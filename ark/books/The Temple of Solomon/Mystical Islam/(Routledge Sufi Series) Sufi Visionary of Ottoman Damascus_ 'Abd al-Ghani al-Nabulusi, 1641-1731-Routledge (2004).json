Many contemporariesand later Sufis gained their knowledge of Sufism from his writings.Many studied the works of the Andalusian mystic Ibn¿ArabÎ, theEgyptian poet Ibn al-FÁriÅ and other masters through his mysticalinterpretations. Yet, despite NÁbulusÎ’s importance for understand-ing Arab Sufism in the Ottoman age, very little has been publishedon this significant Sufi author. This pioneering book seeks to intro-duce the reader to NÁbulusÎ’s Sufi experience and work, set againstthe background of Islamic life and thought in seventeenth- andeighteenth-century Syria and Palestine.The book opens with an exploration of NÁbulusÎ’s early life asscholar and Sufi saint in the making, earning enemies by his supportfor Ibn¿ArabÎand more controversial medieval mystics. His debt toIbn¿ArabÎis examined further in a study of one of NÁbulusÎ’s bookson Sufi doctrine, written at the age of 33 years. In his fortiesNÁbulusÎ underwent a time of intense visions, especially during aseven-year period of retreat. This time also saw the production ofNÁbulusÎ’s popular book of dream interpretation. Following discus-sion of his personal visionary experience and writing on dreams,further chapters deal with the journeys of his later middle age inSyria, Palestine, Egypt and the ÊijÁz. These chapters emphasise themystical content of his travel writings, including his interest in thesignificance of ecstatics’ visions and visits to holy tombs.Elizabeth Sirriyehis Senior Lecturer in Islamic Studies in the Schoolof Theology and Religious Studies, University of Leeds.

His close associates and manylater Sufis regarded him as an extraordinary visionary, one of thegreatest of the gnostic saints, who had been guided through divineunveiling to walk on the ‘path of God’ and be brought near to theDivine Presence. Admiring contemporaries spoke of him as thequÕb, the spiritual ‘pole’ or ‘axis’ of his time at the head of the saintlyhierarchy, upon which the order of the universe depended. His namewas linked with that most famous of Arab Andalusian mystics,MuËyÎ’l-dÎnb.al-¿ArabÎ, widely known simply as Ibn¿ArabÎ(1165–1240), the Great Master (al-shaykhal-akbar). In some circleshe was even thought to be a reincarnation of Ibn¿ArabÎ, as the viewspread that the Great Master had himself predicted that he wouldreappear in Damascus and be named¿Abd al-GhanÎ. AlthoughNÁbulusÎmay have stopped short of such a direct identification, hedid come to look upon Ibn¿ArabÎas his spiritual father and acceptedthat he had inherited from him a very high and distinctive status;according to NÁbulusÎ’s grandson and biographer, he affirmed thatthe Great Master had been the Seal of Muhammadan Sainthood inhis own age, but that there were seals later in time, of which he wasone.1What did NÁbulusÎintend if he did indeed speak of himself asthe Muhammadan Seal?The idea of a seal of the saints is known from an early Sufi treatiseby al-ÊakÎm al-TirmidhÎ(d.c. 910), whose theorising was studiedby Ibn¿ArabÎwhen he came to develop his own view on the subject.2According to TirmidhÎ, Prophet MuËammad was the seal of theprophets because prophethood was perfected in him, not because hewas the last in the line of prophets. Similarly, he described the seal ofthe saints as being so-called ‘because he has perfected his “friend-ship with God”, that is, he has “sealed” it’.3TirmidhÎapparentlyix"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"laid claim to the title long before Ibn¿ArabÎ’s more famous, andseemingly more extensive, claims for himself in the role. For Ibn¿ArabÎ, the Muhammadan Seal is ‘the special Seal of the sainthoodof the community which is visibly that of MuËammad’4and is theultimate source of all sainthood, including that of the prophets intheir capacity as God’s saints. Ibn¿ArabÎ’s bold statements abouthimself as seal are sometimes ambiguous and were to lead to muchcontroversy because the Great Master appeared to critics to beexalting himself to a rank above that of the prophets. The first todenounce Ibn¿ArabÎ, and especially the promotion of the seal ofsainthood, was the Syrian ShÁfi¿Îjurist Ibn¿Abd al-SalÁm al-SulamÎ(d. 1262), who notes that TirmidhÎwas followed by Ibn¿ArabÎ‘andseveral misguided [Sufi] masters in Damascus’, and he declares:Each of them asserted that, in certain respects, he wassuperior to the Prophet. ... All these claims sprang from thedesire for the leadership (riyÁsa), which they thoughtbelongs to the Seal of the Prophets. However, they made agrievous mistake, for the Seal of the Prophets is far superiorto any of them, and there is ample evidence to prove this.5Had Ibn¿Abd al-SalÁm lived in the later seventeenth rather thanthe thirteenth century, he would surely have condemned NÁbulusÎalong with other ‘misguided masters in Damascus’. He would nothave been alone in his opinion. While Shaykh¿Abd al-GhanÎ,oratleast some among his followers, may well have believed that he wasthe highest perfected saint of his time, not everyone in Syria agreedwith this assessment. In a climate of tension between Sufis and theiropponents, NÁbulusÎfelt compelled to defend himself and cham-pion Ibn¿ArabÎand other fellow Sufis, both of the past and of hisown day. Throughout his long life he was to inspire extreme venera-tion and intense hostility. To anti-Sufis he was one of those respon-sible for introducing corruption into the faith. They were to see himas the staunch supporter of much that they attacked as false innova-tions; these ranged from the lofty speculations of Ibn¿ArabÎ’scosmic vision to popular practices at the graves of saints.However, NÁbulusÎwas not only a ‘true saint’ in the eyes ofadmirers or a ‘corrupt heretic’ as far as his detractors were con-cerned. He was a talented poet and man of letters, a scholarlytraditionist and jurist as well as a commentator on Sufi texts andexponent of Sufi doctrine. He also became well known for hismystical travel writings, recording his physical and spiritual journeysxSUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"among the living and dead saints of his native Syria, Egypt and theÊijÁz. He wrote for both a scholarly and Sufi élite, but also for awider general public, among whom his book of symbolic dreaminterpretation would be extensively consulted and retain its popu-larity to the present. By his early fifties, he had already written 140books and short tracts and by the time of his death at the age of 90years, he may have composed as many as 250 works. Nevertheless,despite his scholarly and spiritual distinction, many of these areextant only in manuscript, while others have been lost. The formi-dable task of making NÁbulusÎ’s surviving writings available in crit-ical editions has proceeded slowly over the last 50 years, and it islikely to be many more years before a full corpus of his extant workbecomes available in Arabic. At present, very little has been trans-lated into English and European languages.In view of the inaccessibility of much of his work,¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎhas attracted limited attention in academic studies, inspite of his importance for the understanding of Arab Sufi thoughtand religious life in the Ottoman period. Bearing in mind the lack ofEnglish publications on NÁbulusÎ, this book seeks to introduce thereader to his Sufi life experience and a small selection of his writings.NÁbulusÎ’s life is reviewed against the backcloth of Ottoman Syriaand Palestine in the late seventeenth to early eighteenth centuries,but remembering that for NÁbulusÎthe inner life of the visionary isas real as the events of his outer life and frequently more significant.Chapters discussing the various phases of his life alternate withchapters dedicated to particular aspects of his work, reflecting hisconcerns in that period. Thus a chapter on his early life and Sufidevelopment is followed by a chapter discussing an early work ofSufi doctrine; a chapter on his middle years of intense visionaryexperience is followed by a chapter regarding his interpretation ofdreams; and a chapter on his later middle age, which was marked bya series of travels to visit the righteous living and dead, is followedby a chapter on mystical elements of hisriËlas. A breakdown of thechapters is given below.Chapter 1, ‘The making of a scholarly saint’, considersNÁbulusÎ’s life and work to the age of 33 years. It pays attention tointellectual and spiritual influences on NÁbulusÎfrom his familybackground and teachers and from his studies of the medieval Sufitradition, especially Ibn¿ArabÎ, but also the philosophical mysticIbn Sab¿În (d.c. 1269–71) and Sufi poet ¿AfÎf al-dÎn al-TilimsÁnÎ (d.1291). After a brief examination of his poem in praise of the Prophetand commentary on it, composed in 1664 in a state of mysticalxiPREFACE"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"inspiration at the age of 23 years, it discusses his initiation into theQÁdiriyya.Chapter 2, ‘The spiritual son of Ibn¿ArabÎ’, studies NÁbulusÎ’sbook on Sufi doctrine,al-FatËal-rabbÁnÎwa ’l-fayÅal-raËmÁnÎ,written in 1674 when NÁbulusÎ was 33 years old and reflecting thestrong influence of Ibn ¿ArabÎ. It observes how NÁbulusÎat timesgave his own development to the Great Shaykh’s ideas in ways thatcould antagonise critics of some Sufi thought or of Sufism as awhole.Chapter 3, ‘The NaqshabandÎrecluse’, discusses NÁbulusÎ’s lifeand work from about 1676 to 1687, focusing on his connectionswith the Naqshabandiyya and a seven-year period of retreat, a timeof dreams and ecstatic states and of prolific writing.Chapter 4, ‘Interpreter of true dreams’, explores NÁbulusÎ’s viewson dreaming, and interpretation of his own and others’ dream expe-riences. It looks in some detail at his famous guide to symbolicdreams,Ta¿ÕÎr al-anÁmfÎta¿bÎr al-manÁm, composed during thelong retreat.Chapter 5, ‘Solitude in a crowd’, deals with the period of returnto public life from 1687 to 1700, when NÁbulusÎset out to fulfil theeighth NaqshabandÎprinciple, mindful of his inward spiritual journeywith God, even when outwardly in the world. It discusses his phys-ical journeys to Lebanon, Jerusalem and Palestine, as well as hislong journey of 388 days through his homeland to Egypt and on totheÊijÁz for theËajj. It also surveys writings from that time,including his major work on Sufi doctrine,al-Wuj×d al-Ëaqq,completed in 1693.Chapter 6, ‘ A new kind of mystical travel-literature’, examinesNÁbulusÎ’sriËlasresulting from his extensive travels. It emphasisestheir mystical content by concentrating on NÁbulusÎ’s accounts ofhis encounters with Sufis, especially ecstatics (majÁdhÎb), and hisvisits to Sufi tombs. Attention is also paid to the significance ofdreams in the SufiriËla.Chapter 7, ‘Last years inÐÁliËiyya, 1707–1731’, offers a shortreview of the end of NÁbulusÎ’s life and final contributions to Sufischolarship.Foreign language words, mainly Arabic, are italicised. In the caseof some more common words, the English form of the plural is usedin preference to the Arabic, for exampleÕarÎqasrather thanÕuruq.The system of transliteration is generally standardised except forquotations and some well-known place names.xiiSUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"1THE MAKING OF ASCHOLARLY SAINTThe birth of a saint¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎwas marked out for sainthood evenbefore his birth. His mother, Zaynab, a lady of some social standingas the daughter of a leading merchant, played a crucial role inconnecting her son to the saintly tradition of Damascus. She wasalso to be a key figure in his spiritual upbringing. During the latestages of her pregnancy, her husband, IsmÁ¿Îl al-NÁbulusÎ, wasaway in Egypt studying with some of its most prominent Sufis.These includedÊasan al-ShurunbulÁlÎ(d. 1658), who is noted asholding in high esteem the ecstatic mystics (majÁdhÎb), who wereconstantly overwhelmed by the divine presence in their lives.1IsmÁ¿Îl and his wife appear to have shared this view, as Zaynab wentduring her pregnancy to consult the custodian at the shrine of one ofthe most popularly venerated Damascene saints, Y×suf al-QamÎnÎ(d. 1259).2QamÎnÎis variously described as an ecstatic (majdh×b), seizedwith apparent madness by the force of sudden illumination, andenraptured by God (muwallah), someone who through extreme loveof God experienced a permanent state of unveiling (kashf )so as tohave direct experiential knowledge of God. Through his mysticalinsights he was also said to be aware of the innermost thoughts ofhis fellow human beings.3He was noted as an antinomian Sufi forwhom it was no longer relevant to follow the dictates of theSharÎ¿abecause he had gone beyond all need for it. Therefore, he did notobserve the rules of ritual purity, but wore filthy clothing, rarelywashed and urinated in his long, sweeping robes. QamÎnÎwasknown to frequent the stoke-hole of the baths at the N×r al-dÎnHospital in S×q al-QamËand, otherwise, spent his time among thedung heaps. Nevertheless, it was popularly believed that hisoutwardly polluted state was of no consequence in the true saint,1"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"whose inner state was pure. He was credited with many miracles,especially with the healing of the sick. After his death, crowds ofworking-class Damascenes attended his funeral and erected ‘a deco-rated tomb with a carved headstone, and a group of them remainedby the tomb reciting the Qur’Án, thereby casting him in death in therole of the founders of the great tomb-foundations’.4However,veneration of such a ‘people’s saint’ did not apparently remainconfined to the lower strata of society, since IsmÁ¿Îl and Zaynab al-NÁbulusÎwere from the Arab élite of seventeenth-century Damascus.The shrine was actually maintained by the NÁbulusÎfamily until themid-twentieth century, when an apartment building was constructedover it.5The custodian of the tomb, whom Zaynab visited to enquireabout her unborn child, was also an ecstatic, known simply asShaykh MaËm×d. He had a reputation for holiness and miracles,and he allegedly knew before the birth that Zaynab would bear ason and told her that she should call him¿Abd al-GhanÎ.6Hepredicted a glorious future for the boy and is said to have given her asilver coin and a lump of earth, which she was to feed to the babyafter his birth.7It is not clear whether the gifts show the state ofMaËm×dasamajdh×b,crazed to the eyes of the world, or whetherthey have some other significance.¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎwasborn on 18 March 1641. He recalls that his birth took place on thesecond day after MaËm×d’s death and that the saintly custodian‘had entreated our mother before he died to bring us to his grave andto rub us with the soil of his grave before it was built over’.8Thiscustom of laying the new-born child on the earth is extremelyancient and known in a wide variety of cultures.9It is probable thatthe gift of earth as food is connected in some way with this request.Here the aim is seemingly to effect a two-way transmission of spiri-tual forces. In a sense the newly born and the newly dead share acommon situation: the one is at the beginning of earthly life, theother is on the threshold of the afterlife and being born to the new,real life with God. By placing the infant¿Abd al-GhanÎon the soil ofthe grave and feeding him with earth from the holy man, his motherwould ensure that he derived blessing (baraka )from the deadshaykh; at the same time she would enable her baby son to transmithis ownbarakaas a future saint to assist Shaykh MaËm×d in his lifeafter death. This story, which NÁbulusÎpromotes, serves to confirmthat he was recognised and destined from a foetus to become morethan a competent scholar. It witnesses his own conviction about hissuperior spiritual status.2SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"A family of lawyersThe young¿Abd al-GhanÎmight have had the markings of a saint inthe making, but he was also a member of a scholarly family of somedistinction. He traced his ancestry back through fourteen genera-tions of notable jurists and men of learning to the twelfth century.He was to point out himself that the NÁbulusÎs were descended fromthe Ban×JamÁ¿a, who had provided ShÁfi¿Îchief judges in Maml×kEgypt and Syria.10The family, originally fromÊamÁin central Syria, had settled inJerusalem during the thirteenth century. The Ban×JamÁ¿a then splitinto two main branches. One line remained in Jerusalem andsupplied the preachers at the AqÑÁ Mosque; the other moved toCairo when Badr al-dÎnMuËammad b. JamÁ¿a (d. 1333) wassummoned there in 1291 by the new Maml×k sultan, al-AshrafKhalÎl. He was to be appointed to two of the most senior posts in thereligious hierarchy: chief judge (qÁÅÎal-quÅÁt )and head of the Sufibrotherhoods (shaykh al-shuy×kh). A man like Ibn JamÁ¿a wasobviously far removed from the popular tradition of the outwardlypolluted, ‘enraptured’ men of God. He believed in the intimate asso-ciation between learning and purity, and cautioned against thedangers of any contact with pollutants: ‘The learned man shouldkeep away from the basest professions, because they are despicableaccording to both revelation and custom, such as the art of cupping,dyeing, money changing and gold-smithing.’11The list suggests thedangers of both physical and moral pollution and the link betweenthe two. When at a later stage in his life NÁbulusÎfaced allegationsof not observing strict ritual purity himself, he called attention to hisimpeccable learned and pure ancestry, the great and good of theBan×JamÁ¿a.12However, although NÁbulusÎmight have been proud of hisdescent and used it in his defence, he held very different views fromBadr al-dÎnb.JamÁ¿a on matters of doctrine. Ibn JamÁ¿a was one ofthose jurists who issued a number offatwÁs in condemnation of Ibn¿ArabÎ’s theosophy.13NÁbulusÎ, on the other hand, was to be amajor exponent and supporter of that theosophy.Badr al-dÎn’s own direct descendants from the line of great judgesof Cairo and Damascus appear to have died out by the fifteenthcentury.¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎwas actually himself descendedfrom Badr al-dÎn’s younger brother¿Abd al-RaËmÁn, who remainedin Jerusalem. However, not long after the Ottoman occupation ofSyria in 1516, one of the family members moved from Jerusalem tothe Palestinian town of NÁblus and then up to Damascus, a city that3THE MAKING OF A SCHOLARLY SAINT"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"attracted a number of Palestinians to settle there in the sixteenthcentury. This branch of the Ban×JamÁ¿a was to become known asNÁbulusÎafter the family’s short stay in NÁblus. But it was¿Abd al-GhanÎ’s great-grandfather, IsmÁ¿Îl al-NÁbulusÎ(d. 1585), who wasto establish the NÁbulusÎfamily’s fortunes. True to the traditions ofthe old Ban×JamÁ¿a, he was distinguished as a ShÁfi¿Îjurist, becameShÁfi¿ÎmuftÎof the city and taughtfiqh, both at the UmayyadMosque and at four differentmadrasas. These included theDarwÎshiyya Madrasa, specially endowed by DarwÎsh Pasha, gover-nor of Damascus in the 1570s, for IsmÁ¿Îl and his descendants toteach ShÁfi¿Îfiqh.14He taught an international body of students,Turks and Persians as well as Arabs, all of whose languages hespoke. IsmÁ¿Îl succeeded also in becoming a wealthy man, the lease-holder of various villages and farms, and had connections at thehighest level with the religious dignitaries of Istanbul. NÁbulusÎwasobviously very proud of his great-grandfather, writing in laudatorytones about him when recalling a visit to the mausoleum built forhim by DarwÎsh Pasha in the Damascus cemetery of BÁb al-ÐaghÎr.15By contrast,¿Abd al-GhanÎ’s grandfather, also named¿Abd al-GhanÎ, seems to have been lacking in intellectual abilities and hisgrandson dwells on his noble character rather than his scholarship:He was a man of fine character and gracious qualities,showing fully his magnanimity and noble descent. He had aconsiderable income at that time. If anyone asked him for arobe, he would take off his own robe and give it to him asalms. In the district ofÐÁliËiyya, Damascus, he had endow-ments (awqÁf )left to him by his late mother,ÊanÎfa bint al-ShihÁbÎAËmad, daughter of the judge (qÁÅÎ )MuËibb al-dÎnb. Mun¿a. TheseawqÁfconsisted of shops and rentedproperties. When he went with the brethren to collect therent of the shops and other properties, he would sometimesreturn home the same day empty-handed.16The younger¿Abd al-GhanÎmanages to present his grandfather inthe best possible light, as a model of unstinting charity rather thanan inefficient and extravagant administrator of his inheritance fromhis mother. The generous grandfather is shown as a particular kindof saintly personage, whose charitable works are viewed as ‘socialmiracles’ interrupting the normal course of life. In a study of piousmembers of theÊanbalÎMaqdisÎfamily in twelfth- to fourteenth-century Damascus, Stefan Leder has remarked that they effectively4SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"specialised in either learning or practical piety, often expressed inheroic deeds of charity, although dedication to one did not entirelyexclude the other.17The situation in the NÁbulusÎfamily seems asimilar one:¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎand his great-grandfatherand father represent the pious scholars, while his grandfatherrepresents the practical man of piety.NÁbulusÎpresents his father, IsmÁ¿Îl, as a scholarly jurist withinthe family tradition; but he also shows him as breaking with thattradition by leaving the ShÁfi¿Îschool (madhhab )to become aÊanafÎ. The change ofmadhhabwas not perhaps surprising, sinceÊanafÎs occupied the top religio-legal posts in the Ottoman stateand this led to a growing interest in the study and teaching ofÊanafÎfiqh. Yet NÁbulusÎis naturally anxious not to suggest any oppor-tunism in his father’s move and instead claims that he was intellectu-ally convinced to make the change after serious study withÊanafÎjurists.18IsmÁ¿Îl wrote on legal topics, taught at the UmayyadMosque and atmadrasas in Damascus, and served for some time asa judge in Sidon. He also, as noted, appears to have had someinterest in Sufism. He oversaw his son’s early education, but sadlyIsmÁ¿Îl al-NÁbulusÎdied at the age of 45 years when his young son¿Abd al-GhanÎwas only 12 years old.A scholar in trainingThroughout his life NÁbulusÎwould experience tensions betweenhis role as a religious scholar and his life as an illuminated mysticand people’s saint. From his earliest years his father set him to worklearning and reciting the Qur’Án and, when he had mastered thewhole of it by heart and so become aËÁfiÙat the age of five years, hecould be noted either as endowed with the brilliant mind of a futurescholar or as given the blessing of the sacred text as a future saint or,indeed, as combining brilliance and blessing.His father’s death might, in other circumstances, have severelydisrupted his course of learning and damaged a promising career,but in this case it did not. There was sufficient wealth from bothsides of the family to support him in his studies and his mother, as heinforms us, was ‘devoted and sympathetic’ towards him.19Heappears to have been deeply attached to his mother and appreciatedthe loving support that she provided. His fatherless state might evenbe seen to have marked him out as special, given that the ProphetMuËammad had been an orphan. In middle age, when NÁbulusÎcame to write a book of dream interpretation, he noted that, if a5THE MAKING OF A SCHOLARLY SAINT"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"small boy sees the Prophet Jesus in a dream, ‘he will live as anorphan and be brought up in his mother’s home and will become arighteous and learned man’.20The destiny of the child dreamerappears to mirror his own exactly. Tantalisingly, we are not toldwhether he ever had such a dream himself, but the association withprophetic models is certainly an interesting one in developing hisself-perception.Between the ages of 12 and 20 years, NÁbulusÎcontinued with hisstudies, fatherless, but not totally without a fatherly figure in hislife. He was fortunate in receiving the kind attention of a seniorÊanbalÎscholar,¿Abd al-BÁqÎal-ÊanbalÎ(d. 1660), who is said tohave acted like a foster-father to him.21TheÊanbalÎs of Damascuswere esteemed for their attention to scholarship onÊadÎthand¿Abdal-BÁqÎwas instrumental in supervising the young¿Abd al-GhanÎ’sstudies in the field, in which he was joined in classes by a number ofÊanbalÎstudents.

SomeÊanbalÎs are also knowninitiates ofÕarÎqas in Damascus. In this period relations betweenÊanbalÎs and members of othermadhhabs, mostlyÊanafÎs andShÁfi¿Îs, also seem to have been cordial and not damaged by the kindof juristic disputes recorded in medieval Syria.24TheÊanafÎNÁbulusÎ’s study ofÊadithwith aÊanbalÎmaster was not excep-tional, as other prominentÊanafÎs did the same.His study offiqh, however, had naturally to be conducted underÊanafÎinstruction, his first significant master being Shaykh AËmadal-Qala¿Îal-ÊanafÎ(d. 1658). It would be an important area forhim, in keeping with the family tradition.

Yet, even though his official practice of the law would belimited, he was to be thoroughly prepared as a youth and youngman for future distinction as the author of numerous legal treatises.These included theoretical discussions of legal principles as well ascontributions to debates on issues of the day, such as the permissibilityof smoking. Tobacco had been introduced into the Middle Eastearly in the seventeenth century, and its use became a subject ofcontroversy among the‘ulamÁ’. Campaigners against it succeededin persuading the Ottoman authorities to ban it. The 1630s borewitness to numerous executions for the offence of smoking tobacco.Sufis were by no means the only offenders, but they were generallyperceived as over-tolerant towards tobacco, as well as towardswine, cannabis and opium. After a period of less severe repression inthe time of NÁbulusÎ’s youth, the prohibitionists gained strengthonce again from the 1660s. NÁbulusÎdoes not seem to have riskedsmoking himself as a young man, although he did so in later life. Hewas to write boldly in defence of the habit as legally permissible andalso to compose poetry in favour of smoking.25The names of eighteen of his teachers were recorded by hisgrandson, KamÁl al-dÎn al-GhazzÎ(d. 1699), including his child-hood master Najm al-dÎn al-GhazzÎ(d. 1651), author of a majorbiographical dictionary of notables of the tenth Islamic century (latefifteenth to late sixteenth centuriesCE).26KamÁl al-dÎn remarks withadmiration that his grandfather ‘surpassed all his peers in speechand comprehension before he reached the age of twenty’.27Encounters with Sufi booksAlthough NÁbulusÎgained his scholarly knowledge and skills fromhis teachers, he was not convinced that living human masters werenecessarily the most important and true guides to real knowledge.Books, he believed, taught him more and it was his encounters withthe writings of the medieval Sufi tradition that began to open theway for him to mystical illumination. Essentially, his most esteemedteachers were the dead Sufi masters from the world of spirits, andone means by which he sought to receive their guidance and thepower of theirbarakawas through reading their books.Biographers mention the names of three principal authors inwhose writings NÁbulusÎbecame particularly absorbed: Ibn¿ArabÎ(d. 1240), Ibn Sab¿În (d.c. 1269–71 )and¿AfÎf al-dÎn al-TilimsÁnÎ(d.1291).28Of the three, the Great Master Ibn¿ArabÎis the least7THE MAKING OF A SCHOLARLY SAINT"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"surprising and, as noted in the Preface,¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎconsidered himself to have a special relationship to him.29In thesixteenth century Ibn¿ArabÎhad effectively been adopted by theOttomans as an establishment saint and it had become relativelyrespectable to study his work. Following his conquest of Syria,Sultan SelÎm I ordered the construction in 1517–18 of the celebratedmausoleum over the tomb of Ibn¿ArabÎ; the Great Shaykh becamevalued as the protecting saint of the Ottoman dynasty.30SelÎm’s son,SüleymÁn the Lawgiver (known to Europeans as ‘the Magnificent’),prevented any efforts to disparage Ibn¿ArabÎas a heretic or unbe-liever. However, throughout much of the next century, the GreatMaster and his followers received no official state protection andwere exposed once again to the verbal, and sometimes physical,assaults of their opponents. Most prominent among the adversariesof Ibn¿ArabÎand his school were the radical preachers, jurists andstudents of theÜÁÅÎzÁdelÎmovement.31TheÜÁÅÎzÁdelÎs developedtheir virulently anti-Sufi campaigns in Istanbul and Anatolia underthe leadership ofÜÁÅÎzÁde MeËmed (d. 1635). Between about 1621and 1685, they enjoyed a period of fluctuating popularity in theirefforts to counter what they perceived as unacceptable and hereticalSufi excesses, and at times were highly effective in influencingOttoman sultans to act against Sufis and more widely on a range ofmoral issues. They were vocal spokesmen in the above-mentioneddrive to eliminate tobacco, alcohol and drug use. Temporarilyweakened during the Grand Vizierate of MeËmed Köprülü from1656 to 1661, they were experiencing a revival and were active inDamascus just as NÁbulusÎwas embarking on a teaching career atthe Umayyad Mosque.As a young man in his twenties, he started giving classes there onÊadÎthand also began teaching texts of Ibn¿ArabÎin public andprivate study groups, defying theÜÁÅÎzÁdelÎlawyers and studentswho denounced the Great Shaykh in Turkish asÛeyh-i Ekfer, ‘theWorst Shaykh’.32The young scholar began to be specially noted forhis interpretation of Ibn¿ArabÎ’s most famous book,FuÑ×Ñal-Ëikam(The Bezels of Wisdom),faÑÑ(pl.fuÑ×Ñ )being the ‘bezel’ or ‘setting’on a ring holding a precious stone. The bezels, in this case, are theline of twenty-seven prophets from Adam to MuËammad; each ofthem holds a gem, a particular aspect of the Divine Wisdom. In thetwenty-seven chapters of his book, each dedicated to a particularprophet, Ibn¿ArabÎpresents a synthesis of the main themes to befound in his lifetime’s work, including the ‘oneness of being’(waËdat al-wuj×d), the ‘perfect human being’ (al-insÁn al-kÁmil),8SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"God’s infinite mercy, the non-eternity of punishment in Hell and thefinal salvation of even the Pharaoh. As Claude Addas remarks, thesethemes are all to be found also in Ibn¿ArabÎ’s massivemagnumopus,al-Fut×ËÁtal-makkiyya(MeccanRevelations): ‘But in the onecase they are given expression and in a sense diluted over thousandsof pages, where they intermingle with a whole crowd of othernotions; in the other they are concentrated and expounded moresystematically in a mere hundred pages or so.’33Probably this verycompression of the Great Master’s ideas also served to make themmore startling and led to theFuÑ×Ñbecoming the main target forattacks on his thought.Ibn¿ArabÎbelieved that he was not really ‘the author of theBezels’,ÑÁËib al-FuÑ×Ñ, as he was often titled, but simply the onewho inherited the work direct from the Prophet himself in a visionwhich he experienced in December 1229 at Damascus. He, there-fore, asked God’s favour that:in all my hand may write, in all my tongue may utter, and inall that my heart may conceal, He might favor me with Hisdeposition and spiritual inspiration for my mind and Hisprotective support, that I may be a transmitter and not acomposer, so that those of the Folk who read it may be surethat it comes from the Station of Sanctification and that it isutterly free from all the purposes of the lower soul, whichare ever prone to deceive.34Ibn¿ArabÎis said to have forbidden his disciples to bind copies oftheFuÑ×Ñtogether with any other books authored by him. Sufiswidely held that it should be read with a commentary and with aqualified spiritual interpreter. In seeking to acquaint students withtheFuÑ×Ñ, particularly when he was so young himself, NÁbulusÎwasundertaking an awesome task in any circumstances and one thatdemanded courage in the face of those ready to charge him withheresy.Perhaps it was as well for him that he did not also attempt toteach the thought of the Andalusian philosophical Sufi Ibn Sab¿Înand his son-in-law and disciple,¿AfÎf al-dÎn al-TilimsÁnÎ, the twoother figures who are more unexpectedly recorded as influencingthe young¿Abd al-GhanÎ. While it was problematic enough to teachthe work of the Great Master, the ideas of Ibn Sab¿În and TilimsÁnÎwere, if anything, even more contentious. Ibn Sab¿În was generallyrejected within the Islamic community for teaching that God is the9THE MAKING OF A SCHOLARLY SAINT"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"substance of phenomena, that ‘in reality the whole exists in indi-vidual things and individual things in the whole and so the wholejoins with the individual things’.35He was attacked asittiËÁdÎ,apreacher of unitive fusion with God. Although the term ‘oneness ofbeing’ (waËdat al-wuj×d )may have been coined by anotherAndalusian author,¿Abd al-Mun¿im al-GhilyÁnÎ(d. 1205), IbnSab¿În appears to have played a significant role in promoting its use,leading to a long cycle of arguments and misunderstandings.36Alex-ander Knysh has demonstrated that the polemical writing of QuÕbal-dÎn al-QasÕallÁnÎ(d. 1287 )attacking monistic Sufi thought wasactually directed primarily at Ibn Sab¿În (his rival in Mecca for polit-ical influence with the governor); yet QasÕallÁnÎdragged Ibn¿ArabÎinto the debate, forcing him ‘to play the role of a founding father(along with a few others )of the monistic “heresy”’.37Ibn¿ArabÎwasthus effectively tarnished by association with the more radicallymonist Ibn Sab¿În.In subsequent medieval vilification of heretical monists, Ibn¿ArabÎwould sometimes be distinguished as closer to ‘orthodoxy’than the ‘damnable’ Ibn Sab¿În. Even that most strenuous of criticsof philosophical Sufism, Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328), is ready toconcede of Ibn¿ArabÎthat ‘of all the exponents ofwaËdat al-wuj×dhe is close to Islam, that many of his ideas are correct, that he distin-guishes between the Manifest (al-ÙÁhir )and the objects of manifes-tation (maÙÁhÎr )and accepts the commands and prohibitions (of theshar¿ )and other principles as they are’.38The distinguished historianand jurist Ibn Khald×n (d. 1406 )was also ready in hisMuqaddimato recognise differences between the followers of Ibn¿ArabÎ, whomhe classed as ‘People of Theophany’ (aÑËÁb al-tajallÎ )(because oftheir understanding of God’s self-manifestations in all things )andIbn Sab¿În and his school, the Sab¿Îniyya, whom he described as‘People of Absolute Unity’ (aÑËÁb al-waËda al-muÕlaqa), the realmonists.39However, after his move from the Maghrib to Egypt andholding the MÁlikÎchief judgeship there, he showed himself nolonger prepared to differentiate between the two Sufi masters andtheir followers. In a latefatwÁhe denounces Ibn¿ArabÎand IbnSab¿În together, declaring that their ‘works reek of downright unbe-lief and reprehensible innovation’ and he doubts ‘whether thesepeople can at all be treated as members of this [Muslim] communityand counted among [the followers of] the SharÎ¿a’.40In Ibn Khald×n’sopinion, their books ‘must be destroyed by fire or washed off bywater, until the traces of writing disappear completely’.41Not only was Ibn Sab¿În generally held to represent the most10SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"radical of monist Sufis, but attempts at character assassinationportrayed him as a bitter, twisted, arrogant philosopher, a plagiaristand a gigolo. The myth told of his being hounded out of every citywhere he set foot in Spain, North Africa and Egypt on account of hisscandalously unorthodox doctrines and behaviour, until he soughtsanctuary in theËaramof Mecca. Even there it was said that hefound no peace, but committed suicide by slashing his wrists, thusopenly violating the prohibition on killing within the sacred precinctas well as the prohibition on taking one’s own life. However, IbnSab¿În’s suicide in Mecca is as unsubstantiated as are a number ofother slurs on his character. An alternative account tells of his lastdays in Mecca as adviser to SharÎfAb×NumÁyy b. AbÎSa¿Îd (r.1254–1301 )and his possible conversion to Shi‘ism. In this versionof events his medical knowledge saved the SharÎf’s life, but the Sunniruler of Yemen al-Malik al-MuÙaffar (r. 1250–95 )arranged for IbnSab¿În to be poisoned.42Readers of a poem by his major disciple,¿AlÎal-ShushtarÎ(d.1269), might have been further alarmed by the records of IbnSab¿În’s spiritual ancestry, including the ecstatic martyrÊallÁj (d.922 )and others of the more audacious mystics, Muslim philoso-phers such as Ibn SÎna (d. 1037 )and Ibn Rushd (d. 1198 ), even theGreek philosophers Socrates, Plato and Aristotle and, at the source,Hermes Trismegistus, the Greek title given to the Egyptian godThoth.43Hermes Trismegistus, ‘Thrice Greatest Hermes’, wasmythically considered to have imparted to human beings knowledgeof healing, science, philosophy and magical arts. His name was alsoattached to various Neoplatonic writings, theCorpus Hermeticum,much of which seems to have been known in Arabic translation inmedieval Spain. Had inquirers turned to Ibn Sab¿În’s own best-known workBuddal-¿Árif(TheEscape[orthePrerequisite]oftheGnostic), they would have found him testifying to this debt to thetraditions of late antiquity, stating in his Introduction: ‘I petitionedGod (astakhartu li’llÁh )to propagate [through me] the wisdom(Ëikma )which Hermes Trismegistus (al-harÁmisa )revealed in theearliest times.’44For Ibn Sab¿În, the figure of Hermes Trismegistus,whom he also terms ‘our greatest impeccable teacher’ and ‘thegreatest sage’, appears to take precedence over ProphetMuËammad.An interest in Hermetic wisdom teachings is attested to in certainJewish, Christian and Muslim circles in the medieval Spanish envi-ronment in which Ibn Sab¿În grew up.45Hence in their originalcontext his incorporation of Hermetism in his philosophical system11THE MAKING OF A SCHOLARLY SAINT"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"would have been shocking to more orthodox believers, but not sointellectually alien as to be extraordinary. However, so negative wasthe perception built up about Ibn Sab¿În that most Muslim scholarshad been successfully scared off from reading his works after thethirteenth century. The question then remains: why did¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎturn to the writings of a ‘Muslim’ Hermetist withphilosophical and Sufi leanings, whose works had been denigratedand neglected for almost 400 years? The matter is something of amystery because it was extremely unusual for a Sufi scholar of hisage, and he has been noted as a remarkable exception for not onlystudying Ibn Sab¿În’s books but also for hoping to acquirebarakathrough them.46The extent of his reading of these books is not clear,or whether he discovered the author himself or was introduced tohim by a teacher or teachers, in which case it would suggest thatthere might have been some continuing private study of such writ-ings in seventeenth-century Damascus. Perhaps NÁbulusÎwassimply bolder than others in admitting his interest. However,from themanner of his occasional citation and quotation of IbnSab¿În later in life, it is probable that he either did not appreciate thedifferences between him and Ibn¿ArabÎor did not wish to exposethem in public.47Generally, NÁbulusÎwould struggle hard in defence of the GreatMaster and of all those who might be described as upholdingwaËdat al-wuj×d, even when their interpretations differed substan-tially. Thus he would also make a personal effort to restore thebattered reputation of the Sab¿Îniyya, writing against critics ofShushtarÎ, the most prominent of the Sab¿ÎnÎdisciples,Radd al-muftarÎ‘an al-Õa¿n fi ’l-ShushtarÎ(Refutation of the Slanderer,concerningthedefamingofShushtarÎ).48Finally, he showed his deepadmiration throughout his life for the third of the dead mystics,¿AfÎf al-dÎn al-TilimsÁnÎ, from whose writings he claimed to receiveguidance andbaraka, and whose poetry he quotes with respect.TilimsÁnÎprovides a link between the Sab¿Îniyya and the school ofIbn¿ArabÎ, having connections to both. He was also noted for hiscommentary on theFuÑ×Ñ. He was loathed in his turn by many ofthe jurists. Ibn Taymiyya calls him ‘wicked’49and another detractorscathingly refers to him as ‘pigs’ meat on a China plate’,50the Chinaplate being his beautiful poetry. Ibn Khald×n included him amongthe authors whose books should be burned or washed clean. But for¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎhe would remain ‘the one acquaintedwith knowledge of the Divine’ and ‘interpreter of the presence ofGod’s truths’.5112SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Praising the ProphetThe year 1664 was important for NÁbulusÎ, a time of new spiritualinsight, but also a time of disappointment in worldly affairs. He hadpractised poetry from an early age, but now his talent was floweringand he was convinced that this was not purely the result of naturalability and training. When he wrote a poem in praise of ProphetMuËammad, he declared that he had composed it in a state ofmystical inspiration. Sceptics, however, simply thought that it wastoo good to be his own work, rejected his claims and accused him ofnot being the true author. In order to put him to the test, theydemanded that he produce a commentary on it in the space of amonth; he did this within three weeks, thus confounding hiscritics.52It is not entirely surprising that critics should have queriedthe authorship of this poem,NasamÁt al-asËÁrfÎmadËal-nabÎal-mukhtÁr(Evening Breezes in Praise of the Chosen Prophet),because it is a piece of extraordinary accomplishment and thecommentary,NafaËÁt al-azhÁr(Flower Fragrances )must haveamazed them even more.53The poem is abadÎ¿iyya, praising ProphetMuËammad by utilising a great range of ‘verbal tricks’ that showthe poet’s mastery of a branch of Arabic rhetoric described asbadÎ¿.This type of ‘trick’ has been defined as ‘the kind of trope known inEnglish as a “scheme”, embodying not imagery so much as someartifice that exploits the phonetic or graphic features of words’.54NÁbulusÎ’s poem follows the pattern set by an Iraqi poet,ÐafÎyy al-dÎn al-ÊillÎ(d.c. 1349), but represents an extreme point in the elab-orate use of tropes to adorn this form of eulogy. The commentary isarguably even more technically impressive in demonstratingNÁbulusÎ’s extensive knowledge of 180 tropes, including as many as50 types of paronomasia (where words are used that differ inmeaning but with phonetic or graphic similarities); all are illustratedwith quotations from a variety of earlier poets.In his investigation of latebadÎ¿literature, Pierre Cachia hasobservedthat the literature heavily laden with verbal ornamentationand apparently holding such ornamentation to be thedistinguishing mark of artistic expression was in honoramong Arabic-speaking peoples not during a short passingphase but for at least six centuries, from the thirteenth tothe eighteenth, and it seemed to satisfy generation aftergeneration of men who were neither fools nor uncultured.5513THE MAKING OF A SCHOLARLY SAINT"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"In seeking the reasons for such appreciation of ‘sound effects’ in thewordsmith’s craft, he focuses on the élitist nature of this kind ofpoetic production, catering for poets and their readers who sharecommon cultural values with which they have been satisfied overhundreds of years. The composition, reading and recitation of thebadÎ¿iyyatake place as ‘a game’ within a framework of rules that allparticipants understand. They do not expect the poet to break thoserules and bring them something unfamiliar, which invites them toreflect on and possibly question their established perception of a topic.NÁbulusÎ’sNasamÁtandNafaËÁtdo both assume the culturalhomogeneity of a Muslim-educated élite, acquainted with the Arabicliterary heritage, but also with minds trained to a high degree ofdexterity in wordplay and able to make mental associationsbetween words and phrases in a way that may not be at all obviousto an outsider who does not know how to play the game. Twoexamples of NÁbulusÎ’s tropes may serve to illustrate this point. Thefirst is his use of a chronogram to provide the date of the poem. Heexplains that this trope consists of a word or words whose lettershave numerical values attached to them, which add up to the yearthe poet wants to specify. But he has to indicate first to the readerthat he is about to mention a date. Thus NÁbulusÎtells his readersthe date of composition of theNasamÁt:Glory said, setting a date:‘In MuËammad I take pride.’56The consonants of this final statement,BiMuËammadinatasharrafu,have a total numerical value of 1076, this being thehijrÎyear (1664–5).57A second example of an ingenious trope used and discussed byNÁbulusÎis of a cryptogram, where a word or words are hidden inthe text and the reader is provided with clues to solve the puzzle, asin the following lines of verse with explanatory solution, translatedhere by Pierre Cachia:It has a shell whose core has been removedAnd been replaced by an abidingconscience.The middle letters of the wordqishra, ‘shell’, are removed,leaving Q–A. The word for ‘conscience’,ÅamÎr, may alsomean ‘pronoun’, and one such ishuwa, ‘he’, spelt HW.Replacing the core of the word for shell, they produceQaHWA, ‘coffee’.5814SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"However, there are probably also religious connotations, if otherlevels of meaning are explored. The wordÅamÎrrendered as ‘con-science’ in this translation may also have the significance of the‘heart’, the ‘core of one’s being’, andhuwais ‘he’, but it is also ‘He’,God and the ultimate core of all being. Coffee was also a sensitivesubject at this time, since theÜÁÅÎzÁdelÎs had succeeded in forcingthe closure of coffee houses in Istanbul by 1662.59Therefore,NÁbulusÎ’s cryptogram could also be read as an implicit defence ofcoffee drinking. Perhaps, if the reader looks beyond the outer shellof the coffee-drinker’s activity, he will see its inner value as an aid toconcentration, leading to constant awareness of divine realities.Withinqahwa, ‘coffee’, lieshuwa, ‘He’ for those whose hearts areready to receive Him.On one level, NÁbulusÎ’s poem and commentary are intended foran audience appreciative of technical virtuosity with words, andready to interact with the poet to solve the riddles he has set them.There is a mental challenge of a type that might draw a sympatheticresponse from readers familiar with the twists and turns of aTimescrossword puzzle. And yet there is something else. The doubting,exotericistÜÁÅÎzÁdelÎs might do all the mental exercises and still notsee it. TheNasamÁtandNafaËÁtare more than just a testimony toNÁbulusÎ’s literary and intellectual powers and an invitation to playword games. For¿Abd al-GhanÎand his followers they vindicate thegenuine nature of his mystical knowledge and seem to support thevalidity of thebarakatransmitted to him by Ibn¿ArabÎ, Ibn Sab¿Înand TilimsÁnÎ,and its aid to him on his path to a higher spirituallevel. Effectively, what occurred was to be understood by sympathisersas a kind of saintly miracle (karÁma), appropriate in one who wasboth scholar and mystic, and which affirmed not only his own posi-tion, but also that of the representatives of the Sufi tradition inwhose footsteps he followed.The journey to Istanbul and QÁdirÎinitiationShortly after the controversy aroused by his poem on the Prophet,written in 1664, NÁbulusÎset out for Istanbul, although he was notto stay long in the Ottoman capital.60The reasons for undertakingthe journey are not clarified and he left no separate account of it, ashe did of other later travels. It would be a natural choice of destina-tion for a young scholar interested in making the right connectionsfor worldly advancement. But the young NÁbulusÎdoes not seemespecially concerned with these matters and, if he was temporarily15THE MAKING OF A SCHOLARLY SAINT"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"distracted by worldly ambition, he would soon abandon these aspi-rations. In any case, he would have been confronted there by astronger presence of his enemies, theÜÁÅÎzÁdelÎs, than he had expe-rienced in Damascus. Perhaps his rejection of any such quest forofficial posts is reflected in a story told of his meeting in Istanbulwith an ecstatic (majdh×b), who told him: ‘There is nothing for youhere. Go back towards theqiblah.’61The sense behind this statementis that¿Abd al-GhanÎas a spiritual person should not be directing hisface, as if in prayer, towards Istanbul, the centre of state powerworshipped by those in search of earthly rewards. Instead, he shouldreturn to Damascus, thus facing in the direction of Mecca andworshipping God alone. He took the advice of themajdh×b.Even on his way to Istanbul,¿Abd al-GhanÎ’s greater concernwith his spiritual, rather than temporal, progress is accented.Passing through the town ofÊamÁin central Syria, he was toundergo his first initiation into a Sufi brotherhood, that of theQÁdiriyya. On a later visit toÊamÁin 1693, he recalled this signifi-cant occasion of almost 30 years earlier and his initiating shaykh,¿Abd al-RazzÁq al-KaylÁnÎ, a descendant of the saintly allegedfounder¿Abd al-QÁdir al-JÎlÁnÎ(d. 1166).62The older NÁbulusÎwrites of himself as a young man:After we had taken the oath of allegiance, clasped handsand received the certificate of investiture in the QÁdirÎÕarÎqaand while we were in that assembly, our shaykh, thelate Shaykh¿Abd al-RazzÁq, in an ecstatic state took fromhis head his great green turban and ordered his chiefdisciple to unstitch his QÁdirÎtÁjand sew it in our turban.He did so and those present wondered at him and knewthat it was out of inspiration from God and a clear andglorious sign.63What NÁbulusÎdescribes is an usual initiation ceremony with thetaking of an oath of obedience to the shaykh accompanied by ahandclasp and the awarding of a certificate admitting him to thebrotherhood. Transmitting the Sufi’s patched frock from master todisciple was often replaced with the transmission of anothergarment, in this case the distinctive piece of headgear, thetÁj.Shaykh¿Abd al-RazzÁq was here effectively transferring the statethat he was in to the young¿Abd al-GhanÎwith the aim of guidinghim towards perfection. However, in NÁbulusÎ’s account there isalso a strong sense of his belief that the shaykh recognised that he16SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"was destined to achieve a high spiritual ranking. He is no ordinarydisciple but a saint in the making, as he had been even before hisbirth.In later writings NÁbulusÎwould mention the QÁdiriyya as hismashrab, literally ‘drinking place’, in acknowledgement of its beinghis firstÕarÎqa. However, he does not seem to have undergone anylengthy training period, since his stay inÊamÁappears to have beenquite brief. Barbara von Schlegell has remarked that he saw himselfas ‘beyond the need for a classical master–disciple relationship’.64He appears to have felt little need for the spiritual guidance of aliving shaykh such as¿Abd al-RazzÁq, given his higher regard fordead masters and their books and his own direct ‘tasting’ of divineillumination. Some years after his initiation, Shaykh¿Abd al-RazzÁqpassed through Damascus to join the pilgrims’ caravan for Mecca.NÁbulusÎrecords somewhat perfunctorily the shaykh’s first wordson meeting him: ‘Love is nothing but God.’65This suggests atenuous relationship at most between the two men. AlthoughNÁbulusÎwas to style himself ‘the QÁdirÎ’, it is likely that the titleserved to boost his credentials in society rather than indicate a deepindebtedness to guidance in the QÁdiriyya.On returning to Damascus, NÁbulusÎwas to work in the courtsfor a short time, but then abandoned religious legal practice torenew his teaching career.66The next 10 years were to be a relativelyquiet period in his life, but one in which he was to acquire a growingreputation for both scholarship and saintliness. It was towards theend of this time that he married his first wife, MuÑliËa, the daughterof a man mentioned as Ab×RabÎ¿al-QÁdirÎal-Ð×fÎ, presumably abrother in hisÕarÎqa. In 1674 MuÑliËa gave birth to his son IsmÁ¿Îl,named after his own father and great-grandfather. At 33 years ofage¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎhad apparently achieved a harmo-nious balance between a career in the world, family life and walkingon the path of God.17THE MAKING OF A SCHOLARLY SAINT"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"2THE SPIRITUAL SON OFIBN¿ARABÍIn the steps of the Great MasterAll is encompassed in the Book of GodAnd AËmad’sSunnais a commentaryAnd commentary on both theFut×ËÁt,Brought by illumination from besideThe sanctuary to our Arab shaykh,Who poured on us right guidance and favour.1So writes¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎin a poem of ecstatic praise forthe Great Master Ibn¿ArabÎ.

May God raise me withhim on the Day of Resurrection!3Startling as the imagery may seem, it appears natural in its context,since the creation of kinship ties through suckling has traditionallyplayed an important role in Arab society and been embedded inSharÎ¿a. The milk is apparently symbolic of the Great Master’s mysti-cally acquired knowledge being imparted to his spiritual son. It is alsoreminiscent of the occasion on the Prophet’s night-journey to Jeru-salem, when he chose to drink the milk of divine wisdom and guidance.In common with many other followers of Ibn¿ArabÎ,NÁbulusÎisalso anxious to quell any potential criticism by the statement that hesupports only those views of the shaykh that are consistent with theQur’Án,Sunnaand early consensus. Not everyone would be satis-fied that this was indeed the case and that he did not follow hismaster and spiritual father in overstepping the mark and strayingtoo far from core Islamic doctrines. At the time of the dream hecould look back on a life of affirming Ibn¿ArabÎ’s ‘speech to others’,but also strenuously defending it and his own ideas against chargesof unbelief (kufr). His earliest known work of this type is hisal-Radd al-matÎn¿alÁmuntaqiÑal-¿Árif MuËyÎ’l-dÎn(The FirmRebuttal of the one who disparages the Gnostic MuËyÎ’l-dÎn),produced in 1672, when he was 31 years old.4In spite of¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎ’s claims to such closeaffinity with Ibn¿ArabÎand devotion to promoting his work, regardfor his contribution as an interpreter has fluctuated. Bakri Aladdinis one who has helped to reinstate NÁbulusÎ’s position in this areaand to show that he did actually have some depth of understandingof the Great Master’s doctrines.5An alternative assessment byWilliam Chittick revealed some doubts. He notes:Perhaps the most widely read commentary on theFuÑ×Ñinthe Arab world was written by the prolific Sufi author¿AbdTHE SPIRITUAL SON OF IBN¿ARABÍ19"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎ(d. 1143/1730); his care to define andexplain practically every single word and his often ques-tionable interpretations suggest that already by his time thegeneral ability to read and understand theFuÑ×Ñin the Arabworld had severely declined.6There is something to be said for both judgements. In places NÁbulusÎdemonstrates his comprehension of Ibn¿ArabÎ, but elsewhere hemakes some ‘questionable interpretations’. But is he simply inca-pable when he takes the second course or does he have somepurpose in disclosing meanings that may not have been intended bytheShaykh al-Akbar?Whatever may be the truth, NÁbulusÎis probably more inter-esting when he does diverge from the master and, in doing so, he iscertainly not alone among late Sufi writers. One major effect of thedivergence is to attach ideas to a famous and authoritative name,that of Ibn¿ArabÎ, and so to gain credence for views that mightotherwise have been rejected. Although NÁbulusÎand other influen-tial Sufis of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries may at timesgenuinely fail to understand Ibn¿ArabÎ(and other prominentmedieval figures), the overall process goes beyond simple misrepre-sentation. Negatively, it can, of course, be problematic in creatingconfusion about medieval Sufi thought, and especially that of Ibn¿ArabÎ. Positively, it can be seen as a creative way of developingfresh opinion on a subject in a society which holds tradition in highesteem, and is suspicious of individuals’ attempts to present anyradically new views. Thus it could enable someone such as¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎto introduce his own thought and make it morewidely acceptable by portraying it as in agreement with that ofmajor Sufis of the past, above all his Great Master, and not merelyas an expression of his own, more readily disputed, opinion.In an attempt to understand something of this process, one ofNÁbulusÎ’s early works has been chosen for further examination.This isal-FatËal-rabbÁnÎwa ’l-fayÅal-raËmÁnÎ(Lordly Revelationand Merciful Emanation), written as a guidebook for the spiritualdevelopment of Sufis. He completed it in late 1674, which wouldplace its composition about 10 years after his journey to Istanbuland joining the QÁdiriyya and in the same year as the birth of his sonIsmÁ¿Îl. TheFatËappears to be designed as a teaching book directedat disciples, but he himself regarded it as significant, referring to it inother works. It seems to encapsulate the state of his thinking in hisearly thirties on matters at the heart of becoming a Sufi or the very20SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"core oftaÑawwuf. It is by no means his most advanced and sophisti-cated work of Sufi thought by comparison with the mature produc-tion of his fifties. However, it is of interest in showing his alreadydeep debt to Ibn¿ArabÎat this period in his life and also his exten-sion of the Shaykh’s ideas in new and influential directions.‘Lordly Revelation’NÁbulusÎ’s debt to his spiritual father is evident immediately in thecustomary encomium of praise for God and His Prophet, which is ineffect a succinct account of the creation process in a post-Ibn¿ArabÎan version, replete with its technical terminology. Theopening lines give something of its flavour, echoing the languageand ideas of theFuÑ×Ñin its opening chapter:Praise be to God who made manifest the world from thetreasure of existence (al-wuj×d )and brought it forth fromtotal non-existence (al-¿adam )and by it described Himselfto Himself in the place of possibility (i.e. this world )so thatinfinite pre-existence (al-qidam )might be distinguished byvirtue of its essence.7NÁbulusÎcontinues with the familiar imagery of the created worldas a mirror reflecting aspects of the Divine.Following the elaborate encomium, he introduces himself to hisreaders as aÊanafÎQÁdirÎof Damascus, and, after some verses onhis own ecstatic experience, he proceeds to spell out his intention inwriting the book. NÁbulusÎis addressing theFatËto the spirituallyminded so as to guide their hearts and he will speak of what has beenrevealed to him through divine illumination. However, he assureshis readers that, in doing so, he will not violate theSharÎ¿aor stateanything that is not in conformity with it. Expressing his awarenessthat his expressions may sometimes be open to misinterpretation, headmits that this is because he is dealing with matters which cannotalways be meaningfully expressed in words, but can only be under-stood by the heart. He has divided his book into seven chapters, ‘inthe hope that the eighth may be the chapter of “opening” (fatË )tothe paradise of guidance and closeness (to God)’.8Although theseven chapters do not correspond in any obvious way to sevenstages of the ‘path’, their aim is to offer the Sufi aspirant the kind ofprogressive knowledge of mystical interpretation of the faith thatwill enable the achievement of the highest stations (maqÁmÁt)21THE SPIRITUAL SON OF IBN¿ARABÍ"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"through the seeker’s personal effort and prepare for the reception ofspiritual states (aËwÁl) through God’s grace.The essential issues with which NÁbulusÎis concerned are, first,true faith, how to understand it and how to achieve it, and, second,the related problem of sin, its significance for the believer in ‘one-ness of being’ (waËdat al-wuj×d )and its meaning in relation todifferent categories of the faithful. Therefore, it is these centraltopics in theFatËthat have been selected for discussion here.WaËdat al-wuj×dand the problem of sinNÁbulusÎbegins and ends his book of guidance with a concernabout sin that leads him into far more complexities than would beenvisioned by the writers of the classic manuals of Sufi guidance.The usual assumption of these earlier Sufis is that sin is sufficientlyobvious not to require extensive efforts at definition. Therefore,they concentrate their discussion on repentance from sin, the firststation on the ‘path’, rather than on sin itself. Probably the best-known classic manual, theRisÁlaof QushayrÎ(d. 1072), follows thisapproach, giving full consideration to what constitutes repentanceand the different levels at which it may be achieved with aconsciousness of making a distinction between ordinary believers,Sufis, saints and prophets.9QushayrÎnotes three essential condi-tions in order for repentance to be acceptable: remorse for the sincommitted; abandonment of that sin; and determination not torepeat it. The heart has a key role to play in making the believerconscious of evil acts. It is then necessary to dissociate oneself frombad company and to persevere until correct conduct is maintainedand the sin is no longer committed. There is an acknowledgementthat would be readily admitted in Sufi circles that it is hard never tore-offend and natural if lapses do occur. However, one must persist,until the sin is rejected completely. QushayrÎstresses the need for acombination of deep feeling and determined action:When a man abandons major sin, loosens from his heart thebond of persistence and firmly intends not to return to sin,at that moment true remorse comes to his heart. He regretswhat he has done and reproaches himself for the repugnantacts he has committed. Then his repentance is complete, hisstriving is true, and he exchanges the comradeship of theevil companions he previously kept for isolation and foraversion to them.1022SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"But for real repentance it is not enough to be truly sorry. There mustalso be an attempt to set matters right with any persons who havebeen wronged by evil actions. This is assuming continuing con-sciousness of the sin committed. However, divisions of opinion arereported as to whether the repentant sinner should indeed rememberthe sins or forget them completely. According to the highly respectedauthority of Junayd, it was more proper to forget everything associ-ated with the former state of impurity.Although NÁbulusÎ’s treatment of the same theme contains elementsalready present in manuals of this type, it is also strikingly differentfrom them. They contain clear and relatively simple ethical teach-ings put in the mouths of former masters and often also make refer-ence to the Qur’Án andËadÎths, interpreted, on the whole, inaccordance with their obvious meanings. NÁbulusÎ, by contrast, setshis concern with sin and repentance within an elaborate theoreticalframework, in which the simple advocacy of practical piety isdiscarded in favour of convoluted arguments claiming to expoundthe ultimate truths attainable by the spiritually enlightened.If there is one word that dominates the discussion in theFatË,itis‘reality’ or ‘ultimate truth’ (ËaqÎqa). This is NÁbulusÎ’s principalconcern and it is evident throughout that, while he treats topics firston the level of theSharÎ¿a, displaying his knowledge offiqhand thekalÁmof the classical schools of theology, the most significant part ofeach chapter is devoted to theÊaqÎqa. But NÁbulusÎadmits that thereare different types of ‘reality’. Thus, in considering sin, he speaks ofits reality according to the Law and defines this as opposition to theLord after he had sent a prophet to provide guidance.11Conse-quently, those people who lived in a time in which they had notreceived revelation from a prophet could not be regarded as sinful intheir deeds, and the same applied to those who lived in an isolatedplace cut off from information or who lived indÁral-Ëarband did notmake ahijratodÁral-IslÁm. For NÁbulusÎ this isthe essential truth ofsin from a legal perspective. But there is another type of reality, thereality of sin, in this case according to its inner divine dimension. It isthis sense of reality with which NÁbulusÎis primarily occupied andwhich leads him to the most complex theorising.On this dimension he seeks to understand the place of sin withinthe Ibn¿ArabÎan scheme of oneness of being (waËdat al-wuj×d )andaddress the problem of its origins in a system where everything ulti-mately derives from God.12He expounds Ibn ‘ArabÎ’s ideas in asimplified form for his target audience, explaining the nature ofexistence as comprising four degrees of descent from the highest to23THE SPIRITUAL SON OF IBN¿ARABÍ"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"the lowest levels of existence: the first degree is that of God’sessence; the second that of God’s attributes, which is also the degreeof the Prophet MuËammad; the third is that of the attributes oractions, which is the degree of the believers; and the fourth is that ofthe acted upon, the world, which is the degree of Satan. ‘These fourare in reality one thing’, asserts NÁbulusÎ,13but, as this ‘one thing’has descended in the creative process, various forms have becomemanifest and its existences have multiplied; and yet, all four degreesof existences are ‘the form of the Real (al-Êaqq)’ or God. Hecontinues:God – may He be exalted – created Adam comprising thisform. ... He is the mirror of the Real, for Adam exists in hisprototype, which is the degree of the essence. And he existsin the knowledge of God, and this is the degree of theattributes. And he exists in the exalted pen, and this is thedegree of the actions. And he exists in the preserved tabletand this is the degree of the acted upon.14He adds that every one of God’s worlds has its own Adam and hissons, and that means, in effect, each land has its own prophet. Herehe is echoing the teachings he has inherited regarding the ‘perfecthuman’ (al-insÁnal-kÁmil), who encompasses all the degrees of exis-tence. The idea had been given great importance by Ibn¿ArabÎ, whoconsidered such a one to be ‘the total theophany of the divinenames, the whole of the universe in its oneness as seen by the divineessence’.15It is a condition said to be fulfilled in the ProphetMuËammad as the MuËammadan Reality (al-ËaqÎqa al-muËammadiyya). The concept was later explored in great theoret-ical detail, notably in the thought of¿Abd al-KarÎm al-JÎlÎ(d.c.1428), whose bookal-InsÁn al-kÁmil(The Perfect Human )wasamong the Sufi writings that made a deep impression on the young¿Abd al-GhanÎ.16However, NÁbulusÎis here more concerned withestablishing that prophets generally encompass all these possibilitiesof existence so as to comprehend the meaning of sin in relation tothem.Sin, according to him, takes on its individualised form from thefourth degree of existence, the degree of Satan. It is produced by thesoul (nafs )paying attention to this lower degree and so committingsin, something that occurs in time rather than being eternally pre-existent.17NÁbulusÎdoes not consider the prophets to be totallysinless, but believes their sins to be less than those of ordinary24SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"believers and different from theirs because of the special nature oftheir existence. Similarly, he sees the sins of believers as less thanthose of people in general.18He does admit to having experienced some confusion as regardsthe question of whether the prophets were ever disobedient to God.Two bodies of opinion are noted. The first is that it is necessary tobelieve from the Qur’Án that prophets disobeyed God on occasionboth before and after their calls to prophethood and that whoeverdoes not accept this is an unbeliever. The second is that the prophetswere never at any point in their lives disobedient. NÁbulusÎtells usthat his response to this dilemma was to pray to God for guidanceand that, while he was praying, the solution came to him in aninrush of inspiration (wÁrid). He thus arrives at a mystically inspiredrather than a logically reasoned answer to the problem.God’s full reality, he claims, is actually unknown to the prophetsbecause their knowledge is only of His total transcendence. Thebelievers, in their turn, have only a limited knowledge and cannotunderstand the reality of the prophets.The two realities are unknown to us, both the reality ofGod and the reality of the prophets, peace be upon them.But each of the two realities has immutable attributes in thetexts, in all of which it is obligatory to have faith, inaccordance with what they actually contain, not what weinterpret them to mean.19At this point NÁbulusÎcautions against excessive efforts at inter-preting revelation and advises following the way of the ancestors(al-salaf), remembering that it is really only God and His prophetswho know the full meaning of what appears ambiguous in thedivine message.Having sought to establish the place of sin in the order of exis-tence and to identify it as presenting different problems of under-standing in relation to prophets, ordinary believers and others,NÁbulusÎthen turns to the classification of sins according to theSharÎ¿aand theÊaqÎqa. With reference to theSharÎ¿a, he covers thefamiliar ground of early theological debates, especially thoseconcerning the status of the grievous sinner, but finally repeats themoderate doctrine that it is possible for major sins, such as adulteryor theft, to be obliterated by repentance or performance of theËajjand that God will only punish the grievous sinner in the afterlife, ifhe or she persists in their state of sin until death.2025THE SPIRITUAL SON OF IBN¿ARABÍ"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"In examining the classification of sin according to theÊaqÎqa,heis concerned more with the practical implications of this for Sufis.He reiterates early teachings of practical Sufi piety about the sinful-ness of forgetting the Real (al-Êaqq), and especially the covenantbetween God and humanity, proclaiming: ‘Know that forgetfulnessmakes man into a beast, just as mindfulness makes him into aking.’21The Sufi reader would be reminded of the danger ofreverting to the level of ordinary people who are not God-consciousand, therefore, not fully human, but like animals. There are alsoreminders of the sin of practising a false kind of Sufism, for exampleby being mindful of other than God, indulging in asceticism andworship night and day, but out of a preoccupation with self and notwith the Lord. Similarly, one may be devoted to the service of a spir-itual guide to such an extent that God is ultimately neglected.NÁbulusÎends with the exhortation to his readers to reform them-selves inwardly, for then God will reform them outwardly.His treatment of repentance is inevitably closely linked to hisunderstanding of sin and, as with other topics, he discusses it firstwith reference to theSharÎ¿a. He echoes the classic manuals ofSufism in his assertions that the reality of repentance according totheSharÎ¿aconsists in turning away from sin with remorse and aresolve not to commit that sin again. Like them, he is also realistic inhis recognition that for most people this will not mean that theynever lapse, but that repeated efforts will be necessary to breakaway from the sinful state.The principal discussion, however, is of repentance according totheÊaqÎqa. In common with other Sufis, he thinks in terms ofdifferent forms of repentance of ordinary people and of the spiritu-ally elect. For the common believer, repentance involves ‘killing thenafswith the sword of striving’.22But thenafs, the soul or self, variesin the bodies of different creatures, as he illustrates in imagery oflight on glass familiar from theFuÑ×Ñ:Have you seen how the sun, when it falls on coloured glass,appears in every piece of glass with the colour of that piece?So it is when the spirit (al-r×Ë )becomes attached to anybody, it appears to have the necessary characteristics of thatbody. So it appears in the body of man with human charac-teristics, in animals with animal characteristics, in plantswith plant characteristics and similarly in minerals. Andthis is thenafs.2326SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The spirit, he explains, is created before the body and is always goodand pure, and contamination only takes place after contact with thebody, although there are good souls (nuf×s) as well as bad.24While ordinary people repent with remorse at their sinfulness, theelect repent of their repentance. NÁbulusÎattempts to clarify this bystating thatany worshipper who repents has forgotten about God’sBeing, that it is God who made him and made his repen-tance, and forgetfulness is a sin that requires repent-ance.So we have said about the repentance of the elect: it isrepentance of repentance.25This rather tortuous argument presents the act of repentance itselfas a moral problem because it implies that the repentant sinner isforgetful of God in His universally creative role and, consequently,it can be a sin even to repent of sins. A few years later NÁbulusÎcameto believe that he had himself joined the category of the elect whoare conscious that it is God who creates their repentance. He recallshis own visionary conversation with God, when he repented forhaving missed the afternoon prayer because he had spent the timereplying to a man who was questioning him about the faith. Hequotes God as assuring him: ‘Know that My granting you success inrepentance from every sin you find in yourself is the sign of My lovefor you.’26NÁbulusÎthen asked what would happen if he died whilehe was sinning and relates God’s words to him: ‘In that case you willbe one of those I forgive without repentance.’27Whatever the difficult ethical implications of such beliefs aboutan élite of sinners, for NÁbulusÎthe real concern in theFatËis withthe preservation ofwaËdat al-wuj×dand this is accomplished at thelevel of theÊaqÎqa. The state (ËÁl )of repentance, according toSharÎ¿a, is to escape God’s anger, but, according to theÊaqÎqa,itisthesinking of plurality in the oneness of being such that the peni-tent says, ‘I am not I and He is not He.’ Then he says, ‘Not I,and He is not He.’ Then he says, ‘Not He.’ Then he says,‘He.’ Then he is silent for ever, as is mentioned in theËadÎth:‘The tongue of the one who knows God grows weary.’28As for the station (maqÁm )of repentance, according to theSharÎ¿a,this is marked by the penitent’s exchanging bad for good qualitiesTHE SPIRITUAL SON OF IBN¿ARABÍ27"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"through God’s grace, but, according to theÊaqÎqa, the stationinvolves becoming familiar with the degrees of nearness to God.However, NÁbulusÎexplains that the station of repentance is only abeginning:Know that the degrees of nearness to God have an end inthis world, but not in the next. The fact is that one neverarrives at God. All are travelling to Him from pre-eternityto eternity. The station of repentance marks the entry onthat journey with those travellers. Then there is nothing butthe lifting of a veil and finding other veils behind it. There isno end to the theophanies and no end to the veils and noend to the unveilings.29NÁbulusÎis hopeful that most sinners who sincerely repent are likelyto have their repentance accepted by God. Exceptions are those whoinsult any of the prophets or Caliphs Ab×Bakr and ‘Umar b. al-KhaÕÕÁb, the heretic who holds all religions to be right and true and,finally, the practitioner of magic. Basing himself on the authority ofIbn¿ArabÎ,NÁbulusÎis particularly harsh on both males and femaleswho engage in witchcraft, which he denounces as the work of thedevil, contrasting it with the work of the ‘perfect human’ whosummons to true faith.30Sound doctrine post-Ibn¿ArabÎFrom here on, NÁbulusÎdevotes himself to expounding the reality oftrue faith in the spirit of Ibn¿ArabÎ. This often amounts to anapologetic, although the Great Master is only occasionally men-tioned as the source of his views. The third chapter of theFatË,on‘Sound doctrine’, supports belief in the oneness of being as theessential true doctrine. NÁbulusÎpresents his position in a lengthycreedal statement, for which he claims the authority of his personalillumination, not of past masters.So listen with the ear of your heart to what is poured outupon you from what is in the vessels of sound doctrine sothat you may wash away with that the filth of doubts andfancies and remove the impurities of innovations (bida¿),deviation and errors. ...

The attributes of this incomparable essence,also pre-eternal, are not its very self, nor are they anythingadditional to it, and the whole world is necessary to them,but not to the essence.31Such is NÁbulusÎ’s profession of faith, and, if its full realisation isthe result of mystical unveiling (kashf), it is also the product of amind steeped in the thought of Ibn¿ArabÎ. God’s essence is effec-tively beyond human definition or understanding, completelyincomparable with all other degrees of existence, including God’sattributes, which are carefully stated to be ‘not its very self’. Thepurpose of this detailed statement, abridged here, appears to bedefensive against possible charges of absolute monism.32¿Abd al-GhanÎfurther explains the relationship between God’s essence, Hisattributes and His revelation of Himself in the Qur’Án andÊadÎth:Know that all these attributes by which God has describedHimself, whether in His Book (Qur’Án )or on the tongueof His Messenger (Êadith), have pre-eternal meanings,existing in His exalted essence. Just as they are not thesubstance of the essence, neither are they other than theessence. Similarly, every one of these attributes is not thesubstance of the other attribute nor is it other than it. So Hisessence has unity and oneness, it and its attributes not beingconstructed with one form.All the attributes are links between God and the world. Theworld only emerged from nothingness into existence fromthat pre-eternal essence by means of its being described by29THE SPIRITUAL SON OF IBN¿ARABÍ"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"these attributes, which are also pre-eternal. God madeHimself known to us, as far as the Law is concerned, by trans-lating those pre-eternal meanings existent in His essence,which are the attributes, into Arabic in His pre-eternalspeech and on the tongue of His Messenger. With regard toall those Arabic expressions, whose meanings (His attrib-utes )are translated for us, ultimate realities (ËaqÁ’iq )arecontained in those meanings and not metaphors (majÁzÁt).33All this is not very original, but it represents a painstaking effort toclarify the Great Master’s ideas on ‘oneness of being’ in such a waythat they appear in conformity with the Law. There is also a concernto give due importance to the Qur’Án andÊadÎthin God’sinforming humanity about Himself rather than laying major stresson direct knowledge gained through mystical experience.NÁbulusÎis extremely conscious of the status of Arabic as God’sown pre-eternal speech. Elsewhere he accepts the views of his earlyteacher Najm al-dÎn al-GhazzÎ, biographical dictionary author,that the knowledge of Arabic is the essential quality that marks theArabs’ superiority over other peoples, quoting his saying:There is no doubt that theArabs’ logic is better, theirexpression clearer, and their language the most perfect ineloquence and the ability to differentiate between nuances... The Arab mind is the most perfect, since language isthe expression of one’s understanding.34He cites aËadÎthto the effect that Adam spoke Arabic in Paradise.After sinning, he spoke Syriac until he repented and God restoredhis knowledge of Arabic.35All Arabic words, he maintains, repre-sent realities (ËaqÁ’iq), when they are used with reference to God.36The vocabulary of ‘reality’ (ËaqÎqa, pl.ËaqÁ’iq )as contrastedwith ‘metaphor’ (majÁz, pl.majÁzÁt )occupies a prominent place in¿Abd al-GhanÎ’s writing. Only God has qualities that are ‘real’(ËaqÎqÎ), while those that appear in the world are ‘metaphorical’(majÁzÎ). Thus the beauty of the world is a metaphor for His Beauty.In the same way, it is only God’s Love that is real and human love ismetaphorical.37In discussing the Arabic expressions for God’sattributes in this context in theFatË,NÁbulusÎtakes the example ofpower. As real power belongs to God, if the Arabic wordal-qudraisused with reference to humans, it can only refer to a limited meta-phorical power that God has created in them.30SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"In a manner that is commonly associated with later reformers, forexample MuËammad¿Abduh (1849–1905 )in Egypt, NÁbulusÎseesserious problems of misunderstanding entering the Islamic commu-nity after the thirdhijrÎcentury (ninth centuryCE).38This was thetime when theological disputes and innovations spread in theummabecause of a failure to follow the pious early Muslims (al-salaf al-ÑÁliË )in their true understanding of the faith.

His fiercest rebukes are reserved for the ShÎ¿Îsects of Syria, whom he judges to be unbelievers worse than Chris-tians because of their rejection of all prophets, laws, revelations andthe Last Day, and because of their belief in the transmigration ofspirits.48His information on them is by no means reliable. Forexample, he confuses the NuÑayrÎs (also known as¿AlawÎs )with theDruze, when he writes of ‘the NuÑayrÎs who speak of God’sindwelling in al-ÊÁkim bi-amr AllÁh’, that is, the FÁÕimid Caliph al-ÊÁkim (r. 996–1021), believed by the Druze to be an incarnation ofGod.49The Jews and Christians are treated with comparative tolerance.Although NÁbulusÎnotes the traditional views on the forms of theirunbelief, he remarks that they are to be excused in the event of their32SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"insulting one of the prophets and that their repentance is acceptedup to the hour of their death (on the understanding that this meanstheir becoming Muslim).50NÁbulusÎalso has occasion to defend Ibn¿ArabÎin his interpreta-tion of the punishment of unbelievers in Hell. In theFatËhe refersto the criticisms of statements in theFut×ËÁtandFuÑ×Ñthat theexperience of the Fire will actually become pleasant for the infidelseventually. It is a view that NÁbulusÎshares with JÎlÎand a numberof Sufis of the school of Ibn¿ArabÎ. However, Ibn¿ArabÎacknowl-edged that certain categories of unbelievers, namelymushrik×n(guilty of associating others with God )and atheists, would remainin the Fire for ever, but that there would come an end to their under-going the pains of chastisement due to the operation of God’sattribute of Mercy (raËma).51God’s Mercy, explains NÁbulusÎ, has a primary function ofbringing things into existence through its remembrance of every-thing. Thus even the pains of Hell came into existence becauseMercy remembered them. God’s Wrath, in its turn, is dependent forits existence on His Mercy. Therefore, when God’s Wrath increasesagainst the sinners in Hell, their punishment increases, but ‘Mercyalso increases because it preceded Wrath ... so they are punishedinasmuch as Wrath increases and are pleased inasmuch as Mercyincreases.’52In his explanation NÁbulusÎkeeps close to Ibn¿ArabÎ’streatment of the subject in the ‘Word of Zakariah’ in theFuÑ×Ñ:Know that the Mercy of God encompasses everythingexistentially and in principle, and that the Wrath [of God]exists only by virtue of God’s Mercy on it. His Mercy hasprecedence over His Wrath, which is to say that Mercy isattributed to Him before Wrath.53Ibn¿ArabÎ’s argument develops in a far more technical and abstruseway than that of NÁbulusÎ, who attempts to make the GreatMaster’s ideas more readily accessible to the reader. However, whatis evident from both is that belief in a personal God who may beapproached by His worshippers in the hope of obtaining mercy isreplaced by a belief in an impersonal and apparently mechanicalprocess. Those who are still veiled so that they do not perceive theReality may continue to pray to receive mercy. The spiritually elect,however, will realise that they have already received mercy by beinggranted existence, for ‘His mercy has the highest ontological statusas existence-giver to all things, His wrath included’.5433THE SPIRITUAL SON OF IBN¿ARABÍ"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Where NÁbulusÎdoes seem to part company with Ibn¿ArabÎ, andalso with the majority of Muslim theologians, is over the question ofthe vision of God (ru’yat AllÁh )after death. Sunnis have generallyagreed that God will be visible through perception only in the after-life and only to believers, not to infidels, on the authority of theQur’ÁnicÁya: ‘No indeed, on that day they shall be veiled from theirLord.’ (S×ra 83, v. 15)55Ibn¿ArabÎfollows the mainstream opinionthat the inhabitants of Hell will remain veiled from God even aftertheir chastisement ends, arguing that, if they were to see God aftercommitting such sins, they would be overcome with shame andshame is a form of chastisement that has ended.56However, it is notclear that he held rigidly to this position, since at one point in theFut×ËÁtthere is the suggestion that these sinners may not bepermanently veiled.57NÁbulusÎ, however, puts forward a rather different view. Heclaims that the pain of punishment will not be experienced forever,not because it will come to an end, but because the sufferers will beoccupied with a vision of the beauty of God’s Splendour, just asthose in Paradise are occupied with a vision of the splendour ofGod’s Beauty. Thus ‘He will be manifest to the People of Paradisethrough the attribute of Beauty and to the People of Hell throughthe attribute of Splendour.’58Each of these attributes containswithin it the other. Yet, for NÁbulusÎ, God in His essence remainsunknowable even in the afterlife and cannot be seen by anyoneexcept in the form of attributes. NÁbulusÎseems to be far removedfrom orthodoxy according to most Sunnis, but he is still claiming abasis for his views in Ibn¿ArabÎ’s thought on the subject, althoughgiving no exact reference. Is he simply reporting these controversialstatements from an unlocated place in the Great Master’s vastoutput or is he merely using his name to provide a cover for his ownradical ideas?He follows up his remarks with an impassioned defence of hismaster:Do you really think that the Great Shaykh, MuËyÎ’l-dÎnb.al-¿ArabÎ(may God sanctify his inner secret )says that thepunishment of the unbelievers will be abolished andcease? All he actually wishes to convey is what we havementioned. But there has been dispute about his meanings,differences of opinion about his symbolic expressions anddeviation from the sense that he intended. Rumours havespread so that the ignorant man has thought that he34SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"intended to say that the eternal punishment of the unbe-lievers will be abolished and he has concluded from thisthat the definite texts (i.e. in the Qur’Án )are beingrejected.59It looks very much as if this line of attack on the ‘ignorant’ isdesigned to deflect accusations away from himself, particularly ashe immediately informs his readers that he had thought to deal withthe topic in a separate treatise, but was concerned that he might bemisunderstood. It is a matter for those who are ready to understandultimate truths, he explains, and are able to realise how they are inconformity with the Qur’Án andSunna. He also finds it necessary tostress that, if there is anything that someone does not understand, hewould wish that person to refer back to him for further explanationand to be assured that he will not be saying anything contrary to theQur’Án andSunna.Faith and the sinful saintSuch assurances seem all the more necessary when NÁbulusÎembarks on his discussion of the various levels of belief. He dividesthe topic into the accepted divisions ofislÁm,ÎmÁnandiËsÁn(submission to God, faith and beneficence). As in the previous chap-ters, he deals with the outer and inner aspects, theSharÎ¿aandÊaqÎqa, dividing and subdividing each one and explaining it so as toconform to the ideas of Ibn¿ArabÎ. Much of his exposition here is anabstract summary of inherited Sufi positions without a high degreeof originality. What is more interesting is when he makes use of Ibn¿ArabÎ’s authority to support what is at times a highly controversialagenda of his own. This is markedly the case in his comments on thefaith of the spiritually elect. Is it possible to be sinful and awalÎAllÁh? If it is, can this ‘sinful’ saint act as a spiritual guide to others?NÁbulusÎopens his argument by examining the meaning of aparadoxical and puzzling propheticËadÎth: ‘The adulterer does notcommit adultery, when he commits adultery but is a believer, andthe thief does not steal, when he steals but is a believer.’60Such aËadÎth, taken at face value, could be interpreted so as to negate theLaw with reference to two of the gravest offences and so, by exten-sion, to provide arguments for a wholly antinomian position.NÁbulusÎ’s understanding of it could be seen as leaning in that direc-tion, although with qualifications. Essentially, he regards thisreputed statement of the Prophet as referring not to the ordinary35THE SPIRITUAL SON OF IBN¿ARABÍ"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Muslim, but to one who is a believer (mu’min )in the sense of havingreal and perfect faith (ÎmÁn). Such a person is one of the saints. Heexplains:Those who have perfect faith are ‘preserved’, not sinless.The meaning of ‘preservation’ is that sin does not harmthem at all, but it does not mean that they do not commitsin.61Such people, he argues, are sure to repent and seek God’s forgive-ness for their sins and, the more sins they have, the more they will berepentant and so receive God’s love. However, ordinary Muslimswho fall into sin will become more forgetful of God and even moreveiled from Him. Although he concedes that they may sometimesrepent, this is not assured as it is in the case of the perfectly faithfulwho are able to see the ugliness of their sin.NÁbulusÎat this point seeks support from the authority of Ibn¿ArabÎ, quoting him at some length. After stressing the importanceof a disciple’s belief in his shaykh’s knowledge of the way to Godand ability to advise others, Ibn¿ArabÎtells the following story:A student associated with a shaykh. Then he saw him oneday committing adultery with a woman, but he did notchange in his service and did not fail to carry out any of theshaykh’s instructions, nor show him any less respect. Theshaykh knew that he had seen him, so he said to him oneday: ‘My son, I know that you saw me when I did wrongwith that woman and I was expecting you to leave mebecause of that.’ The student said to him: ‘My master, thehuman being resists conforming to God’s decrees. From thetime that I entered your service, I have not served you on theunderstanding that you are sinless, but I have only servedyou on the understanding that you know about God’s wayand know how to seek Him, which is my desire. Your beingis disobedient, a matter between you and God that hasnothing to do with me.’62Ibn¿ArabÎconcludes that the student became spiritually successful,attaining a high state and station.In essence, what Ibn¿ArabÎis saying is open to different interpre-tations. He may be saying that Sufi shaykhs have the normal failingsof other human beings and are liable to sin, but this does not prevent36SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"them from being good spiritual guides, or he may be saying that thedevoted seeker can attain his goal, even if his guide is far fromperfect. It could be read as cautionary advice against excessiveveneration of the shaykh and a reminder that the man of God is notsinless and that the disciple’s achievement must depend on his owneffort.To recognise human failings and to counsel against undue exal-tation of the spiritual guide is one thing. It is something entirelydifferent to present those failings almost as if they are desirable inthe spiritually elect because they will lead to greater repentance.Such a proposition could have very disturbing ethical implicationsand be seen as opening the way to abuse, stifling criticism ofwrongdoing, provided it is those of perfect faith who are thewrongdoers. This does appear to be the crux of NÁbulusÎ’sconcluding command:Do not say to one whom you see disobeying God in a greator small action, while believing in his heart in MuËammad(PBUH )and in all that he brought from God and confessingthat with his tongue: ‘If this man were a saint, then hewould not disobey his Lord.’63The problem of veneration of corrupt shaykhs is one which wasto be heatedly debated by reformers in the years after NÁbulusÎ’sdeath. It became a matter of increasing anxiety for eighteenth-century critics within the Sufi brotherhoods and is especially wellknown in the tracts of the anti-Sufi Arabian WahhÁbÎs. Ibn¿Abd al-WahhÁb (d. 1792 )declares it to be less reprehensible to worshipidols of wood and stone than to follow sinful, corrupt Sufi masters,men who do not even feel shame on account of their evil deeds.64This was, of course, not a new area of concern, but the intensifica-tion of the polemic is obvious in this period. However, it is still notso obvious why it should be so and how the anti-Sufi polemic relatesto the understandings of Sufism being promoted in the seventeenthand early eighteenth centuries. Alexander Knysh has drawn aptattention to the current gap in reliable information, observing:It is, I believe, our scant knowledge of eighteenth-centuryMuslim theological literature that prevents us from explainingwhy some Muslim reformists vehemently opposed Ibn¿ArabÎ’s teaching, viewing it as a consummation of Sufiheresy, whereas others considered it quite germane to their37THE SPIRITUAL SON OF IBN¿ARABÍ"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"goals and, moreover, were eager to incorporate its elementsinto their own reformist platforms.65He further remarks the need for ‘a thorough analysis of the work ofthe seminal figures of the eleventh/seventeenth century’.66Amongsuch figures NÁbulusÎwould surely be one of the most important,both through his writings and the growing number of his studentsand network of scholarly and Sufi contacts, including those in theHoly Cities of Arabia. Many understood Ibn¿ArabÎthrough themedium of men such as NÁbulusÎ, who certainly advocated hisideas, but not without sometimes giving them a development oftheir own, which would not necessarily have earned the GreatMaster’s approval. The same applies to the adoption of ideasclaiming a basis in the poetry of Ibn al-FÁriÅ(d. 1235), another maintarget of WahhÁbÎattacks and also widely known through NÁbulusÎ’sinterpretation. Certainly, Ibn¿Abd al-WahhÁb condemnedboth Ibn¿ArabÎand Ibn al-FÁriÅas unbelievers. Nevertheless, it is likely thathe and other critics were angered more by what they perceived as athreat to Islamic morality in their own day from the ‘questionableinterpretations’ of latter-day followers of the ‘infidel mystics’, ratherthan by their original works. Among the few contemporary Sufiswhom Ibn¿Abd al-WahhÁb attacks by name is ‘a certain Ibn¿AzzÁzfrom one of the oases in Najd, whom he suspected of having been apupil of¿Abd al-GhanÎ,known asal-¿Àrif bi’llÁh– most probablythe famous Damascene NaqshbandÎ¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎ’.67At this point in time more study of the writings and debates of theperiod prior to the great eighteenth-century revival is needed in thehope of gauging how widely NÁbulusÎ’s ideas were shared by otherSufis and how much and what kind of theological opposition theyaroused.38SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"3THE NAQSHABANDÍRECLUSE¿Abd al-GhanÎ, the NaqshabandÎOttoman Damascus might be a provincial Arab city, but its popu-lation, both permanent and transitory, was markedly cosmopol-itan. The increase in ethnic diversity between the sixteenth andeighteenth centuries owed much to the growing importance ofDamascus as an assembly point for pilgrims gathering to join theannual caravan setting out for the Meccan pilgrimage. Although itstill could not compete in scale with the caravan from Cairo, theDamasceneËajjcaravan assumed a vital strategic role for Ottomanplanners, comparable, as Karl Barbir notes, to ‘the route to India inthe minds of British imperial planners in the nineteenth and twen-tieth centuries’.1The route through Syria provided the essential linkbetween Istanbul and the Holy Cities of Arabia. It was the route ofchoice for members of the sultan’s family and senior Ottoman offi-cials travelling forËajj,and was also necessary to trading communi-cations in the region. Hence, the sultans expended considerableefforts on the organisation of the caravan and protection ofpilgrims. In the late seventeenth century (from 1672 onwards), moreTurkish officials, including some governors of Damascus, wereappointed to the post of ‘commander of the pilgrimage’ (amÎr al-Ëajj), and fewer local notables are recorded as holders of this presti-gious office.2Thousands of pilgrims passed through Damascus, although exactnumbers are notoriously unreliable. Estimates vary from about15,000 to 40,000 in exceptional years.3In addition to those fromelsewhere in Syria, especially Aleppo, there were many Turks andeastern Europeans and a smaller number of Persians and centralAsians from beyond the Ottoman borders. While they would stayfor differing periods of time in the city, those from further afieldwould often seek to arrive well ahead of the caravan’s expected39"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"departure; others would face delays in their travels, reach Damascustoo late and be forced to wait until the next year or return homewithout performing theËajj. Some actually decided to settlepermanently, adding to the city’s cultural diversity but also leadingto some inter-racial tensions and, by the eighteenth century, strainedSunni–ShÎ¿Îrelations when some of the Persian pilgrims marriedlocal Sunniwomen.4In 1676, about two years after completing theFatËand 12 yearsafter his initiation into the QÁdiriyya,¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎencountered a central Asian traveller from Bukhara. This was theNaqshabandÎShaykh Ab×Sa¿Îd al-BalkhÎ, who had been to performtheËajjand visited Istanbul. He initiated NÁbulusÎinto theNaqshabandÎbrotherhood, taking from him the oath of allegianceat the shrine of John the Baptist in the Umayyad Mosque.5Ab×Sa¿Îdinvested him with theqalansÁwa, a white cap, and presented himwith a treatise on the Naqshabandiyya by TÁj al-dÎn al-R×mÎ(d.1640),RisÁlafÎsunanal-ÔÁ’ifaal-Naqshabandiyya(TreatiseonthePractices of the NaqshabandÎOrder). He then asked his newdisciple to write a commentary on it, a task that NÁbulusÎsooncompleted.6TÁj al-dÎn was a prominent personality among theIndian NaqshabandÎs, his own shaykh being MuËammad BÁqÎbi’llÁh Berang (d. 1603), the major propagator of theÕarÎqain Indiafrom its base in Delhi. However, the brotherhood diverged intodifferent branches after his time. One offshoot was associated withTÁj al-dÎn, who moved to settle in Mecca and played a role in famil-iarising Arabs with the Naqshabandiyya through his teaching andwritings, including theRisÁlaand translations into Arabic ofNaqshabandÎtexts, such as a collection of Sufi biographies by thegreat poet JÁmÎ(d. 1492).7It is an interesting indication of the inter-national ramifications of the Naqshabandiyya in the late seven-teenth century that a central Asian shaykh asks his Syrian disciple tocomment on the work of an Indian shaykh resident in theÊijÁz. It isnot known whether NÁbulusÎwas familiar with TÁj al-dÎn’sRisÁlabefore his encounter with Ab×Sa¿Îd, but TÁj al-dÎn’s explanations ofthe basic principles of theÕarÎqawill have been foundational to hisown practice. They relate closely to the meditational customs of theNaqshabandÎs, particularly the characteristic silentdhikr(dhikrkhafÎ). Of the following eleven principles, eight were established by¿Abd al-KhÁliq GhijduwÁnÎ(d. 1220 )and a further three by theeponymous early master of the brotherhood, BahÁ’ al-dÎn Naqshband(d. 1389) of Bukhara:840SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"1.YÁdkard(remembrance, or ‘making mention’), both oraland mental.

However, despite the apparent strong TÁjÎinfluenceon him,¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎdoes not trace his spiritual gene-alogy through a TÁjÎchain (silsila). The list of masters, that herecords many years later, goes back via Ab×Sa¿Îd al-BalkhÎthrougha central Asian line to the dominating figure of KhwÁja ‘UbaydAllÁhAËrÁr (d. 1490), who stands out for his political andeconomic, as well as religious, authority.10He was the disciple ofYa¿q×b CharkhÎ(d. 1447), who constitutes the usual final linkbefore BahÁ’ al-dÎn Naqshband and the line of the earliest mastersback to GhijduwÁnÎ.NÁbulusÎsubmitted himself only briefly to the guidance of Ab×Sa¿Îd during what appears to have been a short stay by the master inDamascus before he departed on his journey homewards. He neverarrived. Ab×Sa¿Îd al-BalkhÎdied at Basra in 1681. Yet, the depar-ture and death of his shaykh probably made little difference toNÁbulusÎ’s progress in the Way. The books of dead masters andtheir spirits, seen in dreams and visions, were always more impor-tant. In making claims to direction from the spirit world, he wasfollowing a practice recognised in the Naqshabandiyya from earlyin its history. BahÁ’ al-dÎn Naqshband was instructed by livingguides, but considered his most significant spiritual training to havebeen acquired through visionary contact with earlier masters, espe-cially GhijduwÁnÎ, who insisted that he undertake the silentdhikr.11Among NÁbulusÎ’s spirit guides from outside theNaqshabandiyya, Ibn¿ArabÎhas been noted as a vital influence, the42SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"spiritual father, whom NÁbulusÎdescribes as his ‘milk-father’, whosuckles him and so, in some sense acts like a mother, breast-feedingthe spiritual son.12This imagery would also have been familiar toNÁbulusÎfrom NaqshabandÎtradition, according to which theshaykh’s nurture of the novice is likened to breast-feeding or tolaying an egg. Sayyid AmÎr KulÁl, the living master of BahÁ’ al-dÎnNaqshband is thus quoted as saying: ‘I milked my breast for you.’13NÁbulusÎalso laid claim to receiving guidance from a great shaykhof the NaqshabandÎs. Although he had undergone an outer bodilyinitiation through Ab×Sa¿Îd al-BalkhÎ, he seems to have attachedmore importance to his inner initiation through the spirit of KhwÁja¿AlÁ’ al-dÎn¿AÕÕÁr (d. 1400), a son-in-law and major disciple ofBahÁ’ al-dÎn Naqshband.14This¿AÕÕÁr also features in the spiritualancestry of JÁmÎ, linked to him by two intermediary shaykhs; and soa kind of bond is formed between the two poets, NÁbulusÎandJÁmÎ, joined as spiritual heirs of the same great masters, althoughseparated historically by 200 years. The effect of this initiation isalso to bring NÁbulusÎmuch closer to the great masters of theÕarÎqaand to show him replicating the mystical life of BahÁ’ al-dÎn. Bydoing so, he would be likely to gain a more elevated status withinthe Naqshabandiyya than could be attained as a mere novice of aminor seventeenth-century shaykh. Yet, if such worldly consider-ations are set to one side, presumably NÁbulusÎwould see himself asin need of a higher source of guidance than that represented by theaverage living shaykh, since he would pass so rapidly beyond theinsight available from an ordinary master, being himself no ordi-nary disciple.NÁbulusÎfits into the category of Muslim mystics who allege thatthey have been guided without physical access to a visible instructor;they are generally described as UwaysÎs and so-called after Uwaysal-QaranÎ. Uways was supposedly a contemporary of ProphetMuËammad, but possibly a legendary figure, who was said to haveengaged in telepathic communication with the Prophet.15WhileUwaysÎpractices could be accommodated at times within a powerfuland organised brotherhood such as the Naqshabandiyya, not allÕarÎqashaykhs were comfortable with the idea and would generallycaution a disciple against the dangers of visiting the tombs in thehope of direction from a dead saint. Julian Baldick has remarked onthe UwaysÎtradition as having been ‘a marginal one, with a certaindubious appeal’, but sees some advantage in it, since ‘by callingoneself an UwaysÎone can avoid the unpredictable and often severedemands of the living elders available’.16This might indeed be the43THE NAQSHABANDÍRECLUSE"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"case for those dervishes lacking in genuine spiritual commitment,for whom a master’s training might prove too rigorous. However,the great mystical ‘friends of God’ are clearly in a class apart fromthe everyday dervishes.MujaddidÎconnectionsIn addition to communication with the spirits of the saintly dead,NÁbulusÎbelieved that he was guided by the Prophet in dreams andvisions, and was also directly instructed by God.17The closest modelfor him in this respect among NaqshabandÎs near to his time is thefamous Indianmujaddid, renewer of his age, Shaykh AËmadSirhindÎ(d. 1624). SirhindÎalso believed that he came to be divinelyguided after a period of training under a NaqshabandÎmaster. Theimplication is that both men understand their experience as beingbrought near to God so as to share in the Prophet’s experience asHis disciples, but that they also remain in a servant–master relation-ship to the Prophet. For SirhindÎ, this is describable as his being aservant invited to eat at the same table as his lord.18During his lifetime, SirhindÎ’s mystical letters provoked a numberof critiques by‘ulamÁ’,protesting against themujaddid’s unor-thodox ideas. It is not clear how far these ideas were familiar toNÁbulusÎin the 1670s and 1680s, although he is recorded at a laterdate as the author of a commentary on SirhindÎ’s letters.19By theeighteenth century the image of AËmad SirhindÎhad changed fromthat of a controversial mystic to that of a staunch defender ofSunnism, and his new branch of theÕarÎqa, the Naqshabandiyya–Mujaddidiyya, had acquired a similarly sober and respectableimage.20The MujaddidÎs had also become successful to the pointthat by the late eighteenth century their branch was ‘virtually synon-ymous with the order as a whole throughout south Asia, theOttoman lands and most of central Asia’.21When¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎjoined the order, this was obviously not yet the case, andhe does not seem to have considered becoming a MujaddidÎ, in spiteof friendly contacts with the branch. His personal faith and practicedo not appear to include anything much that would be recognisableas distinctive of theÕarÎqain its modern (largely MujaddidÎ )form asdescribed by Hamid Algar:The leading characteristics of the Naqshbandiyah are strictadherence to thesharÎ¿ah, a sobriety in devotional practicethat results in the shunning of music and dance and a44SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"preference for silentdhikr, and a frequent (although by nomeans consistent) tendency to political involvement.22All this appears singularly uncharacteristic of NÁbulusÎ. Despitehis qualifications as a jurist and his protestations at times that hewill say nothing contrary to theSharÎ¿a, his attitude to the practiceand enforcement of the letter of the Law, its external aspect, is atbest ambiguous. He is a devoutÊanafÎscholar and respected authorof treatises onfiqh, but shows his sympathies with such as the reput-edly antinomian poet¿AfÎf al-dÎn al-TilimsÁnÎ, noted as an earlysource of spiritual inspiration to him, and has high regard for enrap-tured ‘friends of God’ who flout the exoteric ordinances. His ownpractice is also questionable with regard to observance ofSharÎ¿aattimes in his life, especially in the 1680s, not long after his joining theNaqshabandiyya. Far from ‘shunning’ music and dance and onlyapproving silentdhikr, he wrote in 1677 (shortly after his initiation)on the legitimacy of musical instruments in the Sufi audition(samÁ¿)23and, not long after, defended the whirling dance of theMawlawÎs (Mevlevis).24He also accepted invitations to attend thevocaldhikrof otherÕarÎqason a number of occasions afterbecoming a NaqshabandÎ.While many masters in theÕarÎqainsisted on exclusive practice ofsilentdhikr, others did not, and the seventeenth century is a timemarked by disputes between advocates of the different forms ofdhikr. In Medina the prominent NaqshabandÎteacher IbrÁhÎm al-K×rÁnÎ(d. 1690 )has been noted for his ‘partiality to the loud (jahrÎ)dhikr, combined with music (samÁ¿)’.25He had a considerable inter-national following, including some from as far away as Indonesia,for whom he was the ‘most popular’ of the NaqshabandÎmasters inthe Holy Cities.26The K×rÁnÎfamily also had links with NÁbulusÎ.Debates among NaqshabandÎfactions spread outwards fromArabia, even to China, as travellers returned home and took withthem the views of their shaykhs on silent and vocaldhikr. Conse-quently, NÁbulusÎ’s writing on the subject may perhaps be seen as acontribution to these debates taking place within theNaqshabandiyya of his period, as well as with critics and would-bereformers outside it. Finally, any ‘tendency to political involvement’appears minimal in NÁbulusÎ’s case. Other features frequently asso-ciated with reform-minded NaqshabandÎs, such as opposition tomany popular practices connected with saint cults, have no place inNÁbulusÎ’s agenda and, instead, he ardently defends visits to thetombs of the righteous and all manner of rituals involved in the45THE NAQSHABANDÍRECLUSE"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"process of visitation (ziyÁra). On this issue he appears to have littlein common with the likes of MuËammadÊayyÁal-SindÎ(d. 1750),the Indian NaqshabandÎteacher in Medina of the vigorously anti-Sufi Ibn¿Abd al-WahhÁb.27Is the fact that NÁbulusÎwas not a MujaddidÎsufficient explana-tion for his strong advocacy of views and a lifestyle so contrary towhat might normally be expected in a NaqshabandÎshaykh? Itprobably does explain a great deal, but perhaps not everything.NÁbulusÎenjoyed a warm relationship of friendship and mutualrespect with MurÁdb.¿AlÎal-BukhÁrÎ(d. 1720), a disciple ofSirhindÎ’s son, MuËammad Ma¿Ñ×m, and a key figure in the spreadof the Mujaddidiyya in the Ottoman Empire.28Born in Samarqand,MurÁd travelled to India where he was initiated into the brother-hood, then after journeys in Persia, Iraq, Egypt and Arabia, took upresidence in Damascus in 1670. He was a man of NÁbulusÎ’s ownage and working to promote Naqshabandism in Damascus at thetime when¿Abd al-GhanÎdeveloped an interest in it. In 1681 hemoved to Istanbul for a period of about five years and acquired aMujaddidÎfollowing, including the Shaykh al-IslÁm FayÅAllÁhEfendÎ. With support from a high level for his mission, he returnedto Damascus and established twomadrasas in the 1690s, theMurÁdiyya and the Naqshbandiyya al-BarrÁniyya. He was also therecipient of amÁlikÁneestate from the sultan, providing the foun-dation for the MurÁdÎfamily’s wealth.29Late in his life MurÁdwent back to Istanbul where he died in 1720. Atekkenear histomb was to become a significant base from which the MujaddidÎbranch of the NaqshabandÎs would be promoted across Anatoliaand into the Balkans. MurÁd’s son, MuËammad al-MurÁdÎ(d.1755), also enjoyed the favour of the Ottoman authorities in hispromotion of the Naqshabandiyya. He was honoured by beingcalled upon to undertake theËajjin the sultan’s name and becametheqÁÅÎof Medina.30He was also a student of¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎ.Given that the MurÁdÎs were MujaddidÎs and NÁbulusÎwas not,were there serious differences between them? NÁbulusÎwas clearlynot an activist reformer in the style of many later NaqshabandÎshaykhs, but were the MurÁdÎs? It seems unlikely that MurÁd andhis son would have maintained their association with NÁbulusÎiftheir own faith and practice were so sharply contradictory to his.When the Mujaddidiyya was becoming established in Istanbulduring the eighteenth century, and even into the early nineteenthcentury, several shaykhs of theÕarÎqaare also noted as belonging to46SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"the Mawlawiyya and teaching the great mystical poem of centralimportance to the order, theMathnawÎ(Mesnevi )of JalÁl al-dÎnR×mÎ(d. 1273).31Hence, they were evidently not seeking thesuppression of vocaldhikr, music and dance. Some did, however,develop links with Ottoman bureaucrats with an interest in politicaland social reform, fulfilling the expectation that NaqshabandÎ–MujaddidÎshaykhs are enjoined ‘to try to seek influence with rulersas a part of their mission’.32Nevertheless, the stricter reform tenden-cies to insist on reviving the Prophet’sSunna, uprooting unaccept-able innovations (bida¿ )and enforcing theSharÎ¿aare more markedfrom the 1820s; they are especially associated with the activities ofShaykh KhÁlid Shahraz×rÎ(d. 1827 )and the rising influence of hisown MujaddidÎbranch, the KhÁlidiyya.33It therefore seems reasonable to suppose that the early MurÁdisdid not differ substantially from NÁbulusÎin their perception ofwhat constituted the right belief and behaviour for a NaqshabandÎshaykh. The major difference between them is that, whereasNÁbulusÎis primarily an ecstatic mystic leading selected souls on thepath of God and acquiring renown as a great scholar and a people’ssaint, the MurÁdis are primarily organisers with wealth, powerfulconnections and a mission to expand the Naqshabandiyya in theOttoman Empire.Divine love, platonic love, gay love?By his late thirties¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎwas distancing himselfincreasingly from contacts with worldly society, seemingly indespair at the corruption of his day in Damascus. At the same timehe was becoming an ever more controversial figure, apparentlycensured by his enemies, particularly hisÜÁÅÎzÁdelÎcritics, onaccount of his eccentric behaviour and audacious self-expression.Among his many offences in their eyes was his advocacy of the prac-tice ofnaÙar, gazing upon and contemplating beauty in beardlessyouths. The process, both praised and decried among Muslimmystics, was based on the belief from the ninth century onwardsthat the spiritual seeker would be brought through God’s grace toseeing the reality (ËaqÎqa )of Divine Beauty and Love by the pure,non-sexual experience of the earthly beauty and love of humanbeings.34It is only God in whom qualities are considered to be real;the seeker hopes for a deepening realisation of this and a growingunderstanding that all worldly manifestations of beauty and loveare but a metaphor (majÁz )for His Beauty and Love. Metaphorical47THE NAQSHABANDÍRECLUSE"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"human love is viewed as a bridge or ladder leading to the DivineBeloved. In the words of JÁmÎ:Beholding in many souls the traits of Divine beauty, andseparating in each soul that which it has contracted in theworld, the lover ascends to the highest beauty, to the loveand knowledge of the Divinity, by steps of this ladder ofcreated souls.35For the true lover of God, only His Reality would be visible.Critics, however, pointed to abuses. HujwÎrÎ(d.c. 1071 )consid-ered the practice ofnaÙarto be forbidden ‘and anyone whodeclares this to be allowable is an unbeliever’.36In his opinion, itwas a deplorable legacy of the believers inËul×l, the possibility ofGod’s incarnation in a human being. Other critics observed amoral danger for Sufis looking on the beauty of young boys: therisk of their being drawn into homosexual acts. NÁbulusÎstoodaccused by his enemies of homosexuality and support for gay love.Barbara von Schlegell has doubted whether there was ever anysound basis for these charges and notes his own comments to theeffect that both homosexuality and anal sex with women are to beclassed as unbelief (kufr).37While this may be a fair reflection ofNÁbulusÎ’s sincerely held views, there are problems with placingabsolute reliance on his remarks in this context as evidence of hisprivate views on the subject. He gives a public statement of hisposition inal-ÊadÎqa al-nadiyya(The Perfumed Garden), hiscommentary on a work highly revered by theÜÁÅÎzÁdelÎs,al-Ôariqa al-MuËammadiyya(The Way of MuËammad )by MeËmedBirgili (d. 1573), a leading critic of alleged Sufi aberrations.38NÁbulusÎ’sÊadÎqa, therefore, represented a significant part of hisdefence of Sufis in his confrontation with theÜÁÅÎzÁdelÎs and hisopen condemnation of homosexuality would be expected in responseto their attacks.It is very much a case of NÁbulusÎ’s own word against that of hisenemies. Their goal seems to be to discredit as an unbeliever thiseminent follower of Ibn¿ArabÎ, the detested ‘Worst Shaykh’ as far asthey are concerned. They would use all means to undermine hisposition in Damascene society and his own outspoken readiness toengage in controversy exposed him to such attempts to destroy hisreputation as one of God’s saints. Seeking escape from harassment,depressed by the corruption of the world around him, hoping to begranted true vision, he shut himself away in retreat.48SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The seven-year retreatIn 1680 NÁbulusÎwas approaching the age of 40 years and this mayhave been at least as significant a factor driving him to retreat fromthe world as the desire to seclude himself from his persecutors.Following the example of the Prophet, he probably expected toexperience a heightened awareness of God in his life through themedium of dreams and visions. He is described as shutting himselfup in his house in the Perfume-Sellers’ S×q near the UmayyadMosque, beginning a seven-year period of isolation. It is not certain,however, that he remained confined at home throughout the sevenyears from 1680 to 1687, since he has been noted as writing poemsdated to this period that depict him as attending outside gatheringswith his friends.39He was not always alone in the house, but, inaddition to family, was joined by a number of ecstaticmajÁdhÎb.During these seven years NÁbulusÎis said to have undergoneextra-ordinary states of ecstasy and to have advanced to the higheststations of the mystic. On the very first night of his retreat, 27RamaÅÁn, frequently identified asLaylat al-Qadr(the Night ofPower), he records his own consciousness of God’s presence and ofHis speaking to him. On other occasions he claimed to have similarexperience of conversations with God, which he set down in writingin hisMunÁjÁt(IntimateConversations), preserved in manuscript.40Usually the substance was to assure NÁbulusÎof God’s loving carefor him, of his status and that he would be preserved from hisenemies. Some of the subject matter is of a highly sensitive nature,such as the following account, disclosing the mystic’s secret:My Lord said, ‘You are My secret that I conceal withinMyself and I am your secret that you keep for Me in your-self (nafs). The self has many forms ... and I have manyforms with which I manifest in your self. The goal is “Youare in My presence (anta¿indÎ )and I am in your presence.”“You in My presence” is My very knowledge of My self. “Iin your presence” is your very knowledge of your self. I am Iwhile you are not you.’ God appeared to me in my form andHe said, ‘I am Absolute unrestricted Being and you are Myrestricted form (qaydÎ). Those who do not know Meworship Me in the forms of their beliefs, but not in thebeliefs of others.’ My Lord gave me an awesome revelation(tajallÎ )saying, ‘You will be in My presence (¿indÎ),subsisting in Me continually, for there are forms that will beobliterated and there are forms that remain for eternity.’49THE NAQSHABANDÍRECLUSE"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"And so I rejoiced. I had been sick and I was healed. My sick-ness was I and my cage was He. ... Then He called out to mefrom my own calling out and He revealed His Essence(dhÁt )and my essence to me and I heard but one voicetalking and I witnessed one ecstatic being. I knew thatduality in speaking comes entirely from vain imagining.The door was opened. The outer covering (qishr )that hadbeen the door, the separation, fell away.41This is a bold and shattering disclosure on his part, although it isunlikely that he made these proclamations known outside a veryclose circle of confidants. It is improbable that they were everintended for a wider audience. What he was writing was a strictlypersonal diary style of record with dates of each ‘intimate conversa-tion’, including this one, his own witness to a totally monistic visionof existence. The ecstatic statements situate NÁbulusÎat theextremely audacious, intoxicated end of the Sufi spectrum. Heexclaims inshaÕËiyyÁt(‘theopathic utterances’ )his overwhelmingconsciousness of absolutetawËÎd, that God alone truly is and thatthis knowledge, gained through the direct ‘tasting’ of the mystic,pervades him to the very depth of his being.42The terse, paradoxicalexpressions are in the category of Ab×YazÎd al-BisÕÁmÎ’s ‘Glory beto Me! How great is My Majesty!’ andÊallÁj’s ‘I am the Truth’among famous early words of ecstasy. And yet they seem morecontrived and carry the weight of the Sufi intellectual heritage, andin these respects bear comparison with the extravagant speech ofother mystics of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, such asAËmad SirhindÎand ShÁhWalÎAllÁh of Delhi (d. 1762). As CarlErnst remarks, recalling the ‘rhetoric of transcendental hyperbole’that characterises the two masters, they ‘describe themselves ashaving reached stations that make the achievements of BÁyazÎd andIbn¿ArabÎseem insignificant – the currency of spiritual states hasbecome devalued’.43Such is the case with NÁbulusÎ. Perhaps hisleast contentious statement here is that he has reached the higheststate of subsistence (baqÁ’ )in God. Other statements, such as hisclaim of God’s saying to him, ‘I am unrestricted Being and you areMy restricted form,’ and his saying, ‘He revealed His Essence (dhÁt)and my essence to me and I heard but one voice talking’, are farmore controversial. While Ibn¿ArabÎmaintained that he had had avision of God’s Essence ‘in the shape of the wordh×, “He”, lumi-nous between the arms of the letter hß’,NÁbulusÎ’s vision appearsto go well beyond that of his spiritual father.44NÁbulusÎ’s account,50SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"if publicly exposed, would certainly have laid him open to accusa-tions that he believed not only in the possibility ofËul×lorittiËÁd,God’s indwelling or unitive fusion with a created being, but of hisown participation in it. Both beliefs had been severely denounced byhim in theFatË, apparently in an effort to clarify his own positionand to separate himself from any suspected support for what hehimself described as heresies.45Even without divulging his mysticalexperience publicly, he was a target of suspicion and, although hewas not always so cautious, he knew enough not to speak publiclyof his experience.¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎrecords his vision as a healing experi-ence. He admits that he had ‘been sick’, spiritually sick. Externally,he appeared to others to be depressed, at times suspicious of visitors,obsessed with protecting himself from enemies and occasionallyviolent. On one occasion he assaulted the messenger of the gover-nor, IbrÁhÎm Pasha, when he came to present him with a purse ofgold and a sheep.46He seems to have been offended by the gover-nor’s gift, possibly seeing it as an attempt to lure him into thecorruption of the world, which he had rejected.A characteristic portrait of him at this time is provided by thebiographical dictionary writer MuËammad KhalÎl al-MurÁdÎ:He let his hair hang down loose and did not cut his nailsand he remained in a remarkable state. Melancholy beganto overwhelm him at this time. Envious people spreadunfounded rumours that he left off the five prayers and thathe mocked people in his poetry, but he – may God bepleased with him – was innocent of that. The people ofDamascus rose up against him and committed abhorrentacts.47The image offered by MurÁdÎis of NÁbulusÎas the enraptured holyman absorbed in the pursuit of mystical enlightenment to the exclu-sion of everything else in his life. He is constantly in a high spiritualstate so that all normal duties and even basic concerns to maintainritual purity have become an irrelevance for him. Yet there are diffi-culties raised by this picture of the ecstatic ‘friend of God’ (walÎAllÁh). How long did he remain in a ‘remarkable state’ as described?He is very unlikely to have done so throughout the seven years, sinceit is understood that it was not a total retreat and also that it was oneof his most prolific writing periods. Even though he regarded asignificant part of his production, including theMunÁjÁt, as God-51THE NAQSHABANDÍRECLUSE"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"directed or inspired, it seems unrealistic to suppose that he was in acontinual state of mystical rapture while he composed the followingworks:al-ÊadÎqaal-nadiyya, his commentary on Birgili’sÔarÎqaal-MuËammadiyya; a major verse commentary on the inner meaningsof the Qur’Án, running to some 5,000 lines; a detailed word-for-word commentary on Ibn¿ArabÎ’sFuÑ×Ñ;Ta¿ÕÎr al-anÁmfÎta¿bÎr al-manÁm(The Perfuming of Humankind in the Interpretation ofDreams), his popular guide to dream interpretation; also treatiseson the legality of smoking, the validity of MawlawÎritual, the needfor seclusion from corrupt society and the practice of gazing on thebeauty of youth.A further difficulty arises regarding the conflict between publicexpectations of NÁbulusÎas a religious scholar and his life as avisionary. Even if they knew nothing about the nature of his visions,many people in Damascus appear to have been deeply shocked bythe spectacle of Shaykh¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎallegedly floutingtheSharÎ¿a. His unkempt appearance with his hair un-braided andlong, dirty fingernails indicated that he could not be fulfilling theusual demands of cleanliness necessary for the performance ofprayer. His biographer, as a NaqshabandÎhimself and a great-grandson of MurÁd al-BukhÁrÎ, probably could not bring himself toadmit the possibility that this distinguished shaykh of hisÕarÎqamight have abandoned prayer, however briefly, and in an ecstaticstate. Instead, MurÁdÎhas to believe that he was innocent of at leastthis charge against him. He ignores the question of whether, ifNÁbulusÎprayed, he did so in an externally polluted state, whichwould be likely if the rest of the description were accurate. For¿Abdal-GhanÎ, as a mystic who believes himself to have attained throughGod’s grace the highest perception oftawËÎd, concerns with purityand pollution and even the performance of religious duties in anycondition may seem legitimately suspended. According to his under-standing, he is with God and his being is totally overwhelmed. Forthe people of Damascus, this is just not the kind of behaviour theywould expect from a member of one of the most importantÊanafÎ‘ulamÁ’families of their city, a descendant of the great juristic familyof the Ban×JamÁ¿a, a respected scholar ofËadÎthandfiqh.Heisnoignorantmajdh×blike Y×suf al-QamÎnÎ, who could be excused anybizarre behaviour and still be looked upon as one of God’s saints.They could not and did not tolerate the situation, although MurÁdÎdoes not specify the ‘abhorrent acts’ they committed or who, mostprobably some of hisÜÁÅÎzÁdelÎenemies, incited them.52SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"A voice from the unseen worldBy 1685 NÁbulusÎappeared increasingly under strain after fiveyears in retreat. His first marriage ended with his divorce ofMuÑliËa. Since the birth of IsmÁ¿Îl she had borne him no children forover 10 years and this may have been a critical factor in the break-down of their relationship. Due to the customary reticence of aMuslim household, no information is forthcoming, but otherfactors may well have been the intensity of NÁbulusÎ’s absorption inhis visionary and intellectual life, his possible preference for malecompany even if the charges of homosexuality were unfounded, andthe inevitable strains of social isolation and persecution. However,he does not seem to have had serious problems with MuÑliËa’sfamily, since he was later to marry MuÑliËa’s sister¿AlmÁ, whowould become the mother of a son (MuËammad Mas¿×d who diedat the age of eight years )and his two daughters,ÔÁhira and Zaynab,the latter named after his beloved mother and noted for her saintlymiracles of healing.On 10 October 1685 (12 Dh×’l-Qa¿da 1096)¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎheard a voice which he believed to come from the unseenworld, a voice of divine inspiration. The voice brought him thewords with which to respond to his enemies, explaining the beautyof true love of the beloved and exposing their corruption. Theresulting book was completed in January 1686 and NÁbulusÎgave ittwo titles: for the exotericists (ahl al-ÙÁhir )he called itGhÁyat al-maÕl×bfÎmaËabbat al-maËb×b(The Desired Goal in Love of theBeloved), while for the esotericists (ahl al-bÁÕin )he used the titleMakhraj al-muttaqÎwa-manhaj al-murtaqÎ(The Way Out of thePious and Method of the Spiritually Advanced).48Yet, althoughNÁbulusÎ’s authorship is clearly established and the work is writtenin his characteristic eloquent style, Y×suf al-NabahÁnÎ(d. 1932),among later Sufi authors, is too shocked to recognise this.49NabahÁnÎis an ardent admirer of NÁbulusÎas the greatest saintlymystic of the last 300 years, and cannot accept that he wouldcompose this frank apology fornaÙar, gazing on the beautiful malebeloved. On no sound basis he concludes that NÁbulusÎcannot bethe author and the book has either been falsely attributed to him orinterpolated.NÁbulusÎseeks to define the true nature of love (maËabba),explaining its various stages and declaring his conviction that lovecannot be divided into divine and creaturely love; all love is one.50He affirms the legality of looking upon beautiful faces, both maleand female, if this is practised without lust. If lust is present, the53THE NAQSHABANDÍRECLUSE"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"practice is forbidden. Sadly, he laments that this is not generallyunderstood in his day:We have seen many people confuse love with animal lust sothat they claim that they love the beloved and that they havetasted love and know it, when their love is mere lust. In thesame way they love food and drink in the sense that they aregreedy for it, but, because of the extent of their ignoranceand their hearts being filled with stupidity, they cannotdistinguish between love and lust. So you see one of themspending his life in ignorance, depravity, error and sin andthinking that he loves the beloved, although he only wantsto commit gross indecency with him or to have some otherpersonal contact such as embracing, kissing or touching.Due to the widespread love among them in this sense, lovehas become for them dishonour and shame, a defect, sinand vice, so that when they want to blame someone, theysay about him that he loves the beloved. So they despise himand disregard him. All this is error on their part, unbeliefand disrespect for the perfections of theSharÎ¿adue to theirignorance of it, but ignorance is not an excuse as we willshow in what follows.51NÁbulusÎmakes some severe criticisms of jurists, both past andpresent, on the grounds that they have been exceptionally harsh injudging certain behaviour to beËarÁm, for example the consump-tion of coffee and tobacco; this has even led to the killing of innocentpeople.52He aims to demonstrate that their condemnation ofnaÙaris due to their ignorance and misunderstanding of the Prophet’sSunna. He devotes a lengthy chapter to showing what he considersto be the authentic Islamic basis for the practice in the early commu-nity, drawing onÊadÎthand biographies of Companions andFollowers.53He is particularly concerned with arguing his caseagainst the cautions of the classic manuals of Sufi instruction,notably QushayrÎ’sRisÁla, about association with novices (ÑuËbatal-aËdÁth). He follows this with a highly controversial chapterexamining the Prophet’s pure love for the young Zayd b.ÊÁritha,his one time adopted son, and Zayd’s son UsÁma.54There is also areminder here of racial perceptions and prejudices of the period.UsÁma is being claimed as a model of beautiful youth and tradition-ally he had been described as black. NÁbulusÎfinds this problematic54SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"and so denies UsÁma’s blackness (sawÁd )because it would rob himof beauty according to Arab opinion of the time; instead, he assertsthat the colour intended to describe UsÁma is brownness (sumra),sothat the young beloved of the Prophet takes on the olive-browncolouring of an Arabian youth, more acceptable to his and his read-ers’ sensibilities.Before concluding with a chapter of examples of ascetics andmystics whom he cites as practisingnaÙar(including Ibn¿ArabÎ, Ibnal-FÁriÅand R×mÎ),NÁbulusÎreturns to attack his accusers inDamascus. In this autobiographical extract he recounts the distressthat led him to retreat and his deep unhappiness with the prevailingsocial trends:I was badly affected by this horrible state of affairs whichbefell this city of ours, Damascus, and the terrible, cata-strophic situation which afflicted this land, such that I gaveup associating with people except for some who believed inwhat I had to say and desired the truth that I desired. Iundertook to go out of my house only occasionally in caseof necessity because unbelief became manifest and spreadamong them without anyone rejecting it. God is sufficientfor me and I place my trust in Him so as to withstand insultand endure misfortune, when there is so much hypocrisyand discord. I experienced severe alienation from the wholeof humankind, since I did not find anyone who agreed withme on the evident truth, let alone finding anyone to supportme, owing to the massive corruption of this time and thesinfulness and widespread error among both commonpeople and notables – and in God I seek refuge at all times. Itook it deeply to heart and was moved by the ardour of myfaith, in the absence of any supporter or helper and withmany to contradict and oppose me, a massing of enemiesand envious people against me and the unjust, immoral andcorrupt all helping one another. Thus it was of primeimportance for me to respond, relating what I heard fromthe voice of the unseen world (hÁtif al-ghayb).55His contemporaries, he notes with bitter sarcasm, do not improvewith age: ‘The ignorance of the middle-aged and the old man is likethe ignorance of the suckling child.’56When NÁbulusÎwrote of the importance of his recording what hehad heard from ‘the voice of the unseen world’, he was still careful55THE NAQSHABANDÍRECLUSE"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"to restrict the readership of this work. He gave it a title forexotericists, but, nevertheless, told his disciples that they should notread it with the uninitiated.57It is by no means certain that all ofthem were aware of the book’s contents or agreed uncritically withtheir master, if they were aware. One of the most important ofNÁbulusÎ’s disciples was MuÑÕafÁb. KamÁl al-dÎn al-BakrÎ(d.1749), a leading figure in the eighteenth-century Khalwatiyya, aprolific writer and someone who has been considered significant asa reformer of Sufism, despite some queries as to whether he shouldbe viewed as a neo-Sufi reformer.58Despite his attachment toNÁbulusÎ, Bernd Radtke observes that he and his son objected to the‘immoral practice of consorting with beardless youths (murd)’,59although it is not clear whether he condemned it totally as a practiceor was critical of the immorality of the age as affecting Sufi behav-iour, a complaint that is also made by NÁbulusÎ.Despite his many troubles, NÁbulusÎwas nearing the end of hisseven years of voluntary confinement. In 1687 he finally emergedfrom retreat, his fame having spread and therefore attracting newdisciples and students; he was also the author of a substantial bodyof books, treatises and poems, and the object of growing venerationas a popular saint. The opponents did not vanish overnight, orindeed for many years, but he was stronger now and able to mount aformidable defence.56SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"4INTERPRETER OFTRUE DREAMS‘The two worlds are one’The conviction that what is accomplished in the world of the dreamis as valid as, or may actually be more valid than, the actions ofwaking life remained with¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎto the end ofhis life. No doubt, it was confirmed to him by his own remarkabledreaming, especially in the years of retreat, but persisting into oldage. His own writings and those of disciples bear witness to hisviews. This chapter explores NÁbulusÎ’s treatment of dreams, firstlooking at his attempts to understand their significance for himselfand his disciples, then examining his contribution to the literature,discussing dreams within the Islamic tradition. Although visionaryexperience and writing are noted from different points in NÁbulusÎ’slife, special attention is subsequently given to a dream manualcompiled during his retreat and to its preservation of a substantialheritage of dream interpretation, both Islamic and pre-Islamic.NÁbulusÎ’s disciples confirm from their own dream experiencethat they and their master attached great importance to thedreaming process. MuÑÕafÁal-BakrÎ, the distinguished KhalwatÎdisciple, was among those who flocked to study with NÁbulusÎ,travelling from Egypt to Damascus to join him for periods of up tofour years at a time between 1688 and 1709.1BakrÎ’s experiencewas not confined to everyday waking encounters, but also shows theimportance attached to dreaming in Sufi guidance. BakrÎrelates thaton one occasion he dreamt of NÁbulusÎgiving him anijÁzain boththe QÁdiriyya and Naqshabandiyya. The next day he visitedNÁbulusÎin his house and asked him to provide theijÁzain writing.However, the shaykh exploded with anger, exclaiming, ‘I gave youpermission. I gave you permission. The two worlds are one.’2Onefurther testimony is that ofÊusayn al-BaytamÁnÎ, a disciple of hislater years, who recorded various dreams relating to¿Abd al-GhanÎ57"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"al-NÁbulusÎ, including one in which NÁbulusÎordered him to dieand to come to life again afterwards, a common theme in accountsofmurshid-murÎd(guide–disciple )relationships. But then the masterapproached him and he recalls:When our palms were pressed together he gave me thebay¿ah(oath )inÔarÎq AllÁh(the Path of God )and thedhikroftahlÎl(lÁilÁhaillÁllÁh). When I woke I told him thedream. He rejoiced, ‘It is exactly so. Thebay¿ahbetweenspirits is stronger and more powerful than between bodies.3The dream events are seen as more significant in spiritual termsbecause it is in sleep that the pure spirits are present and morecapable of receiving glimpses of the world of truth. For NÁbulusÎthat truth is encountered on the ‘path of God’ to which he leads hisdisciples and which takes precedence over initiations, even dreaminitiations, into the QÁdirÎand NaqshabandÎÕarÎqas. BaytamÁnÎ’sdream is a further confirmation that NÁbulusÎ’s concerns are notthose of a typicalÕarÎqashaykh, but that he views himself as havinga primary mission of seeking God and helping others to seek God,but not necessarily through an organisedÕarÎqa. Dreaming thenbecomes a powerful vehicle for guidance.NÁbulusÎ’s disciples did not always dream of him as assuming hisown identity in their visions. On at least three occasions during hisearly period in retreat, 1681–83, the Prophet was seen in dreams ofsome of these disciples as having the physical shape of¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎ.4This was not, however, an isolated phenom-enon in Sufi circles, since cases are recorded of the Prophet allegedlyappearing in the bodily form of other potential saints. One of themore surprising instances is noted in late nineteenth-century Syriaby RashÎdRiÅÁ(d. 1935), a NaqshabandÎin his youth but laterknown for his devastating critiques of much Sufi practice in his day.Near the end of his life he recorded his anxiety as a young man whenpeople began to look at him for signs indicating that he was one ofGod’s friends. Included among these signs were acquaintances’dreams of the Prophet in RiÅÁ’s shape.5But how could such dreamsbe explained without contradicting famousËadÎths to the effect thatthe Prophet appearing in a person’s dream is truly seen by thedreamer? Medieval writers overcame the problem by explainingthat in the dream MuËammad is actually the symbol of the Prophetand that this symbol could take other forms.6The north African SufiMuËammad al-ZawÁwÎ(d.c. 1477 )was one of those who expressed58SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"the opinion that a different form did not necessarily signal a differentidentity. He supported this view with examples from the Prophet’slifetime: of the angel Gabriel taking the form of one of the Prophet’sCompanions, DiËya al-KalbÎ, and even of a male camel.7However,examples of this type seem designed merely to demonstrate the tech-nical possibility of assuming various forms, since they do not appearto have any obvious connection with enhancing the spiritual statusof either DiËya or the camel! Nevertheless, visions of the Prophet inthe form of a revered master do have such a function and the disci-ples’ dreams of NÁbulusÎall confer a high status on him. They serveto give him the credentials to guide others, whether his disciples or awider public, through the interpretation of dreams.Dreams traditionally played an important part in the spiritualtraining of novices, although some brotherhoods were particularlyassociated with the practice of dream interpretation. The Khalwatiyya,MuÑÕafÁal-BakrÎ’sÕarÎqa, is one that is especially known foremphasising guidance through dreams.8The normal expectationwould be that the disciple would relate his dream to the shaykh, asBakrÎand BaytamÁnÎdescribed theirs to NÁbulusÎ, and that theshaykh would then be able to gauge their level of spiritual progressand advise on action to be taken. Parallel to this pattern of dreamanalysis was the analysis of a disciple’s thoughts. In Syria this wasadvocated from the early sixteenth century by Shaykh¿AlÎb.Maym×n, a noted target of NÁbulusÎ’s criticisms for his harshness inpursuit of Islamic reform. He founded aÕarÎqasometimes referredto as the KhawÁÕiriyya, its name being derived fromkhawÁÕir,‘thoughts’.9However, thought interpretation was also subject toimitation by the untrained. A Sufi cobbler is recorded as taking hisfollowers to Ibn¿ArabÎ’s tombwhere, after performing theÆikrritual, “he began to inter-pret thoughts in the manner of Sheikh¿AlÎibn Maym×n,emulating him.” The chronicler concludes: “It would havebeen better not to have done it, since he is an uneducatedman (¿ÁmmÎ), in contrast to¿AlÎibn Maym×n, who was an¿Álim.”10The way in which interpretation of thoughts operates in tandemwith dream interpretation points to their being two branches of thesame process: divine gifts of guidance are being received by thewaking mind in the form of thoughts, and by the sleeping mind inthe form of dreams. The message reaching the dreamer or thinker is59INTERPRETER OF TRUE DREAMS"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"likely to relate to the disciple’s spiritual state in the present or tohow past actions have affected it, although it may also have rele-vance for the future. The disciple is intended to learn from the diag-nosis how to draw nearer to God by righteous behaviour andavoidance of sin. The Sufi dreamer differs from the ordinarymember of the public, who consults a paid dream interpreter topredict whether he will become rich or powerful, or marry or havechildren, or achieve other mundane desires.The dreaming of a saintIn NÁbulusÎ’s case, he both appears as the guide within disciples’dreams and interprets the dreams that they relate to him. He also, attimes, finds benefit in informing them about his own dreams andexplaining them; sometimes he may even acquaint a wider reader-ship with this visionary experience. While the avowed aim is toguide the seeker, the dream narratives and their interpretation giveassurance about NÁbulusÎ’s deep perception of the Unseen, thusboosting his position as an advanced mystic brought near to God.As he developed certainty in his own mind that he had become‘opened’ to the Divine, he believed that as one of ‘God’s friends’ hereceived God’s guidance, either directly or through the Prophet orholy dead, to enable him to realise the significance of his dreams,and did not need other living human interpreters to assist him. Theperiod in retreat is particularly remarkable as a time of ‘opening’,but dreams whose interpretation he hinted at, or more plainlydisclosed, are in evidence throughout his life.Several years before the retreat when he was writing theFatË,NÁbulusÎwas already showing a concern to defend the validity ofthe dream visions experienced by those whom he classes as ‘per-fect believers’. Their faith, he claimed, remained pure during theirsleep and neither sleep nor death could veil the true saint fromGod:As for the states of sleep and death, the perfect believerremains a believer in both states. His faith may actually bepure in sleep and freed from the demands of his humanity,so that he returns to his original nature that God bestowedon him. Therefore, sleeping visions are parts of prophecybecause pure spirituality is contained in them. ... So howdoes faith diminish in sleep, when dreams contain a part ofprophecy? ... And how does it diminish in death, when the60SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"believer does not see his Lord until he dies? Sleep and deathboth perfect faith and do not detract from it.11NÁbulusÎwas here countering a certain traditional Sufi view of sleepas one of the veils between humankind and God.12He appears tohave had more than a theoretical interest in the effect of the sleepingprocess on the faith of saints. It was crucial to the evaluation of hisown visionary life.When¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎwas in his fiftieth year, inMarch 1690, he recorded a dream that he received before setting outon a journey to Jerusalem.13This is a dream that he regarded asexemplary of God’s guidance and favour, a dream that functionsboth in providing indirect moral advice for NÁbulusÎ’s followersand, at the same time, reassuring NÁbulusÎand confirming hisreception of Divine blessings. He recalled the extraordinary events:We had had a vision in the world of dreams a few daysbefore deciding to embark on this journey. [In the dream]we set out from our house together with a company of menand we proceeded until we reached the gate at the end of theBeltmakers’ S×q. Then we found one of the finest Arabhorses offered to us to ride and we rode it and went on ourway. Suddenly we encountered two strong and energeticyoung men; they were well-dressed, magnificently clothedin green and red. Each of them put the palm of his handunder my foot while I was riding and their palms took theplace of the stirrups, each on one side, and I rode the horselike that with the two young men. Then it came to mymind during this visionary incident that this was some-thing of my own devising, and I was afraid that the richwould follow me in doing it and that I was inventing thispractice for the arrogant to ride so that they put their feeton the palms of their servants, until I woke up andwondered at this occurrence. Then, no sooner had fourdays passed, when I decided on this blessed journey, andsuddenly two righteous ecstatics appeared walking infront of me like angels.14NÁbulusÎportrays his decision to travel to Jerusalem and the holyland of Palestine as a blessed event, but he does not at this timepresume that he has a status as a perfected believer. He has hisdoubts about the morality of his dream behaviour and shows his61INTERPRETER OF TRUE DREAMS"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"anxiety in case he is guilty of implementing a bad innovation thatwill be followed by the arrogant rich. He is conscious of his respon-sibility as an exemplar and guide. His concern also serves as awarning to disciples and other readers that they must also guardagainst arrogance. NÁbulusÎfails to understand the dream immedi-ately in a way that might have been expected of him as a saint.Initially he fears that his dream does not come from God, but fromwithin himself and is a product of his own imagination. The mean-ing only becomes plain to him when the dream is fulfilled four dayslater, and even then he does not spell out the interpretation for hisreaders. Instead, he leaves it for the spiritually minded to work outfrom the subsequent events. The two magnificently clothed youngmen are revealed as poor ecstatics (majÁdhÎb), who are clothedmagnificently in the spirit despite their material poverty. NÁbulusÎisuplifted by their presence, not physically, but spiritually. In asymbolic dream of this type it is possible for the Muslim dreaminterpreter to read the dream image as standing for its opposite incertain circumstances: for example, weeping may be interpreted asjoy. In NÁbulusÎ’s dream the richly dressed are poor, but at anotherlevel of understanding they are also rich in spiritual terms.The vision is described as awÁqi¿aor psychic episode that takesplace in ‘the world of dreams’. However, not allwÁqi¿Átform thesubstance of dreams. As Ibn¿ArabÎexplains: ‘Some people see themin a state of sleep, some in a state of annihilation (fanÁ )and others inthe state of wakefulness.’15But, although NÁbulusÎis explicit hereabout thiswÁqi¿aoccurring as a dream, other accounts by him andother authors are not always clear as to whether a vision has beenwitnessed in this way or whether it has occurred during wakeful-ness, or in the condition between sleeping and waking. This isdespite a range of technical vocabulary seeking to clarify differenttypes of visionary experience.16Among the commonest terms,manÁmdefinitely signifies sleep and hence dreaming, whileru’yÁ(from the Arabic root r-a-y )has the primary association with seeingand so may have the meaning of something seen in sleep, a dream,but can also refer to other visions. Both dreams and mysticalwÁqi¿Átare said to occur when one is absent to the world of the senses; bothare contrasted withmukÁshafa, the state of unveiling in which themystic is ‘present’ in the sensory world and where no deceptionwould be thought possible.17Psychic incidents from late in¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎ’s lifeoperate as definite indicators of high spiritual rank. The dream ofIbn¿ArabÎas spiritual father in December 1721 (discussed in62SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 )affirmed his position as successor to the Great Master.Some years later, near the end of his life, NÁbulusÎclaimed to havehad twowÁqi¿Át, which appear to be dreams of a supreme achieve-ment. In October 1728, he saw himself in Mecca looking upon theKa¿ba in a state of ruin, its walls rased to the ground. He rebuilt itwith his own hand in a mysterious way, starting near the BlackStone. In the second dream, in April 1730, just under a year beforehis death, he saw people looking for the key to the Ka¿ba and awoman standing in front of a house; she gave the key to him and hekept it in his belt.18The first dream, in particular, displays a charac-teristic reformer’s distress at the decay of the Islamic community,but also a high degree of confidence that he has solved its problems.Messages from the ‘world of truth’These two dreams from NÁbulusÎ’s last years scarcely require theskill of a perceptive dream interpreter. The images of the ruinedKa¿ba and the search for its key are obvious in their connotations.Many of the dreams recorded in Islamic literature contain a simi-larly thin cloak of symbolism or relay clear messages, where therecan be little room for speculation because of the literal nature ofthe information. The traditional pattern for the completely literaldream is one in which a person appears to the dreamer and deliversa message. The dream may be of someone who is still alive, notuncommonly a saintly ‘perfect believer’ or Sufi guiding shaykh, as inthe case of some of NÁbulusÎ’s disciples’ dreams. Frequently thedream vision is of someone who has died, either in the recent ordistant past, and who may or may not have been personally knownto the dreamer; sometimes the vision is of a prophet or of a deceasedsaint, shaykh, relative, teacher or friend. Dreams of the dead werewidely considered to be of special value, since the deceased dwells inthe ‘world of truth’ (dÁr al-Ëaqq), and so can be the bearer of truthto the world of the living.19While a single message-bearer is themost frequent, a really momentous message may even be carriedby a whole company of distinguished dead, such as the ProphetMuËammad accompanied by groups of Companions, Rightly-Guided Caliphs and perhaps also earlier prophets and major saints.Dreams of this type, containing explicit messages, may serve avariety of purposes: for example, they often function as a vehicle forthe deceased to give information about life after death and how heand others have fared, thus enhancing or damaging their reputa-tions.20Otherwise, they may also provide particular guidance for an63INTERPRETER OF TRUE DREAMS"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"individual or the community, warn or give reassurance, or foretellimportant events. Yet, despite the numerous narratives of literaldreams, relatively few works were devoted specifically to discussionof them. One well-known work that has survived in this category isKitÁb al-manÁm(The Book of the Dream )by Ibn AbÎal-DunyÁ(d.894).21These message dreams have an ancient history in the Near East,where the dreamers receiving divine communications in this waywere usually of royal or priestly status, especially significantmales.22In the Islamic tradition any Muslim may be the recipient ofa literal and true dream message and what matters is the person’spiety rather than his/her position in society. The righteousness of thedreamer serves as the most reliable guarantee of the truth beingconveyed in the dream.23As John Lamoreaux remarks: ‘It mattersnot whether one is a North African shoemaker, an Afghani holywarrior, or a menstruating woman.’24Yet there were attempts bysome medieval Muslim writers to distinguish those who were themost likely to be among the righteous dreamers. The eminentphilosopher Ibn SÎnÁ(d. 1037 )echoes the ancient Near Eastern viewthat the true dream is ‘the special preserve of kings and sages’.25Onthe other hand, SijistÁnÎ, the author of a tenth-century dreammanual, offers his own ranking of the righteous, placing religiousscholars highest among the Muslims as ‘the most truthful’ andrating free men above slaves, men above women, veiled womenabove the unveiled, the rich above the poor and old people above theyoung.26When NÁbulusÎrelates messages from the dead in the ‘world oftruth’, he is obviously aware of inherited beliefs about the signifi-cance of a dreamer’s piety in assessing the reliability of the dream.Yet he does not always seem concerned to evaluate a dreamer’scredibility and his reasons for choosing a particular dream narrativeare not always clear. For example, on visiting the family tombs, heoffers his readers a short biography of his great-grandfather, inwhich he tells of IsmÁ¿Îl al-NÁbulusÎappearing in a dream vision toone of his former students,Êasan al-B×rÎnÎ(d. 1615), best known asthe author of a linguistic commentary on theDÎwÁnof the Sufi poetIbn al-FÁriÅ, on which NÁbulusÎhimself also wrote a famouscommentary.27According to B×rÎnÎ:I saw him after his death in a dream as though he were in areception with a company over whom he was presiding. Itwas as though I were standing and attending that reception.64SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Then he heard me reading some lines of poetry, and he saidto me, ‘By God, ShaykhÊasan, give up poetry. I have notseen any better poetry, but poetry has been of no benefit tome.’ I said to him, ‘My master, what has benefited you?’ Hesaid, ‘Recital of the Qur’Án and prayers in the middle of thenight.’ And, consequently, I gave up poetry.28It seems surprising that NÁbulusÎshould selectÊasan al-B×rÎnÎ’saccount as a record of a true dream message from his great-grandfa-ther. B×rÎnÎwas of humble background from northern Palestineand a ‘new man’ rather than coming from an established scholarlyfamily. He appears to have been on bad terms with¿Abd al-GhanÎ’sgrandfather (the son of IsmÁ¿Îl), whom he disliked because of hisacquisition of posts through inheritance rather than ability. B×rÎnÎearned himself enemies who considered him to be of bad character,a schemer, plagiarist and drug-taker.29Therefore, although he is oneof the‘ulamÁ’and thus technically qualifies as one who might beclassed among the most truthful, he hardly seems to be the piousmodel to receive true vision. So why does NÁbulusÎquote him?Perhaps it is enough for him that B×rÎnÎis a religious scholar, whosework on Ibn al-FÁriÅhe values; perhaps he is satisfied to reproduce areport by one of his great-grandfather’s students who apparentlyrespected him, even if he did not respect NÁbulusÎ’s grandfather. Hemay feel that the information, regardless of its source, reflects wellon his great-grandfather and be more concerned to quote from abiographical notice that is generally favourable. But what is thepurpose of the dream account and how beneficial is it for NÁbulusÎto record?B×rÎnÎ’s dream is of a common type among literal message dreams.The deceased, here the former teacher, offers advice from his knowl-edge in the ‘world of truth’ of what has and has not benefited him andwhat will benefit his living student and, by extension, others in thecommunity. In telling about IsmÁ¿Îl al-NÁbulusÎ’s fate, B×rÎnÎshowsthat it is a good one because he is presiding over a reception and thusappears to have an honoured position. From his own testimony hehas gained this position from his piety in reciting the Qur’Án andperforming prayer, acts with which NÁbulusÎcould feel justifiablypleased and which he could be happy to have recounted. However, itis less obvious that he would be happy with Shaykh IsmÁ¿Îl’s dreamdenunciation of poetry as being of no religious benefit, when in life hehad been noted as a poet himself and¿Abd al-GhanÎ, of course,remained an accomplished poet and admirer of poetry throughout his65INTERPRETER OF TRUE DREAMS"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"life. It seems surprising and unlikely that he would be entirely satisfiedwith a dream communication that could be used to support the argu-ments of critics of poetry, including religious poetry. Among the mostvociferous of such critics in the century after NÁbulusÎ’s death werethe Arabian WahhÁbÎreformers, among whom¿Abd AllÁh, son ofMuËammad b.¿Abd al-WahhÁb, expressed his concern that Muslimsof his day were moved to tears by Sufi poetry, while remainingunmoved by recital of the Qur’Án.30B×rÎnÎ’s point is, presumably,that, although IsmÁ¿Îl al-NÁbulusÎhad been a poet and saw value inpoetry while alive, after death he received true knowledge on thesubject and this led him to reject his former beliefs. Therefore, it is theteaching of the dream, critical of poetry, that is being promoted ascontaining a more enlightened message, superseding any teachingfrom his lifetime. The dream does appear to advance the pious repu-tation of the NÁbulusÎs, but is otherwise hardly supportive of¿Abd al-GhanÎ’s usual opinions on poetry.In certain cases, literal dream messages may be utilised as a meansof trying to settle scholarly disputes, notably over Qur’Ánic read-ings,ÊadÎthand their transmission, as well as juristic and theolog-ical issues.31NÁbulusÎhas been recognised as contributing to thediscussion about the validity ofËadÎths transmitted in dreams. Hisgeneral position was to endorse the view that any suchËadÎthmustbe in conformity with theSharÎ¿aand could not introduce innova-tions into the faith. Subject to this caveat, he was prepared to recog-nise the permissibility of grantingijÁzasin dreams forËadÎthsthatsupport similar canonicalËadÎths. The issue was of special impor-tance when the Prophet himself delivered the instructions directly tothe dreamer, rather than the newËadÎthbeing recounted by anintermediary. In a treatise devoted to the subject, NÁbulusÎrecords adream where the Prophet gave orders to a man to break theRamaÅÁn fast; the dream vision of the Prophet is accepted asauthentic, but not the legality of acting on it and breaking the fast.32Elsewhere, during travels down the Syrian coast in 1693, NÁbulusÎrecalled a dream experience related to him by the ShÁfi¿ÎmuftÎofSidon. ThemuftÎtold him how three years previously the Prophethad appeared to him in a dream and told him, ‘Live as you wish, foryou will die. Love whom you wish, for you will depart. Do as youwish, for you will be rewarded.’33NÁbulusÎconfirms that he hasheard theËadÎthsomewhere else, but does not specify where orrecommend any particular action in regard to it. It is quite a prob-lematic example, since it could be seen as lending itself to anantinomian interpretation. Although it would be unlikely to pose66SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"special difficulties for the dreamer in this instance, as a jurist respon-sible for upholding theSharÎ¿a, such a dream could have subversivepotential for undermining the law if it were actively followed.Presumably the dream is being related here as an example of divinefavour to themuftÎas dreamer and is not functioning to authenti-cate theËadÎthfor the community.34Dreaming in symbols, predicting the futureThe dreams so far discussed share with much Islamic oneiric litera-ture a concern with moral guidance and instruction, with gainingknowledge from beyond the mundane, sensory world about the fateof the deceased, with perceiving God’s blessings on human beings andwith enabling them to recognise the saints in their midst. AlthoughNÁbulusÎ’s dream of his departure for Jerusalem contains a predictiveelement, it seems more significant as a sign of divine favour and fordeepening his spiritual insight than for simply foretelling that thejourney will take place. Yet, many dreams were considered to havethe primary purpose of relating the future of the dreamer or of others,and these dreams can properly be considered the subject matter ofoneirocriticism (or oneiromancy as it may alternatively be termed),the business of divination through dreams.35The messages of suchpredictive dreams were seldom presented literally, but the profes-sional oneirocritic or oneiromancer would be expected to decipher aseries of symbolic images in order to disclose the true meaningcontained in them. To aid in this task, dream manuals were compiled,giving lists of common symbols and their possible meanings in arange of different circumstances. It was during the time of his longretreat, after five years of seclusion and visionary experience, that¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎcompiled an oneirocritical treatise of thistype,Ta¿ÕÎr al-anÁmfÎta¿bÎr al-manÁm(The Perfuming of Human-kind through the Interpretation of Dreams), finished in 1685. TheTa¿ÕÎrwas to become NÁbulusÎ’s most popular work. Its widecirculation in manuscript was superseded by a far wider circulationin print after its first publication in Cairo in 1858. Valerie Hoffmanremarks that the ‘rich literature on dream interpretation in Islamperhaps reached its apogee’36in NÁbulusÎ’s work and John Lamoreauxaffirms that it is ‘one of the truly classic dream manuals’ and is oneof two works that by the second half of the nineteenth century ‘hadbecome the primary representatives of the Muslim tradition ofdream interpretation’.37The work attracted Western scholarly atten-tion from early in the twentieth century.3867INTERPRETER OF TRUE DREAMS"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"NÁbulusÎ’s famous book of dreams was the fruit of a long tradi-tion of Arab and Islamic dream interpretation (ta¿bÎr). Commentingon medieval Arab lexicographers’ views on the meaning ofta¿bÎr,Lamoreaux notes some of their less likely explanations beforeconcluding:A more probable explanation of the word’s usage wouldtake it in its etymological sense. The act ofta¿bÎris the act of‘making the dream pass’ from one state to another. Itentails the ‘transferring’ of the dream from its symbol to itsmeaning, from the sign to the signified. We might even callthis process an act of ‘translating’ the dream, a usage paral-leled in Syriac, where the causative form of the same root(a¿bar )is used in expressions such asa¿bar men leshÏnÏ‘ebrÏyÏl-yawnÏyÏ(‘he translated from Hebrew intoGreek’).39The roots ofta¿bÎrmay well lie in ancient Near Eastern thought onthe subject and certainly have a strong foundation in the Greek onei-romancy of late antiquity.40However, Muslim practitioners of theart look consciously to the models for dreamers and oneirocriticsprovided by the prophets affirmed in the Qur’Án.The most familiar Qur’Ánic connection of dream interpretationwith prophecy is in the case of the Prophet Joseph, to whom Godgives the miraculous ability to interpret dreams. When Joseph tellshis father Jacob of his dream of eleven planets, the sun and moonbowing down before him, Jacob assures his son: ‘So will your Lordchoose you and teach you to interpret dreams’ (s×ra 1, v. 6). Theword rendered as ‘dreams’ isaËÁdÎth, for which a possible interpre-tation suggested is ‘events’, later coming to signify ‘predictions’.41Joseph not only comprehends his own dreaming, but also thedreams of others: of his prison companions (s×ra 12, v. 36 )and ofthe Pharaoh (s×ra 12, v. 43), whose famous dream of seven fat andseven lean cattle, seven green and seven dry ears of corn is inter-preted as depicting the years of plenty followed by famine. Joseph’sprophetic superiority is highlighted by his extraordinary insight intowhat seemed to the Pharaoh’s Egyptian councillors to be merely‘confused dreams’ (aÅghÁth aËlÁm), incapable of being deciphered,a category to which many dreams would be assigned by Musliminterpreters.Prophet MuËammad was similarly credited with inspired knowl-edge of the real meaning of dreams, including his own, as, for68SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"example, on the eve of the battle of UËud (March 625), fought onand in the vicinity of the hill of UËud outside Medina and viewed atbest as an indecisive encounter between the Muslims and theirMeccan opponents, at worst as a defeat for the burgeoning Islamiccommunity. The Prophet told his companions his dream: he sawhimself wearing a strong breast-plate, but his sword was cracked.There were cows being slaughtered and a ram that he was driving infront of him. He interpreted his dream to mean that the strongbreast-plate was Medina and the cracked sword a sign that hewould be wounded in battle; the cows represented the Muslimmartyrs about to die at UËud and the ram was the leader of theMuslim army, the Prophet’s uncleÊamza, who was to be the mostfamous martyr of this battle.42Muslim dream interpreters clearly felt the need to boost theircredentials by promoting themselves as the heirs of exemplaryprophetic oneirocritics. Nevertheless, a considerable body of oneiro-critics, at least from the early eleventh century up to NÁbulusÎhimself,show a reliance on their pre-Islamic, non-prophetic precursors fortheir analysis of dream symbols. Geert van Gelder has noted typicalaspects of their approach to the task:A general characteristic of the Arabic dream-books is thatalmost anything can mean nearly everything, a result partlyof the compilatory nature of these books and also of theinventiveness of the contributors who exploited the inter-pretive potential of metonymy, metaphor and paronomasiaor false etymology, which are their favorite tools, together,of course, with Qur’Ánic and other allusions.43Sometimes a symbol may offer the interpreter an opportunity tocombine these devices, as when NÁbulusÎtreats the dream image of acrown (tÁj )as a metaphorical representation of ‘knowledge’ and ‘theQur’Án’ and also a metonym for a ‘king’.44Some of these ‘favoritetools’ have a long history in divination from dreams in ancient Egyptand Mesopotamia. Notably, the attempt to provide etymologicalexplanations, however improbably contrived, is to be seen in theAssyrian Dream-Bookfrom the great library of Assurbanipal. Forexample, in a section on eating various types of bird, it is related ofthe dreamer: ‘If he eats a raven: income will come [in].’45The words‘raven’ (aribu )and ‘income’ (irbu )are given a pseudo-linguistic rela-tionship in an effort to justify the predicted outcome of an unlikelydream. However, income being acquired or lost is a common69INTERPRETER OF TRUE DREAMS"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"prediction in both the Assyrian and later Islamic dream manuals ofsymbolic dreams. Other common predictions are, as might beexpected, of length of life, fortune, offspring and social status. Acommon feature in both Assyrian and Islamic oneirocriticism is forthe prediction to be affected by the dreamer’s action, such as eating,being given, carrying or wearing the symbol seen in the dream. Meta-morphosis, in which the dreamer turns into the symbol, is also sharedby both sets of interpreters. Thus theAssyrianDream-Bookreads: ‘Ifa man turns into a lion: lo[sses and ]. ... If a man turns into a do[gand (? ):] and the countries will ... against him; the palace will seedistress and his crime/punishment [will be heavy(?)].’46NÁbulusÎ,following other Muslim interpreters, not infrequently discusses suchchanges of shape and their significance. The way in which the inter-pretation is structured is also similar in the two traditions. The usualpattern is a protasis, for example ‘If a man wears such-and-such,’followed by the apodosis, ‘Such-and-such will happen.’ This basicstructure and method appear to undergo remarkably little changethrough to NÁbulusÎ’s compilation in the 1680s, although directlinks to the ancient tradition remain elusive.More tangible is the debt to the Greek tradition and especially totheOneirocriticaof Artemidorus of Daldis from the second centuryCE, the only Greek dream manual from this period still extant in full.An adapted Arabic version of it became available in the ninthcentury and is usually attributed to the Nestorian Christian physi-cianÊunayn b. IsËÁq (d. 877).47The translator saw fit to alter thetext in places where Artemidorus’s polytheistic beliefs would havecaused offence to monotheist readers, whether Muslim, Christian orJewish. Thus references to the gods of the Greek pantheon are trans-muted into mentions of AllÁh or of His angels, and pagan sacrificialrituals are changed into Muslim ones, such as those of‘Ídal-AÅËÁ.48However, the diagnosis by Artemidorus of many dream imagesproved non-problematic and could be incorporated freely into theArabic dream-books with more or less acknowledgement. Whereparticular explanations were not pillaged intact, Muslim oneiro-critics used Artemidorus’s method of seeking out supposed similari-ties between symbols seen in the dream and whatever they might bethought to signify. An example of Artemidorus’s reasoning is asfollows: ‘Bugs are symbols of cares and anxieties. For bugs, likeanxieties, also keep people awake at night.’49This type of use ofanalogy, along with puns and other forms of wordplay, was readilyextended by Arab writers to fit new Islamic symbols. They wouldhave presented few difficulties forNÁbulusÎ, himself a skilled70SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"rhetorician; and perhaps he would have seen in them a furtherincentive to take an interest in traditional oneirocritical writings inaddition to his obvious concern to help others understand the signif-icance of any divine communications through dreams.The Muslim interpreters varied in their readiness to accept thecontribution of Artemidorus and other non-Muslim sources. At oneend of the spectrum of views, the eleventh-century MÁlikÎjuristQayrawÁnÎclaimed reliance on the traditional material of the earlyIslamic community and professed to ignore the ancient pagan heri-tage.50At the other extreme end, the philosopher Ibn SÎnÁopenlyexpressed his preference for Greek interpretation and his use of theOneirocritica, although he added some material culled from theopinions of the Arabs.51NÁbulusÎfollows the middle path, set bythose interpreters who draw on both Muslim and non-Muslimauthorities without clearly privileging Arabic Islamic sources overothers. The major influence on him in adopting this approach is thefamous manual composed by DÎnawarÎfor Caliph al-QÁdir bi’llÁh(r. 991–1031), a massive compilation completed in 1008 and listedin theTa¿ÕÎras one of NÁbulusÎ’s sources.52DÎnawarÎadmitteddrawing on ancient Near Eastern and Indian material, as well as onArtemidorus and on Christian and Jewish authorities in addition toMuslim views. However, NÁbulusÎwas not alone among laterwriters in recording his debt to DÎnawarÎ, while remaining vagueabout, and apparently uninterested in, the origins of much of theolder author’s information. He is more inclined to refer to views of‘the ancients’ or ‘the unbelievers’ rather than to specific writings.53Yet his awareness of an infidel source of knowledge that he relaysdoes not appear to trouble him unduly and, for the most part, hemakes no distinction between Islamic and non-Islamic dreaminterpretation.The Perfuming of HumankindThere is very little originality in NÁbulusÎ’sThe Perfuming ofHumankindnor does he claim any. It is perhaps ironic that his best-known book contains so little of himself, but actually represents thelatest contribution to a conservative tradition. The Islamiconeirocritical treatises conform to a standard pattern and it wouldnot really have been feasible for NÁbulusÎto be accepted as anauthority within the genre, had he departed from the conventionalcontent of such works. Yet he does nothing to satisfy us as to hisdeeper motivation in authoring for popular use a book that depends71INTERPRETER OF TRUE DREAMS"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"on old non-Sufi, and even non-Islamic, methods of interpretation. Itremains something of a mystery as to why he should do so at a timewhen he is so convinced of being ‘opened’ to the Divine in his owndreams and visions, and thus able to have his own mystical insightsto guide him to diagnose others’ experiences. Why should he thenwish to cull second-hand information to pass on for the wider publicto consult? Perhaps he is conscious that he can only give direct helpto a limited number of initiates, but feels some commitment to assistthe general reader in making sense of dreams without access to aspiritual guide. Presumably he does not see too serious an incompat-ibility between a mystical means of divination and inheritedwisdom. In any case, his personal standing as a visionary, andindeed a people’s saint, is likely to have gained respect for his much-consulted compilation.In substance theTa¿ÕÎrdiffers hardly at all from earlier dreammanuals, but there is an obvious difference in organisation. In olderworks the lists of dream symbols would commonly be groupedtogether in a descending hierarchical order, typically God, then Hisprophets, angels, early Muslims and symbols associated with Islamsuch as Qur’Ánics×rasand Pillars, various humans, animals, plants,inanimate beings and natural phenomena. However, NÁbulusÎrealised that this was not the most convenient, user-friendly formfor reference and proposed instead an encyclopaedia-style arrange-ment. He explains:I wanted to compile a book on this subject that would beorganised according to the letters of the alphabet in order tomake it easy for everyone to have ready access to it. I saw abook compiled in this manner by Ibn GhannÁm – may Godhave mercy on him. He had followed this methodthroughout his work, but it was a brief treatment thatwould not quench the thirst of those desirous of under-standing.54Thus Ibn GhannÁm (d. 1275 or 1294 )appears to have been the firstto compose an encyclopaedia of dreams, of which manuscriptssurvive under several titles.55However, his book seems compara-tively little known and it is NÁbulusÎwho popularises theencyclopaedic ‘key to dreams’.In the introductory section to theTa¿ÕÎr,NÁbulusÎfollows hispredecessors in expounding dream theory, presenting a typology ofdreams and underlining general principles to be adhered to in order72SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"to enable the interpreter and the dreamer to achieve a successfulanalysis. In discussing the predisposition of dreamers to certainkinds of dreams, he repeats the ideas of Galen (without referring tohim by name )regarding the influence of the four humours on thedreaming process. If black bile were predominant in the dreamer’sconstitution, NÁbulusÎobserves that he would then see misfortunes,blackness and horrors in the dream; if yellow bile, he would see fire,lights and blood; if phlegm, he would see whiteness, waters, riversand waves; and, if blood, he would see drink, winds and stringedand wind instruments.56Absorbing a combination of Greek andIslamic rationale for the causes of dreams, NÁbulusÎnotes variousother explanations of dream types. For example, useless and indeci-pherable dreams are identified predictably as originating from Satan;he relates aËadÎthin which a man told the Prophet of a dream inwhich his head was cut off and he was following it, the devilish stuffof nightmares. Other dreams are diagnosed as reflecting normalhuman needs, as when the hungry man dreams of eating. Still othersare the product of worries and desires or have natural physiologicalcauses, such as the wet dreams of adolescence. Dreams may also beproduced by outside intervention in the dreamer’s life and can be thework of sorcerers.57All these varieties are not the concern of theoneirocritic, although they might conceivably be relevant to physi-cians or to spiritual guides. Neither are literal ‘true dreams’ of rele-vance here, but only those that contain symbolic truth.NÁbulusÎlays down stringent requirements for the dream inter-preter. It is not a role that can be played by anyone who has accessto a reference book of dream symbols, but makes considerabledemands, both in terms of learning and of personality, and necessi-tates sensitivity and discernment: ‘He is to conceal people’s faults,listen to the question in full, distinguish between the noble andhumble, go slowly and not hurry in giving his answer.’58He adds evenmore cautionary advice. The interpreter is expected to be a scholar ofthe Qur’Án andÊadÎth, but also be familiar with popular culture andthe speech of ordinary people. He should avoid interpreting dreamsat times when people have religious duties to perform and should takepains to explain the dreams in a way appropriate to the dreamer’sposition in society, religion and ethnicity.How can one know that a dream is indeed true? NÁbulusÎnotescertain signs of truth and gives examples of categories of humansand other creatures that are to be believed, if they speak in a dream:a dead family member, an infant (who does not know how to lie),animals and birds, but not liars such as astrologers and soothsayers.73INTERPRETER OF TRUE DREAMS"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"He also cautions against making assumptions based on an apparentmeaning, since the real meaning could actually be the opposite.Weeping might indicate joy and laughter could be a sign of misery.The body of the text, with its lists of dream symbols in alphabet-ical order, reveals a number of factors to be taken into considerationin interpreting. Not only are the images affected by the identity ofthe dreamer, his or her age, gender, character, social status, state ofhealth or wealth, but they are also affected by his or her actions andthe actions of persons and other beings represented in the dream.Further effects on the interpretation will come from visions of thetime and place of the dream events and any other variable character-istics, such as the quantity; for example, if the dream symbol issnow, the meaning may be determined by whether it is a light scat-tering or deep snowdrifts.While all these factors may influence the reading of the dream,there are certain common meanings that recur. These include pre-dictions about good fortune or calamities, power or humiliation,wealth or poverty, health or illness, fertility or barrenness, faith orunbelief, attacks of enemies or friendship and love, and receivingmercy or punishment. Frequent actors are God, rulers, relatives,friends and enemies. It can be seen from the repertoire of symbolsand their meanings that the resulting interpretations are designed toaddress the usual human concerns and in this they have much incommon with the popular astrologers, whom NÁbulusÎcondemnsas liars. Although symbolism could be used in a way suited to thespiritually elect, it can, and generally does, meet the needs of the‘veiled’ masses.An encyclopaedia of God’s signsNÁbulusÎ’s encyclopaedia of God’s signs is certainly easy to use, butthe new arrangement may affect the reader’s perception of thedream symbols. In the earlier dream manuals the hierarchical listingpreserves the sense of special significance attached to dreams ofGod, holy persons and symbols of Islam. This sense is lost when thereader looks up the desired item in an alphabetical list and finds, forexample, that ‘AllÁh’ is immediately followed by ‘the fat tail of aewe’ (alyat al-shÁt )and ‘MuËammad’ by ‘a camel-borne litter’(muËmal). The effect could be to make a routine practice out ofconsulting a ‘key to dreams’ where the images of God and Hisprophets become devalued, placed next to trivial and mundaneobjects. On the other hand, it is possible for the reader to discover74SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"that even the everyday dream of a sheep’s tail can be a prediction of‘abundant grace’ or ‘beneficial knowledge’.59The traditionalprocess of searching for underlying similarities enables the inter-preter to make a connection between the valued fatty meat andGod’s blessings in the form of grace or knowledge. However, adream of God may not in every instance be a positive sign of Divinefavour, but may indicate the very opposite or relate to ordinaryworldly matters. The dreamer who flees from God is not only theworshipper who will abandon prayer, but ‘if he has a father, he willbe disrespectful to him, and, if he is a slave, he will run away andescape from his master’.60By an allegorical reading, the relationshipbetween God and the human being is understood to refer to earthlyhuman relationships where God represents the father or masterfigure.There are a number of factors that determine whether the visionof God, or sometimes hearing His voice with or without a vision,can be interpreted as an augury of good. Included among thesefactors is the state of the dreamer’s heart. NÁbulusÎasserts near thebeginning of the entry on ‘AllÁh’:It is a good indication for one who sees Him in His mightand splendour and in all His incomparability. This is apropitious sign for his life in this world, and an assurance ofhis faith in the next. If he sees Him in a different manner,the vision of God shows the evil of his heart, especially if Hedoes not speak to him.61He later remarks:Whoever sees that God speaks to him and he is able to lookat Him, he is one on whom God will have mercy and towhom He will grant grace. Whoever sees that he looks atGod, he will behold Him in the after-life, and whoever seesthat he stays with Him, he will obtain His mercy andachieve martyrdom, if he desires it, and realise whatever hehopes for in this life and the next. Whoever sees that Godembraces him or kisses him or kisses one of his limbs, hewill obtain the reward that he desires.62These remarks endorse the view that it is possible for the sincerebeliever to experience a true dream of God, actualised with Hisattributes of might and splendour and without trace of75INTERPRETER OF TRUE DREAMS"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"anthropomorphism, and that this dream may contain valid visual,aural and tangible elements. It thus supports the authenticity andblessed nature of the dreams of many of those brought near to God.An example illustrative of several auspicious features in a vision ofGod is recounted by R×zbihÁn BaqlÎ(d. 1209), celebrated PersianSufi of Shiraz:I saw God manifest to me as though he were giving condo-lences. Then he came to me, and with him were all theprophets, messengers, angels and saints, and he took me bythe hand and brought me to the world of majesty andbeauty, in a presence with gardens and happiness.63R×zbihÁn further relates that God spoke to him, saying that this washow his death would be. The oneirocritic would note as positivethat the mystic both saw and heard God, the form in which God wasmanifested, God’s action in taking him by the hand, and the pres-ence of prophets, angels and saints. However, in keeping with thegenre of oneirocritical writing, NÁbulusÎmentions no records of hispersonal experiences. Had he wished, he could surely have providednumerous examples, including his own visions from this period inhis life, but they are deliberately not disclosed to those unpreparedto comprehend them.A veil separating the dreamer from God may or may not havenegative implications. NÁbulusÎnotes that it may be a sign of inno-vation (bid¿a )and error and indeed an ill omen that the dreamer willcommit grave sins. Yet later in the entry inconsistent statementsappear to have been inserted to the effect that it is a sign of thesoundness of the dreamer’s faith if he hears God speak to him onlyfrom behind a veil and does not see Him. If he sees God, there is afault in his religious belief, a view presumably reflecting the Sunnidogma that God will be seen only in the afterlife. NÁbulusÎappearsto have pieced these comments into the interpretation here, drawingdirectly from older works that are not necessarily in line with hisown opinions.64He also borrows the concept of symbols beingreciprocal so that if, for example, the dreamer sees that God isdispleased with him, this informs him of his parents’ displeasure,but, if he sees that his parents are displeased, this actually signifiesGod’s displeasure. Similarly, he adopts the idea that a dreamer maysee an action or situation portending certain consequences or hemay see the consequences; therefore, he writes: ‘Whoever sees thatGod is angry with him, will fall from a high position and, if he were76SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"to see that he fell from a wall or sky or mountain, that would showGod’s anger with him.’65Metamorphosis of the dreamer into the dream image has beennoted as frequently analysed even in ancient Assyria, but it is clearlya more sensitive issue when the image is of God. NÁbulusÎdoes notexpand on the topic, but merely says, ‘Whoever sees as if he becomesthe Real (al-Êaqq )– may He be praised and exalted – will be guidedto the straight path.’66The reader may sense uncomfortable echoesofÊallÁj’s famous exclamation, ‘AnÁal-Êaqq(I am the Real)’, andnote the risks of confusion with the dangerous heresy of belief inËul×l, God’s indwelling in a human, which NÁbulusÎhad been soanxious to reject in theFatË. The terse statement here can serve as areminder that such a dream metamorphosis is purely symbolic and asign of Divine guidance free of any hint of blasphemy.Dreams of mosques, shrines and holy citiesImages of certain kinds of places or of specific places may be of greatconsequence in a dream. However, their exact significance maydepend on a number of variables. Thus NÁbulusÎwrites of a dreamimage of God being seen in a place:As for a theophany occurring in a particular place, thissometimes shows that it will be rebuilt, if it is in ruins, orthat it will be ruined, if its building is standing. If the peopleof that place are wrongdoers, revenge will be taken onthem. If they are wronged, they will obtain justice. Some-times the vision of Him points to a specified place having agreat king or a tyrant taking control of it or a valued scholaror physician coming to that place.67The argument proceeds by the pairing of opposites and by easilydeciphered allegory. The variables affecting the prediction here arethe current state of the place and the character of the inhabitants.Visions related to a particular location could commonly be cited as away of justifying Divine favour allegedly shown to it and, therefore,its suitability as a centre of rule or learning or as a place ofpilgrimage. Not surprisingly, reports of theophanies or, morecommonly, dreams of prophets, saints and early Islamic figuresoccur in the literature on the merits (faÅÁ’il )of various cities andregions, and they appear constantly in claims intended to promoteacceptance of a certain shrine or holy grave as against rival sites.77INTERPRETER OF TRUE DREAMS"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Dreaming of places is often symbolic of persons associated withthem. Therefore, to dream of a mosque is often to dream of‘ulamÁ’and their actions or of matters related to the dreamer’s dealings withthem.68To dream of specific mosques, such as the AqÑÁMosque inJerusalem or the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, may indicatetravel to them or it may represent ‘ulamÁ’or rulers in their vicinity.69In the same way, a dream of a shrine (qubba )may signify its saintlyoccupant and it may even be a sign that the dreamer is marked outfor sainthood.70This entry is one of very few in theTa¿ÕÎrin whichNÁbulusÎrelates his interpretation of an actual dream where heacted as a consultant interpreter. Even so, he does not disclose theidentities of his clients, but simply records:A man told me: ‘Yesterday I saw a shrine building whichfour men were wanting to demolish and they demolishedit.’ I said to him: ‘An¿Álimwill die and his four descendantswill be destroyed by certain of them defeating others.’ It isgenerally agreed that the next day an¿Álimfrom a villagenear Damascus died – may God have mercy on him.71NÁbulusÎdoes not tell us whether the second part of his predic-tion came true. Was there a family dispute after the¿Álim’sdeath?If so, what was it about? Perhaps it concerned inheritance or succes-sion to a teaching post or appointment to an official role in aÕarÎqabranch. Whatever may have been the case, NÁbulusÎdoes not seeminterested in the details, but only in demonstrating his own powersas an interpreter of dreams. Even though he was spending much ofhis time in seclusion at his house during this period, he was nottotally isolated from contact with the community and may have hadinsider information. However, he wished to present himself assomeone who had miraculous insight rather than knowledgeacquired by conventional means.To dream of large and inhabited places, especially cities, is gener-ally considered a positive sign in the Arabic oneirocritical tradition,whereas to dream of places in ruins and of villages is usually nega-tive. Geert van Gelder remarks that ‘in the case of the town ingeneral the oneirocritics seem to agree: it stands, first of all, forprotection and safety. Very often this notion is accompanied byothers such as civilization, learning and authority; or those whopossess these things: scholars and rulers.’72Again, there is this linkbetween places and persons: dreaming of entering a ruined city maypoint to a dearth of‘ulamÁ’or the death or injustice of the ruler,78SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"while a thriving city is one with many scholars.73In his relativelylong entry on the city (madÎna),NÁbulusÎalso lists the meaning ofvisions of particular cities and regions, not all of them appearing inearlier oneirocritics’ lists.74A number augur well: for example, todream of being in NÁbulusÎ’s home town of Damascus is a sign thatGod will bestow His blessing and grace on the dreamer.75However,a few are more ambiguous or even negative. In some cases deductionby false etymology may provide an explanation for an interpreta-tion, but in other cases NÁbulusÎmay simply be expressing popularviews or his own feelings about particular places. When he writesthat one who dreams of Mount Hermon, the Jordan and LakeTiberias can expect to travel or perhaps to be humiliated, he may begiving voice to contemporary fears because these areas of southernSyria and northern Palestine were wild and quite dangerous fortravellers in his day.76Obvious religious hostility is apparent ininterpreting a dream of Christian Europe as indicating blindness ofheart and pleasure-seeking.77Dislike of ShÎ¿ism, perhaps mixed withracial prejudice, seems to be present in the pronouncement that todream of being in Persia indicates slander and insolence.78Thetensions in Damascus between the local Sunni population andPersian pilgrims joining theËajjcaravan have already been noted.79The expectation might then be that dreams of the Holy Cities ofArabia are likely to be propitious. NÁbulusÎdevotes a separate shortentry to Medina and interprets the image entirely in positive termsas a sign of the dreamer repenting and being forgiven, obtainingmercy, being freed from care and enjoying a good life.80However, adream of Mecca yields a greater variety of interpretations. Whilethey are generally beneficial to the dreamer, they are not alwaysindicative of a good spiritual state. This is because the interpretationmay also depend on the dreamer’s character. A vision of Mecca inruins may be a sign of guilt, showing the dreamer’s neglect ofprayer.81Despite the connection of the city with theËajj, dreamingof Mecca is read only as a sign that the dreamer will become apilgrim, if he actually sees that he is on the road to Mecca. Theoneirocritic can predict quite different outcomes by making linksbetween Mecca and various events in the formative period ofIslamic history, and he sometimes employs allegory to extend thereading to secular matters. Thus, if the dreamer is a slave, the visionmay mean that he will be freed ‘because God – may He be exalted –will release him from his oppressors’; the interpreter here finds aconnection between Mecca and the oppression of the Prophet’sfollowers, including slaves, before the emigration to Medina, and79INTERPRETER OF TRUE DREAMS"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"also associates the Holy City and liberation with the coming ofIslam. In addition, there may be other non-religious connotations ofseeing Mecca in the dream, such as gaining a high position from thesultan, God standing in the place of the ruler and his house in theplace of the palace.Dreams of prophets and caliphs, of scorpions and spidersA rich variety of dream symbols do in fact indicate people, whiledreams of people may indicate themselves or something entirelydifferent. They are often subjected to allegorical interpretation sothat a dream of a teacher actually represents a sultan, while ateacher of young boys may stand for a prince or even a hunter andseller of sparrows.82Dreams of persons by occupation are commonin Islamic dream manuals and NÁbulusÎfollows the line of hispredecessors in his discussion of them, including the dream inter-preter, whose image is understood as a sign connected with solvingproblems and acquiring knowledge.83There are also dreams ofpeople that are viewed as relating to the dreamer’s own material ormoral condition. NÁbulusÎremarks that, when someone dreams of aperson he does not know in a state of wakefulness, this can be God’sway of giving the dreamer an insight into himself and informing himas to whether his actions are good or bad.84The dream in this caseserves as a means of ethical guidance.The only persons to be identified by name in theTa¿ÕÎrareprophets, the four rightly-guided caliphs and women of the Prophet’shousehold. It is a mark of the highly conservative nature of theoneirocritical tradition that no specific individuals are mentionedafter the first generation of Muslims. It is remarkable that no laterrulers, scholars or, indeed, Sufis figure in the lists of symbols, noteven the most famous of the saints whose names occur regularly inthe literature of mystical experience. In general, dreams of theprophets and early Muslims are considered to be auspicious, but thisis more likely to be the case if the dreamer is of good character. Thusa dream of prophets can be understood as a prediction of salvationfor the pious, while a vision of the Prophet MuËammad’s Compan-ions is said to be a sign of belief in them and of following theirsunna; they are symbolic of love and brotherhood, happiness andsecurity from enmity and envy.85In analysing dreams of particular prophets and caliphs, theoneirocritic is concerned to identify their special qualities and relatethese and their life events to the dreamer’s life and character. With80SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"regard to the early caliphs, the interpretation has a conventionalSunni slant. Caliphs Ab×Bakr and¿Umar are held up as idealmodels, dreams of them being largely positive signs and evidence ofa good spiritual state; the image of Ab×Bakr is understood as a signof following the truth, while that of¿Umar is taken to mean successand achievement in the world combined with service to religionand an ascetic lifestyle.86The visions of Caliphs¿UthmÁn and¿AlÎmay also have a beneficent aspect, the symbol of¿UthmÁn indicatinga devotion to learning and total forsaking of this world, and a dreamof¿AlÎpointing to similar qualities in the dreamer and possiblevictory over enemies.87However, they can also be a reminder ofcorruption and strife entering the Islamic community. With refer-ence to¿UthmÁn, the following note of caution is sounded:If he sees him exchanging and selling, the dreamer is oneof the students of this world. He adorns himself withknowledge and earns his living by it, but he is not a realscholar. If he sees¿UthmÁn killed in his house, then hecurses the family of the Prophet (PBUH )and he feels no lovefor them. One who sees him in the city or market will beranked with the martyrs and righteous and will acquireknowledge, but one who sees him surrounded in his househas wronged a great scholar.88Similarly, the vision of¿AlÎcould also be an ill omen, especially if itinvolved a metamorphosis:If he (the dreamer )sees that he changes into the caliph, thenit will not be fortunate for him, unless he is one of thosewho should be caliph. If he is not, he will be humbled andsee people rise above him who were in his service and hisenemies will curse him.89People may also be represented in theTa¿ÕÎrand earlier dream-books by a wide array of other creatures. Animals, birds and insectsmay be symbols of a person of a certain social standing, religion,ethnic origin, occupation or character. Sometimes the same symbolmay stand for very different categories of people: for example, a bullor ox (thawr )may be a tribal leader or a workman, while a donkeymay be a slave, a boy or a wife.90The interpreter is looking for char-acteristics that his community will perceive as shared between thecreature and the person symbolised. It is not difficult to see such81INTERPRETER OF TRUE DREAMS"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"connections being made between a scorpion and a slanderer orenemy who is a relative, nor does it take much imagination to tracethe link between a spider and a weaver, or even ‘an accursed womanwho flees from her husband’s bed!’91But the view that ‘almostanything can mean nearly everything’ appears to be confirmed byNÁbulusÎ’s statement that ‘if he (the dreamer )sees the spider fallingfrom the roof, it is a sign of heavy rain’.92Given that NÁbulusÎis the compiler of a great deal of traditionallore in theTa¿ÕÎr, to what extent did he share in the religious, racialand class prejudices and misogynistic outlook that he purveys? Theolder manuals contain much material that is derogatory towardsChristians and Jews, Persians and other non-Arabs, women,working-class men and slaves. NÁbulusÎcould have cut this out, butgenerally chose not to do so. Consequently, he still writes, forinstance, that a Jewish woman may appear in the symbolic dreamform of a female rat.93Yet NÁbulusÎ, from the evidence of his behaviour and other writ-ings, does not emerge as an obviously narrow-minded woman-hater, racist, snob and bigot. He maintains good relations withChristians in his homeland, corresponding warmly in later life withthe Patriarch of Antioch and enjoying the company of monks atBethlehem during his travels in Palestine.94His tolerant attituderegarding the treatment of Jews and Christians is plain, for examplein his treatise on their religious status (1692 )and as early as theFatË(1674).95When he expresses hostility, it is on political rather thanreligious grounds, notably in criticisms of Serbian Christians as athreat to the Ottoman Islamic state.96As for racial prejudices,NÁbulusÎis obviously proud to be Arab, but, where he displaysanger towards any other race, it is usually towards certain Turksassociated with the anti-SufiÜÁÅÎzÁdelÎs. It is not towards Turks ingeneral, a number being included among his disciples and friends.97Moreover, class-conscious snobbery is deplorable in his eyes, shownin his high esteem of the poor ecstatics and concern with a pure spir-itual state rather than worldly social status. Finally, there seems nostrong reason to accuse¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎof misogyny,even if it were to be admitted that he spent more time in thecompany of like-minded men than of women and was probablycontent with this arrangement. It would hardly be unusual in theDamascene society of his day, however enemies might interpret it.The sources are naturally reticent, but NÁbulusÎ’s high regard for hismother is acknowledged, as well as his loving fatherly relationshipwith his daughters. The one event that could have affected his82SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"outlook at the time of writing theTa¿ÕÎrwas his divorce from hisfirst wife in the year of its completion.However, it remains unlikely that NÁbulusÎseriously adopted anumber of the views inherited by him from a thoroughly conserva-tive tradition. More probably he feels obligated to pass on, withoutpersonal judgements, a body of oneirocritical knowledge accumu-lated over the centuries.The Perfuming of Humankindis a remark-able, and still popular, guidebook to the interpretation of dreams,but in it the individual self of¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎhas beensuppressed to the point of virtual annihilation.83INTERPRETER OF TRUE DREAMS"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"5SOLITUDE IN A CROWD‘Outwardly in the world’Shortly before his emergence from the long retreat in his house,¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎwrote a letter to a friend in Istanbul. Hetold him that he had now decided to abandon exoteric learning anddevote himself entirely to the pursuit of esoteric knowledge.1Thismight not be obvious from all of his subsequent writings. BakriAladdin has observed that some 25 works composed in the sevenyears following the end of his retreat show continuity with hisprevious production rather than a dramatic change.2It is, however,quite understandable that a man of NÁbulusÎ’s scholarly standing,in his late forties, cannot simply shake off years of scholarly prac-tice, however enthusiastic his resolve to listen to the voice of theunseen world. Consequently, his scholarship continues to underpinhis writing and does not allow him to focus solely on mysticalinsights. Nevertheless, the letter serves as a declaration of theincreasing value he places on mystical approaches to knowledge asagainst exoteric study; it need not be taken too literally as a matterof intent.At this point NÁbulusÎwas prepared to re-enter the world without theprop of a confined, secluded space to isolate him from distractions andhelp him to concentrate on Divine realities. When, in 1687, he resumed apublic life, he advanced to a new level of spirituality in which he soughtto put into effect the eighth NaqshabandÎprinciple, aiming to achieve‘solitude in a crowd’ (khalwatdaranjuman). From this time onwards hewould hope to be constantly mindful of the seeker’s spiritual journeyand remember that, ‘though outwardly it is in the world, inwardly it iswith God’.3This period would demand of him even greater self-disci-pline and devotion to maintain a God-conscious state in the face ofexposure to the veneration of disciples and believers in his saintlypowers, as well as the open attacks of his enemies.84"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Between 1687 and 1689 NÁbulusÎcontinued this more open life-style in Damascus, teaching and leading others on the path to God.Then, in the late summer of 1689, he embarked on the first of aseries of journeys that he undertook intermittently over a period ofabout 11 years, ending in 1700. All these journeys involved travelwithin his Syrian homeland, but also, on his longest journey, inEgypt and theÊijÁz to the Holy Cities of Arabia. This chapterexamines NÁbulusÎ’s life and work during this period, whileChapter 6 explores some Sufi elements of interest in the accountsthat he left of his travels, contained in fourriËlas.It is tempting to detect a certain numerological significance inthe pattern of NÁbulusÎ’s life, at least from around the age of 40years. From this point, critical mundane and spiritual eventsappear to be connected in seven-year periods into relative old age,although this is only approximate and there may be a slightoverlap at times between the periods. A pattern seems to emergemore clearly when viewed in terms of the Islamic calendar years.The apparent first cycle begins with the seven-year solitary retreatfrom 1091 to 1098AH. The second cycle may then run from theend of retreat until NÁbulusÎ’s departure from Damascus on 1MuËarram 1105 (2 September 1693), intending to perform theËajj. It marks the beginning of a period of ‘solitude in a crowd’, inwhich NÁbulusÎexpands his public role and reaches an intellectualand spiritual pinnacle with his composition ofKitÁb al-wuj×d al-Ëaqq(The Book of Real Existence), his mature exposition ofwaËdat al-wuj×d, countering the critics of Ibn¿ArabÎ; he completedthe work a few months before embarking on pilgrimage. A thirdcycle may be perceived as beginning with the longest journey andrunning until 1112AH, when NÁbulusÎundertook his last journeyin September–October 1700. He then returned to his house nearthe Umayyad Mosque for a further seven-year period until, facinganother time of crisis, he retired in 1119AH(1707 )to live in thevicinity of his beloved spiritual father, Ibn¿ArabÎ, in the Dama-scene quarter ofÐÁliËiyya.There does not seem to be any evidence of NÁbulusÎactuallyviewing his own life in this way, although it does appear to fall quitenaturally into such divisions. However, it also does not seem fortu-itous that he confined himself to his house for seven years, given themystical importance of the number seven.4Indeed, this looks quiteas deliberate a choice of timing as the decision to begin retreat on 27RamaÅÁn when nearing the age of 40 years.

At such a time expectations of arenewer of the faith, amujaddid, would naturally run high, aspeople looked for the one who would bring back the strayingcommunity to a true implementation of God’s will as contained inthe Qur’Án andSunna.NÁbulusÎ’s comments on the corruption ofMuslim society in Damascus in the last years of the century, hisretreat and intensifying study of the Qur’Án andÊadÎthall look likeactivities of preparation for the role of renewal (tajdÎd).5As aNaqshabandÎshaykh, he also has the example of AËmad SirhindÎasa recognised famousmujaddidof the preceding century, whom herespects, though not adhering to the MujaddidÎbranch of the orderhimself. While NÁbulusÎis a conservative and, in the eyes of some, areactionary who is out of tune with the spirit of neo-Sufi reform, hedoes believe in his role to renew a corrupted faith.6His dreams nearthe end of his life, notably one of his rebuilding the Ka¿ba, confirmhis ultimate conviction of success in this task.7Among contempo-rary scholars, Bakri Aladdin notes that NÁbulusÎ‘mérite d’êtrequalifié demuÉaddid’ for his role in defending and spreading Ibn¿ArabÎ’s doctrine.8The pure gold of a Lebanese journeyBefore dawn on 15 Dhu ’l-Qa¿da 1100AH(at the end of August1689), NÁbulusÎset out on a 15-day journey that would take himthrough the villages of the Anti-Lebanon mountains, across theplain of the BiqÁ¿to the town of Ba¿labakk. His return was by acircuitous route with a detour via holy sites in Mount Lebanon. Hewas accompanied by a party of friends and disciples, including hismajor disciple MuËammad al-DikdikjÎ(d. 1718), who also acted asa scribe for him and attended him on all his travels.9The avowedaim of the journey was to visit the shrines of prophets and saints,seeking spiritual reward, and also to visit friends among the‘ulamÁ’of Ba¿labakk and meet with fellow Sufis along the way. But histravels began in Damascus with pilgrimages to the holy dead withwhom he was most closely associated: the shrine of John the Baptistat the Umayyad Mosque, site of his teaching; the tomb of his spiri-tual father Ibn¿ArabÎinÐÁliËiyya; and the tombs of Shaykhs Y×suf86SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"al-QamÎnÎand MaËm×d, linked with the miraculous events of hisbirth and recognition as a future saint.NÁbulusÎrecorded this journey in a shortriËla, which he entitledÊullatal-dhahabal-ibrÎzfÎriËlatBa¿labakkwa’l-BiqÁ¿al-¿azÎz(TheDress of Pure Gold on the Journey to Ba¿labakk and the NobleBiqÁ¿).10The first part of the title may be explained by NÁbulusÎ’scomparison of the BiqÁ¿Valley to pure gold and its water to silver.11NÁbulusÎimagines the plain to be clothed in a golden dress, not onlybecause of its natural beauty, but also because the land is blessedby God with the spiritual power (baraka )emanating from andpersisting in its holy persons, both living and dead. NÁbulusÎinher-ited the full range of medieval Muslim beliefs in the extraordinaryforce ofbarakathat could be transmitted from its possessors toother persons and objects through the correct performance of ritualdevotions.12He could acquirebarakafrom its living bearers bydirect physical encounters and dream encounters with them, andfrom the dead through contact with persons or objects connected tothem. At their tombs the blessing could be gained by touching,kissing, rubbing against, circumambulating and sleeping at thegrave, taking away earth and a variety of practices specific to partic-ular holy sites. On this journey NÁbulusÎsought forbarakain somewild and isolated places and belies the notion that this spiritual forcewas essentially contained in the Islamic city. While cities mightcomprise the larger share of sacred spaces and persons, they did nothave a monopoly of either. NÁbulusÎwas hardly a pioneer in hisquest for the sacred in a rural setting, but was following a well-worntradition.13NÁbulusÎand his party reached Ba¿labakk on the fifth day of theirtravels and were received by the town’s governor, MuËammad Pasha,with his entourage and military escort.14The warm welcome given tohim as a saintly¿Álimof a distinguished Damascene family contrastsmarkedly with the experience of some English Christian travellers tothe town in the same year. Henry Maundrell, Levant Company chap-lain at Aleppo, who passed by Ba¿labakk on his way to Jerusalem in1697, remarked how cautious he and his companions had to be,seeking permission from the governor before entering. He recalls thatthey weretaught this necessary care by the example of some worthyEnglish gentlemen of our factory, who visiting this place inthe year 1689, in their return from Jerusalem, andsuspecting no mischief, were basely intrigu’d by the peopleSOLITUDE IN A CROWD87"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"there, and forced to redeem their lives at a great sum ofmoney.15NÁbulusÎdeclares his purpose on entering Ba¿labakk to be ‘thecompletion of pilgrimage to its well-known shrines’.16However, heactually devotes most of his time and attention to a tour and descrip-tion of ‘the remarkable fortress of Ba¿labakk’, that is the greatRoman temple complex.17He was fascinated by ‘these monumentsof the ancients’,18making detailed notes of the current state of thetemples of Bacchus and Jupiter, although with no idea whatsoeverof the original function of the buildings or the identity of theirbuilders.19NÁbulusÎreadily accepted local folk beliefs as explanationfor the great architectural works of past civilisations. He remarked:We have heard that thejinnbuilt Jerusalem and the town ofBa¿labakk with its fortress for Solomon, peace be uponhim. This is evident to the senses, for human beings couldnot construct these great buildings.20Like other Muslim scholars of his age, NÁbulusÎdid not have muchreal interest in acquiring knowledge of non-Islamic cultures andtried to fit the pre-Islamic past into a traditional Islamic world-view.In this respect he presents a marked contrast with European Chris-tian visitors to Ba¿labakk in the seventeenth and eighteenth centu-ries, given their clear interest in pre-Christian Classical culture.After a brief two-day stay, NÁbulusÎdeparted from Ba¿labakkand took a further week to arrive back safely at Damascus via hisscenic and shrine-strewn route. During his short period of absencefrom home, his second wife,¿AlmÁ, had given birth to his secondson, MuËammad Mas¿×d. He had learnt of the birth in a letter fromhis brother Y×suf, received on the eighth day of the journey, whenhe was on his way back and making a pilgrimage visit to a reputedgrave of Prophet IlyÁs (also identified with the Jewish Prophet Elijahand his Islamic counterpart al-KhaÅir).21IlyÁs/Elijah/al-KhaÅir wasthe most widely venerated of holy figures in geographical Syria, withnumerous shrines.22NÁbulusÎwas overjoyed at the news andcomposed a poem in praise of the Prophet and expressing his happi-ness with his new son.23He included a chronogram in the poem,concealing his son’s birth date in an elaborate wordplay. He decidedto give his son the second name of Mas¿×d after one of his relatives,whom he describes as ‘one of the righteous’ and who came to join himat this point. But, however happy he was to see his baby son on his88SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"return to Damascus, NÁbulusÎwas not long distracted from recordinghis travel experience. About a month later, on 21 October 1689, hecompleted work onÊullat al-dhahab.24Travels in a wild and sacred landNÁbulusÎspent the winter with his family in Damascus before beinginspired to resume his travels. Towards the end of March 1690 heexperienced the dream of riding out on horseback accompanied byrichly dressed young men, subsequently shown to be poor ecstatics.25He relates the dream as decisive for his undertaking a new journey,this time into the sacred land of Palestine with Jerusalem as his ulti-mate destination. Yet there must also have been a practical element inhis departure from Damascus in spring, as his route through the wildcountry of southern Syria and northern Palestine would have beeneven more hazardous in winter conditions. He presents it as a farmore arduous trip than his wanderings in the BiqÁ¿. The journey wasto last about one and a half months, with a stay of 17 days inJerusalem.This time NÁbulusÎwrote a longerriËla, describing his life on theroad and offering a detailed account of the holy places, especiallytheÊaram al-SharÎf and principal sites of Jerusalem and Hebron.He called the workal-ÊaÅra al-unsiyya fi’l-riËla al-qudsiyya(TheIntimate Presence on the Jerusalem Journey).26ÊaÅramay perhapsbe understood as having a double meaning in this instance. On theone hand, it may refer to a Sufi gathering for spiritual exercises andshow NÁbulusÎ’s concern with meeting fellow Sufis on his travels;on the other, it may signify the Divine Presence to which he hopes tobe drawn closer by visiting the Holy City of Jerusalem. This is theultimate goal for the traveller, as he proceeds to overcome the phys-ical difficulties of the outward way and to concentrate, as a pilgrim,on the inner way.The difficulties began almost immediately, as, on the secondnight of the journey, NÁbulusÎand his companions spent a restlessand uncomfortable night in akhÁnat the village of Sa¿sa¿.Hecomplained of the fleas, comparing their assault to that of wolvesleaping on the Bedouins’ sheep and remarked that the fleas enjoyeda better meal than they did.27He was also miserable with cold, asthey made their way through the Golan to QunayÕra, seeing the highpeak of Mount Hermon (Jabal al-Shaykh )covered in snow.28Theroute offered little comfortable shelter before the town of NÁblus.On occasion he recorded sleeping ‘under the blue sky of our tent’.29SOLITUDE IN A CROWD89"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Although impressed by the natural beauty of the scenery, he wasalso aware of the dangers of travel in the northern Palestinian coun-tryside. On reaching¿Uy×n al-TujjÁr on the sixth day of his journey,he remarked: ‘We heard news that the shaykh of that village hadbeen killed because he had many enemies and few supporters.’30Hewitnessed the further effects of this insecurity: ‘When we passed by,the door of the mosque was locked due to the feuding that had takenplace there.’31The mosque had been looted. NÁbulusÎhimself,surrounded by a party of about 20 riders, was still not exempt fromattacks. Near to JinÎn he was warned by an ecstatic of a plot tokidnap him and his companions and seize their horses. However,the man behind the plot had reckoned without the power of thesaint because, according to NÁbulusÎ, the robber was punishedwhen that night his horse fell in a pit; no-one could pull it out and itwas left to die.32From NÁbulusÎ’s perspective, this was no simpleaccident or counter-attack by his companions or people from thevillage. It was a miraculous punishment for one who had attemptedto harm a ‘friend of God’. He was evidently happy to arrive atNÁblus on the tenth day and be received in friendship by the local‘ulamÁ’and notables of the town. He stayed there for three daysbefore travelling on the safer stretch of his route to Jerusalem.Despite the wildness of rural Palestine, NÁbulusÎwas in no doubtthat the whole land was sacred and, especially in the most isolatedand inhospitable places, he encountered holy ecstatics.33The landwas also blessed in his eyes by the great number of its holy dead andhardly a day passed without his visiting the tomb of a saint, prophetor figure from the ancient sacred history of the region or the earlydays of Islamic conquest. He was naturally very conscious of thespecial holy status of Jerusalem, the main object of his journey andthe place where he spent the longest time. He stayed at theSulÕÁniyya Madrasa in the city, built by the Maml×k Sultan al-Ashraf QÁ’it Bay (r. 1468–96 )near the Gate of the Chain in thewestern wall of theÊaram. NÁbulusÎspent most of his time in reli-gious and literary discussions with the ‘ulamÁ’ and praying at thenumerous famous pilgrimage sites in and around the city.34He occu-pied himself in making detailed notes of the holy places so that theresultingriËla, theÊaÅra, became best known for its store of infor-mation on these sites, particularly at theÊaram al-SharÎf, theMount of Olives and the principal Muslim cemeteries.35It includedsome places of pilgrimage visited by both Muslims and Christians,such as the footprint of Jesus at the Place of Ascension and thereputed tomb of Mary at Gethsemane. From Jerusalem, NÁbulusÎ90SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"and his party also made a day’s excursion to see the tombs of theProphets Abraham, Isaac and Jacob at Hebron, sites venerated incommon with Jews and Christians.36In his visits to the holy places of Jerusalem and Palestine, NÁbulusÎwas following an itinerary that had undergone a long process ofextension since the early eighth century when Muslim pilgrimage tothe sacred Palestinian land and its holiest city burgeoned. During thisearly period the pilgrims’ focus was largely on theÊaram al-SharÎfand a few nearby sites.37While belief in the sanctity of Jerusalemreceived official encouragement from the Umayyad state, some of themost enthusiastic promoters of the ‘virtues of Jerusalem’ (faÅÁ’il al-quds )were the ascetics of the period.38The city became a populargoal of mystics, who came as pilgrims and sometimes chose to residethere.39Ibn¿ArabÎprovides a prime example of such a mysticalpilgrim. In 1202 he travelled from Egypt to Palestine before contin-uing from there for theËajj; he first meditated at Abraham’s tombat Hebron, then spent time in Jerusalem, praying in the AqÑÁMosque. After a stay in Mecca, he returned to Jerusalem withsporadic residence in the city between 1204 and 1206. ClaudeAddas asks why Ibn¿ArabÎchose to make a detour via Palestineinstead ofproceeding forËajjdirectly from Cairo to theÊijÁz. Sheconcludes that his motivation was primarily spiritual.40NÁbulusÎwill inevitably have been conscious of the example set by his spiri-tual father. It was not unusual for pilgrims to do like Ibn¿ArabÎ,sanctifying themselves first at Jerusalem before continuing to Meccaor visiting it on their return fromËajj. In 1690 Jerusalem was a suffi-cient goal for NÁbulusÎ, but, on his second visit there in 1693, itwould also been routefor Mecca.Turks, Jews and ChristiansFor the next three and a half years¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎwasresident in Damascus, from the late spring of 1690 until the latesummer of 1693. However, he was all too conscious of events in thewider world threatening the security of the Ottoman state and wasparticularly concerned at the instability of its territories in easternEurope. NÁbulusÎwas a loyal subject of the sultan, despite hishostility towards certain anti-Sufi Turks. In 1691 he wrote to theGrand Vizier MuÑÕafÁKöprülü, expressing his anxieties and askinghim to follow a stricter policy towards the Christians of Serbia. Hecounselled Köprülü that he would ‘find victory only through thisreligion’, i.e. Islam.41The vizier had managed to recapture Belgrade,SOLITUDE IN A CROWD91"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"but, whether or not he listened toNÁbulusÎ’s advice, was less fortu-nate when he took tough action in Hungary. He was killed on 19August 1691 at the battle of Szalankemen near Carlowitz.NÁbulusÎ’s anger with eastern European Christians was notreflected in his dealings with Christians generally or his personalviews. As early as 1674, when composing theFatË, his liberal atti-tude towards both Christians and Jews was already in evidence.42Ina short treatise written in 1692 in response to a Turkish critic,NÁbulusÎappears once again remarkably liberal and tolerant ofPeople of the Book.43His polemical intention is shown in the title ofthe work:KitÁb al-qawl al-sadÎdfÎjawÁz khulf al-wa¿Îd wa ’l-radd¿alÁ’l-R×mÎ’l-jÁhil al-¿anÎd[The pertinent discourse concerning thepossibilitythatGodwillnotcarryouthisthreats(topunishtheinfi-dels with Hell fire) against the ignorant and stubborn Turk].44NÁbulusÎwas incensed by this Turk’s accusations of unbeliefagainst both himself and Ibn¿ArabÎon the basis of NÁbulusÎ’scomments on a passage of theFut×ËÁt.¿Abd al-GhanÎlaunched hisown forceful attack on his accuser as ‘a man of the boors of thedeserts and the unlucky ones of the steppe, who is keen on chargingthe Arab and the son of the Arab with unbelief’.45The Arab is, ofcourse, himself and the ‘son of the Arab’ Ibn¿ArabÎ. While NÁbulusÎis proud to be Arab, his argument here supporting Arab superiorityshould probably be read in the context of his venting his wrathagainst his Turkish opponent rather than as a considered, cold-blooded statement of his convictions. Michael Winter, who origi-nally drew attention to the treatise, describes it as ‘an attack againstan anonymous Turk’,46but Barbara von Schlegell has identified theoffender as MaËm×d b. Shaykh¿AlÎ.47Apparently this critic of Ibn¿ArabÎand his school had managed to infiltrate NÁbulusÎ’s privatelessons, craftily posing as an admirer of the Great Shaykh.¿Abd al-GhanÎmust have been disturbed by the seriousness of the charge ofinfidelity and, therefore, felt the need for a firm rebuttal for his ownsake as well as on behalf of his master.The main topic under dispute concerned whether and how theJews and Christians gained happiness (sa¿Áda )by paying the poll-tax (jizya). Ibn¿ArabÎhad asserted that they did and NÁbulusÎsupported his opinion. The Turkish critic understood happiness asreferring to happiness only in the afterlife and declared that thisopinion was in conflict with God’s threat to punish unbelievers inHell.48NÁbulusÎargued that the Turk was ignorant of the nuancesof the word for ‘happiness’,sa¿Áda, which should be understood torefer to happiness also in this earthly life and not exclusively after92SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"death in the blissful state in heaven.49He interpreted Ibn¿ArabÎassaying that the Jews and Christians enjoy happiness on earthbecause they enjoy the protection of the Islamic state in return fortheir payment ofjizya, as is their legal right.50Had NÁbulusÎstopped there and confined his defence to an argument for earthly,not heavenly, happiness for the People of the Book, his positionwould hardly have been problematic. However, he did furtherbelieve that Jews and Christians might experience this happiness inheaven as well as on earth:As theulamataught, faith is believing in the heart only.Showing the faith by means of speech is a condition forapplying the laws of this world to them, but it is not a partof faith, as it has been established in another place.In thiscase(i.e. if they believe in their heart)their happinessbecomes specific happiness and thus they enter Paradisealong with the Muslims. They become Muslims accordingto the laws of the hereafter, but not of this world.51In making such claims, NÁbulusÎwas putting himself in the frontline of a dangerous controversy. He courted even more potentialcriticism by introducing the element of race into the debate. Withreference to God’s threat to punish unbelievers, he accepted theestablished view that God is not to be judged by human standards ofjustice and that He is not bound to punish anyone; NÁbulusÎconsid-ered the Turk guilty of adhering to a Mu¿tazilite position inassuming that God must carry out his threat.52But then he went onto present his belief that God will act in accordance with Arab (notTurkish! )ideals of honour. The honourable Arab will be consid-ered generous if he abstains from fulfilling a threat and, as Godrepresents perfect generosity, it is inconceivable that He would actany less generously. By the same token, NÁbulusÎexpected thatGod would keep His promise to reward the believers, since Arabswould consider it reprehensible to break a promise to do good.53NÁbulusÎ’s vision in this treatise is of God as primarily very mercifuland forgiving, magnanimous to enemies and trustworthy tofriends, the perfection of all virtues esteemed by the Arabs. There isan ethical problem here in NÁbulusÎ’s seeking to impose Arabstandards of behaviour on God. There is also a logical inconsistencyin his argument, since he has already insisted that ‘human criteria donot apply to God. He may kill people and destroy cultivated fieldsand cattle and this would not be called injustice.’54Essentially,93SOLITUDE IN A CROWD"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"NÁbulusÎfinds it just as difficult as his Turkish opponent to adherestrictly to Sunni doctrine and accept God’s absolute power to actwithout any kind of requirement to meet human expectations ofjustice. For the Turk, God has to punish, while for NÁbulusÎ,hehasto be generous because Arabs are generous.Events of 1693On 21 March 1693 NÁbulusÎcompletedal-Wuj×d al-Êaqq, describedby its editor and commentator, Bakri Aladdin, as ‘l’oeuvrefondamentale d’al-NÁbulusÎtraitant de la doctrine de lawaËdat al-wuÉ×d’.55However, while it contains metaphysical reflections onthe subject, intended for a more advanced readership than theFatËof 20 years earlier, Aladdin observes that it is much less well struc-tured.56The 47 chapters range from one page to 30 pages, withnumerous repetitions and apparent late additions to the text.NÁbulusÎdevoted a large part of the work to the doctrine of Ibn¿ArabÎand his school regarding oneness of being with extensive cita-tion of mystical authors. But he was also anxious not just to inform,but to defend, the Great Shaykh and to rebut the attacks of hostiletheologians. Although some of the arguments against Ibn¿ArabÎoriginated with the greatÊanbalÎjurist Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328), hewas not the main object of NÁbulusÎ’s ire and Aladdin has reflectedthat subsequent theological attacks were ‘plus menaÃants’ for Ibn¿ArabÎ’s doctrine.57There is also the possibility that NÁbulusÎ’sfriendship withÊanbalÎscholars of Damascus made him lessdisposed to target their esteemed master. The need to avoid alien-ating allies could be an important factor in selecting works thatmight safely be criticised.Among Ibn¿ArabÎ’s opponents, NÁbulusÎchose Sa¿d al-dÎn al-TaftazÁnÎ(d. 1390 )as the principal author whose writings were tobe refuted, dedicating his longest chapter (32 pages )to critiquingTaftazÁnÎ’s ontology.58TaftazÁnÎhad spent some time in Damascusand engaged in the polemical debates taking place in the city, acentury after the Great Shaykh’s death. However, he was primarilyassociated with the eastern Islamic lands, relying on the patronageof the Chaghatayid Mongol rulers in central Asia and subsequentlyactive in Samarqand at the court of the great military conquerorTimur (d. 1405). In addition to having a fiercesome reputation as awarlord, Timur also took an interest in promoting learning andstimulating theological debate. While TaftazÁnÎwas distinguishedas a theologian with philosophical tendencies, Alexander Knysh has94SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"remarked on his superficiality in attacking Ibn¿ArabÎ’s ‘polemicalimage, which had been molded by several generations of Muslimcontroversialists’, rather than making his critique as a result ofdetailed study of the master’s writings.59Even when he was suppos-edly seeking ‘to refute theFuÑ×Ñ, a close textual analysis of this workshows that textual evidence plays a relatively minor role in hispolemic’.60He borrowed from his teacher, ‘Adud al-dÎn al-’ÍjÎ(d.1355), the allegation that Ibn¿ArabÎfantasised under the influence ofhashish and was thus deluded into believing that he composed theFuÑ×Ñon the orders of the Prophet. From previous critics, includingIbn Taymiyya, TaftazÁnÎtook key points, such as the claim that Ibn¿ArabÎand his school considered even the most despicable things inthis world to be God and supposed their own subjective mysticalexperience of unity with the Divine to be ‘a mirror reflection of theactual state of affairs in the empirical universe’.61In launching his counter-attack on TaftazÁnÎ,NÁbulusÎchosepassages for critical analysis from the author’s major theologicalwork,SharËal-maqÁÑid(The Commentary on Meanings).62However, he also made reference to another polemical work,FaÅÎËatal-mulËidÎnwanaÑÎËatal-muwaËËidÎn(TheHumiliationofthe Heretics and Admonition of the Unitarians )written by one ofTaftazÁnÎ’s students,¿AlÁ¿al-dÎn al-BukhÁrÎ(d. 1437).63ThisBukhÁrÎgrew up in Bukhara and later travelled extensively to India,Arabia, Egypt and Syria. After involving himself in debates in Cairobetween supporters and opponents of Ibn¿ArabÎ, he moved toDamascus where he composed theFaÅÎËaand also proceeded toattack Ibn Taymiyya, to the anger of the city’sÊanbalÎs. TheFaÅÎËawas sometimes attributed erroneously to TaftazÁnÎand NÁbulusÎdid not identify it as the work of his student, either because he wasunaware of the true authorship or chose to aim his criticisms atthe master, on whom BukhÁrÎwas heavily dependent.64In any case,he could hope to gain some popular sympathy for his cause inDamascus by focusing the attack on authors without a strongfollowing in the city.About two or three months after NÁbulusÎ’s completion ofwork onal-Wuj×dal-Êaqq, in June 1693, a plague struck Damascus.It claimed as one of its victims¿Abd al-GhanÎ’s elderly mother,Zaynab. On the occasion of visiting her grave, he recalled the eventssurrounding her death:One of the most remarkable events on the day of her deathwas that a righteous and religious man, Shaykh¿AlÎal-SOLITUDE IN A CROWD95"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"NabkÎfrom the village of Nabk, came that day alone andon foot from Nabk and entered our house.65He was dishev-elled and dusty, one of those enraptured with God(muwallah×n), and the signs of righteousness were evidentin him. We were busy washing our mother and preparingher for burial. He told us that a voice had said to him, ‘Goto Damascus and bringbarakato this great funeral.’ Thiswas when the plague that was ravaging Damascus wassetting its seal on her. He knew nothing of that, but hisecstatic state drove him to us. Then he learned about herdeath. Before that he had been slightly hesitant aboutcoming to Damascus. He passed that day in our company.We carried her to the Umayyad Mosque and prayed for herthere. Afterwards the man accompanied us until we buriedher in the mausoleum of BÁb al-ÐaghÎr in her grave. Thenwhen we had finished the burial, he stood, invoked God’sblessings on us and gave us righteous counsel. Then he trav-elled the same day to the village of Nabk and the plague waslifted after that, praise be to God, just as that man had toldus.66¿Abd al-GhanÎ’s high regard for his mother is evident in his prepara-tions for what was to be a ‘great’ funeral, with prayers at theUmayyad Mosque and burial in an honoured position in the BÁb al-ÐaghÎr cemetery near to the first Umayyad Caliph Mu¿Áwiya and toShaykh NaÑr al-MaqdisÎ(d. 1096), a ShÁfi¿Îjurist noted for ‘hispious devotion, true asceticism, piety, learning and good works’.67Zaynab was also marked out as a holy woman in the eyes of her son,since she attracted divine intervention to lift the plague and bringblessing to the city of Damascus, when the enraptured Shaykh¿AlÎwas ‘sent’ by God’s inspiration to her funeral.The longest journeyTwo months after his mother’s death NÁbulusÎleft Damascus onwhat was to be the longest journey of his life. It was the beginning ofa new Islamic year on 1 MuËarram 1105 (2 September 1693 )andmay, as noted earlier, mark the beginning of a new cycle in which heattained the apogee of his time of ‘solitude in a crowd’. He was to beaway from home for a total of 388 days, traversing much of thecountryside and remote areas of his native Syria, as well as itsprincipal towns, before proceeding from Gaza into Egypt and on to96SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"theÊijÁz and its holy cities. He wrote on the experience in his fullestriËla, which he entitledal-ÊaqÎqawa’l-majÁzfÎriËlatbilÁdal-shÁmwa miÑrwa’l-ËijÁz(Reality and Metaphor in the Journey throughSyria, Egypt and theÊijÁz).68The title bears witness to NÁbulusÎ’spreoccupation with the spiritual quest as he contrasts God’s Reality,al-ÊaqÎqa, with the existence of the physical world through whichhe travels and whose beauty can only be a metaphor for the DivineBeauty.69For NÁbulusÎ, his only real travelling companion was Godand it was only He whom he encountered in all his meetings with therighteous on the way.Why did NÁbulusÎchoose this time for his departure fromDamascus? The long journey may have been a welcome escape fromtroubles at home owing to his confrontation of critics and the deathof his mother. He had completed the 40-day period of mourningand, with the end of summer, the weather would have become moretolerable for travelling. However, he did not mention any suchconsiderations, but stressed the religious motivation appropriate tohis saintly status. He recalled that a Sufi friend had visited his houseand shown him some lines of verse that had inspired the custodianof the tomb of¿Abd al-WahhÁb al-Sha¿rÁnÎ(d. 1565), the distin-guished Egyptian mystic, to embark on theËajj.70He took this as asign that it was his destiny to undertake the pilgrimage. Had thisbeen his only aim in making his journey, the timing of his decisionwould not have been ideal. TheËajjof 1104 had just passed andNÁbulusÎwould have had to wait many months before the depar-ture of the mainËajjcaravan of 1105. However, as always on hisjourneys, he was determined to visit as many holy persons aspossible, whether living or dead.Having almost a year to travel from Damascus to Mecca,instead of following theËajjroute southwards, NÁbulusÎand hisparty travelled north on the road toÊimÑandÊamÁ. Passingthrough both Muslim and Christian villages of the Anti-Lebanon,he appears to have found no welcome among the Christians ofcentral Syria. He expressed his relief on leaving the village ofMa¿arra and its monastery ofÐÎdnÁyÁ, declaring, with his typicallove of wordplay, on hisarrival at the Muslim village of al-M×hibiyya, that he hadexchanged ‘disgrace’ (ma¿arra )for ‘gifts’(mawÁhib).71In the Syriac-speaking village of Ma¿l×lÁhe visitedthe cave of Mar Taqla, a site visited by both Christians andMuslims for its curative waters.72The cave was associated withThecla, a woman saint who was said to have lived for 30 yearsthere, healing the sick in a miraculous way. However, NÁbulusÎ97SOLITUDE IN A CROWD"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"seems to have been characteristically unaware of such Christianlegend and commented only on the water’s benefits in riddingbabies of wind. Further along the way toÊimÑhe received a veryunfavourable reception at QÁra, originally a Christian village butwith a mixed Muslim and Christian population in NÁbulusÎ’sday, where he complained of the miserliness of the inhabitantsand even found it hard to buy food. He remarked with sarcasmthat ‘the doors of its houses are very small, smaller than thewindows lest a guest enter by them’.73Nevertheless, he will havebeen well aware that low doors were quite common as a securitymeasure to prevent forced entry in lawless areas of seventeenth-century Syria and Palestine. When he moved up beyondÊimÑonthe road toÊamÁ, he wrote of the dangers on account of Beduinattacks on travellers; but he survived encounters with Beduinunscathed and they appeared somewhat fearful of his party ratherthan vice versa.By contrast with the problems NÁbulusÎexperienced in thecentral Syrian countryside, he met with a warm reception in thetowns ofÊimÑandÊamÁ, attending gatherings of ‘ulamÁ’ and Sufisand visiting many holy tombs. The visitation of tombs was a normalpart of his daily routine in both town and country, as it was on hisother journeys, and he would seek out thebarakaof the holy dead inthe most inaccessible places, although even his adventurous spirithad its limits. For example, he recalled how he was told of an allegedtomb of the Prophet Seth, son of Noah (Shayth b. N×Ë )at thesummit of a high mountain near the castle of Qadm×s. He had heardof miraculous cures of the sick at the shrine and that ‘a lion goesthere once a year and visits it’.74In this NuÑayrÎ(¿AlawÎ )area thiscurious story may be a way of suggesting an indirect authenticationof the site by¿AlÎb. AbÎÔÁlib, the ‘lion of God’. NÁbulusÎrecitedtheFÁtiËafrom a distance, but did not take the trouble to climb themountain. He remained unconvinced that this was the true burialplace of the Prophet, referring to a better-known tomb nearBa¿labakk that he had visited four years earlier.75On that occasionhe had noted doubts about the authenticity of some prophets’graves, the one certain grave being that of Prophet MuËammad atMedina. Yet what mattered was the sincere intention of the pilgrimin the case of a disputed location of a tomb.76Very few travellers took the route followed by NÁbulusÎand hiscompany fromÊamÁthrough the NuÑayrÎmountainous region tothe coast. The famous Moroccan globetrotter Ibn BaÕÕ×Õa haddescribed the castles of MaÑyÁf, Qadm×s and Marqab in 1355, but98SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"such descriptions were rare. NÁbulusÎfound the castles and thevillages they sheltered mostly in ruins. He identified the inhabitantsmistakenly as ‘IsmÁ¿ÎlÎs, people of heresy and error’.77The briefcomment is in keeping with his usual scorn for the ShÎ¿Îsectarianminorities and a lack of interest in distinguishing between them.Proceeding towards the coast, NÁbulusÎ’s company arrived at thetobacco-growing area around Jabala, where he remarked on thenecessity of smoking because of the cold weather there.78This seemsto have been his first experiment with the practice, although he hadmade previous contributions to debate about its permissibility.During the time of his long retreat he had declared that he was not asmoker, but defended the use of tobacco as allowable within theSharÎ¿a.79By the 1690s the intensity of opposition to smokingappears to have declined in the Ottoman Empire after the harshrepression and executions of offenders, including many Sufis, in the1630s and 1660s. Apart from its tobacco, the other main attractionof Jabala for NÁbulusÎwas an alleged tomb of the famous, semi-legendary IbrÁhÎm b. Adham (d.c. 790), claimed as one of theearliest Sufi ascetics. Supposedly a prince of Balkh, formerly a centreof Buddhism in Afghanistan, he was said to have renounced theprincely life for one of spiritual poverty, his life story mirroring thatof the Buddha. It is not clear how he had come to be linked to Syria,but pilgrimage to the unlikely burial site had become popular inMaml×k times and NÁbulusÎnoted Sufis of the AdhamÎbrother-hood tending to the shrine.80From Jabala NÁbulusÎ’s route took him southwards down thecoastal plain via Latakya. Here he was lavishly entertained by thegovernor and found himself an honoured guest at a circumcisionfeast outside the town.81He continued via Tripoli, Beirut, Sidon andTyre and so into Palestine. As on his earlier journey in 1690, heundertook a potentially dangerous excursion through the wilds ofthe northern Palestinian countryside to Jerusalem. The few Euro-pean travellers who ventured to the holy city by that route recordedthe lawlessness and risks of pillaging by Beduin. Aware of these risksfrom personal experience of the way from Damascus to NÁblus,¿Abd al-GhanÎcarried with him a written warning from thegovernor of Sidon to respect him and his party or face severe punish-ment. While claiming that he did not have problems himself, hehints that he was not well received by the Christian population ofNazareth and also witnessed some cases of civil disturbance in thevillages on the way between Nazareth and NÁblus.82However, evenin the most dangerous and desolate parts of the country, he once99SOLITUDE IN A CROWD"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"again had positive encounters with holy ecstatics and sought thebarakaof the holy dead.As at the time of his previous journey in Palestine, NÁbulusÎfound travel from NÁblus to Jerusalem and its vicinity much saferthan in the north of the country. He recorded the same warmreception that he had enjoyed from the religious notables of NÁbluson his earlier visit there in 1690. He appeared glad to attend adhikrof the ShÁdhiliyya, although he had no formal association with theorder and his relationship with the NÁbulsi ShÁdhilÎs seems morecourteous and sociable than spiritual in nature.83His other contactsin the town included a shaykh who claimed descent from the famousearly ecstatic Ab×YazÎd al-BisÕÁmÎ(d.c. 875 )and the chief reciterfor the Prophet’smawlid, who asked NÁbulusÎto compose his ownmawlidpoem for the occasion.84In Jerusalem he stayed at the Madrasa al-QÁdiriyya in the south-west corner of theÊaram, a building dating from the fifteenthcentury. He passed much of the time in visits to the main pilgrimagesites, described in more detail in theÊaÅra, gave lectures onÊadÎth,held discussions with ‘ulamÁ’, attendeddhikrwith members of hisown QÁdirÎÕarÎqaand even composed a treatise on the relativeeminence of the prophets.85At Friday prayer in the AqÑÁMosqueNÁbulusÎlistened to akhuÕbadelivered by his relative MuËammadb. JamÁ¿a on the traditional topic of the importance of pilgrimage tothe three mosques of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. He followedthis with a visit to the graves of his Ban×JamÁ¿a ancestors.86However, perhaps the high point of his stay in the city was the nightof the Prophet’s birthday at al-AqÑÁ, which he recalled with someenthusiasm:We went to perform the sunset prayer at theÊaram al-SharÎf on the night of the Prophet’s gracious birthday. Wearrived at the AqÑÁMosque with its innumerable virtuesand blessings and sat there waiting to hear the blessedmawlid.

[Sayyid¿Abd al-Ðamad] began the noblemawlidsurrounded by a company ofmu’adhdhinschanting withlovely voices. Then they distributed among all those presenta variety of sweets, candied nuts and fine perfumes; andthey brought rosewater and sticks of incense.87On this second visit to Jerusalem, NÁbulusÎmade the city his basefrom which to explore the surrounding country, with the constantpurpose of seeing the sacred places. In addition to Hebron,described on his earlier journey, the tour included Jesus’ birthplaceat Bethlehem, where monks from the Franciscan monastery enter-tained NÁbulusÎhospitably, playing music on theurgh×l(a windinstrument with twin pipes), a sound that he compared to thesinging of blackbirds and nightingales.88It is not clear how manymonks were living at the monastery at this time. Early in the centurythe Scottish traveller William Lithgow had mentioned only six.89NÁbulusÎwas evidently happy to socialise with the Bethlehemmonks and again later with Armenian monks at Jaffa on his wayfrom Jerusalem to Egypt, when he spoke of attaining ‘the mostperfect purity and joy’.90It is notable that he welcomed the companyof those Christians who were well disposed towards him and did notregard association with them as undermining his own spiritual state,but freely admitted the ‘purity’ experienced in their presence.When NÁbulusÎfinally left Jerusalem, he set out southwardsheading for Gaza. His route took him via the town of Ramla, butincluded along the way visits to many holy tombs in the villages andremote parts of the countryside. Gaza in the late seventeenth centurywas one of the most prosperous places in Palestine, its governingfamily having curbed Beduin raids and embarked on an ambitiousprogramme of construction of mosques and other religious build-ings.91NÁbulusÎwas received in the town by a number of its senior‘ulamÁ’, including theqÁÅÎandÊanafÎmuftÎ, and spent time in theusual religious and literary discussions, pilgrimages to graves andmeetings with local Sufis at theirzÁwiyas and at gatherings fordhikr. He also listened to many stories of miracles connected withsaints of the area and retold them for his readers, in addition tosome extraordinary accounts of visions, including camel caravans inthe sky and storm clouds turning into trees. Interpretations are notsupplied. However enjoyable his stay, NÁbulusÎwas unavoidably101SOLITUDE IN A CROWD"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"detained by the necessity of waiting for his son IsmÁ¿Îl to join him inGaza. He describes IsmÁ¿Îl as a grown man, but an inexperiencedtraveller, unused to mixing with people.92He had journeyed withthe caravan from Damascus to Jerusalem, but found that his fatherwas no longer in the city and theqÁÅÎhad to send his valet to accom-pany him to Gaza. There is a hint of annoyance in NÁbulusÎ’scomments on the ensuing delay. It also seems that he had planned totravel in an independent group to the Holy Cities of theÊijÁzbythepost road from Gaza. It was only after consulting a Beduin shaykhthat he was persuaded it would be easier for him to go to Egyptwhere the shaykh assured him that ‘the EgyptianamÎral-Ëajjhas allthe shaykhs of the Beduin with him and he will send you as youwish’.93Perhaps NÁbulusÎhad counted on his reputation for sanc-tity to give him a greater measure of protection among the Beduin.NÁbulusÎpassed via the town of al-¿ArÎsh through Sinai until hereached a point where he learnt that Beduin were blocking the roadand he was forced to wait for an Egyptian military escort. For thispart of the journey he joined a caravan travelling from Damascusafter soldiers managed to disperse the Beduin force.94Outside Cairohe was met by Shaykh Zayn al-¿ÀbidÎn al-BakrÎ, representative ofone of the most prominent and wealthy Sufi families of OttomanEgypt, with high status in the religious establishment and chargedwith overseeing the Prophet’smawlid.95NÁbulusÎwas to stay inconsiderable luxury at the BakrÎs’ palace by the Azbakiyya Pondfor about two and a half months, attending religious scholarly gath-erings for discussion with ‘ulamÁ’ of al-Azhar and visiting thezÁwiyas of the KhalwatÎ, BektashÎand MawlawÎbrotherhoods, inaddition to the Bakriyya.96He also performed pilgrimage tonumerous holytombs, including those of famous Sufis such as Ibnal-FÁriÅ(d. 1235), al-ShushtarÎ(d. 1269 )and Sha¿rÁnÎ(d. 1565),and he toured the great cemetery of al-QarÁfa.97Before leaving thecity, he consulted AmÎr IbrÁhÎm Bey, commander of the Egyptianpilgrimage, on his plans to travel outside theËajjperiod by the landroute to theÊijÁz with only a small party. He was given assurancesof protection by Beduin shaykhs.98TheamÎrassigned three Arabtribesmen and five camels to conduct him on the road; he also hadhis own two horses.99After the comforts of Cairo and the constant company of fellow‘ulamÁ’ and Sufis, NÁbulusÎhad to adjust to the physical hardshipsof travel and the solitude of a desert journey with only a fewcompanions. He could no longer rely on the group of ‘brothers’who had accompanied him through his homeland and some, it102SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"seems, as far asEgypt. No explanation is given as to why nonewished to proceed with him to Mecca, but suddenly he was nolonger cultivating ‘solitude in a crowd’, but solitude without thecrowd. Perhaps they did not want to take the risks. NÁbulusÎnotes:‘There were eight of us: myself, my son, my servant, three others(MuËammad and the twins As¿ad and¿Abd al-LaÕÎf )and threeBeduin, but one returned and two (Êasan and Najm )stayed withus.’100There is a stark sense of isolation in NÁbulusÎ’s uncharacteris-tically plain language. The little group parted from the scholars ofCairo who had come out to see them on the way, including a son ofÊasan al-ShurunbulÁlÎ,¿Abd al-GhanÎ’s father’s old teacher at thetime of his birth. They set out with their camels and horseseastwards to Suez and then across the central Sinai peninsula to thehead of the Gulf of¿Aqaba. This part of the route was especiallydifficult terrain, and they were forced to camp throughout theirjourney. However, NÁbulusÎwas delighted to wake one morningand discover that his fine white mare had given birth to a foal.101Keeping close to the Red Sea coast, he camped near the fort ofMuwayliË, from where he sent a letter to his friend al-BakrÎ,entrusting it to two of the Beduin, who headed back to Egypt at thispoint.102It seems remarkable that so small a caravan arrived insafety at Medina, having encountered no problems whatsoever fromthe Beduin along their way at a time when even the greatËajjcara-vans needed heavy protection. It is possible that NÁbulusÎ’s saintlystatus did actually offer security against attack, at least as much asany Beduin shaykhs’ guarantees of safe passage.NÁbulusÎstayed for around four months in the Holy Cities. Inaddition to performing theËajjand visiting the Prophet’s grave atMedina, he spent most of his time in meetings with ‘ulamÁ’, someof them with notable Sufi credentials. Unfortunately, some of themost outstanding Sufi figures had recently died. IbrÁhÎm al-K×rÁnÎwas one such distinguished scholar, a Kurd who had spent much ofhis life in Medina and was a well-known advocate of Ibn¿ArabÎ’sdoctrine of oneness of being (waËdat al-wuj×d). He was alsorenowned as a NaqshabandÎshaykh.103He had died in 1690, somefour years earlier, but NÁbulusÎcelebrated hismawlidduring hisvisit and was welcomed by his son, Ab×ÔÁhir MuËammad. Ab×ÔÁhir was the spiritual guide of the great Indian reformer ShÁh WalÎAllÁh of Delhi during his stay in Mecca and Medina in 1731–32.104IlyÁs, another son of IbrÁhÎm al-K×rÁnÎ, was also one of NÁbulusÎ’sstudents.105NÁbulusÎwas further honoured in Medina with a poemof praise from thekhaÕÎbof the Prophet’s Mosque, AËmad, son of103SOLITUDE IN A CROWD"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"IbrÁhÎm al-KhiyÁrÎ, whom he describes as ‘our late friend’106andwho is known as the author of ariËlawith some mystical contenton his journey to Istanbul in 1669–71.107NÁbulusÎhad probablybecome acquainted with IbrÁhÎm al-KhiyÁrÎwhen KhiyÁrÎpassedthrough Damascus on his travels and recorded his ecstatic experi-ence, ‘a state of spiritual rapture’, that overwhelmed him at thetomb of Ibn¿ArabÎ.108NÁbulusÎ, on leaving the Sufi scholars of Medina and proceedingto Mecca, inspected the library of another prominent and recentlydeceased Kurdish Sufi, Shaykh MuËammad al-BarzanjÎ(d. 1691),who, like K×rÁnÎand himself, was a staunch defender of Ibn¿ArabÎ.Like NÁbulusÎ, BarzanjÎhad suffered from attacks for this reason, inhis case from a Yemeni critic of the Great Shaykh,ÐÁliËal-MaqbalÎ(d. 1699).109In Mecca NÁbulusÎalso grantedijÁzasinÊadÎthas wellas one that he describes as being in ‘all our own writings’ that hegranted to a former student of K×rÁnÎ.110Barbara von Schlegell is inclined to downplay the intellectualimportance of these Medinese and Meccan connections, seeingNÁbulusÎ’sijÁzasas those of a ‘tourist’ rather than an indication of aserious influence on the scholars of the Holy Cities prior to the greateighteenth-century period of revival and reform.111NÁbulusÎ’s four-month visit was relatively short compared, for example, to the 14-month stay of ShÁh WalÎAllÁh. However, it appears that he hadalready established links with certain key individuals and families, inaddition to having a saintly and intellectual reputation. Conse-quently, although his visit may have been touristic in some respects,his relations with the Sufi ‘ulamÁ’ of Mecca and Medina and his influ-ence among them were presumably more substantialthan in the caseof a less renowned visitor. If there was something heshared withthese residents of theÊijÁz, it was a common conviction of thetruthcontained in Ibn¿ArabÎ’s metaphysical thought and, insome cases,a devotion to the Naqshabandiyya. He evidently enjoyed the companyof like-minded scholarly Sufis, especially following a long period inwhich he had been engaged in defence of these same views inDamascus. No doubt, he appreciated the moral support, intellectualstimulation and spiritual sustenance available to him in the HolyCities, and reciprocated by offering the same to all those who cameinto contact with him. It may be concluded that he did have somesignificant impact on Sufi circles in theÊijÁz. However, this impactwas not due solely to his visit, but was also owing to a long prior expo-sure to his writings, personal teachings and spiritual guidance throughscholarly friends, students and disciples travelling to Damascus.104SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"While he was in Mecca, NÁbulusÎwas joined for the pilgrimageby his brother Y×suf, who had come from Damascus with the mainËajjcaravan.112The family party returned home together with theSyrian pilgrims. Sadly, Y×suf was taken ill on the way and died.113NÁbulusÎand the rulersIn 1621 a certain Mar¿Îal-KarmÎ, a Palestinian¿Álimliving in Egypt,wrote a glowing panegyric of the Ottoman dynasty. After heapingpraise on their virtues and achievements, far surpassing those ofearlier Muslim rulers, he recorded with some satisfaction: ‘[TheOttomans] curb the belligerent Christians. ... And drive away theunsuccessful Franks to the extremity of the lands of Islam.’114By the1690s it was clear that this was no longer the case. The position ofthe Ottomans in eastern Europe had weakened and, when¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎwrote his own panegyric of the sultans on returnfrom his long journey in 1694, he was not unaware of their trou-bles.115Since 1684 the Ottoman Empire had faced a holy Leagueformed of European Catholic states (Austria, Venice, Poland,Tuscany and Malta), in addition to Russia under Czar Peter theGreat, all determined to wrest away territory from the Islamic state.In this they succeeded dramatically: the Austrians captured Buda in1686, driving the Turks from Hungary, while 10 years later theRussians advanced to take Azov on the shores of the Black Sea. Thescale of Ottoman defeat was unprecedented. Faced with thisdesperate state of affairs, the Shaykh al-IslÁmFaÅl AllÁh wrote toNÁbulusÎin April 1698, appealing for him as a ‘friend of God’ topray for the Muslims. NÁbulusÎpromised that he would indeed praythe specialqun×tprayer, to be said in times of disaster, in all the fiveprayers.116The correspondence with the Shaykh al-IslÁm testifies toNÁbulusÎ’s saintly standing at this time, indicating that he wassomeone to be supplicated by the highest religious authority in theOttoman state. It is interesting also that one reaction in the wake ofMuslim military loss was to turn to the protective intercessionaryoffices of awalÎAllÁh. A few months later, on 26 January 1699, theOttomans signed the Treaty of Carlowitz, by which they ceded tothe Habsburgs most of Hungary and parts of Transylvania, Sloveniaand Croatia, to the Poles part of Podolia and the Ukraine, and to theVenetians Morea and some land in Dalmatia. In a separate agree-ment they acknowledged the Russian conquest of Azov.However, while NÁbulusÎwas no doubt distressed by the catas-trophe facing the Islamic state, the mid- to late 1690s was also aSOLITUDE IN A CROWD105"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"time of some concern nearer to home in Damascus. The local Dama-scene janissary force, accustomed to defending the interests of thepopulation of Damascus, were seriously weakened following apurge in 1691, including executions of some of their more promi-nent members by the governor of the city on the sultan’s orders.117This was a blow to many Damascenes, who felt unprotected againstgovernment rapacity supported by the imperial janissaries. Whenlocal ‘ulamÁ’ attempted to speak up against the governor’s perceivedinjustice, they were exiled in 1695–6, also on the sultan’s orders, tonearby Qal¿at al-QasÕal, Tripoli on the Syrian coast and Cyprus.118Their number included thekhaÕÎbof the Umayyad Mosque and thenaqÎb al-ashrÁf, head of thesharÎfdescendants of the Prophetthrough the line of FÁÕima and¿AlÎ.119It is not clear whetherNÁbulusÎhad any active involvement in these matters, although hisnormal sympathies were with his fellow Damascene ‘ulamÁ’ and theordinary people of Damascus. On a more personal note, he suffereda family tragedy in 1697 on the death of his eight-year-old son,MuËammad Mas¿×d, whose birth during his first Lebanese journeyhad brought him so much joy.Yet, by the time NÁbulusÎrecorded his last journey of about sixweeks in September–October 1700, he made no mention of impe-rial, regional or family problems, but wrote only of happiness in histravels to Tripoli. His finalriËla,al-TuËfa al-nÁbulusiyya fi’l-riËlaal-ÕarÁbulusiyya(NÁbulusÎ’sGemontheJourneytoTripoli )did notattract as much attention as his earlierriËlasand might be consid-ered a more pedestrian work, scarcely meriting the extravaganttitle.120Although, as on other occasions, NÁbulusÎnoted his aim tovisit his spiritual brethren and the holy dead, he also remarked thathe had been invited by certain governors. These invitations set thetone for the journey. Far more than in previous travels, NÁbulusÎspent time in the company of the ruling authorities, attending recep-tions at the palaces of governors and riding out with them on excur-sions into the countryside. Crossing the Lebanon to the coast atSidon, he stayed at the palace there for a week, before travellingNorth via Beirut to Tripoli, where he remained for a further twoweeks, being entertained by its governor, ArslÁnMuËammadPasha, before returning over the mountains to Ba¿labakk and acrossthe BiqÁ¿Valley and the Anti-Lebanon to Damascus. Certainly healso met many ‘ulamÁ’, disciples whom he terms ‘our spiritualsons’ and other Sufis, such as a NaqshabandÎshaykh at Tripoli,but, by his own reports, his conversations focused on discussionsofÊadÎth, points of law or poetic technicalities rather than Sufi106SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"doctrine. Hevisited some holy graves, but without dwelling much onthe experience. Routinely, he described mosques,zÁwiyasand publicbaths in the towns, and listed books in notables’ collections, includinga few Sufi works such as commentaries on QushayrÎ’sRisÁlaand theDÎwÁnof Ibn al-FÁriÅ. All in all, the expedition seems to haveconfirmed NÁbulusÎ’s status as a distinguished visiting scholar andrevered regional saint. The impassioned mystic appeared to have beenco-opted into the Ottoman establishment.107SOLITUDE IN A CROWD"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"6‘A NEW KIND OF MYSTICALTRAVEL-LITERATURE’NÁbulusÎ’s mysticalriËlasSir Hamilton Gibb describes¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎas ‘theoutstanding figure in the Arabic literature of the Ottoman period’and notes, in addition to his achievements as a poet and author ofSufi treatises, that he was ‘the originator of a new kind of mysticaltravel-literature in rhyming prose’.1Even if not all of hisriËlas havea consistently mystical character, NÁbulusÎremains the best-knownexponent of Arabic travel writing in which Sufi interests featurepredominantly. After a brief consideration of earlier concerns withSufism in the genre, this chapter examines in more detail aspects ofNÁbulusÎ’sriËlasthat can be seen to mark them out as ‘mysticaltravel-literature’. A primary aim for NÁbulusÎin all his travels wasto seek contact with living Sufis and with the dead at their tombs.His connections with Sufi‘ulamÁ’ on his journeys have already beennoted and his accounts ofÕarÎqas are given further considerationhere. However, some of his more interesting meetings were withuneducated recluses and ecstatics in the wilds of the Syrian andPalestinian countryside, and these encounters are explored withspecial reference to the two earliestriËlas,Êullat al-dhahaband theÊaÅra, which are characterised by a more distinctively mysticaltone than the later works. Pilgrimages to Sufi graves and shrines aremore extensively covered in the longestriËla, theÊaqÎqa, so this isthe principal source for NÁbulusÎ’s treatment of the topic. For him,as for many other Sufis of his age, tomb visits became an integralpart of the religious life and hardly a day passed out of the 388 daysof the long journey without his recounting one or more excursionsto holy graves.108"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Sufi elements in earlierriËlasTheriËlaunderwent considerable changes between the time of itsfirst great master, Ibn Jubayr of Valencia (d. 1217), and the time ofNÁbulusÎ’s remodelling of the form. The narrative of the Andalusiantraveller was clearly focused on the performance of theËajjanddescription of conditions in the lands of the Arab East. Ibn Jubayrhas been much praised for the way in which he accomplished his aimof providing an exact and detailed account of the places along hisroute and especially the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina. Such washis achievement that his work became recognised as a model and asource to consult and even to plagiarise.2He does not seem to havelacked all interest in Sufism, but it was a minor facet of the overallscene that absorbed him. While he wrote with some awe of the Sufisof Damascus that they were ‘the kings in this land’,3he was not oneof them. He recorded tombs of the righteous in the city withmeticulous care,4but his attitude was essentially different from thatof NÁbulusÎ. Ibn Jubayr was, after all, a pious MÁlikÎjurist, not amystical ‘friend of God’.Ibn BaÕÕ×tÁ(d. 1368–9 or 1377), the most renowned of medievalMuslim travellers, showed a much greater interest in the Sufis of hisday and appears to have been a sporadic devotee of Sufism himself,as Ross E. Dunn observes:By the time he left Tangier, he was so deeply influenced bySufi ideas, especially belief in personalbarakaand the valueof ascetic devotionalism, that his traveling career turned outto be, in a sense, a grand world tour of the lodges and tombsof famous Sufi mystics and saints. He was never, to be sure, acommitted Sufi disciple. He remained throughout his life a‘lay’ Sufi, attending mystical gatherings, seeking the blessingand wisdom of spiritual luminaries, and retreating on occa-sion into brief periods of ascetic contemplation. But he nevergave up the worldly life.5Ibn BaÕÕ×tÁwas initiated into different brotherhoods, notably theRifÁ¿iyya during a stay in Jerusalem and Suhrawardiyya inIsfahan.6However, it is questionable how deeply meaningful theseaffiliations were for the traveller.7Nevertheless, there were timeswhen he displayed a greater level of commitment, as when he spentsome five months in a life of severe asceticism under the directionof a Sufi shaykh in India, KamÁl al-dÎn¿Abd AllÁh al-GhÁrÎ.8IbnBaÕÕ×tÁwas obviously the amateur Sufi, dabbling in the spiritual109‘A NEW KIND OF MYSTICAL TRAVEL-LITERATURE’"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"life, by contrast with NÁbulusÎ, professional Sufi shaykh, scholarand saint. Yet the Moroccan’s multi-facetedriËlacontains accountsof Sufis and their miracles,zÁwiyas and tombs that may be seen asforerunners of a growing obsession with visits to the righteous, anobsession that eventually gives rise to a distinctive sub-genre of theriËla.Looking in at Sufism from the outside edge, Ibn BaÕÕ×tÁdid nothave the perception of the mystic. His treatment of Sufis quitecommonly took the form of tales of the miraculous, related withvarying degrees of credulity.9Sometimes he did express doubts, butit is not always possible to tell exactly how credulous he was inaccepting a story at face value. On occasion he may simply haveenjoyed telling an extraordinary tale to divert his readers. Forexample, when he told of a holy man of Shiraz being thrown to apack of ferocious dogs who refused to harm him, it is not clearwhether Ibn BaÕÕ×tÁwas just narrating an amazing story orbelieving it to be a miracle.10In this case, did he also see a didacticpurpose in the miracle account, reading the dogs as representing thebase self tamed by the saint through his spiritualjihÁd?Ifhedidhave any such understanding, did he by any chance expect hisreaders to share it? NÁbulusÎ, in his turn, would tell strange tales andnot always interpret them, but it was clear that he saw miracles allaround him.Dunn has described Ibn BaÕÕ×tÁas a ‘literate frontiersman’, aman of modest learning travelling to the fringes of theummainpursuit of career opportunities that might otherwise have beenbeyond his ability to attain.11He was thus to serve for six years as ajudge in Delhi and even as a chief judge for some time in the MaldiveIslands. However, Dunn regards him not simply as an adventurousindividual, but as one representative of a wave of internationalmigration of moderately qualified‘ulamÁ’, settling permanently ortemporarily in the further Islamic communities of Asia and Africa inthe later medieval period. They may have been indifferent scholarsfor the most part, but they had a role to play in building Islamicinstitutions and culture beyond the heartlands of the faith. Yet, afterthe fifteenth century, this outward movement of literate Muslims tothe frontiers gradually came to an end.The Arab ‘ulamÁ’ of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,whatever their capabilities or lack of them, had little incentive toventure to remote regions that did not offer them much in terms ofcareer development that was not available to them closer to home.Not that all such movement ceased, but the further areas were110SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"supplying more of their own scholars to meet their needs and some-times exporting them to the Holy Cities of Arabia. Sufis continuedto travel in different directions, bearing the messages of their respec-tiveÕarÎqas, both from and to the Arab lands. Nevertheless, the Arabauthors who contributedriËlasin this period generally producedcommonplace records of journeys forËajjor pilgrimage visits in theirown or neighbouring Arab countries. It was not unusual to recounttravels of a strictly local character, for example those of three Dama-scene ‘ulamÁ’ who wrote of crossing Syria from Damascus to thecoast at Tripoli some 60 to 100 years before NÁbulusÎwas to make asimilar journey; these wereÊasan al-B×rÎnÎin 1599–1600, RamaÅÁnal-¿UÕayfÎin 1634 and YaËyÁb. al-MaËÁsin in 1638–9.12The earliestof these travellers, B×rÎnÎ, has been noted as a student and biographerof NÁbulusÎ’s great-grandfather, mentioned previously with referenceto his dream of IsmÁ¿Îl al-NÁbulusÎ, a man of dubious reputation, butthe author of a useful commentary on the language of Ibn al-FÁriÅ’sDÎwÁn.13In 1693, on observing the great aqueduct built by Godfreyde Bouillon outside Tripoli, NÁbulusÎquoted from B×rÎnÎ’s descrip-tion of it in his longestriËla.14For Arabs travelling to non-Arab lands Istanbul was the mostfrequent destination that found its way into theirriËlas.Itwasanatural magnet for religious scholars with any ambition toadvance their careers in the Ottoman Islamic state and, therefore,a more obvious goal at this time than outlying parts of theumma.As noted earlier, the young¿Abd al-GhanÎhad visited the capitalin 1664, but left noriËlarecalling the experience. IbrÁhÎm al-KhiyÁrÎ, his older contemporary and friend,khaÕÎbat theProphet’s Mosque in Medina, has also been recorded asembarking on the journey to Istanbul in 1669, stopping atDamascus on his way up from theÊijÁz and leaving a full descrip-tion of his experience.15His return journey took him back by wayof Palestine and Egypt to Medina, making a detour similar to thatof NÁbulusÎmore than 20 years later. KhiyÁrÎmay be seen asanticipating NÁbulusÎ’s development of the mysticalriËla, sincehe is also very much concerned with recollecting the spiritualeffects on himself of visiting shrines and meeting like-minded‘ulamÁ’ and Sufis. He is one of the better examples of the new Sufi-inspired trend in Arabic travel-literature of the Ottoman period,but he is not alone.16Consequently, Gibb’s description of NÁbulusÎas the ‘originator’ of the mysticalriËlashould probably be modifiedto recognise his significant role in its development rather than inven-tion of a totally new phenomenon.111‘A NEW KIND OF MYSTICAL TRAVEL-LITERATURE’"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Men of theÕarÎqasGiven that, during the course of his travels,¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎmet so many Sufis of all kinds, from sons of the distin-guished scholar IbrÁhÎm al-K×rÁnÎto illiterate ecstatics, it may seemsurprising that he wrote so little of theirÕarÎqas, where indeed theybelonged to any. On most occasions in theriËlashe is content with abrief mention of attendance at thedhikrof a particular brother-hood, for example the ShÁdhiliyya in NÁblus,17or a short visit to azÁwiyasuch as that of the Bektashiyya in Cairo.18Rarely does hewrite at length of an individual whoseÕarÎqais identified or describefurther matters relating to aÕarÎqa. The impression gained from theriËlasconfirms NÁbulusÎ’s limited concern with the Sufi institutionsof his day, as he is more involved in his own personal journey on the‘path of God’ than in a spiritual life controlled by any organisation.Similarly, although he has friends, like the Egyptian Shaykh al-BakrÎ, who are organisation men, he shows more evident interest inothers who have taken a personalised path like his own.Although the Naqshabandiyya became officially his mainÕarÎqa,he does not discuss the prominent NaqshabandÎs whom he met intheÊijÁz, such as Ab×ÔÁhir MuËammad, in terms of theirNaqshabandism andÕarÎqa-based activities. The QÁdiriyya, as thefirst brotherhood into which he was initiated atÊamÁin 1664,receives a little more attention in theÊaqÎqa, but this is mostlybecause he returns toÊamÁafter 30 years and displays a specialenthusiasm for his old links with the distinguished QÁdirÎfamily ofthe KaylÁnÎs, descended from the great saint¿Abd al-QÁdir al-JÎlÁnÎ.19The KaylÁnÎs dominated the religious hierarchy of the town,holding the principal offices, and had acquired considerable wealth.20NÁbulusÎstayed with YÁsÎn EfendÎ,naqÎbal-ashrÁf, at the KaylÁnÎs’palace overlooking the Orontes River and its waterwheels. He alsomet and joined in thedhikrat the QÁdirÎzÁwiyawith Shaykh¿AlÎal-KaylÁnÎ,the currentshaykh al-sajjÁda(head of the brotherhood),experiencing an ecstatic state at that time. As well as rememberinghis initiation and recalling the visit to the grave of his old shaykh,¿Abd al-RazzÁq, he also presents a spiritual genealogy (silsila )of theQÁdiriyya down to himself.21Occasionally NÁbulusÎaccords a brief mention to Sufis of minorÕarÎqas, such as those of the Adhamiyya, whom he saw at the allegedtomb of IbrÁhÎm b. Adham at Jabala.22The sixteenth-century Egyp-tian Sufi Sha¿rÁnÎhad been critical of this order as guilty of corruptionand failure to follow theSharÎ¿a.23Another minorÕarÎqathat Sha¿rÁnÎwas prone to rebuke for unorthodox practice was the MuÕÁwi¿iyya,112SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"possibly a branch of the Badawiyya (or AËmadiyya), famous or noto-rious for its popularmawlidat the shrine of AËmad al-BadawÎ(d.1276 )atÔanÕÁ.SharÎ¿a-minded Sufis frequently attacked the BadawÎfestival for its unIslamic nature and for giving rise to licentious behav-iour.24NÁbulusÎdoes not concern himself with the BadawÎs in Egypt,but he does remark briefly, on seeing adhikrof the MuÕÁwi¿iyya at amosque in Gaza, that he ‘saw thefaqÎrs calling the name of God MostHigh in powerful states of ecstasy’.25Michael Winter has observedthat, to judge by a mid-eighteenth-centuryfatwÁagainst them, ‘theywere regarded as very unorthodox, guilty of total ignorance of Islam,of hatred of the jurists (who could have guided them toward the rightbehaviour )and of pederasty and fornication’.26However, it is notice-able that, whatever he may have thought of the practices of certainÕarÎqasor individual Sufis, NÁbulusÎis not condemnatory of them inthe manner of some jurists, including those who were also Sufis, suchas Sha¿rÁnÎ.As for Sufis whom NÁbulusÎencountered from other majorÕarÎqas, it is those of the Mawlawiyya and Khalwatiyya that attracta certain degree of his attention. In theÊaqÎqahe recalls visits toattend thesamÁ¿of the famous ‘whirling dervishes’ at the MawlawÎlodge in Cairo27and especially in Tripoli, where he was deeplyimpressed by the beauty of thezÁwiya’s location, calling it ‘a para-dise for the eyes’.28However, while he appears to be full of approvalfor the MawlawÎbrethren, his comments are confined to vaguepraises in both his extravagant flowery prose and in poetry, when heexclaims at the sight of thezÁwiya:Have you not seen the rivers beneath it flowingAnd the birds singing melodies without rhyming?Syrian Tripoli grew proud and was boasting,How blessèd is he in seclusion retiringAnd the light of the holy ones there affirming,While he from those pleasant pools his thirst is quenching.How the lights of the shaykhs in that place were shiningAnd chanters theMathnawÎ’s mysteries chanting!29In the late seventeenth century it was not particularly unusual fora NaqshabandÎshaykh to show enthusiasm for the teachings ofR×mÎ’sMathnawÎand the Mawlawiyya.30NÁbulusÎknew Persianand had apparently been interested in R×mÎ’s work even as a youngman, when he claimed to have absorbed R×mÎ’s spiritual nature.31Two hundred years later the young reformer RashÎdRiÅÁ(d. 1935),‘A NEW KIND OF MYSTICAL TRAVEL-LITERATURE’113"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"also initiated as a NaqshabandÎ, would react with horror at theMawlawÎsamÁ¿of their TripolizÁwiya, denouncing its ‘forbiddenacts, which one has no right either to look at or to pass over insilence, for to do so is to accept them’.32But by then the NaqshabandÎsand MawlawÎs had drifted further apart and RiÅÁwould ultimatelyreject both.In NÁbulusÎ’s time the Khalwatiyya was the other mainÕarÎqawhose members he sometimes noted in hisriËlas. In Cairo herecorded his visit to a KhalwatÎmosque andzÁwiyaand to gravesof their shaykhs, as well as his attendance at theirdhikrat theMosque of Hussein.33In NÁbulusÎ’s day the KhalwatÎs in Egyptwere predominantly Turks, although in the eighteenth century theywere to widen their membership through the mission (da¿wa )effortsof his disciple, MuÑÕafÁb. KamÁl al-dÎn al-BakrÎ. They became abrotherhood especially favoured by the Azhar ‘ulamÁ’and regardedas highlySharÎ¿a-conscious.34At the Syrian coastal town of Latakyahe also noted his meeting with a KhalwatÎshaykh who was reput-edly 115 years old.35However, NÁbulusÎ’s fullest report of an encounter with amember of the Khalwatiyya is one that he relates in his shortestriËla,Êullat al-dhahab. He identifies this KhalwatÎas ShaykhAËmad, the custodian of al-Dilla Mosque, situated on a mountain-side in the Anti-Lebanon and said to contain a grave with the bodyof Prophet YaËyÁ(John the Baptist).36NÁbulusÎrecognised ShaykhAËmad as one marked by the signs of righteousness, an indication ofthis being that he had foreseen their arrival at his village. The talkturned to miracles, including a virgin birth comparable to that ofMary giving birth to Jesus.37However, the KhalwatÎalso spoke atlength of the uselessness of miracles and sainthood, when unsup-ported by knowledge and practice of theSharÎ¿a. To illustrate hispoint, he told of a local man who had been a friend of his father. Hisholiness was such that he was able to fly miraculously between themountains, but he was ignorant of true Islamic worship. The resultof this ignorance was that the devil was able to tempt him and hebecame a sinner.38The story serves to underline a KhalwatÎconcernwithSharÎ¿apenetrating even this wild mountainous area beyondthe normal reach of‘ulamÁ’orthodoxy.Encounters with ecstaticsAlthough¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎwas himself a jurist, his lifeappears to be spent in fairly equal proportions in the company of114SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"those who are profoundly conscious ofSharÎ¿aand those for whomits normal obligations are suspended, due to their being ecstaticmystics (majÁdhÎb )suddenly ‘drawn’ to God by an overpoweringexperience of unveiling (kashf).39He was frequently in the companyofmajÁdhÎbin Damascus, but also met with a number during histravels. They appear quite frequently in theriËlas, as, for example,in theÊaqÎqawhen NÁbulusÎrecalls amajdh×bin Cairo who knewthrough his own mystical insight what¿Abd al-GhanÎhad under-gone on the ‘path of unveiling’.40He also foretold that he wouldperform theËajjthat year in safety, echoing the same predictionmade earlier on the route by a Turkishmajdh×bat Tripoli.41A cynicmight have thought that no special gifts were needed to know thatNÁbulusÎwas proceeding forËajjand to announce a successfuloutcome, but NÁbulusÎdoes not question the genuine foreknow-ledge of the ecstatics.TheÊaÅra, in particular, contains some fascinating accounts ofmajÁdhÎbwhom NÁbulusÎencountered in the countryside ofnorthern Palestine, and a few of the same individuals also make anappearance in theÊaqÎqaabout three years later. JinÎn and itssurrounding villages seem remarkable for these ecstatic personali-ties. On 2 April 1690, the ninth day of his journey, NÁbulusÎrelateshow numbers of ecstatics came out to greet him on his entry intoJinÎn.42Some were from the settled population, others wanderingfrom place to place. According to¿Abd al-GhanÎ, they knew in theirhearts of his coming without learning of his visit by any othermeans. This type of intuitive knowledge, including knowledge ofothers’ thoughts, is commonly noted as a characteristic of thosewhose rational judgement was swept away by the experience ofdivine illumination.43It was not unusual for them to dress andbehave in a bizarre fashion, as in the case of a certainmajdh×bfromone of the villages near NÁblus, who marched around the marketscarrying a gun and a sword.44It is not clear whether he is the same asa ShaykhÐÁliË, whom NÁbulusÎdescribes in theÊaqÎqaas dressedin rags, beating a drum and bearing arms.45Others exchanged ragsfor a state of total nudity, marking a complete lack of concern withthe material world of appearances so that all longing for possessionsand sensual desires disappeared and themajdh×bregained the inno-cence of life in Eden.46Most of the ecstatics described were single males, but occasion-ally married men and a few females are mentioned. One interestingcase is when NÁbulusÎwrites of his meeting a whole family ofmajÁdhÎbfrom the Transjordanian district of¿Ajl×n. They consisted115‘A NEW KIND OF MYSTICAL TRAVEL-LITERATURE’"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"of Shaykh MuËammad b.Êum×d, his brothers, male cousins (sonsof his paternal uncle )and his wife.47The presence of all theseecstatics in one family does also raise the question of whether theycan fit the classic designation of themajdh×b, whose mind is invol-untarily seized by a powerful unveiling such that rational judgementis suspended for a long period. NÁbulusÎin some instances describesamajdh×bas alsomuwallah, voluntarily seeking unveiling anddriven into insanity by a passionate love of God. In one case heremarks that a certain ShaykhÊasan al-FÁl×jÎfrom the vicinity ofGaza was amajdh×b,amuwallahand also a ‘lord of states’ (rabbal-aËwÁl )gifted with supernatural powers.48It is probable that, wherea family are allmajÁdhÎb, the term is being used rather casually andtheir condition may not be entirely involuntary.Another person whom NÁbulusÎdescribes both asmajdh×bandone of the ‘masters of states’ (aÑËÁb al-aËwÁl)49is the black ecstaticShaykh ZÁ’id, who was living in a large cave with fifteen recessesthat he had dug out for himself in woodland near the village ofYa¿bad. NÁbulusÎnarrates in some detail his visit to him in theÊaÅraand mentions a second visit in theÊaqÎqa. He remarks thatZÁ’id had been a slave to one of the people in the village and hadbeen working as a shepherd when he was seized by the sudden, over-whelming divine illumination ofjadhb, rendering him amajdh×b.Consequently, his owner freed him and he came to live in the cavewhere¿Abd al-GhanÎsaw him sitting naked on the ground, crushingcoffee beans with a wooden mortar.50Noting that people visitedZÁ’id in order to obtainbarakaand consult him about their affairs,NÁbulusÎconfirms his regard for the ecstatic’s mystical insight bysaying that he asked about the state of his brethren and companionsproceeding to Jerusalem. ZÁ’id told him that they were in a state ofgrace due to their being with him and foresaw a positive outcome totheir journey.51Thus these comments not only assert ZÁ’id’s knowl-edge of the spiritual state of others and foreknowledge of theirimmediate future, but also serve to promote the idea of NÁbulusÎ’sown personal sanctity. He reports a further instance of ZÁ’id’spsychic qualities on his return visit when themajdh×bknew by hisspecial insight that NÁbulusÎ’s servant was holding the horsesoutside the cave and asked for him by name to come in and drink hiscoffee.52ZÁ’id also appeared to exercise the kind of supernatural powerscharacteristic of a ‘master of states’. The coffee that he madeconstantly for his visitors was prepared by him out of a blend ofwheat, barley, millet and chickpeas, but, at his touch, it turned116SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"miraculously into good coffee.53Such amazing power was in hishands that, if he wanted firewood, he would uproot a great tree withonly a small stick, break it with his hand and carry it back to thecave.54It is apparent from NÁbulusÎ’s accounts that he accepts themajdh×bas being in an extraordinary state from God.However, his encounter with another black ecstatic, ShaykhMurjÁn, at the village of¿ArrÁba serves as a reminder that thesefigures were also feared for their curses.55NÁbulusÎmentions thathe and his company had forgotten to visit themajdh×bin thisvillage. As they were passing on their way, one of them fell from hishorse backwards onto a young boy, who became unconscious.Anothermajdh×bamong them then shouted, ‘Recite theFÁtiËaforShaykh MurjÁn.’ They did so. The boy recovered consciousness andthe horse and rider were unharmed. NÁbulusÎ, seeing supernaturalforces everywhere, never considers the possibility of a mere acci-dent. From his perspective, misfortune befalls their companybecause they neglect one of God’s chosen ones, just as blessing isimparted by their respect for Shaykh ZÁ’id.Dreams of the righteousAlthough NÁbulusÎdoes not relate a large number of dreams in hisriËlas, they do play a part of some consequence in his accounts ofmeetings with the righteous andmajÁdhÎb. Three dreams are selectedfor discussion here. Two are literal dreams described in theÊaÅraand one is a relatively rare account of a symbolic dream told in theshortestriËla,Êullat al-dhahab. Despite the fact that the dreamsdiffer in character, all three have underlying features and aims incommon. They are the dreams of enraptured mystics, who meetNÁbulusÎduring his travels through wild parts of the countryside innorthern Palestine and Lebanon, and who recognise the importanceof the experience. The dreams disclose some deeper truths than areavailable in everyday waking life, while accepting that ‘the twoworlds are one’. They reveal that those with knowledge of the unseenworld (al-ghayb), ‘friends of God’ and ecstatics, may have specialawareness of one another. Above all, the ultimate point of the dreamsis to indicate¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎ’s superior sainthood.NÁbulusÎtells of the first literal dream, when he remembers themajdh×bShaykhÊasan al-FÁl×jÎ, who was among the ecstatics atJinÎn. This man had travelled from his home village of FÁl×ja in thesouth of Palestine right up to the north through difficult anddangerous country in order to greet NÁbulusÎ. He had made the117‘A NEW KIND OF MYSTICAL TRAVEL-LITERATURE’"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"journey because he had had a dream, in which he had beencommanded to travel by a company of saints, including ShaykhArslÁn al-DimashqÎ(d.c. 1145-55 )and Shaykh¿AlÎb.¿Ulaym (d.c.1081). Both are of national rather than international significance.Shaykh ArslÁn’s mausoleum outside the city walls of Damascus nearBÁbT×mÁwas a well-known place of pilgrimage (ziyÁra )and hewas popularly credited with miracles, even regarded as a kind ofpatron saint for Damascus.56Thirteen years before the Palestinianjourney, in 1677, NÁbulusÎhad written a commentary on ArslÁn’sepistle ontawËÎd,57so there was already a connection betweenthem.¿AlÎb.¿Ulaym’s tomb was a pilgrimage site in themajdh×b’shome area on the southern Palestinian coast near to Jaffa.58NÁbulusÎwas to visit it on his long journey in 1693. However, thetwo saints also had links with each other. Shaykh ArslÁn’s ownshaykh was described in the sixteenth-century pilgrimage guide ofIbn al-ÊawrÁnÎas ‘a companion to Shaykh YÁsÎn, who was acompanion to¿Uqayla, who was a companion to¿AlÎb.¿AlÎm’59andso back to the famous early Sufi SarÎal-SaqaÕÎ(d.c. 867). Thus thesaints who are named in the dream are expected to know each otherand also to know NÁbulusÎand themajdh×b,Êasan al-FÁl×jÎ.According to NÁbulusÎ, they told FÁl×jÎ:‘Get up and go to meetÊaÅrat al-Shaykh.’ [They said this],although he [themajdh×b] did not know us and had nevermet us or made our acquaintance. He informed us also thathe saw the righteoussayyids and perfect saints journeyingto meet us on the road, to right and left, whether it wasbroad or narrow. He [told us that] they had been with us inour tent and celebrated thedhikrwith drums and tambou-rines and were seized with a powerful ecstatic state in whichreason was overwhelmed. Yet nothing startled the horses,even though they were tethered around the circle, whichwas filled with shouting and cries of emotion.60Once the connections between persons have been established, thedream itself requires minimal interpretation, but clearly demon-strates the high regard of the region’s saints for¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎ.The second literal dream is recounted on the occasion ofNÁbulusÎ’s entry into the village of Ya¿bad on 4 April 1690, justbefore his visit to ZÁ’id’s cave.61In this case, NÁbulusÎmentions hisreception by one of his former students in Damascus, IsmÁ¿Îl al-118SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Ya¿badÎ. IsmÁ¿Îl introduced him to his father, Shaykh MuÑliËal-Ya¿badÎ, who then related a dream. Shaykh MuÑliË’s wife had beenill, so the night before NÁbulusÎ’s arrival in the village he slept nextto her and his two daughters in order to look after her. However, itcrossed his mind that a stranger seeing them all together might havethe wrong impression about his behaviour. He fell asleep anddreamt of NÁbulusÎ, his son’s old teacher, although he had nevermet him. Far from reproving him, NÁbulusÎjoked with him aboutthe situation and Shaykh MuÑliËintroduced him to his wife anddaughters.At first sight the dream account reads as a rather crude, humorousstory. It appears very different from the first dream of saintly recog-nition. Yet, on closer examination, there are certain similarities inthe way that the dreams function. Shaykh MuÑliË’s dream alsoconfirms the high saintly status of NÁbulusÎ. He appears in hisstudent’s father’s dream because he is the spiritual teacher whoknows the truth about the thoughts of others and the reality of asituation. Even though he has never met Shaykh MuÑliË, he under-stands at long distance his anxieties and embarrassment and themost delicate intimate details of his family life. He can enter hisdreaming and actually joke about a sensitive matter because of hisexceptional mystical insight, and his joking is acceptable (like themajdh×b’s nudity )because of his absolutely pure state. The saintcan, therefore, behave in a dream in a way that would be reprehen-sible in the ordinary person. The readers of theÊaÅrawill beexpected to appreciate this and acknowledge NÁbulusÎ’s sanctity,although they may also be allowed to laugh.The third dream, recalled by NÁbulusÎinÊullat al-dhahab,isarare instance in theriËlasof a symbolic dream. At the village ofZabadÁnÎ, on the third day of his journey from Damascus towardsthe BiqÁ¿Valley in 1689, he met with an itinerant dervish, whobriefly joined his company. NÁbulusÎdescribes how this man’sdream experience had led to his life of wandering:He told us that one time he was ill in the Grotto of the Fortyon Mount QÁsy×n, when there appeared to him in a dreama company of naked holy men. They stripped him of theclothes that he was wearing and ordered him to go out atonce and set out on his travels. This dream was repeatedthree times, so it was a sign of his meeting with us in the bestof states.62119‘A NEW KIND OF MYSTICAL TRAVEL-LITERATURE’"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The dream has several interesting features to it. First, its condi-tions suggest its affinity with ancient Near Eastern incubation, inwhich the devotee would sleep in a sanctuary in the hope ofreceiving dream revelation as to a right course of action. The usagecontinued into the Islamic period in the form ofistikhÁra, a processof seeking to choose by submitting to God’s guidance in sleep,‘entrusting God with the choice between two or more possibleoptions, either through piety and submission to His will, or elsethrough inability to decide oneself, on account of not knowingwhich choice is the most advantageous one’.63Despite the opposi-tion of many religious lawyers to the practice of sleeping in mosquesand other holy places, it is known to have been popularly main-tained and several sites in the Damascus area were associated withthis type of incubation.64Although Toufiq Fahd does not seeistikhÁraas having a therapeutic function, unlike the ancient Greekconcept, it is possible that there is such an element in this case, sincethe man told NÁbulusÎthat he was sick at the time of his sleeping inthe grotto.65The nature of his illness is not revealed, but it appearsto have left him afterwards. It may also be implied that it was a spiri-tual sickness. Another characteristic ancient feature is the confirma-tory nature of the dream’s three-fold repetition.The Grotto of the Forty on Mount QÁsy×n is also identifiable asthe Grotto of Blood (MaghÁratal-Dam), the legendary site of Cain’skilling of Abel. According to Ibn al-ÊawrÁnÎ, it was a place ofsupplication (du¿Á’), where prayers were answered and to which thepeople of Damascus resorted when faced with troubles such asdrought or an oppressive ruler.66He notes that ‘it is reported fromsome that the Substitutes meet on momentous nights in the place offulfilling supplication and pray there and make requests of God theExalted and supplicate Him’.67The Substitutes (abdÁl )were ‘theForty’, the company of saints who also gave their name to thisgrotto and who were known as ‘substitutes’ because each time onedied, another would be substituted to take his place on earth.68Anumber of other pilgrimage sites, particularly grottoes, were linkedto the Forty Substitutes, including three visited by NÁbulusÎin histravels: at Marqab in northern Syria, Nazareth and Hebron in Pales-tine.69Presumably the dream company of naked holy men wereunderstood to be the spirits of the Forty, although their number isnot specified.Clothing, or rather its removal and lack of it, is of centralsymbolic importance to the dream. The topic receives its fair shareof attention in NÁbulusÎ’sTa¿ÕÎr, including separate entries on120SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"articles of clothing, such as a long discussion of ‘robe’ (thawb).70Both the material worn and the colour are considered significant,wool naturally being the sign of ‘an ascetic and of calling people toasceticism in this life’, while green is a positive sign of faith. Cleanli-ness of clothing is also symbolic of purity, while dirty clothingreveals the presence of sin. Washing a robe or putting one on areindicative of changes in the dreamer’s condition, but taking offclothes receives only the brief comment: ‘Taking off dirty clothing insleep means the ending of sorrows.’71It would seem applicable tothe present case, since the company of holy men, who were clearlydivested of the clothing of sin, ended the dreamer’s connection withthe sorrows and sickness of worldly life by removing his clothes andurging him to embark upon the Way. The dream events echo olderSufi tales illustrating the need to abandon all ties to this world, tokeep nothing of the old life, not even a robe. The dream is reminis-cent, for example, of a tale told by the Persian poet FarÎd al-dÎn¿AÕÕÁr (d. 1220 )of an Arab who travelled to Persia and whoseclothes were stolen from him by a band of dervishes, who thenforced him out to wander naked through the world. The essentialmessage is the same:Risk all, and as a naked beggar roamIf you would hear that ‘Enter’ call you home.72Finally, NÁbulusÎrelates the man’s dream to himself. Although,as he informs us, the dervish had been travelling for 20 years sincethe time of his repeated visions,¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎstillmanages to interpret them as a sign that would culminate in theman’s meeting with this great saint of the age, himself.Holy gravesEncounters with the righteous dead were at least as important toNÁbulusÎas encounters with the living. Writing in theÊaqÎqaof hislongest journey, he notes that a major concern in hisriËlais toprovide descriptions of some of the prophets as well as ‘biographiesof God’s friends and the righteous, who honoured us by theirpresence at the time of our pilgrimage to them, whose sweet odoursperfumed us and whose lights illuminated us’.73NÁbulusÎvisited avast number of holy tombs in his travels, in many cases recordingsimply the location and that he recited theFÁtiËaand supplicatedGod. On other occasions he provides more detail, sometimes more121‘A NEW KIND OF MYSTICAL TRAVEL-LITERATURE’"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"description of the site, short biographical information, notes ofmiracles or of some aspect of his personal experience as a visitor tothe alleged tomb of the prophet or saint. Quite often he expresses hisfeelings in poetry, recalling his sense of awe and of the blessedness ofthe holy person’s burial place.As a saintly Sufi pilgrim himself,¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎwasprepared for communication with the holy dead at their tombs, thatthey would indeed honour him with their presence. When he writesof their sweet odours and lights, he means it literally and recollectsexperiences shared with many other pilgrims. The aroma of sanctitymay be a scent of musk or of flowers, such as jasmine and roses. Itspresence at a grave was taken to indicate that the one buried therewas truly a pure soul. Jewish and Christian pilgrims held similarviews on the odour of holiness.74NÁbulusÎ’s claims to be illuminatedby the lights of the holy dead also reflect widely reported experi-ences. For example, more than a hundred years earlier Ibn al-ÊawrÁnÎnoted of the Prophet Noah’s reputed grave at Kark nearBa¿labakk: ‘I saw the brilliant lights (anwÁr )rising from the tomb(ÅarÎË).’75Medieval Jewish writers reported comparable sights, as ina thirteenth-century account of a visit to a tomb of Ezra the Priest inan Iraqi village: ‘there goes up from his grave on certain nights anillumination that dispels the thick darkness’.76By NÁbulusÎ’s time the interest of Sufis in performing localpilgrimages (ziyÁrÁt )to holy tombs was at a peak in Ottoman Arablands, supported by official patronage of shrines. According to thefifteenth-century historian MaqrÎzÎ, the promotion of the practice ofziyÁrÁtin Egypt dates back to the early thirteenth century. Christo-pher Taylor has observed that, if this is correct, ‘it would corre-spond exactly with the link betweenÕarÎqaSufism and the massfollowings the brotherhoods began to attract in the same period’.77He would consequently see encouragement of the visitation ofgraves as playing an important part in building a broad popularbase for theÕarÎqasin Egypt and also in other Islamic lands.78In thegreat cemeteries of Cairo, especially al-QarÁfa, theziyÁrabecame anorganised group activity with guides to escort pilgrim parties andguidebooks to provide information on the graves and their occu-pants, and to prescribe proper etiquette for approaching the saints.79While in Syria the cult of saints andziyÁradid not develop the large-scale organisation of Egypt, it did give rise to its own literature ofpilgrimage guides. Notable among these was the well-known workof¿AlÎal-HarawÎ(d. 1215), a compendium of information on holysites in various Islamic countries, including HarawÎ’s native Syria.80122SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Ottoman period saw the production of guides to local tombsand shrines. On Damascus and its environs, three are noteworthyfrom the sixteenth to seventeenth centuries: that of Ibn al-ÊawrÁnÎfrom around 1562 and two later imitations by QÁÅÎMaËm×d al-¿AdawÎ(d. 1623) and YÁsÎn al-BiqÁ¿Î(d. 1684).81NÁbulusÎobviously owes a debt to such guides for pilgrims. Attimes he quotes from them in his descriptions of tombs, includinginformation on alternative burial sites where the authenticity of agrave’s attribution is open to question. Similarly, he cites and quotesfrom the late medievalfaÅÁ’illiterature on the ‘merits’ of cities suchas Jerusalem, and also makes use of general and local histories,geographical and biographical works. Parts of theÊaqÎqa, in partic-ular, may read very much like a pilgrimage guide, when NÁbulusÎproduces lists of graves in famous cemeteries, such as al-QarÁfa inCairo. However, there is usually a more personal engagement, aclearer sense of his spiritual participation in the visitation of a holygrave. This is especially in evidence when he performsziyÁrato anindividual, and sometimes isolated, sanctuary away from the greatcity cemeteries, or when he visits the tomb of a ‘friend of God’ towhom he feels some special attachment.Sufi saints of southern PalestineThe tomb of¿AlÎb.¿Ulaym at Ars×f on the coast of southern Pales-tine was both an isolated sanctuary and the burial place of a saintwith whom NÁbulusÎalready had some connection. The saint’sspirit had supposedly visited him at JinÎn three years beforeNÁbulusÎdecided to return the visit by performingziyÁrato hisgrave during the long journey of 1693. His account of theziyÁraisof particular interest, as it combines information on¿AlÎb.¿Ulaymand his shrine with the personal responses of NÁbulusÎand hiscompanions to the experience of the pilgrimage.On leaving the town of Ramla on the eightieth day of his travels,NÁbulusÎmentions his intention to visit the saint and gives somebackground on Shaykh¿AlÎand the esteem in which he was held.82He quotes at some length from a history of Palestine composed by¿Abd al-RaËmÁn al-¿UlaymÎ(d. 1521).83After remarking on¿AlÎb.¿Ulaym’s noble descent from Caliph¿Umar b. al-KhaÕÕÁb,¿UlaymÎrecorded that it was indeed a miracle that even European Christiansbelieved in his holiness. He adds: ‘I have been informed that, whenthe Franks are at sea and approaching his grave, they bare theirheads and bow towards him.’84Neither¿UlaymÎnor NÁbulusÎ123‘A NEW KIND OF MYSTICAL TRAVEL-LITERATURE’"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"consider any other explanation for the Christians baring their headswhile facing east, presumably praying in the direction of Jerusalem.For the Muslim authors, they must be honouring the Sufi saint and itis an indication of Shaykh¿AlÎ’s holiness that even the unbelieversrecognise his virtues. NÁbulusÎfurther quotes¿UlaymÎon the highregard of the great Maml×k Sultan al-ØÁhir Baybars (r. 1260-77)for the saint, who had died almost 200 years earlier. Baybars, on hisway to conquer this part of Palestine, had visited the shrine andsupplicated God at the grave to give victory to his Muslim army.This was taken as another sign of¿AlÎb.¿Ulaym’s important posi-tion as a saint. A further indication of this was the large number ofpilgrims attending the annual summer festival at the shrine andmaking endowments (awqÁf). Finally, NÁbulusÎrelays¿UlaymÎ’sdescription of the extensive restoration of the sanctuary in the latefifteenth century.85This included replacing a wooden with a marblecover for the grave and building a tower on the west side nearest thesea, equipped with weaponry to fight the European Christians.Given this background, the reader of theÊaqÎqais prepared forthe account of NÁbulusÎ’s ownziyÁra. He was accompanied bynotables from Ramla, including a descendant of the saint, ShaykhAb×’l-HudÁ, in addition to the party travelling with him to Gazaand Egypt. He describes the sanctuary as lying far from any habita-tion in unpopulated country near the seashore.86There was aspacious courtyard surrounded by walls and a gate that was lockedwhen no visitors were expected. It had to be unlocked for NÁbulusÎand his party. NÁbulusÎ’s description of the shrine is simple, but hisaccount is characterised by a strong sense of being in the presence ofholiness. When the gate was opened, lights shone out from the gravein broad daylight. At other sites this might only be perceived tohappen at night,87so the illumination of the grave by day testified tothe great sanctity of¿AlÎb.¿Ulaym. ThemiËrÁbat the marblebuilding appeared to be full of revealed and hidden mysteries, while‘fragrant breezes’, the odour of sanctity, bore witness to the puresoul that had been accepted by God.If further evidence were needed of the true sainthood of¿AlÎb.¿Ulaym, it was demonstrated by the answering of NÁbulusÎ’sprayers. His son IsmÁ¿Îl had travelled with him as far as Sidon, butleft him there to return to Damascus at his mother’s request. AtShaykh¿AlÎ’s grave NÁbulusÎsupplicated God to move his son torejoin him on the journey and accompany him on theËajj. He recallsthat the answer was immediate. IsmÁ¿Îl left Damascus that very dayand a few days later joined his father at Gaza. NÁbulusÎadds that124SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"other prayers were answered because he supplicated God at thegrave, but he never prayed for¿AlÎb.¿Ulaym to intercede as a moreordinary pilgrim might have done.NÁbulusÎalso reports three remarkable events relating to thisziyÁra. The first two are closely connected and concern the tomband his own presence there. First, on his arrival, he remarks that oneof his companions found a piece of paper on the grave and, writtenon it, words of welcome to NÁbulusÎand calling on God to facilitatehisËajj. He does not admit this as a miracle, but comments that Godknows best about the matter. Perhaps he had some suspicion thatthe message might not be from the dead saint, but from one of hisown party or someone else aware of his intended visit. No-one hadbeen to the shrine for a long time and this explained for him thesecond event, the discovery that bees had entered the offering boxby the shaykh’s head and had made their honeycombs in it.NÁbulusÎate the honey and believed that he acquiredbarakafromit, a normal expectation for a pilgrim on taking something that hadbeen in contact with the holy person or place. Similarly, on visiting agrave at Ramla, NÁbulusÎfound sweet yellow dates on the tomb.88Such cases seem to show saints offering hospitality to their guests,the pilgrims.The third strange event concerned one of NÁbulusÎ’s companionswho had lost his copper inkwell in the grass by the road on the wayto the shrine. He called upon the saint: ‘O SayyidÎ¿AlÎb.¿Ulaym,restore this inkwell to me, for I have come to visit you in your sanc-tuary.’89The inkwell was returned some time later in Egypt andNÁbulusÎinterprets this as occurring through thebarakaof Shaykh¿AlÎ. However, there is a marked difference in his own behaviour insupplication and that of his companion. NÁbulusÎonly calls uponGod for assistance, presumably because he is himself a saint and sodoes not need the help of¿AlÎb.¿Ulaym. All three events testify toShaykh¿AlÎ’s sainthood, but the first two, in particular, also pointto Shaykh¿AlÎ’s recognition and honouring of¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎas another great saint. The company stayed overnight atthe shrine and only left at noon the following day.A son of¿AlÎb.¿Ulaym and two of his grandsons were alsoburied in southern Palestine at sites revered as holy and objects ofziyÁra.90NÁbulusÎalso writes of the lights illuminating thesegraves. He notes of¿AlÎ’s grandson, Shaykh ‘IjlÎn, that his grave bythe sea was open to the sky with no building over it. Once againNÁbulusÎappears as the honoured guest of the saint, since duringhisziyÁraa boy brings him a basket of sweet figs and another125‘A NEW KIND OF MYSTICAL TRAVEL-LITERATURE’"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"brings a bunch of double narcissus. He describes the figs as ‘thebanquet of Shaykh ‘IjlÎn’.91It is yet another case of mutual recogni-tion among Sufi saints.At the tombs of Ibn¿ArabÎand Ibn al-FÁriÅIn all hisriËlasexcept for the last, NÁbulusÎrecords at the beginningthat he performedziyÁrÁtto the holy graves of the Damascene ceme-teries and to his spiritual father, Ibn¿ArabÎ.InÊullatal-dhahabandtheÊaÅrathis receives a brief mention.92In theÊaqÎqaNÁbulusÎwrites at greater length of his visit to the tomb of his beloved GreatShaykh atÐÁliËiyya.93Even if he had had no special connection tothe famous scholarly saint, the mausoleum was such an importantplace of pilgrimage at this time that it would have been odd for himto write of visits to the righteous dead and not perform theziyÁraorrecord it.In NÁbulusÎ’s day Ibn¿ArabÎ’s tomb was visited by manyTurkish, as well as Arab, pilgrims since Sultan SelÎm I had rescuedthe site from a long period of neglect. The sultan, after his conquestof Syria in 1516, arranged for the urgent construction of a newmausoleum and mosque to promote the position of Ibn¿ArabÎasan effective patron saint of the Ottoman dynasty. On 5 February1518 he rode in person to inaugurate the prestigious new build-ings atÐÁliËiyya.94But why was the sultan so concerned to asso-ciate himself and the Ottoman state with the great Sufi master?Ryad Atlagh has posited that SelÎm sought legitimacy forOttoman rule by the annexation of important religious symbols:the caliphate, the earth’s sacred centre at Mecca and the Seal ofthe Saints represented by Ibn¿ArabÎ.95Barbara von Schlegell alsonotes the usefulness to the Ottomans of having Ibn¿ArabÎontheir side in the struggle with the Safavid ShÎ¿ÎShahs of Persia andconcludes:It would be far too simple to say that the Ottomans usedIbn¿ArabÎand the saints to fight the Safavids and theirimamology, but it is fair to say that SalÎm’s glorification ofIbn¿ArabÎ, who was believed to have predicted the Otto-mans’ greatness at the end of time was a decidedly Sunnimanipulation of the power of the unseen world.96While Sultan SelÎm and the Ottomans had no actual Sunni monopolyover Ibn¿ArabÎ, since there were also ShÎ¿Îs who believed in his126SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"sainthood, the sultan certainly appeared to be in a great hurry toassert his claims to the Great Shaykh’s protection of his Islamic state.¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎnotes briefly in theÊaqÎqahis ownvisit to the tomb and refers the reader to a short treatise that hewrote in 1678 on the proper Sufi etiquette to be followed in theziyÁra. He had entitled ital-Sirr al-mukhtabÎfÎÅarÎËIbn al-¿ArabÎ(The Hidden Secret Concerning the Tomb of Ibn al-¿ArabÎ).97NÁbulusÎexplains that there are two different approaches to thegrave and the choice of approach is significant as an indication ofthe spiritual state of the pilgrim. He writes that the most blessed wayto enter is via a garden ‘crossed by a stream of propitious water’.98The garden represents theÊaqÎqa, the ultimate truth, and the visitorwho takes this way to the shrine finds the tomb in an elevated posi-tion and knows the superiority of the saint. He will thenexperience the felicity of both worlds and will discover thetomb of the Great Shaykh, the Crimson Sulphur, may Allahsanctify his spirit and illumine his sepulchre, in the highestsummit, and will behold the stream of life eternal and gainthe fruits of happiness everlasting.99However, the visitor who goes first to the mosque that representstheSharÎ¿a, and then descends to perform theziyÁra, will see thetomb below him and wrongly act as though he is superior to thesaint.He will turn aside, deny, criticize and be contemptful. Thatis then his state as contemplated in the Shaykh’s mirror.Despite this he is in need of the water of life, which he mustextract by means of the well of thought situated in thatgarden so that his presence be perfect and his humilityconsummate.100NÁbulusÎpresents a brief biography of Ibn¿ArabÎin theÊaqÎqaaccount, lists some of his own writings on the Shaykh and producesa poem for the occasion.101He also records the experience of one ofhis friends who, on the following night, dreamt of Ibn¿ArabÎandheard the Great Shaykh recite new verses of his own composition.The dreamer committed them to memory, wrote them down andpassed them on to NÁbulusÎ.102It seems that he accepted theirauthenticity as a true message from the world of truth.Another major Sufi shrine that made a deep impression on‘A NEW KIND OF MYSTICAL TRAVEL-LITERATURE’127"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"NÁbulusÎwas that of the poet Ibn al-FÁriÅin Cairo. In theÊaqÎqahe describes two visits that he made to the tomb and its associatedmosque.103In both cases he attended sessions ofdhikron a Fridayafternoon after the midday prayer and notes the emotional crowdspacking the mosque. Following Qur’Án recital and prayers of suppli-cation, singers (munshid×n )began to sing poems of Ibn al-FÁriÅ,weeping and being seized with ecstasy. He writes of the effect on thecrowd and on himself:Everyone was humble, weeping and sighing from the inten-sity of a spiritual state, great ecstasy, humility and submis-sion. So someone would shout, ‘Repeat!’ And so the singerwould repeat what he had said. Then another would shout it,and he would repeat it, and so on until I and those with usfrom the group were seized by an intense spiritual state.104NÁbulusÎwas aware that not everyone shared his deep respect forthe Sufi poet and the events at his tomb. He encountered Turkishcritics, perhaps from the anti-SufiÜÁÅÎzÁdelÎmovement, who wereopposed to the audition (samÁ¿ )at the shrine, but observes that eventhey were overwhelmed by a spiritual state on attending themosque. He remarks on meeting one of them who asked himwhether the audition was actually permissible. NÁbulusÎwrites: ‘ButI would not talk to him, and I calmly endured him until the auditionbegan. Then he was seized by a spiritual state and I have not seenhim since.’105Apart from the tombs of Ibn¿ArabÎand Ibn al-FÁriÅ,NÁbulusÎvisited many other Sufi tombs and alleged tombs, some of whichwere unlikely burial sites. An example of a falsely attributed graveto which he performedziyÁrais that of Ab×YazÎd al-BisÕÁmi (d.874 )at Rastan on the way toÊamÁ.106The better-known grave is atBisÕÁm in northern Iran. Although NÁbulusÎis aware of the BisÕÁmsite, it is characteristic of him that he does not rely wholly on histor-ical evidence in ascertaining authenticity, but is also guided in hisjudgement by his own mystical experience. Thus he writes of Ab×YazÎd’s supposed grave at Rastan that ‘over him and his grave thereis splendour and awe, asserting his presence there’.107Ultimately,although NÁbulusÎ’sriËlasare not always infused with mysticism,he gives such importance to mystical experience and knowledge thatit seems fair to consider his travel accounts as predominantlymysticalriËlas.128SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"7LAST YEARS INÐALIÊIYYA,1707–1731The years of NÁbulusÎ’s old age coincided with a time of tensionsand factional disputes in Damascus, by which he was personallyaffected. It was a period when the Ottoman authorities wereintent on bringing the city and its province under greater centralcontrol and, while much was achieved in this direction by theenergies of the new governors, it was not without its humancosts.1In 1706 SüleymÁn Pasha, a governor with an already fear-some reputation in theÊijÁz and Egypt, was appointed toDamascus.2During his brief tenure of office for under a year hemanaged to alienate many Damascenes by his harsh measures inforcing the closure of thes×qs and alleged extortionate demandsof money. The protests of local‘ulamÁ’on behalf of the peopleled to a number of them being exiled to Sidon.3At this timeNÁbulusÎwas driven out of his inherited teaching post at theDarwÎshiyya Madrasa, endowed by a former governor for hisgreat-grandfather IsmÁ¿Îl and his descendants.4The loss of thispost appears to be related to NÁbulusÎ’s readiness to act as aspokesman for the Damascenes.5Amidst the general unrest, the NÁbulusÎs’ old family house nearthe Umayyad Mosque had become increasingly unsafe, being situ-ated in the Perfume-Sellers’ S×q at the heart of the disturbances inthe city centre. In 1707 an incident took place there that had afurther negative impact on NÁbulusÎ’s life. A band of the imperialjanissary troops attacked one of the Damascenesayyids in the streetoutside his house and killed the man. NÁbulusÎprotested and joinedin hand-to-hand combat in which he was blinded in one eye.6Thismisfortune, in addition to his being forced from the DarwÎshiyya,triggered his decision to move with his family to the more peacefulenvironment ofÐÁliËiyya on the outskirts of the city, where hewould also have the spiritual comfort of closeness to the tomb of Ibn129"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"¿ArabÎ. He first built a simple house by the graves of the popularecstatic saint Y×suf al-QamÎnÎand his custodian Shaykh MaËm×d,who had predicted¿Abd al-GhanÎ’s great future before his birth.Shortly afterwards he moved to a new home built in an orchard areaknown as al-¿Ajamiyya.7The community ofÐÁliËiyya had been founded in the twelfth centuryon the slopes of Mount QÁsy×nbyÊanbalÎfamilies migrating from theregion of NÁblus.8Since then, the district had built up a strong reputa-tion for the personal piety of its‘ulamÁ’families as well as having aconsiderable Sufi presence. It was also a healthy and attractive location.On a visit to Damascus almost 50 years earlier, in 1660, a French trav-eller, Chevalier Laurent d’Arvieux, had remarked how many upper-classDamascenes had houses inÐÁliËiyya ‘as much for the view as for thegardens which adjoin them’.9NÁbulusÎwas in his mid-sixties at the time of the move, butremained active in teaching, spiritual guidance and writing intohis late old age. He continued to teach Sufi works, especiallythose of Ibn¿ArabÎ, in his private study circles, but also boldlyinsisted on giving public readings of the Great Shaykh’sFut×ËÁt,despite the criticisms of anti-Sufi elements in the city.10At the ageof 90 years he had reached the middle of his third presentation oftheFut×ËÁtto the people of Damascus. During the early time inÐÁliËiyya, the distinguished KhalwatÎ, Shaykh MuÑÕafÁb. KamÁlal-dÎn al-BakrÎ, was among his close disciples, studying with himthere until 1709. Until 1718 another constant companion wasMuËammad al-DikdikjÎ, a major early disciple and copyist ofmany of NÁbulusÎ’s works, noted for his fine voice in readingaloud in the study circles. A third main disciple in this period wasÊusayn al-BaytamÁnÎ, who died in 1715 after 15 years of devotedservice to the shaykh. He is representative of the less-educatedfollowers of NÁbulusÎ, whose spiritual leadership appealedacross classes.11In 1710 NÁbulusÎcompleted work on his widely read commentaryon Ibn al-FÁriÅ’s poetry, understood within the complex theosophicalframework of Ibn¿ArabÎ’s thought.12Julian Baldick notes that it might‘at first sight’ be supposed to resemble a fifteenth-century commentary‘in which earlier poetic talent is submerged in a flood of theorizing’.13However, on closer examination:one discovers that what have been called the “brotherhoodmentality” and the extreme veneration of the personal guide,already familiar from much earlier than the fifteenth century,130SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"have now invaded the higher theoretical literature and takentheir place beside abstract metaphysical speculation.14So a number of verses are explained with reference to theshaykh-murÎdrelationship andÕarÎqa-based activities.For the next 20 years¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎretained hiscommitment to expound and defend Ibn¿ArabÎ’s views and presenthis own interpretation ofwaËdat al-wuj×d. In December 1712 hedid so even for a Christian correspondent, Athanasius DabbÁs, thePatriarch of Antioch for two periods of tenure from 1686 to 1689and from 1720 to 1724.15NÁbulusÎaddresses the ex-patriarch at thetime of his letter with respect for a fellow traveller on the ‘path ofGod’, regardless of his religion in this world. In his customaryextravagant language, NÁbulusÎwrites of him as one of his‘brothers in spiritual practice, whose noble souls and subtleessences have become moons in the sky of theology’.16However,some of the anti-Sufi Muslims in Damascus were less receptivethan the Christian ‘brother’. A year later, in 1713, he wrote inpained tones of the hostility that he encountered from someTurkish opponents, whom he describes as ‘oafish Turkishstudents’ and complains: ‘They object to Sufidhikrwith raisedvoices and to rising and moving in a state of ecstasy atdhikr.’17But, whatever the problems presented by his enemies, NÁbulusÎcontinued to write commentaries and Sufi poetry, and assembled hisDÎwÁnal-ËaqÁ’iq(DÎwÁnofTruths )in the last years of his life.18Healso enjoyed widespread popular support from the Damascenes astheir ‘people’s saint’ and defender against bribery and corruption inofficial circles, and against injustice and oppression. When he wasover 80 years old, in 1722–3, he finally becameÊanafÎmuftÎof thecity by public demand, but was ousted soon afterwards through theintrigues of a jealous rival.19NÁbulusÎdied at the age of 90 years in 1731 after a short illness.20When he was prepared for burial on the day after his death, theritual washing and dressing of the body was carried out by aÊanbalÎfriend. According to one glowing obituary by the eighteenth-century chronicler Ibn Jum¿a, there had diedthequÕbof this time, the marvel of his epoch, the illustriousmystic, theimÁmof the faith, the sultan of the learned, thegreat scholar, the seal of themujtahids, my lord and master,Shaykh¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎ– may God sanctify hissoul and help us to benefit from his coming.21131LAST YEARS INÐALIÊIYYA, 1707–1731"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"All business in the city stopped on the day he died and huge crowdsgathered inÐÁliËiyya to mourn his passing. He was buried in amausoleum that he had had constructed in 1714 close to that of hisspiritual father, Ibn¿ArabÎ, the Great Shaykh, whom he so loved.132SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION‘The illustrious mystic’ and ‘sultan ofthe learned’Ibn Jum¿a, in his obituary of NÁbulusÎ, assigns to him three titlesthat refer plainly to his saintly distinction, and the chroniclerappears to give these precedence over three other titles that relate toNÁbulusÎ’s scholarly achievement. Making allowance for the flow-ery Arabic of the age, how well might these descriptions fit¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎ? It is proposed to look first at those that desig-nate him as a Sufi saint and then consider his status as a Sufi scholar.To judge by his own writings, NÁbulusÎclearly perceivedhimself as having an exalted position as a ‘friend of God’. Hewould surely have agreed with the classification of himself as ‘theillustrious mystic’ and perhaps with the view that he was ‘thequÕbof this time’, greatest saint of his age. Examining his own view ofhis life, he evidently believed himself to have been marked out forsainthood even before his birth. He claimed to have received theblessed guidance of Sufis of the past, especially Ibn¿ArabÎ, eitherthrough dreams and visions or through thebarakatransmitted bytheir writings in his youth and young manhood, leading him on thepath to ‘God’s friendship’. In his forties the visionary experience ofhis seven-year retreat brought him assurance of his favoured statusin the most authoritative manner possible, remarkable conversa-tions with God that he disclosed only to a select few in his closecircle. After emerging once more into the world in middle age, heshowed an awareness of others being led to him through the guid-ance of dreams and recognising his high status, while even the holydead welcomed him at their tombs, as in the case of his visit to thePalestinian sanctuary of¿AlÎb.¿Ulaym. As noted in the Preface,NÁbulusÎ’s grandson held that¿Abd al-GhanÎconsidered himselfas a new Seal of the Saints and, looking back over the picture of hislife that emerges here, this does not seem a particularly unlikelyclaim.133"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"This perception of NÁbulusÎas a great mystic and supreme saintof his age seems to have been shared by a widespread network ofdisciples and students, and acknowledged by many uneducatedecstatics. Moreover, he was acclaimed as the ‘people’s saint’. In thecentral Arab lands his reputation would persist into the twentiethcentury, when an ardent Palestinian defender of Sufism, Y×suf al-NabahÁnÎ(d. 1931), wrote of him as ‘the greatest Gnostic saintfrom his own age to the present day.’1Certainly there do not seemto be many rival contestants for the position ofquÕbamongNÁbulusÎ’s Arab contemporaries.The third title by which Ibn Jum¿a designates NÁbulusÎ’s saint-hood is ‘imÁmof the faith’.¿Abd al-GhanÎshared with his manydisciples the conviction that he was to play a leading role inguiding dedicated seekers on the ‘path of God’, but he was alsoconscious, at least at times in his life, of playing a wider role inguiding the ‘umma’towards true faith. At the end of his life this isindicated in his dreams of 1728 and 1730, in which he rebuilds theKa¿ba and keeps its key. He showed a deep concern with thecorruption that he perceived to be polluting Arab Muslim societyin his day. He believed passionately that he must struggle to purifyIslam and defend the vision of its true representatives, the sincereSufis. Consequently, it seems fair to regard NÁbulusÎas a Sufireformer able to lead by example as a ‘friend of God’, perhaps thendeserving the title of ‘imÁmof the faith’. However, among modernscholars he has not generally been thought to be a reformer. This isapparently because he does not exactly fit the profile of aSharÎ¿a-conscious activist, a so-called ‘neo-Sufi’ social reformer. He doesnot seem to share much in common with the new-style reformingfigures of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, such asShÁhWalÎAllÁh of Delhi (d. 1762 )in India, Usuman dan Fodio (d.1817 )in West Africa or even the famous Kurdish NaqshabandÎ,Shaykh KhÁlid al-Shahraz×rÎ(d. 1827), who himself came to live inDamascus and married a niece of one of NÁbulusÎ’s grandsons.Barbara von Schlegell observes that it is only in his dedication toÊadÎththat he bears any similarity to a neo-Sufi and that he has‘no influence on neo-Sufi reform.’2Julian Baldick remarks that heis ‘a thoroughly backward-looking figure’ and cites in support ofthis view his writings of a defensive character ‘in justification ofthe Whirling Dervishes, of the dancing and music of the Sufis ingeneral, of their use of tobacco, of “gazing at beardless boys”,’ andso on.3While NÁbulusÎmay indeed be a thoroughgoing tradition-alist, he cares passionately that all these Sufi activities should be134SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"practised with a pure heart and be free of the decadence andcorruption of the age. He also sees it as his duty to protect the inter-ests of the Muslims and to seek justice for the oppressed. Hence,while NÁbulusÎ’s reforming efforts may be rather different in char-acter from those of slightly later Sufi reformers, nevertheless theymay justify a perception of him as a saintly Sufi champion of reform.There seems little doubt that¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎrepre-sented the apex of Arab Islamic scholarly production in the seven-teenth and early eighteenth centuries. Ibn Jum¿a’s designation of himas ‘the great scholar’ and ‘sultan of the learned’ is hard to dispute,since he stands head and shoulders above most of his contemporariesin the Arab lands. The third title, ‘seal of themujtahids’, is perhapsthe most exaggerated claim. It would appear to be far too presump-tuous to suggest thatijtihÁdreached perfection with him, although itserves as a reminder that NÁbulusÎwas also a competentÊanafÎjuristand respected as such in his day. However, it is the breadth and depthof his Sufi scholarship, informed by his devotion to the study of themedieval intellectual tradition and nurtured by his visionary inspira-tion and cultivated literary talent, that makes his work particularlydistinctive and remains his most enduring legacy.NÁbulusÎ’s work as a commentator on Sufi texts, notably of Ibn¿ArabÎ, Ibn al-FÁriÅand¿Abd al-KarÎm al-JÎlÎ, would be remark-ably influential among Arabs of his day and succeeding genera-tions. For many of them, their acquaintance with the great mastersof the past would be made to a considerable extent through themystical interpretations of NÁbulusÎ. While beyond the scope ofthe present study and having been the subject of limited investiga-tion so far, further examination of these commentaries is likely tobe of value in uncovering some of the understandings of previousSufi thought circulating from NÁbulusÎ’s time through to the laterOttoman period. Study of NÁbulusÎ’s exposition of Sufi doctrine,exemplified in books such as theFatËandal-Wuj×d al-Êaqqandin shorter writings such as thefatwÁfor the ex-Patriarch ofAntioch, shows a mind heavily influenced by Ibn¿ArabÎ’s ideas andsomeone presenting himself as the protector of the Great Shaykh’sgood name. However, it is not always clear to what extentNÁbulusÎmay at times have either misunderstood Ibn ‘ArabÎorwished to take a deliberately somewhat different line on certainkey issues, and yet to present his views as being in conformity withthose of his spiritual father in order for them to gain greatercredence in a conservative society. For example, NÁbulusÎ’sthought onwaËdat al-wuj×dmay also be affected to some degree135CONCLUSION"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"by the absolute monism of Ibn Sab¿În and his school, whose workhe studied from his youth, but of whom his contemporariesremained deeply suspicious and whom he mentions by name onlyoccasionally in later life, for example inal-Wuj×d al-Êaqq.4Itwould thus be of value to investigate further the sources andnature of influence on Sufi theoretical thought, as well as any newdirections taken, in the under-explored Arabic Islamic writings ofthe late seventeenth to late eighteenth centuries. Hopefully, thiswould also shed light on the climate of critical reaction againstSufism, most forcefully represented by the Arabian WahhÁbÎs, inthe years after NÁbulusÎ’s death.However, NÁbulusÎ’s writing was not only significant for thedevelopment of Sufi theory in the Ottoman period. He has alsobeen observed to be an accomplished Sufi poet, developing anextraordinary and ingenious verbal dexterity from an early age.This is observed from his 1664 poem of praise for the Prophet,together with its commentary, and continued in the many poems ofhisDÎwÁn al-ËaqÁ’iqand in poetry contained in prose works ofliterature, such as his mysticalriËlas. Although his ornate style andlove of wordplay may have limited appeal to modern taste, it is ofspecial interest both to gain an appreciation of the literary tastes ofeducated Sufis in the pre-modern period and for NÁbulusÎ’s use ofpoems to give expression to mystical insights. Elsewhere, he wouldalso write in his elaborate prose of his personal experience ofunveiling and reaching the heights of a Sufi visionary, especiallyduring the years of his retreat. Other prose works, such asGhÁyatal-maÕl×b(on gazing on beautiful youths), have attracted partic-ular attention for his expression of strongly held and controversialviews on the Sufi practices of his day.¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎwas obviously himself a member of acultural Sufi élite, but his writing is not only important forincreased understanding of that élite and its Sufi preoccupations.TheriËlas, for example, are also of considerable interest for theinformation they offer on the Sufi life of uneducated ecstatics andpopular beliefs and practices relating to the cult of saints in theOttoman Arab lands, particularly in Syria, Palestine and Egypt. Incommon with other Sufis, NÁbulusÎacknowledged a spiritual élitethat cut across boundaries of wealth, class and education. Yet partof his work also reflects his concern to give something back as a‘people’s saint’, ‘imÁmof the faith’, to those who may be outsidethis élite. This is apparent from some of his juristic scholarship andcontributions toÊadÎthstudies. It is especially evident in his136SUFI VISIONARY OF OTTOMAN DAMASCUS"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"compilation ofTa¿ÕÎral-anÁm, his book of symbolic dream interpre-tation, to which he intends ‘everyone to have access’5at a time whenhe is experiencing his personal ‘opening’ to the truth of his owndreams and visions.¿Abd al-GhanÎal-NÁbulusÎremained, to his death and beyond, acomplex and controversial figure, inspiring love and hatred, suspi-cion and admiration among Muslims of his own and succeedinggenerations. In life he was to suffer accusations of unbelief and immo-rality and to feel compelled to defend his own reputation, and that ofhis beloved Ibn¿ArabÎand other Sufi masters, against vicious attacks.Yet he was revered by many disciples and students, and welcomedwith respect by governors,‘ulamÁ’, local notables and ecstatics wher-ever he travelled in Syria and Palestine, Egypt and theÊijÁz. He wasvenerated as a saint by many ordinary people as well as by high reli-gious dignitaries of the Ottoman state. In death he was to be a targetof anti-Sufi criticism as one who undermined true faith through hisinterpretations of the ‘infidel mystics’ and propagation of theirdoctrines, and who encouraged the extreme veneration of Sufishaykhs, tomb pilgrimages and many reprehensible innovations. Tolater Muslim modernisers he stood as the epitome of the conservativereactionary, supporting irrational beliefs in guidance through dreams,communication with the dead, saintly miracles and so on, a thoughtworld that they hoped to see swept away in the course of the march toprogress. For those who believed in the validity of Sufi mystical expe-rience, he was the greatest Sufi visionary of the Arabs from the seven-teenth century onwards, ‘the illustrious mystic’ and ‘sultan of thelearned’.137CONCLUSION"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"NOTESPreface1 See Chodkiewicz (1993), 136 and 144, n. 41 on NÁbulusÎ’s claim according tohis grandson, MuËammad KamÁl al-dÎn al-GhazzÎ.2 On TirmidhÎ’s concept of sainthood, see Radtke and O’Kane (1996), especiallythe translation ofSÎrat al-AwliyÁ’, 38–211; for discussion of this work, seeRadtke, ‘The concept ofWilÁyain early Sufism,’ in Lewisohn (1999), 483–96.3 Ibid., 493.4 Ibn¿ArabÎquoted in Chodkiewicz (1993), 120.5 Ibn¿Abd al-SalÁm quoted in Knysh (1999), 72.Chapter 11 See Perlmann (1986), 407–10.2OnY×suf al-QamÎnÎand other marginal holy men, see Chamberlain (1994),130–3 and Bosworth (1976), 1: 121–2 on QamÎnÎand 111–15 on thisreligious underclass.3 Geoffroy (1995), 331, n. 157.
