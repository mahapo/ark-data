This book examines the work of a scholar of this discipline, al-Hārith al-Muḥāsibī, who lived and worked during the classical Islamic period under the Abbāsids. Although al-Muḥāsibī was well known for his skills in many disciplines, including the Qur’ān, Prophetic narration and scholastic theology, it is his mastery in the fi eld of Islamic spirituality and moral psychology for which he is best remembered. Assessing the extent to which the political, social and economic factors played a part in his life and work, Gavin Picken provides a comprehensive overview of his work and its great signifi cance in the development of Islamic spirituality. Reconstructing his life in chronological order and providing the most comprehensive appraisal of his works to date, it explores a facet of al-Muḥāsibī’s teaching which as yet has not been studied, namely his understanding, concept and methodology regarding the purifi cation of the soul within the Islamic para-digm. As such, it will be of great interest not only to researchers and students of Sufi sm but also to scholars of comparative spirituality and mysticism.Gavin Picken is Lecturer in Islamic Studies and Arabic at the University of Edinburgh. His research focuses on the evolution of Islamic intellectual history in the formative period and he has published a number of articles in the areas of Islamic jurisprudence, theology, and Islamic spirituality and mysticism."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Routledge Sufi seriesGeneral Editor: Ian Richard NettonProfessor of Islamic Studies, University of ExeterThe Routledge Sufi Series provides short introductions to a variety of facets of the subject, which are accessible both to the general reader and the student and scholar in the fi eld.

More specifi cally, world reli-gions have contributed greatly to this debate, furnishing a great deal of discussion from their own unique theological and philosophical perspectives. In this sense, Islam is no different and it too has a fully developed concept of the soul based on scriptural tradition. In addition, however, not only the idea of the soul is alluded to in Islam, but also the notion of its purifi cation through a process of spiritual development. Despite the principle of purifi cation of the soul (tazkiyat al-nafs) being central to Islam, relatively little attention was given to it in the formative period in terms of written compilation, if compared to the vast volumes devoted to, say, Qurʾānic exegesis (al-tafsīr), Prophetic narration (al-ḥadīth) or Islamic jurisprudence (al-fi qh). Moreover, much of what has been written has been within the general precepts of what is now termed al-taṣawwuf, or Sufi sm, and much of this work has been concerned with the post-Ghazzālī (d. 505/1111) period. Nevertheless, several authors devoted their time and energy to writing on this topic and, indeed, the concept of tazkiyat al-nafs had been developed prior to the advent of al-Ghazzālī. One of the most infl uential scholars in the pre-Ghazzālī period who wrote on a primordial form of Islamic spirituality was the second-/eighth-century Islamic scholar Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Ḥārith b. Asad al-Muḥāsibī, who was born in Basra around 165/782 but later resided in Baghdad, albeit with a period of exile in Kūfa, until his death in 243/857. Al-Muḥāsibī was known for his skills in many disciplines, including the sciences associated with the Qurʾān, Prophetic narration (ḥadīth) and scholastic theology (ʿilm al-kalām), but it is for his mastery in the fi eld of Islamic spirituality and moral psychology that he is remembered. Regardless of his favourable notoriety, especially in later Sufi apologetic works, he was not without criticism, being repudiated by Imām Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal (d. 242/856) for his ‘unorthodox’ views and reviled by Aḥmad’s subsequent follow-ers Abū Zurʿa al-Rāzī (d. 264/878), Ibn al-Jawzī (d. 597/1201) and ʿAbd al-Raḥīm ʿIrāqī (d. 806/1403). In spite of this, he was a prolifi c writer, reportedly authoring more than 200 works, the most famous of which is perhaps Kitāb al-Riʿāya li Ḥuqūq Allāh. It was this latter, monumental work which drew the attention of the West in the form of the British scholar Margaret Smith (d. 1970), who was the fi rst European"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2 Introductionresearcher to address the life and works of this great exponent of tazkiya in depth. This is not to say that al-Muḥāsibī has been exhausted as an area of research, however, as many of his works have been preserved and, indeed, have been published, edited and annotated since the pioneering work of Smith. Thus, in an attempt to shed further light on this under-discussed facet of the Islamic tradition, this book comprises an examination of the linguistic and termi-nological usage of the terms tazkiya and al-nafs to determine an accurate under-standing of these concepts. In addition, it provides an extensive survey of the available biographical and historical sources to produce an accurate and compre-hensive account of this unique and extraordinary scholar’s life, including a study of the historical period in which al-Muḥāsibī lived, to assess the extent to which the political, social and economic factors played a part in his life and work. More-over, due to the large number of works produced by this prolifi c author and their importance, the latter part of this book will be concerned with an assessment of al-Muḥāsibī’s works to determine the writer’s understanding and methodology regarding the spiritual process of development termed tazkiyat al-nafs. Before we start, however, it is deemed useful to provide the reader with an outline of the research previously carried out in this fi eld,1 so as to acquaint them with the depth of scholarship regarding al-Muḥāsibī, as well as to defi ne the scope of the present work.Al-Muḥāsibī studies2The fi rst and most obvious works to mention regarding al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī are those of the author himself. However, since these works will be dealt with specifi -cally in Chapter 3, they will not be mentioned here and, thus, this leaves us with the works related to al-Muḥāsibī, which will be summarised in the following paragraphs.1‘Notice of the Writings of Abū ʿAbdullah al-Ḥārith b. Asad al-Muḥāsibī, the fi rst Ṣūfī Author’ by D. S. Margoliouth in Transaction of the Third International Congress for the History of Religions (Oxford: 1908). In this paper the author begins by introducing al-Muḥāsibī, indicating the sources where his biographical details can be found and then giving a summarised version of this material. Margo-liouth then numbers al-Muḥāsibī’s works and where they can be found. The content of these works is then described, to which the author attributes Ashʿarite3 tenden-cies to al-Muḥāsibī and proposes that his works are from improvised sermons.4 An interesting observation is made regarding al-Muḥāsibī’s use of Christian sources, suggesting that the author had direct contact with them. Margoliouth then compares al-Muḥāsibī to later scholars, alludes to his infl uence upon them and shows that al-Muḥāsibī’s works are free from many of the Sufi doctrines which developed later. However, the most interesting statement is that al-Muḥāsibī is the fi rst ‘Sufi ’ author who had written works attributed to him.5"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction 32An Early Mystic of Baghdad by Margaret Smith (London: The Sheldon Press, 1935). This is perhaps the most well-known, if not the most important work to be carried out and, as such, requires an in-depth discussion. This work is extremely thorough, being over 300 pages long and consisting of 14 chapters. The fi rst three chapters of Early Mystic are concerned with the biographical details of al-Muḥāsibī’s life and provide information regarding where he was born, his envi-ronment, his ‘conversion’ to taṣawwuf and those who surrounded him, whether they were teachers, students, or associates. Chapters 4 and 5 concentrate on al-Muḥāsibī’s works and the sources he uses in them. Chapter 6 deals exclusively with what Smith terms the ‘Psychological Theory’, the various ‘unseen’ aspects of tazkiya, such as the soul (al-nafs) and the heart (al-qalb). The next three chap-ters discuss various aspects of what Smith terms ‘Ascetic Theology’ where such topics as sin (dhanb), the Devil (Iblīs) and asceticism (zuhd) are discussed. The following three chapters deal with the various moral, devotional and mystical teachings of al-Muḥāsibī, covering such topics as the ‘stations’ (al-maqāmāt) and ‘states’ (al-aḥwāl), prayer (ṣalāt) and love (ḥubb). The fi nal two chapters sum-marise al-Muḥāsibī’s teaching and discuss its infl uence on later generations. Thus, it is easy to see why Smith’s work is regarded as one of the most important when discussing al-Muḥāsibī and, due to its comprehensive nature, one could argue that this is the reason why so little work has been done in this area. Despite this, however, Smith does not defi ne the methodology of al-Muḥāsibī in employing tazkiya, nor does she discuss the method he employs during his writings.3‘The forerunner of al-Ghazālī’ by Margaret Smith in The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland (January, 1936). Building on her excellent work in the above-mentioned book and in particular chapter XIV of Early Mystic, Smith consequently wrote this article showing the signifi cance of al-Muḥāsibī’s teachings through their infl uence on one of Islam’s most famous intellectual lumineries – Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazzālī. Starting from the perspective that al-Ghazzālī himself admits to reading the works of al-Muḥāsibī in his al-Munqidh min al-Ḍalāl and the fact that there is considerable similarity between al-Muḥāsibī’s Kitāb al-Tawahhum and al-Ghazzālī’s al-Durra al-Fākhira, Smith proceeds to make a further comparison between the content of Iḥyāʾ and a variety of al-Muḥāsibī’s works, with particular attention being paid to al-Waṣāyā and al-Riʿāya. Smith constructs her comparative analysis around a variety of positive moral qualities such as sincerity (ikhlāṣ) and truthfulness (ṣidq), which formed the basis of the maqām system in later Sufi sm, as well as a number of moral defi cien-cies such as conceit (ʿujb) and self-delusion (ghurūr). To this extent Smith’s appraisal is erudite and relatively comprehensive and she concludes that, although al-Ghazzālī was an outstanding scholar in his own right, his reliance on al-Muḥāsibī is considerable. As such, this article is extremely important as it establishes the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4 Introductionimportance of al-Muḥāsibī as an original thinker and, in addition, shows to some extent the infl uence of his thought on later generations.4Al-Moḥāsibī – Un Mystique Musulman Religieux Et Moraliste6 by Abd-El-Halim Mahmoud (d. 1398/1978)7 (Librarie Orientaliste Paul Geuthner: Paris) in 1940. This work is a published Ph.D thesis, written by the above-mentioned author under the supervision of the renowned French scholar Louis Massignon and is divided into four main parts: the fi rst part deals with al-Muḥāsibī’s biography and works, being separated into three subsequent chapters; chapter one examines the social milieu of al-Muḥāsibī and assesses its effect upon him, as well as surveying other external infl uences, which may have played their part in affecting his thought; chapter two deals with the works of al-Muḥāsibī and is useful in the sense that it provides a chronological classifi cation of the books he wrote; chapter three concludes this part of the research and is concerned with the interpretive method used by al-Muḥāsibī when examining the Qurʾān. Part two contains one chapter only – chapter four – and deals with al-Muḥāsibī’s religious theory, including his concept of God, his attitude towards sects and rituals, religious obli-gations (al-farāʾiḍ ) and meritorious acts (al-nawāfi l ), and concludes with his interpretation of repentance and eschatology. Part three discusses al-Muḥāsibī’s moral system, including his ethico-psychological system of human nature and the factors which affect this, such as al-nafs, Satan, vanity (al-ʿujb), arrogance (al-kibr), envy (al-ḥasad ) and delusion (al-ghirra), as well as discussing the topic for which he is best known – ‘introspective examination’ (al-muḥāsaba). The thesis concludes with part four in which the author discusses al-Muḥāsibī’s ascetical and mystical theory within Chapter six. This chapter deals with the various qualities required by the mystic, including reliance on God (al-tawakkul ), scrupu-lousness (al-waraʿ), asceticism (al-zuhd ), contentment (al-riḍā) and divine love (al-maḥabba). Thus, this work is also of great importance as it systematically discusses the religious, moral and mystical teachings of al-Muḥāsibī.5Kitāb al-Riʿāya li Ḥuqūq Allāh by al-Muḥāsibī: a translation with introduction and notes by Kermit A. Schoonover, which was submitted as a Ph.D. dissertation to Harvard University in 1948.6‘Al-Muḥāsibī and his al-Riʿāyah’ by Kermit A. Schoonover in The Muslim World (39, 1949), pp. 26–35. This article would seem to be a summary of the author’s achievements in the previously mentioned work and is divided into three sections: A. Life and works of al-Muḥāsibī, B. Al-Muḥāsibī and the Development of Muslim Mysticism and C. A Summary of ‘Kitāb al-Riʿāyah’. The fi rst section deals with"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction 5the biographical data surrounding al-Muḥāsibī’s life and provides little which is new, reiterating his dispute with Aḥmad and confi rming his Ashʿarite tendancy. In addition to this, it provides a brief mention of the number of works written by al-Muḥāsibī8 and the reason behind the author’s choice of Kitāb al-Riʿāya.9 In the second section Schoonover identifi es the importance of al-Muḥāsibī’s position within the overall development of Islamic mysticism saying:For some time scholars have been aware of al-Muḥāsibī and his works, but his position in the history of Muslim mysticism has yet to be adequately recognised. From the point of view of date, geographic location, number of existing works, the quality of writing and the nature of his ideas, al-Muḥāsibī is in a key position to supply information for the understanding of early Islamic mysticism.10The author then discusses the differences between al-Muḥāsibī and the later Sufi s, with regard to the concept of dhikr, samāʿ/istimāʿ, zuhd and the purpose of the mystic, which Schoonover asserts differs greatly. He moves on to discuss the rela-tionship beween differing types of mysticism in the Near East and their infl uence on al-Muḥāsibī. He refutes the concept that al-Muḥāsibī’s teachings are based on Chris-tian sources but concludes that, although al-Muḥāsibī’s thought is essentially Islamic, an indirect Christian infl uence could not be ruled out.11 In the third and fi nal section Schoonover summarises al-Muḥāsibī’s thought and teaching, as found in his most famous work Kitāb al-Riʿāya, and concludes the article with a translation from it.127Die Gedankenwelt des Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī by Josef van Ess in Theologie (vol. 4, Bonn, Selbstverlag des Orientalischen Seminars der Universität Bonn, 1961). Bearing in mind van Ess’s meticulous scholarship, his reputation in the fi eld of Islamic studies and the depth of the study in question, this work, along with the efforts of Smith and Mahmoud, can be considered one of the most important. Van Ess’s work is extremely well structured and begins with a discussion of ‘al-Muḥāsibī’s Life and Works’ (Leben und Werk), which encompasses his ‘con-version’, his relationship with the traditionists (ahl al-ḥadīth) and the dispute with the Ḥanbalites, as well as the sources quoted in his works and the problem of their chronology and authenticity. The second major part of the book, ‘the Human Being’ (Der Mensch), is divided into three sections, namely: ‘al-Muḥāsibī’s psychology’ (Die Psychologie al-Muḥāsibīs), which includes an examination of the heart (al-qalb) and the self (al-nafs), ‘the World and the Self ’ (Die Welt des Ich), where various negative human characteristics such as heedlessness (al-ghafl a) and ostentation (al-riyāʾ) are discussed and ‘the Confl ict of the Intellect against the Self ’ (Der Kampf des Verstandes gegen das Ich), where the intellect (al-ʿaql ), knowledge (al-ʿilm) and various other esoteric qualities such as sincerity (al-ikhlāṣ) and patience (al-ṣabr) and their interrelationships with the ego are examined. The third part, ‘God and the Human Being’ (Gott und Mensch), is further divided into three sections and includes: ‘Outward Knowledge’ (Die äußere Erkenntnis), which"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"6 Introductiondiscusses issues such as faith (al-īmān) and the debates surrounding God’s exist-ence and His attributes (al-ṣifāt), ‘the Inner Encounter’ (Die innere Begegnung), where such issues as remembrance (al-dhikr), spiritual audience (al-samāʿ) and the Qurʾān are examined and ‘the “Friends of God”’ (‘Die “Freunde Gottes”) where love of the divine (al-maḥabba) and God’s elect (al-awliyāʾ) are discussed. As can be deduced from the discussion above, van Ess’s treatise is comprehensive, which makes it a major source work in the study of al-Muḥāsibī.8‘Two works of al-Muḥāsibī’ by Ahmed Ateş in Festschrift Werner Castel: zum siebzigsten Geburstag 5 März 1966 gewidmet von Freunden und Schülern, ed. von Erwin Gräf (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1968), pp. 37–42. This article concerns two of al-Muḥāsibī’s previously undiscovered works extant in manuscript form enti-tled Kitāb Fahm al-Qurʾān wa Maʿānīh and Kitāb al-Qaṣd ilā Allāhi Taʿālā. Thus, the main goal of Ateş’s study is to present a basic description of these manuscripts and a succinct discussion of their contents.139‘Al-Junayd wa ’l-Muḥāsibī’ by ʿAbd al-Ḥalīm Maḥmūd in al-Jadīd (Cairo: September 1974), pp. 12–13. Despite the title, very little of this article is actually devoted to the relationship between al-Muḥāsibī and his principal student al-Junayd, apart from a few anecdotal statements from the biographical sources, which will be dealt with later in Chapter 2. Rather, Maḥmūd discusses the histori-cal features of the period and the open dispute between the ‘orthodox’ represented by the Traditionists (ahl al-ḥadīth) and the ‘rationalists’, represented by the Muʿtazila. This ‘natural’ confl ict as Maḥmūd terms it was indicative of two irrec-oncilable approaches to which al-Muḥāsibī added a third – the use of rational methods to defend ‘orthodoxy’, which ultimately alienated him from both fac-tions. Nevertheless, Maḥmūd posits that this ‘third’ method enabled him to produce some of the most important books in the Islamic tradition that pioneered the exploration of moral psychology and Sufi sm in general, which is witnessed by the many praiseworthy comments Maḥmūd closes his article with.10‘Comment comprendre le Coran selon Muḥāsibī (m. 243/857)’ by Michel Allard in Bulletin D’Études Orientales, Institut Français de Damas, Tome XXIX (1977), pp. 7–16. This article begins by sketching the background and life of al-Muḥāsibī before turning its attention to his major work on the Qurʾān – Kitāb Fahm al-Qurʾān. Thus, Allard provides a brief exposition of theological underpinnings that al-Muḥāsibī provides to affi rm the status of Islam’s primary text within the context of the third–ninth century debates regarding the nature of revelation."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction 711‘Étude stylistique du Kitāb al-Tawahhum le livre de la vision des Fins Dernières d’al Muḥāsibī’ by André Roman in Bulletin D’Études Orientales, Institut Français de Damas, Tome XXXI (1979), pp. 167–266. In this study Roman provides little more than a rudimentary, yet comprehensive, linguistic commentary on his previously published translation of al-Muḥāsibī’s Kitāb al-Tawahhum.12‘Islam and conservation: the theologian-ascetic al-Muḥāsibī’ by L. Librande in Arabica, Tome 30, Fasc. 2 (June 1983), pp. 125–46. The primary goal of Librande’s article is to provide a translation of al-Muḥāsibī’s Kitāb al-ʿIlm but, at the same time, he also begins the article with a discussion of how al-Muḥāsibī attempted to preserve – or as he puts it – conserve a form of religious piety deeply rooted in the concept of ‘tradition’. He suggests that it is within this scenario that al-Muḥāsibī attempts to utilise revelation in the form of the Qurʾān and ḥadīth as the very basis of knowledge (ʿilm) and conse-quently, build on this foundation with action (ʿamal ). Librande concludes the study section of his article with a brief exposition of the content of al-Muḥāsibī’s Kitāb al-ʿIlm and attempts to show how this fi ts within al-Muḥāsibī’s theoretical framework of religious piety.13‘Al-muṣṭalaḥ ladā al-Ḥārith ibn Asad al-Muḥāsibī 165–243’ by Ḥusayn al-Quwwatlī in al-Fikr al-Islāmī (Lebanon: December, 1983), pp. 53–9. Before embarking on his critical edition of al-Muḥāsibī’s al-Qaṣd wa ’l-Rujūʿ ilā Allāh,14 al-Quwwatlī provided a preliminary study of the technical terminology used in al-Muḥāsibī’s works. He begins by discussing the diffi culties of studying the books of al-Muḥāsibī, this being partly due to the specifi c technical vernacular he uses and thus, the need for an explanation of its’ usage. Al-Quwwatlī’s discussion therefore concerns the period in which al-Muḥāsibī lived, as this was a period in which many of the Islamic sciences came to fruition in a technical sense, to examine al-Muḥāsibī’s technical use of the language and to summarise his overall methodology. Al-Quwwatlī also gives credit to Massingon, Ritter, van Ess and Roman for their efforts in this fi eld previously and concludes that within al-Muḥāsibī’s writing style four major devices can be identifi ed: fi rst, the use of defi nitions (al-taʿrīf) in which he attempts to isolate the essence (al-māhiyya) of the subject in question. Secondly, the inference (al-tafrīʿ) of further information derived from the original defi nition; thirdly, the generation (al-tawlīd) of ideas and concepts from those just mentioned and fi nally, his use of the term ‘al-ʿaql ʿan Allāh’ to denote an intrinsic, divinely inspired perception of a subject, whether it be ethical, psychological, social or metaphysical. Bearing in mind the above discussion, it is clear this article is an essential tool for anyone who wants to gain a greater insight into the works of al-Muḥāsibī."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"8 Introduction14‘Taḥlīl ẓāhirat al-ḥasad ʿind al-Muḥāsibī’ by Ḥāmid Ṭāhir in Dirāsāt ʿArabiyya wa Islāmiyya (Cairo: Maktabat al-Zahrāʾ, 1983), pp. 26–43. This particular article focuses on al-Muḥāsibī’s treatment of the human characteristic of envy (al-ḥasad ) as represented in his most famous work Kitāb al-Riʿāya li Ḥuqūq Allāh. As such, Ṭāhir approaches the topic by addressing essentially the same subject areas that al-Muḥāsibī adopts in his work, which include: envy and rivalry (al-ḥasad wa ’l-munāfasa), the location of envy (mawḍiʿ al-ḥasad), the motives of rivalry (dawāfi ʿ al-munāfasa), the motives of envy (dawāfi ʿ al-ḥasad) and the treatment of envy (ʿilāj al-ḥasad ). In this context Ṭāhir provides an examination, discussion and commentary on each of these subject areas interpolating his own thoughts with quotes from al-Muḥāsibī himself and other sources. Consequently, Ṭāhir has produced an excellent addition to the literature, which is extremely useful in discerning al-Muḥāsibī’s method as both an author and a moral psychologist.15‘Al-ʿIẓāt al-Ḥassān fī Shuʿab al-Īmān’ by Muṣṭafā al-Shaʿrāwī in al-Islām (Cairo: 12 June 1987, pp. 5 and 11; 19 June 1987, pp. 5 and 12 and 26 June 1987, pp. 5 and 14). These short series of articles are little more than various quotes from biographical sources and a discussion of al-Muḥāsibī’s works and writing style and as such, do not constitute a major addition to the literature other than providing an introduction to this scholar.16Al-Ḥārith ibn Asad al-Muḥāsibī: al-ʿĀlim, al-Zāhid, al-Faqīh by Kāmil Muḥammad Muḥammad ʿUwayḍa (Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyya, 1994). This work, published under the series ‘Aʿlām al-Fuqahāʾ wa ’l-Muḥaddithīn’, is a comprehensive treatise dealing with the life and teaching of al-Muḥāsibī by a contemporary scholar. Despite its comprehensive nature it suffers from a lack of organisation, as each subject is dealt with in succession, without any sectioning or catagorisation. Thus, the book contains 28 titles each dealing with a specifi c topic related to al-Muḥāsibī. The fi rst 10 sections – almost half the book – are con-cerned with the life and works of al-Muḥāsibī: thus, we fi nd the usual biographical information; his life, teachers, students and anecdotal statements are all included. The dispute with Aḥmad is also dealt with and a survey of al-Muḥāsibī’s works, including his narration of ḥadīth, is also found and this area concludes with his death. The advantage of this book is, however, that all of the above information is referenced to its origin in the Arabic literature, which is of obvious importance. The rest of the book is devoted to al-Muḥāsibī’s teaching and the author selects various aspects and discusses them with lengthy quotations from the author’s works, so as to summarise and crystallise al-Muḥāsibī’s thought and teaching in one place, which is of great service to the reader who wants to gain an overview of the scholar’s ideas, without having to read all of his works."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction 917Al-Fikr al-Tarbawī ʿind al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī submitted by Aḥmad Ḍiyāʾ al-Dīn Ḥusayn (unpublished MA thesis, Jordan: Jāmiʿat al-Yarmūk, 1990). This aca-demic thesis attempts to examine the educational theory of al-Muḥāsibī whether it be related to the etiquettes of the learner–teacher relationship or psychological and intellectual development. To this effect the author begins by providing an informed biographical section on al-Muḥāsibī and assesses the effect that his environment may have had on him. The following chapter traces the development of education until al-Muḥāsibī’s time and assesses his contribution to the overall process. The next two chapters discuss al-Muḥāsibī’s approach to both the psy-chological and intellectual development of the human being and examine the methods that this scholar employs in attempting to achieve this goal. As such this thesis is a very important addition to the literature regarding our subject as it not only examines al-Muḥāsibī’s utilisation of moral psychology as an educational means but also assesses his pedagogical skill and methodology.18Fikr al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī al-Ṣūfī fī Mīzān al-Kitāb wa ’l-Sunna submitted by Khālid b. Sulaymān al-Khaṭīb (unpublished MA thesis, Riyadh: Jāmiʿat al-Malik Saʿūd, 1997). This thesis aims to examine the doctrinal position of al-Muḥāsibī from his kalām-style works by comparing it to the creed represented by ‘ortho-dox’, Sunni Islam based on the Qurʾān and the sunna, as well as discussing to what extent this scholar differed from the teachings of contemporary and later Sufi s, in addition to assessing al-Muḥāsibī’s effect on those who came after him. To this effect al-Khaṭīb begins his thesis by providing an introduction to Sufi sm and its development and also a biographical account of al-Muḥāsibī and his works. The bulk of the thesis, however, is concerned with an examination of the Sufi concepts of station (maqām) and state (ḥāl ), where al-Muḥāsibī’s views are com-pared to those found in apologetic Sufi works such as the Risāla of al-Qushayrī and the Lumaʿ of al-Sarrāj. Finally, an assesment of al-Muḥāsibī’s effect on sub-sequent scholars is made, the two examples selected being Abu Ṭālib al-Makkī (d. 386/996) and Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazzālī (d. 505/1111). Al-Khaṭīb’s work is useful in the sense that it provides some good points and useful discussions but is ultimately limited by the adoption of an ultra-‘orthodox’ theological methodology.19Mawāʿiẓ al-Imām al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī (Beirut: al-Maktab al-Islāmī, 1999). This work, which is part of the ‘Maʿālim fī ’l-Tarbiyya wa ’l-Daʿwa’ series that examines various Muslim mystical personalities, was compiled by Ṣāliḥ Aḥmad al-Shāmī, who also produced a critical edtion of al-Muḥāsibī’s Sharḥ al-Maʿrifa wa Badl al-Naṣīḥa.15 In this book al-Shāmī has provided a brief but useful intro-duction to the life and personality of al-Muḥāsibī and arranged the work on the basis of subject areas, providing quotes from al-Muḥāsibī according to the subject"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"10 Introductionheading provided. As such, al-Shāmī has furnished the reader with a brief yet organised glimpse of the thought of al-Muḥāsibī and provided a quick reference to his teachings that is a useful addition to the literature concerned with this scholar.20‘Kitāb mā’iyyati al-‘aqli wa ma‘nāhu wa iḫtilafi al-nāsi fīhi d’ al-Ḥāriṯ b.

In this article de Crussol essentially provides a French translation of al-Muḥāsibī’s Kitāb al-ʿAql and supplements it with a brief introduction and a summarised discussion of its theoretical constructs determined in the extended study discussed below.21‘Al-Ḥārith ibn Asad al-Muḥāsibī’s Concept of Self Examination as Refl ected in His al-Riʿāyah li Ḥuqūq Allāh’ by Iftitāḥ Jaʿfar.16 This concise article consists of three main sections after a brief introduction: the fi rst section briefl y presents biographical information regarding al-Muḥāsibī; the second part briefl y intro-duces what is regarded to be al-Muḥāsibī’s greatest work – that of Kitāb al-Riʿāya li Ḥuqūq Allāh; the third section and possibly the most important, deals with al-Muḥāsibī’s concept of self-examination, or muḥāsabat al-nafs, where the author gives not only al-Muḥāsibī’s concept but also various scholarly interpreta-tions of al-Muḥāsibī’s thought.22‘Analyse du kitāb al-ghirra bi-llāh le livre de l’illusion au sujet d’Allah de Muḥāsibī (m. 243/857)’ by Yolande De Crussol in Bulletin D’Études Orientales, Institut Français de Damas, Tome LIII–LIV (2001–2002), pp. 279–92. A further addition to the literature is made by de Crussol’s discussion of the specifi c chapter concerning self-delusion (al-ghirra) from al-Muḥāsibī’s Kitāb al-Riʿāya li Ḥuqūq Allāh. De Crussol fi rst examines the structure of the chapter and then analyses how this concept fi ts within the spiritual schema of religious life, as well as how this interacts with vital notions of the intellect (al-ʿaql ) and revelation (al-waḥy). The article concludes with a comparison of the quality of self-delusion (al-ghirra) in Kitāb al-Riʿāya and al-Muḥāsibī’s Kitāb al-Waṣāyā and discusses how this conceptualisation fi ts within al-Muḥāsibī’s overall teachings as a spiritual guide.23Le Rôle de la Raison dans la Refl exion Éthique d’Al-Muḥāsibī: ʿAql et Conversion chez al-Muḥāsibī (165–243/782–857) (Consep: Paris, 2002) by Yolande de Crussol The signifi cance of de Crussol’s study lies in the fact that it is the fi rst"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction 11major monograph since van Ess’s Die Gedankenwelt. Moreover, it examines one the most critical facets of al-Muḥāsibī’s thought – the role of the intellect (al-ʿaql ) in his religious world view. With this goal in mind, de Crussol organises the study into three major sections: part one examines the nature of the intellect and how is it is an intrinsic human facet. The second part of the study revolves around the ethical theory and is reminiscent of previous studies such as those by Smith, Mahmoud and van Ess. The third part attempts to link the previous two parts and illustrates the role the intellect can play in the spiritual and ethical realms of seeking God and the hereafter. The signifi cance of de Crussol’s work is clear to see as it not only explores a little-studied aspect of al-Muḥāsibī’s teaching but also attempts to explore the intersection between the spiritual and the rational within his works.24‘Qurʾānic abrogation across the ninth century: Shafi ʿī, Abū ʿUbayd, Muḥāsibī, and Ibn Qutaybah’ by Christopher Melchert in Bernard G. Weiss (ed.), Studies in Islamic Legal Theory, Studies in Islamic Law and Society (Leiden: Brill, 2002), pp. 75–98. Building on the work of John Burton, Melchert’s contribution explores the maturing of theory of abrogation regarding the Qurʾānic text across the third–ninth centuries, by exploring the contributions of a diverse selection of scholarly writings of the period and the implications of this on later jurisprudence. With regard to al-Muḥāsibī’s contribution, Melchert utilises al-Muḥāsibī’s Kitāb Fahm al-Qurʾān and suggests that, although al-Muḥāsibī’s elaboration of abrogation is much more sophisticated than previous attempts, it would be superseded by other theories that became the foundation of later juristic expositions.Thus, in summary, despite the various entries regarding al-Muḥāsibī in the copious volumes of biographical and historical works of Islamic literature, it was not until the twentieth century that a separate, dedicated study was produced regarding al-Muḥāsibī and his life and works – this of course being the pioneering work of Margaret Smith entitled An Early Mystic of Baghdad. It was this in-depth study of al-Muḥāsibī that really introduced the English-speaking world to the value and importance of this scholar. Smith’s work is indeed admirable since she had to work almost exclusively with manuscripts and moreover, because her work is intuitive, it is extremely well written and comprehensive. This did not hinder further studies regarding al-Muḥāsibī but rather seems to have given impetus to a number of researchers of her generation such as Arberry, Mahmoud, Schoonover and al-Yasūʿī, who have all provided valuable contributions. The next major study came from the capable hands of van Ess and, along with the early work of Smith, is possibly one of the most important studies of al-Muḥāsibī. In more recent times, equally important work in the realm of bringing the works of al-Muḥāsibī to a published form have been made most notably by ʿAṭā but his work has also been supplemented by al-Khusht, al-Sayyid, Mazālī, al-Quwwatlī and Roman.

Thus, al-Muḥāsibī has generated a limited but steady stream of scholarship over the last 70 years or so but, despite this, no author has examined his specifi c methodology regarding tazkiyat al-nafs and, as such, this remains an undiscovered aspect of his thought. To assess the contribution of any historical personality, however, it is neces-sary to examine the period in which he lived so as to ascertain the effect of his social milieu upon him, before moving onto an exposition of his life and, indeed, this is the goal of the next chapter.Notes 1 Specifi c reference to research concerning tazkiyat al-nafs will not be provided here as this has been elucidated elsewhere. For a survey of a selected number of such studies see G. Picken, ‘Tazkiyat al-Nafs: The Qurʾānic Paradigm’, Journal of Qur’anic Studies, vii (2): 120–3, n. 4. 2 In addition to the works mentioned here and those of a biographical nature quoted in Chapter 2, there are numerous works which shed light on al-Muḥāsibī but are not con-cerned with him specifi cally; these include: Muḥammad Ghalāb, ‘al-Taṣawwuf wa ’l-Mutaṣawwifūn’, in Majallat al-Azhar (Cairo: 9th Ramaḍān 1357/1938) pp. 601–4; Ghalāb, ‘al-Taṣawwuf wa ’l-Mutaṣawwifūn’, in Majallat al-Azhar (Cairo: 4th Rabīʿ al-Thānī 1360/1941), pp. 235–8 and Ghalāb, ‘al-ʿAṣr al-Dhahabī li ’l-Taṣawwuf al-Islāmī’, in Majallat al-Azhar (Cairo: 2nd Ṣafar 1380/July 1960), pp. 166–70; Ibrāhīm Hilāl, al-Taṣawwuf al-Islāmī bayn al-Dīn wa ’l-Falāsifa (Cairo: Dār al-Nahḍa al-ʿArabiyya, 1979), pp. 56–84; Suʿād al-Ḥakīm, ‘Makānat al-Ghazzālī min al-ʿUlūm al-Ṣūfi yya’, in al-Turāth al-ʿArabī (Damascus: Ittiḥād al-Kuttāb al-ʿArab, January 1986), pp. 120–63; Muṣṭafā ʿAshwī, ‘al-Insān al-Kāmil fī ’l-Fikr al-Ṣūfī – Dirāsa Naqdiyya’, in al-Tajdīd (Kuala Lumpur: International Islamic University, February, 2000), pp. 11–53; Arthur J.

In addition, his own infl uence in promoting Sufi sm was also extremely signifi cant. For details regarding his life and infl uence see Ibrahim M.

Bearing in mind that individual works have been entirely dedicated to this rich historical part of history, it is diffi cult to represent in a short chapter such as this. Nevertheless, this section of the book concentrates on the factors within the reign of the ʿAbbāsids that may have directly affected the life of al-Muḥāsibī. This chapter will begin, therefore, by providing a brief impression of the ʿAbbāsids, so as to furnish the reader with an overview of the rulers of this particular period of Islamic history. Similarly, the early ʿAbbāsid period is often regarded as the ‘Golden Age’ of Islamic learning and thus an assessment of intellectual life under these caliphs will also be made. Thirdly, since al-Muḥāsibī spent his formative years in Basra and the better part of his life in Baghdad, both these geographical locations will be discussed to assess their infl uence on our author. Finally, perhaps the single most important religio-political event in this period was the miḥna, commonly termed the ‘Inquisition’, which affected religious praxis during a large proportion of al-Muḥāsibī’s life and therefore this event will also be examined.The ʿAbbāsidsThe ʿAbbāsid period covers approximately half a millennium in its entirety, span-ning the years 132/750 to 656/1258.1 Consequently, historians have commonly divided this era into three sub-periods.2 The primary era, being known as the fi rst ʿAbbāsid period (132/750–247/861),3 is generally regarded as a period of growth and prosperity, having built upon the successes of the Umayyads. This is followed by the second ʿAbbāsid period (247/861–447/1055),4 which is regarded as an era of political decline, due to the events leading to the loss of ʿAbbāsid power. Finally, there is the third ʿAbbāsid period, which includes the eventual collapse of the caliphate and the sacking of Baghdad at the hands of the Mongol horde (447/1055–565/1258).5 The ʿAbbāsids took charge of the Islamic empire from the Umayyads with the ascension to the throne of Abū ’l-ʿAbbās ʿAbd Allāh b. Muḥammad (r. 132/749–136/754), commonly known as ‘al-Saffāḥ’ (lit. ‘the blood spiller’) due to his merci-less execution of the remaining Umayyad dignitaries. The rise of the ʿAbbāsids was mainly due, on the one hand, to the lack of popularity of the Umayyads, who"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The ʿAbbāsid crucible 15were seen as a debauched, ‘pro-Arab’ aristocracy who had little regard for the welfare of their subjects, and the messianic campaign of the ʿAbbāsids for a return of authority to the house of the Prophet or ‘al-riḍāʾ min āl Muḥammad’, as they put it, on the other. Their claim to authority came through their familial link to the Prophet’s uncle al-ʿAbbās and they would later counter the ʿAlid claim to authority – since they were also of Prophetic lineage – by showing that their link was through a male relative, i.e. al-ʿAbbās and not through a female one, i.e. Fāṭima, the Prophet’s daughter, which was apparently still an important factor despite this being a supposed post-jāhilī, Arab society. This call, or daʿwa, proved very popular and gained great support in the eastern provinces generally and in Khurasān in particular. Subsequently, it would be support from this province that would bring the ʿAbbāsids to ascendancy and remain their powerbase for years to come.6 The seemingly religious overtone to their claim of legitimacy as rulers was con-solidated by their adoption of honorifi c titles synonymous with the Prophet (alqāb, sin. laqab), which was unprecedented and seemingly added to their apparent link with God and His primary worldly representative. Later, they would enhance this even further by their patronising of religious learning, which equally added to their claim of ‘orthodoxy’ and hence, legitimacy. Despite this, however, their powerbase constituted a departure from the ‘Arab aristocracy’ of the Umayyads, since the majority of their supporters were in fact of Persian origin. Thus, the early ʿAbbāsid period became synonymous with the rise of the Persian ‘clients’ or mawālī, who occupied key positions in the ʿAbbāsid administration and who seemingly ‘Persianised’ the running of the state along the lines of the old Sasanian model.7 The consolidation of ʿAbbāsid power did not lie with Abū ’l-ʿAbbās al-Saffāḥ, however, and, indeed, it was his successor Abū Jaʿfar Muḥammad ‘al-Manṣūr’ who succeeded in suppressing the ʿAlid uprisings and provided the ʿAbbāsid state with a new epicentre, Baghdad, which would remain the state capital for more than half a century to come.8 It was into this era that our subject al-Muḥāsibī is reported to have been born in 165/782 and since he died in 243/857, he lived through a considerable portion of the entire primary period of the ʿAbbāsid era. Thus, al-Muḥāsibī lived through the reign of eight ʿAbbāsid caliphs.1. Muḥammad b. al-Manṣūr, ‘al-Mahdī’ (r. 158/775–169/785)Due to the determination, energy, political acumen and renowned frugality of his father, al-Mahdī inherited an empire that was stable, powerful and richly endowed. Consequently, al-Mahdī is remembered as being generous in comparison with his father and he used the state’s substantial wealth to improve relations with the ʿAlids, by offering them generous stipends and esteemed positions. Seen as a religious ruler due to his building of mosques and patronising of the pilgrimage, al-Mahdī is also remembered for his persecution of those with anti-Islamic ten-dencies known as zindīqs. At the political level, his reign is also a period in which the ‘clients’ mawālī continue to come to prominence and there is a continuation of the expansion of the new secretarial class of civil servants known as the ‘kuttāb’, who helped defi ne the administration’s bureaucracy.9"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"16 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam2. Mūsā b. al-Mahdī, ‘al-Hādī’ (r. 169/785–170/789)With his reign being so short and with the sources comparing him unfavourably with his brother Hārūn, al-Hādī is a diffi cult fi gure to assess. Despite this, we are given the impression that he was determined, forceful and on occasion hasty and ill-tempered. In many ways his reign was a reaction to his father’s, as he reversed his policies regarding the ʿAlids and attempted to limit the infl uence of both the mawālī and, consequently, the kuttāb. His greatest aim, however, was to remove his brother Hārūn from the succession and replace him with his own son Jaʿfar but his life was cut short in suspicious circumstances and considerable court intrigue.103. Hārūn b. al-Mahdī, ‘al-Rashīd’ (r. 170/789–193/809)Arguably the most famous of the ʿAbbāsid caliphs, Hārūn al-Rashīd is well known due to his relations with Europe through the French king Charlemagne and perhaps more so for his apparent immortalisation as the caliphal character in the One Thousand and One Nights. Similarly, he has a privileged place in Sunni hagi-ography for his frequent trips of pilgrimage and his own personal support of the jihad against Byzantium. His reign would be marked, however, by his appoint-ment of members of the Barmakid family as his closest ministers and confi dantes, who essentially administered the caliphate on his behalf for most of his reign until their untimely demise in controversial circumstances under the very same caliph. Al-Rashīd’s caliphate is considerably marred, however, by his almost naive deci-sion to divide power after his death between his sons Muḥammad and ʿAbd Allāh – a decision that would lead ultimately to civil war.114. Muḥammad b. al-Rashīd, ‘al-Amīn’ (r. 193/809–198/813)Often portrayed as politically incompetent, reckless and somewhat debauched, al-Amīn remains one of the most tragic fi gures in ʿAbbāsid history. Having been denied the entire caliphate to himself by his father’s will, he wasted little time in attempting to manipulate it back to his own control. His step-brother’s steadfast-ness in resisting the caliph’s attempt at wresting power away from him could only have one possible outcome – a civil war. Hostilities soon ensued and culminated in a siege of Baghdad that lasted several months and destroyed great areas of the city but a more severe blow was dealt to the ʿAbbāsid caliphate when al-Amīn was executed by his brother’s forces, this being the fi rst incident of fraternal regicide during the dynasty’s rule.125. ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Rashīd, ‘al-Maʾmūn’ (r. 198/813–218/833)After receiving the caliphate in the most inauspicious manner, al-Maʾmūn redeemed himself somewhat by proving himself a patron of the arts through actively support-ing the translation movement and is intimately associated with the celebrated ‘House of Wisdom’ (Bayt al-Ḥikma). Thus, he is remembered for his role in the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The ʿAbbāsid crucible 17translation of Greek, Indian and Persian works on astronomy, mathematics, medi-cine and philosophy, as well as his encouraging of court debates on a variety of intellectual matters. His spirit of ‘tolerance’ was further enhanced by the fact he seemingly attempted to bridge the gap between his own family’s dynasty and the rival ʿAlids by appointing ʿAlī al-Riḍāʾ as his heir but this attempt proved doomed to failure. Due to his tolerant approach to ‘foreign’ learning and ‘unorthodox’ views he was labelled ‘commander of the unbelievers’ (amīr al-kāfi rīn), a title which would be given further credence in the eyes of his opponents by his adoption of the ‘Inquisition’ (miḥna) – a policy, as we will see, that would defi ne his caliphate.136. Muḥammad b. al-Rashīd, ‘al-Muʿtaṣim’ (r. 218/833–227/842)On ascending the throne, al-Muʿtaṣim had been requested by his brother to con-tinue pursuing the policy of the miḥna, which he did reluctantly and it seems that he was satisfi ed to pursue it in the form of courtroom formality only. The one exception was of paramount signifi cance, however, as it lives on in the pages of history, this being the trial of Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal (d. 241/855), which will be dis-cussed later. Al-Muʿtaṣim’s reluctance to pursue the miḥna is often attributed to his lack of intellectual learning but equally the caliph was occupied by a number of events during his reign, such as the revolt of Bābak (d. 223/838), the trial of his general Ashfīn (d. 226/841), mounting his offensive against Amorium, coping with the revolt of Mayzār, overcoming the Zoṭṭ revolt and the transfer of the capital from Baghdad to Sāmarrāʾ. This latter move was an attempt to relocate the army which had become infl uenced by its ‘Turkish’ contingent – a feature that would defi ne the ʿAbbāsid political landscape for years to come.147. Hārūn b. al-Muʿtaṣim, ‘al-Wāthiq’ (r. 227/842–232/847)In many ways the reign of al-Wāthiq was also an extension of his father’s, as he continued appointing ‘Turks’ to key positions in the military and Bughā was one of these who distinguished himself in suppressing the various revolts of the period. Although al-Wāthiq was seemingly a capable politician, he relied heavily on his two chief ministers, Muḥammad b. ʿAbd al-Malik al-Zayyāt (d. 233/847) and Aḥmad b. Abū Duʾād (d. 240/854), to the extent that he consulted them in all of his affairs. It was under this latter vizier that the miḥna was vigorously pursued and the insurgent Aḥmad b. Nasr al-Khuzāʿī (d. 231/845) was executed seemingly not for his ill-fated coup but for his opposition to the state creed. Ibn Abū Duʾād continued to wield power within the administration until he was defeated in a debate regarding the nature of the Qurʾān and thus the caliph seems to have withdrawn his support for the miḥna policy.158. Jaʿfar b. al-Muʿtaṣim, ‘al-Mutawakkil’ (r. 232/847–247/861)Despite this general period being known as a period of decline, the ascension of al-Mutawakkil began a period of relative stability for the Islamic state. It is true"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"18 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamthat the caliph began to lose his infl uence over the wider boundaries of the empire, due to the internal competition of his offi cers and bureaucrats but, despite this, the state stabilised due to al-Mutawakkil’s ending of the Muʿtazilite policy and its consequent inquisition. In addition to this, the caliph also adopted a severe policy regarding the Shiʿite elements, destroying the mausoleum of al-Ḥusayn at Karbalāʾ. Thus, the rule of al-Mutawakkil had a rather authoritarian fl avour, as he took his dignity as a ruler very seriously. This, however, was not suffi cient for him to survive the devious plotting of his Turkish amīrs and they eventually succeeded in assassinating him in 247/861.16Intellectual life in the early ʿAbbāsid periodDespite virtual autonomy in the Middle East, the Arab caliphate had little to show in terms of academic endeavour since the Arabs prior to Islam were mostly an illiterate people, whose main achievement was the eloquence of their language and the recording of their history and culture in a poetic form. This ‘underachieve-ment’ was to change dramatically during the early ʿAbbāsid period for a number of reasons, the foremost of which will be alluded to here. First, the shifting of the seat of power to Iraq placed the new caliphate at the centre of the academic and cultural world; India with a long history of mathematics, medicine and science lay to the east. Alexandria, the seat of accumulated Greek thought, lay to the north as did the academic centres of Damascus and Ḥarrān. Similarly, in neighbouring Persia there were other intellectual institutions such as that at Jundīsābūr.17 Although these intellectual centres were signifi cant during the rule of the Umayyads, they seem to have had little impact on their caliphate. Therefore, the second important factor in the fl ourishing of learning under the ʿAbbāsids was the changing demographic structure of its administration. The introduction of the ‘clients’ (al-mawālī ) into the bureaucratic structure created a new ‘civil servant’ or ‘secretary’ class (kuttāb) in the administration, the vast majority of whom were non-Arabs and who were exemplifi ed by the Barmakids and Nawbakhts and their protégés. Having access to the caliph and hence infl uence, this ‘foreign’ contin-gent encouraged the rulers to take an interest in the surrounding culture of science and learning of the adjacent non-Arab/non-Muslim populations.18 The response of the caliphs was forthcoming and they obliged by patronising the accessing of this knowledge of the ancient and diverse societies surrounding them. The impetus for this development came from what Gutas terms ‘the Graeco-Arabic Translation Movement’ that existed in Baghdad and early ʿAbbāsid society.19 This was the primary cause in the development of learning in the ʿAbbāsid era and would have been impossible, however, without an important discovery – that of paper. The introduction of this technology, apparently by Chinese prisoners of war, quickly replaced the regular writing materials of the day and, although initially it was only used by the caliph for offi cial documents and personal letters, it soon became more widely available, fuelling the learning process with an essential resource.20 Although the translation of ‘foreign’ works was not unheard of in the Umayyad period, it was under the ʿAbbāsid reign that it fl ourished initially under the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The ʿAbbāsid crucible 19 policies of both al-Manṣūr and his son al-Mahdī.21 The same policy of translation continues among their successors but it was under the authority of al-Maʾmūn that the translation movement was at its height,22 culminating in the development of the celebrated Bayt al-Ḥikma, ‘the House of Wisdom’, which seems to have acted as an institution for the translation, copying and keeping of books.23 It is also worth mentioning that it was not only the caliphs who played a role in this process but indeed other members of society also took part in this culture of supporting the translation of non-Arabic works; the most celebrated of these were arguably the Banū Mūsā, i.e. Mūsā b. Shākir and his three sons, who would pay as much as 500 dīnārs monthly for full-time translators.24 As for the translators, it is worth noting that many of them were Christians, usually of the Nestorian denomination, due to their skills with Greek and more specifi cally, Syriac, which was an intermediary language, and Arabic. These scholars were numerous but the foremost in this fi eld were Yaḥyā [Ibn] al-Biṭrīq, Qusṭā b. Lūqā (d. 298/912), ʿAbd al-Masīḥ b. Nāʿima al-Ḥimsī, Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī (d. 362/974) and Abū Bishr Mattā b. Yūnus (d. 327/940).25 However, the most illustrious of these scholars was the renowned Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq (d. 296/910), who is reported to have translated more than 31 works, being paid 500 dīnārs per month and an amount of gold equivalent to the weight of the books he translated, in addition to being the court physician during the time of al-Mutawakkil.26 The nature of the translated works concerned classical learning as a whole and included astronomy, mathematics, medicine and philosophy from the works of Aristotle, Hippocrates, Galen, Euclid, Plotinus and Ptolemy.27 This is not to say that these sciences were merely academic efforts but, indeed, they were put to practical use by a number of luminaries of the period. Astronomical observation had begun in Baghdad at an observatory in the al-Shammāsiyya dis-trict, on the left bank of the Tigris, east of al-Ruṣāfa and Ibrāhīm al-Fazārī, who had translated the Indian book of Astronomy, Sindhind, into Arabic for al-Manṣūr and who had helped plan the foundation of Baghdad, was the fi rst in the Arab world to make astrolabes.28 This work was continued in the time of al-Maʾmūn by Muḥammad b. Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, who also adapted Ptolemy’s Geographike Hyphegesis and composed the fi rst independent textbook on algebra (al-jabr), resulting in his name surviving until today in the term ‘algorithm’ for the formula-tion of the calculation method.29 Medicine was always a popular topic considering its practical application and the royal court’s requirement for the caliph’s treatment when ill. Thus, in addition to Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq there were a host of royal physicians during the ʿAbbāsid period; the earliest of these may have been Jurgis b. Jibrīl b. Bukhtīshūʿ who came from Jundīsābūr to Baghdad in 147/765 to treat the caliph al-Manṣūr due to his skill in Hippocratic/Galenic medicine. The Bukhtīshūʿ family was arguably the most infl uential medical dynasty, their descendants serving as a series of caliphs right up until the time of al-Mutawakkil. In addition, other Jundīsābūr families also participated in this fi eld, including those of al-Ṭayfūrī and Māsawayh who were the most prominent, Yaḥyā b. Māsawayh being the foremost exemplar of the latter family.30"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"20 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam Perhaps the most infl uential of these academic disciplines from the ancient world to have the greatest effect on the religious learning was that of philosophy. In the same way that the other translated sciences found their champions men-tioned above, philosophy would fi nd an avid supporter in the personality of Abū Yūsuf Yaʿqūb b. Isḥāq al-Kindī (d. ca. 255/870). Al-Kindī was from the well-known, aristocratic Arabic tribe of Kinda and enjoyed a privileged upbringing, his family being associated with government appointments in the ʿAbbāsid regime, while he himself became attached to the court in the time of al-Muʿtaṣim. It would be a misrepresentation, however, to portray al-Kindī as purely a philosopher, as he was a polymath, who engaged with all of the disciplines mentioned thus far. Nevertheless, it is with philosophy that his name is synonymous and, to this end, he was one of those who introduced the Muslim world to philosophy, to the extent that he was given the honorifi c title of ‘the philosopher of the Arabs’ ( faylasūf al-ʿArab).31 This is not to say that the only works that were translated were of a scientifi c nature, as in fact literary works were also transferred from one culture to another, to which Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ’s (d. 139/757) translation of Bidpai’s fables, in the form of Kalīla and Dimna, bears witness.32 Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ’s superb writing style is regarded as having given birth to Arabic prose (adab) as a discipline but his seminal efforts were brought to fruition by other writers who wrote not from translations but from their own literary ability. The most illustrious of these was Abū ʿUthmān ʿAmr b. Baḥr al-Jāḥiẓ (b. 250/864 or 255/869 or 256/870), who, in addition to being an ardent Muʿtazilite, wrote prose works of outstanding quality, such as Kitāb al-Ḥayawān and Kitāb al-Bukhalāʾ.33 A similar polymath, who fol-lowed shortly behind al-Jāḥiẓ in the fi eld of Arabic prose, was his contemporary, Ibn Qutayba (d. 276/889), who distinguished himself with equally impressive works such as Adab al-Kātib.34 Despite the development of a new literary vehicle, i.e. that of prose literature, Arabic poetry remained a vibrant artistic form. Nevertheless, the style, metre and to some extent, the content differed from the more ‘classical’ Arabic style. The Arabs, for the most part, no longer lived a nomadic lifestyle in the desert but, rather, had become urbanised, living in fl ourishing cities and budding metropo-lises and, consequently, this was refl ected in their poetry. The poetry also took a more ‘debauched’ feel as the subject matter was often concerned with wine drink-ing and illicit affairs; the most notable of the poets of this genre in the ʿAbbāsid period were Abū Nuwās (d. ca. 198/814), whose drunken misadventures were often the subject of his poetic talent, and Bashshār b. Burd (d. 166/783), who frequented the court of al-Mahdī but whose eroticism alarmed those with religious proclivities.35 Other linguistically related disciplines were also not neglected during this period and Arabic philology was a notable development. The need to examine the depth of the Qurʾānic implementation of the Arabic language became paramount so as to understand the nuances of usage and to gain insight into its multiplicity of meanings. To this end, a number of scholars began the process of formulating works in his fi eld, which apparently resulted in competing schools in both Basra"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The ʿAbbāsid crucible 21and Kūfa. Of the early Basran contingent, Khalīl b. Aḥmad (d. ca. 175/791–92) is the most famous for his dictionary Kitāb al-ʿAyn, which employed the method of utilising classical poetical verses as proof of usage – a method that later would become the established practice. Similarly, Khalīl is credited with the creation of the basic concepts that govern poetic meter (ʿilm al-ʿarūḍ ) and grammar (al-naḥw) and therefore his contribution can hardly be underestimated. Equally signifi cant, however, are the efforts of his student, the much celebrated Sībawayh (d. 180/796), who preserved this grammatical system and developed it further. On the Kūfan side, Sībawayh’s competitor was al-Kisāʾī (d. 189/804), who had taught al-Rashīd and his son al-Mahdī, as well as his disciple al-Farrāʾ (d. 207/822), who taught Qurʾānic exegesis (al-tafsīr) in the mosque at Kūfa and composed a work on grammatical defi nitions in the court of al-Maʾmūn.36 It was also in this period that Muslims began to register works concerning their history and, in particular, biographical details concerning the life of the Prophet Muḥammad (al-sīra al-nabawiyya). One of the earliest of these works to reach us is a complete account of the Prophet’s life written for al-Manṣūr by Muḥammad b. Isḥāq (d. 151/768). His work was continued under al-Rashīd by the Barmakid protégé al-Wāqidī (d. 207/822), whose efforts concerned the campaigns of the Prophet (al-maghāzī ). Similarly, another work in the period and heavily reliant on Ibn Isḥāq is one the most famous works of the genre, the Sīrat Rasūl Allāh of Ibn Hishām (d. 218/833). In addition to strict biographical accounts, another genre appeared – that of charting each generation from the Prophet’s time to the present, commonly referred to as ṭabaqāt and the fi rst scholar to construct a work in this manner was Muḥammad b. Saʿd (d. 230/845).37 This biographical trend can be seen as an extension of another tradition that had seemingly continued from an early period – that of collecting narrations regarding the Prophet’s actions, statements and tacit approval – also known as ḥadīth.38 Although this process had continued for some time and had some offi cial support under the Umayyads, it was under the ʿAbbāsid regime that it would fl ourish and in many ways come to fruition.39 During this period there were a number of prominent ḥadīth collectors scattered throughout the Muslim world who included: ʿAbd al-Malik b. ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz b. Jurayj (d. 150/767) at Mecca, Muḥammad b. Isḥāq (d. 151/768) and Muḥammad b. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Abū Dhiʾb (d. 158/775) in Medina, Saʿd b. ʿArūba (d. 156/773) and Ḥammād b. Salama (d. 167/783) at Basra, Zāʾida b. Qudāma (d. 160/777) and Sufyān al-Thawrī (d. 161/778) at Kūfa, ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Amr al-Awzāʿī (d. 157/774) in Syria, ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Mubārak (d. 181/797) in Khurasān, Hushaym b. Bashīr (d. 183/799) at Wāsiṭ, Jarīr b. ʿAbd al-Ḥamīd (d. 188/804) at Rayy and ʿAbd Allāh b. Wahb (d. 197/813) in Egypt.40 Despite their best efforts, of the earliest ḥadīth works to reach us from this era is that of the imam of Medina, Mālik b. Anas’s (d. 179/795) al-Muwaṭṭa, report-edly written at the behest of al-Manṣūr,41 in addition to the encyclopedic Musnad of Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal (d. 241/855), which contains nearly 30,000 narrations.42 These early works were followed by the most famous collections of ḥadīth, known as the ‘six canonical works’ that comprised al-Jāmiʿ al-Ṣaḥiḥ of Abū ʿAbd Allāh"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"22 Spiritual Purifi cation in IslamMuḥammad b. Ismāʿīl al-Bukhārī (d. 256/870),43 al-Musnad al-Ṣaḥiḥ of Abū ’l-Ḥusayn Muslim b. al-Ḥajjāj al-Qushayrī (d. 261/875),44 the Sunan of Abū Dāwūd Sulaymān b. al-Ashʿath al-Sijistānī (d. 275/889),45 the al-Jāmiʿ of Abū ʿĪsā Muḥammad b. ʿĪsā al-Tirmidhī (d. 279/892),46 the Sunan of Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Aḥmad b.

Yazīd al-Qazwīnī [Ibn Mājah] (d. 273/886),48 in addition to a variety of other works in the period.49 The collection of ḥadīth also contributed to the development of another fi eld of learning that was equally vibrant during the ʿAbbāsid period – that of Islamic jurisprudence (fi qh). The fl ourishing of fi qh during this period was facilitated by a number of factors including state support for jurists and the commissioning of jurisprudential works. In addition, the atmosphere of debate and discussion that was apparent among the scholars even took place at the royal court and there was an increase in the centres of learning and, consequently, the compilation of the fi rst works.50 This ultimately led to the formation of the four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence that still exist today, i.e. those of Abū Ḥanīfa al-Nuʿmān b. Thābit (d. 150/767) known as the Ḥanafī school (al-madhhab al-ḥanafī ),51 Mālik b. Anas (d. 179/795) known as the Mālikī school (al-madhhab al-mālikī ),52 Muḥammad b. Idrīs al-Shāfi ʿī (d. 204/820) known as the Shāfi ʿī school (al-madh-hab al-shāfi ʿī )53 and Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal (d. 241/855) known as the Ḥanbalī school (al-madhhab al-ḥanbalī ).54 This is not to say that there were only four skilled, independent jurists (mujtahidūn) during this period but, indeed, this part of Islamic history was renowned for the existence of a host of prominent scholars of comparable ability who included: Sufyān b. Saʿīd al-Thawrī (d. 161/778),55 ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Amr al-Awzāʿī (d. 157/774),56 al-Layth b. Saʿd al-Fahmī (d. 175/791),57 Sufyān b. ʿUyayna al-Hilālī (d. 197/814),58 Isḥāq b. Rāhawayh al-Ḥanẓalī (d. 238/853),59 Abū Thawr Ibrāhīm b. Khālid al-Kalbī (d. 240/854),60 Dāwūd b. ʿAlī al-Ẓāhirī (d. 270/884)61 and Muḥammad b. Jarīr al-Ṭabarī (d. 310/923).62 Theological debate was no less dynamic during the reign of the early ʿAbbāsid caliphs; the Shiʿite and Khārijite tendencies of the early period were still active63 and the trend towards polemics regarding man’s actions and divine will was further developed by a new sectarian view termed Muʿtazilism,64 geared towards a rational dialectic and probably fuelled by the introduction of the Greek sciences of logic and philosophy.65 This latter trend will be dealt with briefl y in the follow-ing sections but the discussion here will focus on a repercussion of this develop-ment. The general populace of the Muslim community and their scholars at this stage can be designated as being ‘Sunni’ and be considered in opposition to the controversies raised by the sects just mentioned. With the advent of a rational approach as proposed by the Muʿtazilites, what Watt terms ‘the General Religious Movement’66 was faced with a new challenge to their claim of ‘orthodoxy’. In the face of the onslaught of Muʿtazilite rationalism many scholars remained steadfast, doggedly holding on to the creed they inherited from their predecessors, whereas others evolved an equally rational approach to defend their ‘orthodox’ beliefs against the digressions of their coreligionists. This rational method of"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The ʿAbbāsid crucible 23defending orthodoxy that would be closely associated with Abū ’l-Ḥasan ʿAlī al-Ashʿarī (d. 324/935) in later times was apparent in the fi rst generation of Sunni scholastic theologians (mutakallimū ahl al-sunna) long before his arrival.67 Indeed, these scholars may be viewed as the precursors of al-Ashʿarī and included such notables as: ʿAbd Allāh b. Saʿīd b. Kullāb (d. ca. 239/854),68 Abū ’l-ʿAbbās al-Qalānisī69 and of most interest to us, our subject al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī.70 As such, this trend, which was vehemently opposed by ultra ‘orthodox’ Sunnites such as Ibn Ḥanbal, is extremely signifi cant as it lays the ground for the latter-day Ashʿarite school of scholastic theology (kalām).71 In summary, when refl ecting on the discussion that has been presented above it is hardly surprising that the early ʿAbbāsid period was known as the ‘Golden Age’ of Islamic learning. Bearing this in mind, it is appropriate now to examine the geographic locations in which al-Muḥāsibī lived, to explore what other trends may well have infl uenced his life and works.Basra in the ʿAbbāsid early periodThe city of Basra may well stand on the site of an old Persian settlement as it was known to the Arabs as ‘al-Khurayba’ (lit. the little ruin) but its life as a Muslim town can be considered a new construction. The area was chosen by the Prophetic Companion ʿUtba b. Ghazwān in 17/638 on the orders of the second caliph ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb to establish a military camp; this became known as al-Baṣra, prob-ably due to the nature of the area’s soil, as the name appears to mean ‘black pebbles’. Strategically placed 15 kilometres from the Shaṭṭ al-ʿArab, Basra was to afford control over the Persian Gulf and provide a base for expeditions east. The location’s fi rst dwellings were simple reed huts, which were gradually replaced by crude bricks and eventually by baked bricks due to the efforts of the Umayyad Ziyād b. Abū Sufyān (d. 53/673), who can be regarded as the architect of the city’s prosperity.72 Despite its early development, Basra suffered from a lack of readily available drinking water and a notoriously diffi cult climate but, nevertheless, due to various economic, strategic and political factors it became a great city. Being a major military encampment it was populated by some of the ‘aristocratic’ Arab tribes, the town being divided into fi ve tribal sectors (khums, pl. akhmās): Ahl al-ʿĀliya, Tamīm, Bakr b. Wāʾil, ʿAbd al-Qays and ʿAzd. Similarly, the population of Basra included the ranks of the mawālī, and a number of immigrant populations, such as Persians, Indians, Malays and people from Sind, and the Zanj, adding to the new town’s ‘cosmopolitan’ nature.73 Basra reached its zenith in the second/eighth century, being fully developed and having a large population.74 At this stage it was very much a great city and a ‘complete metropolis’, as it had a commercial centre, Mirbad (the kneeling place for camels), situated at the western gate where the caravans halted and was one of the busiest parts of the city. Similarly, it contained a river port termed al-Kallāʿ, which could accommodate ships of a fairly large tonnage and a fi nancial centre run by wealthy non-Arabs, Christians and Jews. In addition, Basra also had an"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"24 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamindustrial area with its arsenal and an agricultural centre famed for its variety of dates.75 During this period Basra had the character of a semi-independent metropolis but with the foundation of Baghdad it lost most of this quality that it had possessed since its inception, becoming little more than a provincial town, and being completely supplanted by the newly founded ʿAbbāsid capital.76The fi rst ascetic school in BasraIt is hardly surprising that such a metropolis that boasted such a highly diverse demographic make-up also became a centre for intellectual endeavour and aca-demic excellence. In fact, Basra was one of the earliest and most infl uential centres of learning in the Muslim world, as Louis Massignon comments, ‘Basra, in fact, is the veritable crucible in which Islamic culture assumed its form, crystallised in the classic mould, between the fi rst and fourth centuries of the hijra (16/637–311/923)’.77 As such, a number of intellectual, academic and religious movements arose in tandem with the fl ourishing of Basra itself. Some of these are of primary importance to the current discussion, in the sense that they may have direct relevance to the life of al-Muḥāsibī and therefore will be discussed presently.78 Of these clearly identifi able trends is the ascetic nature of the spiritual teaching in Basra, which is almost exclusively associated with the city’s most famous son al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī (d. 110/728), and which is commonly held to be the precursor of what would later be termed Sufi sm. Although al-Ḥasan’s infl uence upon the ascetic tradition in Basra cannot be denied, upon examination we fi nd that this trend originates long before his arrival on the scene. In fact the trend for an ascetic, spiritual lifestyle can be traced back to one of its early governors from the Companion generation, Abū Mūsā [ʿAbd Allāh b. Qays] al-Ashʿarī (d. 44/665). Abū Mūsā was one of the most famous Prophetic Companions, being associated with the pietistic individuals known as ‘the people of the bench’ (ahl al-ṣuffa)79 and one of the renowned reciters of the Qurʾān, who were requested by the Prophet himself to recite for him personally. With this in mind, the second caliph ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb placed him in charge of the affairs of Basra but in addition to his administrative duties, one of his main tasks was to teach the recital of the Qurʾān – a tradition that later became a manifest quality of the Basran ascetic ‘school’.80 In addition, he was famed for his fasting despite the heat and his rousing sermons, in which he would warn of the torments of hell and the dangers of becoming attached to the worldly life, to the extent that the audience would weep out of fear – another quality that became an intrinsic part of the spiritual teaching in Basra.81 The initial impetus supplied by Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī gave rise to a number of scholars who took up the mantle of such an ascetical teaching, each of them advancing it in their own way until we fi nd the development of what al-Nashshār terms, ‘the fi rst Basran school’ (madrasat al-Baṣra al-ūlā).82 This school was exemplifi ed by a number of personalities but since an in-depth discussion of each of them individually is beyond the scope of the current work, only the promi-nent names will be given here: ʿĀmir b. ʿAbd [al-] Qays (d. ca. 50/670),83 Harim b.

Ushaym al-ʿAdawī (d. 62/682)87 and his wife Muʿādha bt. ʿAbd Allāh al-ʿAdawiyya.88The second ascetic school in BasraThe development of asceticism did not stop here, however, and continued into what al-Nashshār terms ‘the second Basran school’ (madrasat al-Baṣra al-thāniya)89 for which Muṭarrif b. ʿAbd Allāh al-Shakīr (d. 87/706 or 95/714)90 may be viewed as a precursor. The eponym of this school was not Muṭarrif, however, but Basra’s most illustrious inhabitant al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī, whose infl u-ence in shaping religious life in general and the ascetic life in particular in Basra is proverbial. After spending his formative years in the city of the Prophet, Medina and a brief period of military service on the frontiers, he eventually settled in Basra where he became famous – like his spiritual predecessor Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī – for his fi ery sermons, which are held to be masterpieces of religious rhetoric, as well as one of the earliest specimens of Arabic prose. His teaching revolved around the avoidance of sin, anticipation of the Last Judgement, and rejection of worldly attitudes and the attachment to worldly possessions. Similarly, al-Ḥasan’s practice of humility and self-scrutiny provided the cornerstone of his self-discipline and introspection and, when combined with his brotherly feeling towards his contem-poraries,91 it defi ned him as being, as Knysh puts it, ‘the archetypal proto-Sufi ’.92 It is hardly surprising that such a personality infl uenced so many of his con-temporaries and although there were many, due to the constraints of the current work, only the most prominent names will be mentioned here: Yazid b. Abān al-Raqāshī (d. between 101/719–121/739),93 Muḥammad b. Wāsiʿ (d. 120/738 or 123/741 or 127/745),94 Thābit b. Aslam al-Bunānī (d. 123/741 or 127/745),95 Mālik b. Dīnār (d. 128/746),96 Farqad b. Yaʿqūb al-Sabkhī (d. 131/749),97 Ḥabīb al-ʿAjamī (d. 156/773),98 Ayyūb b. Tamīma al-Sikhtiyānī (d. 131/749)99 and ʿAbd al-Wāḥid b. Zayd (d. 177/794).100 This generation of scholars were known as ‘ascetics’ (nussāk) due to their austere lifestyles, ‘reciters’ (qurrāʾ) due to their emphasis on the teaching of the Qurʾān and presumably its implementation, ‘worshippers’ (ʿubbād) due to their strict adherence to their devotions, ‘preachers’ (quṣṣāṣ) due to the delivery of their heart-felt sermons and ‘weepers’ (bakkāʾūn), due to their shedding of tears publicly when moved by eloquent speech or the remembrance of death or the hereafter.101 This teaching was further advanced by the students of Ibn Zayd, such as Riyāḥ b. ʿAmr al-Qaysī (d. 195/210),102 but more famously by Rābiʿa al-ʿAdawiyya (d. 185/801),103 who espoused the doctrine of ‘divine love’ (al-ḥubb al-ilāhī), which would infuse the doctrines of Sufi sm for centuries to come.The Muʿtazilite school in BasraThe other outstanding intellectual trend that may have had a direct effect on al-Muḥāsibī during the early ʿAbbāsid era was the establishment of the Muʿtazilite school in Basra. Quite paradoxically this too is said have been a product of the circle"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"26 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamof students that surrounded al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī. Tradition has it that a student of al-Ḥasan, Wāṣil b. ʿAṭāʾ (d. 131/749),104 was present during a debate concerning the status of a sinful believer, i.e. what would be the abode of such a person in the here-after, paradise or hell? Wāṣil’s opinion, which he no doubt expressed, was that such a person would neither be in paradise nor hell but in an intermediate position (manzila bayn manzilatayn). This view was opposed by those present and Wāṣil left this gath-ering to which al-Ḥasan is reported to have said that Wāṣil has withdrawn (iʿtazala). Thus, such exponents of this view were known as al-Muʿtazila, lit. ‘those who have withdrawn’, i.e. from the views held by the majority of the community.105 This ‘intellectualising’ of religious dogma seemingly set in motion by Wāṣil b. ʿAṭāʾ developed into a rationalised approach to theology, which seems to have been associated with the acquaintances of another Basran theologian, Abū ʿAmr ʿḌirār b. ʿAmr al-Ghaṭafānī (d. 182/800 or 204/820)106 and culminated in what became known as the Muʿtazilite school in Basra. A full discussion of this school and its views are beyond the scope of the current work and, as such, only the names of the most prominent personalities will be given here: Abū Hudhayl Muḥammad b. Hudhayl al-ʿAllāf (d. 227/842),107 Abū Isḥāq Ibrāhīm b. Sayyār al-Naẓẓām (d. 221/836 or 230/845 or 231/846 or 232/847),108 Muʿammar b. ʿAbbād al-Sulamī (d. 214/830 or 220/835),109 Abū Bakr ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Kaysān al-Aṣamm (b. 200/816),110 Hishām b. ʿAmr al-Fuwaṭī al-Shaybānī (b. 218/833 or 226/841),111 Abū ʿUthmān ʿAmr b. Baḥr al-Jāḥiẓ (b. 250/864 or 255/869 or 256/870)112 and Abū Yaʿqūb Yūsuf b. ʿAbd Allāh al-Shaḥḥām (d. ca. 266/880).113Baghdad in the early ʿAbbāsid periodIt is a common historical feature that each dynasty upon seizing the reins of power establishes a new seat for that power, to demonstrate its identity and prestige and thus erase its predecessors from the collective memory of their subjects. In this regard, the ʿAbbāsids were no exception; on ascending the throne al-Saffāḥ had moved the centre of the empire from Damascus to Kūfa and later to a purpose-built capital known as al-Hāshimiyya, in honour of the dynasty. This proved rela-tively unsuccessful, however, since the establishment of this new centre was attempted at four different sites in the vicinity of Kūfa and Anbar.114 Upon taking control of the state from his brother, al-Manṣūr maintained al-Hāshimiyya as the capital but with the riot of the Rāwandiyya in 141/758 and the close vicinity of Kūfa, which had maintained its Shiʿite sympathies from an early period, al-Manṣūr decided to search for a new more suitable seat for his power. In addition, he decided that the new capital would remain in Iraq despite the powerbase of the dynasty being in Khurasān, as this province was far too remote from the rest of the empire for power to be wielded effi ciently but, never-theless, the ʿAbbāsids still required a suitable location to settle their eastern parti-sans. After travelling to inspect various sites personally, al-Manṣūr eventually decided upon the small hamlet of Baghdād, being suitably impressed with its strategic position – on the banks of the Tigris, its pleasant climate and the legends surrounding it – the name apparently meaning ‘a gift from God’.115"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The ʿAbbāsid crucible 27 Having chosen the site, al-Manṣūr himself was active in tracing the foundations of the new city and, having done so, summoned the local craftsman and artisans to begin work on the construction in 145/762, which was located on the west bank of the Tigris. The offi cial name of the city was Madīnat al-Salām, ‘the City of Peace’, in reference to paradise in the Qurʾānic verse (6:127, 10:26) but the city was also known as al-Zawrāʾ, ‘the crooked’, as well as the original name of Baghdād. At the heart of the construction was the tremendous Round City, with its huge fortifi cations, walls, moat and gates. At the centre of the Round City lay some administrative build-ings, troops quarters, the main mosque and the caliph’s palace, known as the ‘Palace of Gold’ (qaṣr al-dhahab), famous for its green dome over the audience chamber. The almost ‘cosmic’ design of the Round City with its four huge gates, each leading to a ‘corner’ of the empire (Syria [NW], Kūfa [SW], Basra [SE] and Khurasān [ NE]), seemed to imply the caliph’s centralising of the ʿAbbāsid power, as well as supplying him with a fortress to act as a base for his plans. The initial building process took almost one year – 146/763 – before the offi cial caliphal administration was moved to the new capital and construction was fi nally completed in 149/766.116 The eloquent town planning of the Round City was not the only stroke of genius manifested by al-Manṣūr, however, but indeed, the surrounding and adja-cent areas to the main complex were also well thought out. The neighbouring areas to the Round City were organised into quarters that were designed for a unique purpose and to be populated by a specifi c section of society. Most notably, these included al-Ḥarbiyya district, which housed the military contingent made up of the Khurasānī troops, and the Karkh quarter, which was a commercial district, housing the main markets of Baghdad and supplying the palace complex with its needs. Similarly, al-Manṣūr built himself a second palace termed ‘Eternity’ (al-Khuld ), which later became his and many of his successors’ preferred resi-dence, possibly due to its pleasant location on the bank of the Tigris and as an escape from the pressure of the administrative centre in the Round City. In addition, the east bank also fl ourished with the building of bridges and a new district termed ‘the Causeway’ (al-Ruṣāfa). This was further enhanced by the establishment of a further palace for his son and heir known as ʿAskar al-Mahdī, due to the encamp-ment of his troops there, in 151/768 on his triumphant return to Baghdad. Subse-quently, this had the knock-on effect of developing the market areas on the east side to the extent that they came to rival the Karkh district on the western bank.117 Thus, by the time al-Mahdī ascended the throne in 158/775 – some seven years before the birth of al-Muḥāsibī – Baghdad was a fully developed, thriving metrop-olis, acting as the new capital for a fi rmly established ʿAbbāsid state. With the myriad of opportunities such a new construction posed, it is not surprising that the capital also became a multicultural centre assimilating various peoples and culture in an open, Islamic context, in much the same way that Basra had done before it. Consequently, it became a ‘melting pot’ for new ideas, thought and learning, which was a product of its nascent demography. Moreover, numerous new intel-lectual trends appeared and developed to the background of Baghdad society and, this being the case, it is appropriate that the most prominent and signifi cant of these be examined.118"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"28 Spiritual Purifi cation in IslamThe Mystical school in BaghdadIf the ascetic school in Basra exemplifi ed by al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī and his teachers was extremely prominent, it was by no means unique in Iraq and, indeed, a similar trend existed in other cities such as Kūfa. The foundation of Baghdad, however, provided a focal point for the gathering of scholars and the accumulation and assimilation of the various trends that existed in a variety of fi elds of Islamic learning. Spiritual instruction was no exception and the formation of one of the earliest tendencies towards a ‘genuine’ form of Islamic mysticism – or Sufi sm – can be seen to develop out of the prevailing spiritual propensities in the new ʿAbbāsid capital, which has caused this development to be termed the ‘Mystical school of Baghdad’.119 The development of the school is relatively diffi cult to trace but the agent of its design in its initial stages is usually regarded as being Abū Maḥfūẓ Maʿrūf b. Fayruzān al-Karkhī (d. 200/815).120 Maʿrūf al-Karkhī is a pinnacle personality in the nascent Baghdadi school as he was a student of Farqad al-Sabkhī, which thus links him to al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī and consequently, the Basran tradition as a whole.121 Though not formally trained, Maʿrūf carried on the Basran tradition as a pious sermoniser, who preached abstinence and humility.122 Bishr b. al-Ḥārith al-Ḥāfī ‘the barefoot’ (d. 227/842) was another personality associated with the Baghdadi school despite originally being a native of Merv, where he is said to have been a member of a gang and lived a particularly irreli-gious life. At some point, however, he left this lifestyle and journeyed east where his travels brought him into the company of the renowned jurist Mālik b. Anas (d. 179/795), with whom he studied jurisprudence and ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Mubārak (d. 181/797), under whose supervision he studied ḥadīth. Despite this ‘formal’ training in Islamic learning, he shunned the notoriety and potential wealth it could bring, preferring to live the life of a poor ascetic. Similarly, his attitude was similar to his ascetic predecessors and his teaching emphasised the importance of righteous deeds rather than theoretical knowledge.123 A contemporary and seemingly a rival of al-Muḥāsibī was Sarī b. al-Mughallas al-Saqaṭī – ‘the spice seller’ (d. 253/867). The son of a peddler, Sarī too became a merchant but, as was the habit of the time, became equally interested in the study of ḥadīth. These aspects of his lifestyle came to an end when he heard a typically fi ery sermon by Maʿrūf al-Karkhī which ultimately led him to pursue a more spir-itual approach to his religious convictions. His teaching combines the various elements of the ascetic schools up until that point and is characterised by his suc-cinct comments regarding loyalty to one’s friends, practical virtues, the dangers of hypocrisy and the remembrance of God.124 Although these themes seem familiar to the preceding traditions, it is Sarī’s teaching that is characteristic of the Baghdadi school and is a signifi cant development of the basic ascetic practice of those before him. In this regard Knysh comments:In a sense, Sarī’s religions [sic.] attitude marks a departure from the tradi-tional asceticism of Baṣra and Kūfa. Although he built his preaching upon"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The ʿAbbāsid crucible 29basically the same assumptions as his predecessors, the accents he placed on various strands of the old ascetic tradition constitute his distinct contribution to its growth and sophistication. Moreover, his teaching refl ects his internal evolution from a conventional ascetic, preoccupied with avoidance of sin and meticulous compliance with the religious and social conventions of the age, to a fully-fl edged mystic immersed in the contemplation of God and, therefore, totally oblivious to the world around him.125Similarly, Abdel-Kader observes:We may regard as-Saqaṭī as the founder of the Ṣūfī School of Baghdād. This school differed from contemporary Ṣūfī schools in Syria and Khorasan. The Baghdād school’s main topic was Unifi cation, Tawḥīd, and it developed the ‘knowledge’ of Unifi cation. The school is distinguished by its symbolic expressions and by its discussions on the mystic state and station of the Ṣūfī. The members of the school are, therefore, called ‘The Masters of Unifi cation,’ Arbāb al-Tawḥīd, like al-Junayd, an-Nūrī and ash-Shiblī.126The principal personalities of Maʿrūf al-Karkhī, Bishr al-Ḥāfī and Sarī al-Saqaṭī, among others, would in turn produce a variety of students who all contributed in their own specifi c ways to the Baghdad mystical tradition but, due to the limita-tions of the current work, cannot be discussed at length and, as such, only the few, representative names will be given here: Abū Saʿīd [Aḥmad b. ʿĪsā] al-Kharrāz (d. ca. 286/899),127 ʿAmr b. ʿUthmān al-Makkī (d. 291/903 or 297/910 or 300/913),128 Abū ’l-Ḥusayn [Aḥmad b. Muḥammad] al-Nūrī (d. 295/907)129 and Ruwaym b. Aḥmad (d. 303/915).130 Although the Baghdadi school produced a number of notable exponents, as exemplifi ed in the previous list above, its most illustrious student is without doubt Abū ’l-Qāsim al-Junayd b. Muḥammad (d. 298/910). Born of Persian stock in Baghdad, al-Junayd was raised in a mercantile environment, where his father was a glass merchant (hence the appellation ‘al-Qawārīrī’) and he himself became a silk merchant (hence his appellation ‘al-Khazzāz’). In addition to his mercantile activities, he also studied classical knowledge in terms of ḥadīth and jurispru-dence under the auspices of the foremost jurist in Baghdad before the arrival of al-Shāfi ʿī, Abū Thawr Ibrāhīm b. Khālid al-Kalbī (d. 240/854). This ‘formal’ knowledge was supplemented by gatherings with a number of spiritual masters, the most notable being his paternal uncle Sarī al-Saqaṭī and our subject within this study, al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī. It was through these latter scholars that al-Junayd was introduced to the now more sophisticated Baghdadi school and he himself also contributed to its devel-opment. The exact nature of this development is diffi cult to assess in many ways, as no more than a number of his ‘epistles’ (rasāʾil ) on mystical themes have reached us and their language is obscure and extremely diffi cult to access. Never-theless, the Baghdadi school, under the leadership of al-Junayd, due to its heavy emphasis on extreme asceticism and its strong moral teaching, was often termed"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"30 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamthe ‘sober school’ (al-ṣaḥw) of Sufi sm and was said to be exemplifi ed by its chief exponent. This, ‘sober’ school, with its roots in ‘orthodox’ learning was perhaps al-Junayd’s biggest legacy, as it defi ned the nature of Sufi sm for centuries to come.131 Of al-Junayd’s illustrious students, Abū Bakr Dulaf b. Jaḥdar al-Shiblī (d. 334/946)132 stands out but he is eclipsed in terms of notoriety by al-Ḥusayn b. Manṣūr al-Ḥallāj (d. 309/922). This latter personality seemingly advanced the concepts initiated by Abū Yazīd al-Bisṭāmī (d. 234/848 or 261/875) until another school developed, the so-called ‘school of intoxication’ (al-sukr). This second school was in opposition to the method of al-Ḥallāj’s master al-Junayd and was characterised by the so-called ‘ecstatic utterances’ (shaṭaḥāt), which such mystics would make whilst expressing their experience of the divine and which, as a result, often raised the hackles of the ‘orthodox’, due to their seemingly blasphemous overtones.133The Muʿtazilite school in BaghdadIn the same way that the Mystical school of Baghdad was a product of the Basran ascetic school, when Basra was supplanted by Baghdad as the ʿAbbāsid state capital, the trend towards rationalising the Muslim creed did not stop there and the era which Watt terms the period of ‘the Great Muʿtazilites’134 continued for some time. In fact many of the major personalities of the Basran Muʿtazilite school such as Abū Hudhayl, al-Naẓẓām, Muʿammar, al-Fuwaṭī, al-Jāḥiẓ and al-Shaḥḥām, later migrated to Baghdad at some point and were active in court affairs, particu-larly in the reign of al-Maʾmūn.135 This is not to say, however, that there was no Muʿtazilite infl uence in Baghdad before the arrival of the Basran contingent. Indeed, there did exist at that time a completely independent school of Muʿtazilism in Baghdad, which, although the Basran school is thought to predate the Baghdadi school, co-existed in a similar time frame. These scholars are remembered as having infl uence upon the highest echelons of ʿAbbāsid society in Baghdad, pri-marily by participating in debates arranged by the famous vizier Yaḥyā al-Barmakī but more importantly, in the time of al-Maʾmūn, where some of them even held offi cial appointments, particularly during the miḥna period. Once again a full dis-cussion of their thought and teaching is far beyond the current work but neverthe-less the most famous personalities will be mentioned here: Abū Sahl Bishr b. Muʿtamir al-Hilālī (d. 226/841),136 Abū Maʿn Thumāma b. Ashras al-Numayrī (d. 213/828),137 Abū ʿAbd Allāh Aḥmad b. Abū Duʾād al-Iyādī (d. 239/854),138 Abū Mūsā ʿĪsā b. Ṣubayḥ al-Murdār (d. 226/841),139 Abū Faḍl Jaʿfar b. Ḥarb (d. 235/850),140 Abū Muḥammad Jaʿfar b. Mubashshir al-Thaqafī (d. 233/848)141 and Abū Jaʿfar Muḥammad b. ʿAbd Allāh al-Iskāfī (d. 239/854).142The ‘Inquisition’ (al-miḥna)Having briefl y discussed the Muʿtazilite schools of both Basra and Baghdad, this brings us neatly to the subject of the current section – that of the miḥna. This"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The ʿAbbāsid crucible 31historic event demonstrates to us the way in which this relatively obscure group of scholastic theologians (mutakallimūn) became a driving force in the religious life of Muslims during this period, due to their acquisition of caliphal support in the form of al-Maʾmūn. The term itself miḥna and its synonym imtiḥān have the connotation of ‘to test, to try and to put to trial’ but in the specifi c historical context of the early ʿAbbāsid period, it means ‘a test of faith’, this being synony-mous with the religio-political trial introduced by al-Maʾmūn.143 The subject of this trial of conviction may seem even more curious to the casual observer, as it concerned a seemingly hair-splitting article of faith, i.e. the nature of revelation – is the revealed word of God, in this case the Qurʾān, created or not? For the vast majority of Muslims who held the nascent Sunni view, the Qurʾān was considered to be uncreated and an intrinsic attribute of the divine being, i.e. His speech and thus, inseparable from Him.144 For the Muʿtazilites, however, this contradicted one of their most basic concepts as it was at odds with their comprehension of one of their ‘fi ve principles’ (al-uṣūl al-khamsa), which are enumerated as being: ‘divine unity’ (al-tawḥīd ), ‘justice’ (al-ʿadl ), ‘the promise of reward and threat of punishment’ (al-waʿd wa ’l-waʿīd ), the ‘intermediate state’ (al-manzila bayn al-manzilatayn), and ‘enjoining the good and forbidding the evil’ (al-amr bi ’l-maʿrūf wa naḥy ʿan al-munkar).145 The prin-ciple in question was ‘divine unity’ or al-tawḥīd, by which they meant that God was incomparable and unique – a view common to Sunni belief but they employed it to mean that the divine attributes (al-ṣifāt) are not a distinct quality of divinity, as this would indicate multiplicity in the Godhead but are in fact identical with His essence and, as such, they denied their true nature to a large extent. For example, they would affi rm the names of God, such as the ‘All Knowing’ (al-ʿAlīm) as it occurs in the Qurʾān but at the same time they would deny the fact that for God to be al-ʿAlīm, it was intrinsic that He possessed the hypostatic attribute of knowledge (ʿilm), as this would create an additional feature in His essence and thus, multiplic-ity, which is diametrically opposed to indivisible nature of al-tawḥīd. As such, the Muʿtazilites were referred to as al-muʿaṭṭila, as they would ‘strip’ God of His attributes (taʿṭīl ) and deny them (nafīy al-ṣifāt).146 Similarly, when discussing the issue of the Qurʾān, they would imply that if it is uncreated, this must also mean that it is pre-eternal (qadīm) and since only God existed in pre-eternity it is impossible that the Qurʾān also existed, as this would mean that there was a duality in pre-eternity, which once again negates al-tawḥīd. Due to this, they believed that the Qurʾān is created as it is considered the ‘work’ of God and not His speech, which also dictates that the Qurʾān in their view is not eternal, as this would also indicate multiplicity. Although this view is traceable before the advent of al-Maʾmūn, as it is tangible as early as the Umayyad period in the form of Jaʿd b. Dirham (d. 124/742 or 125/743), most famously in Abū Ḥanīfa al-Nuʿmān and later in the reign of al-Maʾmūn’s father al-Rashīd through Bishr al-Marīsī (d. 217/833 or 218/834 or 226/842), it never gained much cre-dence outside the dialectical discussion of scholastic theologians, particularly those of the Muʿtazilites.147 Nevertheless, al-Maʾmūn appears to have made this issue the crux of miḥna, which raises an important question: if the Muʿtazilites"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"32 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamdiffered with the majority on a number of tenets of faith then why select this particular dogma as the basis of the inquisition when there were many other creedal points to choose from? To answer this question is far from an easy task but researchers have made attempts to unravel this conundrum. For example, Watt suggests that this was an attempt by al-Maʾmūn to undermine the authority of the scholarly class (al-ʿulamāʾ), who were the reference point for the general Muslim populace regarding matters of religion, and reassert the power of the caliph in this circle of his subjects. At the same time, by disempowering the scholarly elite this move would also afford the ‘secular’, civil servant class (al-kuttāb) more infl uence in the running of the state, as a created Qurʾān simply had less ‘prestige’, since the implication was that, as such, it is changeable and, if so, its edicts may be over-ruled by an inspired imam (imam al-hudā).148 Although the initial notion may be true, i.e. that al-Maʾmūn sought to undermine the authority of the scholarly class, which is clear from the fact that he targeted many of the populist ḥadīth luminar-ies, the second aspect, i.e. that the authority of the Qurʾān was somehow to be overruled, is less convincing. As Hinds observes:But this misses the point: for one thing, the doctrine of the created Qurʾān is a doctrine about God and more specifi cally God’s unity, rather than a doc-trine about the Qurʾān, and there is in any case no evidence whatsoever to support the view that al-Maʾmūn wanted to overrule the Qurʾān.149The extent of the Muʿtazilite infl uence over al-Maʾmūn is further evidenced by a miḥna letter quoted by Abū ’l-ʿArab (d. 333/944) in his Kitāb al-Miḥan, which stipulated that not only the doctrine of the created Qurʾān be imposed but also the doctrine of denying the punishment in the grave (ʿadhāb al-qabr), this being a popular feature of Muʿtazilite dogma.150 Thus, at best we can view al-Maʾmūn as a sincere proponent of Muʿtazilism, using his considerable infl uence to correct the ‘misguided’ beliefs of the ignorant masses, or at worst a divisive politician who manipulated the Muʿtazilite creed to achieve political supremacy. It is further sug-gested here that in the fi rst-case scenario, he may well have begun the reformation of the Islamic belief system with the Qurʾān due to its pivotal position in the lives of Muslims, thinking that if he could succeed here, then convincing the public of the remaining doctrines would be ‘easy’. Al-Maʾmūn’s Muʿtazilite sympathies are also seen in the fact that many of the leading proponents of this school, such as Bishr b. Muʿtamir and Thumāma b. Ashras, are witnessed at an early stage at Merv in 201/817, as signatories on the document declaring Alī al-Riḍāʾ heir to the caliphate,151 long before al-Maʾmūn’s move to Baghdad to assume the caliphate proper. Similarly, one of the major fi gures of this incident, as we shall see, is Aḥmad b. Abū Duʾād who was greatly honoured at the court of al-Maʾmūn, and was charged with supervision of the miḥna after his death, as the caliph apparently stipulated this in his will for his successor al-Muʿtaṣim. It has been suggested that al-Maʾmūn did this due to al-Muʿtaṣim’s lack of intellectual acumen in dealing with such issues, yet it is"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The ʿAbbāsid crucible 33further evidence of Muʿtazilite infl uence at the caliph’s court, as presumably al-Maʾmūn would not have appointed Ibn Abū Duʾād unless he thought he could fulfi l the task, as well as being an indication of his conviction that the miḥna should be pursued in the fi rst place.152 These facts and the others have caused Abū Zahra to conclude that Ibn Abū Duʾād was in fact the architect of the miḥna.153 Even if we concede this, however, he could not have brought it into being without the caliph’s support or will, suggesting that although al-Maʾmūn may have had some political ambition from the implementation of the miḥna, he was also sym-pathetic to the ideological foundation behind it. As for the historical details of the miḥna, al-Maʾmūn is said to have been con-vinced of the created Qurʾān doctrine as early as 212/827 or even earlier and paved the way for its imposition by deposing the chief judge (qāḍī al-quḍāt) Yaḥyā b. Aktham, who apparently opposed the idea and replaced him with Aḥmad b. Abū Duʾād in 217/832.154 Thus, in the last year of his reign in 218/833 and with his new appointee in place, al-Maʾmūn utilised his state power and initi-ated the miḥna, by sending the fi rst of the miḥna letters to his deputy in Baghdad, Isḥāq b. Ibrāhīm. The letter instructed this offi cial to examine the judges (qāḍī, pl. quḍāt) under his jurisdiction regarding the creation of the Qurʾān and used par-ticularly critical language, vilifying those who opposed this creed, terming them ‘a people ignorant of God’, ‘defi cient in understanding’, ‘those who lie about God and His creation’ and the ‘worst and chief in error’.155 Copies of this letter were also sent to the other provinces of the caliphate but in reality seem to have had little effect due to a lack of popular support for the policy. Similarly, al-Maʾmūn wrote to Isḥāq b. Ibrāhīm again ordering him to send seven prominent personali-ties including the traditionists (muḥaddithūn) Muḥammad b. Saʿd and Yaḥyā b. Maʿīn (d. 233/847) to him at al-Raqqa, where he undertook the examination himself and as a result all seven succumbed to the doctrine of the created Qurʾān.156 Consequently, al-Maʾmūn wrote another miḥna letter to his deputy in Baghdad in a similar style and manner, to continue the process. Thus, Isḥāq b. Ibrāhīm gathered around 30 of the leading jurists (faqīh, pl. fuqahāʾ), judges and tradition-ists and began examining them about the Muʿtazilite creed regarding the Qurʾān. The vast majority of these scholars, some of them notably under duress, yielded and there were only two exceptions, that of Muḥammad b. Nūḥ al-ʿIjlī and more signifi cantly, Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal. These latter two scholars were thus despatched to Tarsus to be dealt with directly by al-Maʾmūn but the caliph’s demise occurred en route (Rajab 218/August 833) and they were therefore temporarily reprieved. However, Muḥammad b. Nūḥ died on the return journey to Baghdad and Aḥmad was kept in detention upon his arrival.157 Al-Muʿtaṣim’s advent to power saw no reprieve in the miḥna as a policy, as al-Maʾmūn had stipulated in his will that his brother continue with this course of action and make Ibn Abū Duʾād his closest confi dante in the issue, with which he duly complied. Nevertheless, the issue of the miḥna during his reign is seemingly less intense due perhaps to the reluctance of the new caliph to pursue this policy. However, there was one exception – that of Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal. After a period of approximately two and half years in prison, Aḥmad was removed, apparently due"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"34 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamto the intercession of his uncle Isḥāq b. Ḥanbal with the prefect of Baghdad, Isḥāq b. Ibrāhīm, as his uncle thought that Aḥmad would relent. In actual fact it was possibly the worst thing he could have done as his interrogation was initiated once more. Over the next two days Aḥmad defended his position with a variety of questioners, including the caliph, and gave a good account of himself, the time in prison seemingly giving him time to formulate convincing arguments of a kalām style. On the third day, however, under pressure from the Muʿtazilite faction at court and despairing of Aḥmad yielding his position, al-Muʿtaṣim ordered him to be fl ogged, during the course of which his wrists were dislocated and he lost consciousness after 30 or so lashes.158 That Aḥmad was released after the fl ogging seems in little doubt; the circum-stances in which his release took place, however, are disputed. The hagiographic works dealing with this incident suggest that his release was due to outrage expressed by the population of Baghdad, who, when they heard of the harsh treat-ment of their imam, gathered angrily outside the palace in protest, which caused al-Muʿtaṣim to release Aḥmad despite the objections of Ibn Abū Duʾād. The less friendly, Muʿtazilite sources of al-Jāḥiẓ and Ibn al-Murtaḍā as well as others, suggest that Aḥmad actually capitulated and his release was a result of his acknowledgement, as the caliph would have no other real reason to free him. In any case, whatever the truth regarding Aḥmad’s release may be and despite this being one of the few incidents to draw attention during al-Muʿtaṣim’s execution of the miḥna policy, it still remains the most signifi cant.159 Similarly, the miḥna did not relent with the advent of al-Muʿtaṣim’s son al-Wāthiq. In fact, the miḥna can be said to have increased in severity during the beginning of his reign, as he wrote to the various regional capitals, commanding them to a renewed prosecution of the policy. This was particularly true in Egypt, where the regional qāḍī, Muḥammad b. Abū Layth al-Aṣamm, was instructed to implement the miḥna with vigour and he duly complied, leaving no prominent religious fi gure untouched, until the prisons were full with dissenters to the state-imposed creed.160 A more peculiar incident is that of Aḥmad b. Nasr al-Khuzāʿī, who attempted an unfortunate uprising which misfi red and was brought before the caliph for questioning. The interesting feature of this interrogation, however, was not the caliph’s questions regarding the failed coup but that he asked this ‘second’ Aḥmad regarding views concerning the doctrine of the created Qurʾān. His answers, due to his opposition to the creed, are said to have enraged the caliph to the extent that he had him decapitated and his head displayed in Baghdad as a grisly deterrent to would be non-conformists. Perhaps the most signifi cant inci-dent, however, concerns a ‘shaykh from ahl al-fi qh wa ’l-ḥadīth’, who when brought before the caliph and questioned by Ibn Abū Duʾād regarding the creed, bettered the latter in the discussion, which ultimately led to the caliph withdrawing active support for the policy.161 The miḥna did not formally end here either, however, but was eventually abol-ished under al-Wāthiq’s brother and successor, al-Mutawakkil. The whole process of abolition of the policy was not immediate and appears to have taken place over a period of time; the fi rst stage seems to have been the caliphal prohibition of"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The ʿAbbāsid crucible 35debate concerning the Qurʾān throughout the empire, which took place in 234/847, being pre-empted by Ibn Abū Duʾād’s paralysis the year before. Similarly, the following year many of the miḥna qāḍīs, including Ibn Abī Layth, the qāḍī in Egypt, were removed from offi ce and this continued over the next two years. The policy was formerly brought to a close after almost 20 years of persecution and Sunni ‘orthodoxy’ fi rmly re-established in 237/851, with the dismissal of Ibn Abū Duʾād and his sons.162 Having surveyed the most signifi cant historical, political, cultural and intel-lectual events of the early ʿAbbāsid period to our study, we can see clearly that this part of history was an extremely important and interesting era. It remains to be seen, however, how these events may affect the life and development of an individual. This being the case it is equally relevant now to examine the life of our subject, al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī, to examine and assess the impact of these events, if any, on him, his life, his works and his teachings and, indeed, this is the goal of the next chapter.Notes 1 J.

Their state was such that they were also known as ‘the strangers’ [to the worldly life] (al-ghurabāʾ). They were not a specifi c group of people but indeed their number would vary due to their circumstances and condition. However, there were a number of the Companions who would remain in ‘the bench’ (al-ṣuffa) at the back of the mosque on a permanent basis and these included Abū Dharr al-Ghiffārī"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"40 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam(d. 32/652), Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī (d. 44/665), and Salmān al-Fārisī (d. 35/655) among others. The Prophet was known to encourage the more wealthy members of society to feed them and look after them, so that each person would take one or two of them at each mealtime to eat. It is reported that the more well-to-do members of the Medinan society would complain and request the Prophet to remove them from his company because an unpleasant odour would emanate from them (that of sheep – presumably due to their wearing of wool) but when this happened a portion of the Qurʾān was revealed saying, ‘And be the patient with those who call upon their Lord during the morning and evening, hoping for His pleasure and not turn away from them, desiring the adornments of this world. And do not obey those whose hearts we have made heed-less to Our remembrance and those who pursue their desires and whose affairs are worthless’ [Q. 18: 26]. Due to this the Prophet is reported to have shaken hands with them and would not remove his hand until they did so fi rst. In addition, he would not leave their company until they did so fi rst, out of respect for them.

Indeed, this was the case throughout the initial period of Islam’s spread throughout the region, as formulated schools in the traditional sense did not appear until much later.81 See Aḥmad b. ʿAbd Allāh b.

Nevertheless, there is suffi cient material to attempt a chronological reconstruction of his life from these works to attempt to provide a coherent picture of this eminent scholar’s worldly moments. Consequently, the usual biographical sketch will be attempted including a survey of his early life, his teachers, his infl uences, his stu-dents and ultimately his death. In addition, however, since all we have are a few anecdotal statements regarding al-Muḥāsibī, an examination of these reports will be made, as well as a discussion of the controversy surrounding Ibn Ḥanbal’s dispute with him, which unfortunately affected the fi nal days of his life, and his reputation among a section of the scholarly elite in subsequent generations. Finally, an assessment of the effect of al-Muḥāsibī’s milieu, environment and period upon his life will be made to examine to what extent he was ‘a product of his time’.Al-Muḥāsibī’s early lifeThe classical biographical and historical sources agree that al-Ḥārith b. Asad was born in the thriving metropolis of Basra but unfortunately are less forthcoming regarding the date of his entry into this world. More contemporary scholars, however, seem also to have reached a consensus that his birth occurred in the year 165/781 but this is purely a speculative opinion based on circumstantial evidence as support.1 What is more certain is the affi rmation of the appellation ‘al-ʿAnazī’ seemingly denoting an affi liation with the Arab tribe of ʿAnaza, which may well have been one of the Arab tribes to settle in Basra after its establishment.2 Moreo-ver, there is an even larger consensus among the biographical and historical sources that al-Ḥārith b. Asad’s agnomen (kunya) was Abū ʿAbd Allāh; this is in spite of the fact that there is no evidence to suggest he was married or had children and, as such, this seems to be a manifestation of the cultural trend towards the use of kunya in Arab society rather than perhaps having a basis in reality.3 Despite his familial affi liation, there can be little doubt that al-Ḥārith b. Asad al-ʿAnazī did not reach fame under this name but rather under the appellation of ‘al-Muḥāsibī’. Biographers and historians give two accounts regarding its origin:"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The life of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 47the fi rst and less common view posits that the appellation ‘al-Muḥāsibī’ is due to the fact that he possessed a number of small pebbles (ḥaṣan) that he would enu-merate (yaʿudduhā wa yaḥsubuhā) whilst engaged in the remembrance of God (ḥāl al-dhikr).4 The more established opinion regarding the appellation ‘al-Muḥāsibī’, and perhaps more befi tting bearing in mind his teachings, is that it relates to al-Ḥārith’s excessive practice of taking himself to account in all circum-stances (li kathrat muḥāsabatihi li nafsihi fī jamīʿ al-aḥwāl).5 Furthermore, very little is known regarding al-Muḥāsibī’s early life apart from two narrations related by Ibn Ẓafr al-Ṣaqlī in his Anbāʾ, one of which reads as follows:It has reached me that al-Ḥārith b. Asad al-Muḥāsibī, may God be pleased with him, whilst still a child passed by some young boys playing outside the house of a date seller and al-Ḥārith stopped to watch them play. Meanwhile, the owner came out carrying some dates with him and said to al-Ḥārith, ‘Eat these dates’. Al-Ḥārith replied, ‘What do you know about them?’ The date seller said, ‘I have just sold some dates to a man and these fell from them’. Al-Ḥārith then said, ‘Do you know him?’ and he replied ‘Yes’. Al-Ḥārith then turned his attention to the children who were playing and said, ‘Is this man a Muslim?’ to which they [the children] said, ‘Yes, yes’. Al-Ḥārith then left him and the date seller followed until he caught up with him and grabbed him saying to al-Ḥārith, ‘By God I will not release you until you tell me what you think of me’. So he replied, ‘O shaykh if you are a Muslim then seek out the owner of the dates and free yourself from your transaction with him in the same way that you would seek out water if you were extremely thirsty. O shaykh do you feed Muslim children the unlawful (al-suḥt) whilst you yourself are a Muslim?’ The man then said, ‘By God, I will never undertake a worldly transaction again!’6This anecdotal statement is typical of the Sufi biographical tradition and, being couched in religious imagery, it sheds much light on the early life of al-Muḥāsibī. We fi nd that al-Muḥāsibī is a regular child observing his peers at play, although not joining in their frivolity, who is then confronted by a seemingly innocuous offer of dates from a person who would be fully expected to possess them, i.e. a date seller. Al-Muḥāsibī does not just simply accept the offer, however, but rather enquires as to the source of the dates in order to ascertain their lawfulness and after fi nding out that they were unlawful, which is made worse by the fact that the owner of the dates is a Muslim, the devout youth fl ees to escape such an undesir-able scene. Consequently, on confronting the date seller, he shocks him further with a pious admonishment that not only clarifyies the legal aspect for him but also counsels him in a sermonising manner, showing the enormity of his crime by drawing his attention to the fact that he had not only committed a forbidden act but, in addition, intended to involve the next generation of believers in it also. Thus, the intention of this report is clear; to clarify that al-Muḥāsibī at even a young age was indeed knowledgeable, scrupulous and concerned with the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"48 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamaffairs of his community, which in itself is a pattern that he would follow into adulthood. The same author provides us with another glimpse of the young al-Ḥārith in the following text:It has reached me that a woman came to him [al-Muḥāsibī] while he was in elementary school (al-maktab) and requested that he write a letter for her, which he did and she gave him a dirham but he returned it to her, so she took it and left. The teacher (al-muʾaddib) then said to him, ‘Why did you return the dirham to her when she had engaged your services [and paid you] for it?’ He [al-Muḥāsibī] replied, ‘Because of His, the Exalted’s statement, “And let no scribe refuse to write as God has taught him [to do so]”,7 so I wrote it [the letter] for her out of obedience to God, as He commanded, so how can I take payment for being obedient to God?’ The teacher then asked, ‘Then what prevented you from giving it to me if you didn’t want to take it?’ So al-Ḥārith replied, ‘I was prevented by His, Glory be to Him, the Exalted’s statement, “And they will surely carry their [own] burdens and [other] burdens in addition to their burdens and they will surely be questioned on the Day of Resurrection regarding what they used to fabricate.”’8This further anecdote creates yet another image of piety for us regarding our subject al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī; an image of a boy who, when employing the skills acquired as part of his education, still refused to take payment for his efforts out of fear that it would impinge upon his sincerity and distract him from implement-ing the command of his Lord. The use of the Qurʿān in the report also indicates to us that, even at such a young age, he perhaps memorised a large portion if not all of the text, as he quotes from disparate places at will. What is far more signifi cant is the application of this knowledge in a practical manner, even in the minute details of his life. He implements this knowledge further with the teacher, remind-ing him that despite the dirham which he enquired about being of little worth and seemingly insignifi cant in this life, its implications would be much greater in the hereafter, thus admonishing him in the process. Similarly, al-Muḥāsibī may have well left the issue at refusing to take the money but instead attempts to avert a disaster in the hereafter for not only one of his peers but also one of his elders. Once again we are given a portrait of a youth full of devotion, who shows his concern for those in his community but also demonstrates his highly honed spir-itual insight. In addition, he is shown to prefer the lasting pleasures of the here-after to the fl eeting comforts of the worldly life and, as such, it is not surprising that he lived in poverty for most of his life, as his religious conviction would not allow him to make a living at the expense of his service to God. In a another report, we fi nd an equally impressive account of al-Muḥāsibī’s religious zeal, as once again Abū Nuʿaym relates in his Ḥilyat al-Awliyāʾ:I heard Abū ’l-Ḥasan b. Muqsim say: I heard Abū ʿAlī b. Khayrān al-Faqīh say: I saw Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Ḥārith b. Asad at Bāb al-Ṭāq (the Gate of the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The life of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 49Archway)9 in the middle of the road clinging to his father whilst the people gathered [around them] saying to him, ‘Divorce my mother as you are upon one religion and she is upon another’.10This report concerning his relationship with his father indicates that by this time al-Muḥāsibī and his family had moved to Baghdad and so this incident must have taken place there. What is more striking, however, is the zealous approach of al-Muḥāsibī regarding the issue of his father’s theological stance, from which it is quite apparent that he thought of it as innovative from a religious perspective and, thus, completely rejected. So much so that he felt it necessary to proclaim his disapproval of this publicly, hence the signifi cance of the incident taking place at Bāb al-Ṭāq. Notwithstanding, his request for his father to divorce his mother is equally signifi cant, as this cannot be regarded as an act of scrupulousness (waraʿ), which by its nature is a supererogatory act, but we can only assume that al-Muḥāsibī held his father’s belief to be an act of disbelief (kufr), as there is no other explanation for his insistence that a solemn marriage vow be broken. Thus, we can conclude not only that al-Muḥāsibī was pious and scrupulous as a young man but also that his religious fervour was intense, to the extent that even his closest family members were not spared. Al-Muḥāsibī’s scrupulousness, fi rst seen as a young boy in Ibn Ẓafr al-Ṣaqlī’s reports above, was to manifest itself further in adulthood in another narration, which Abū Nuʿaym relates in his Ḥilyat al-Awliyāʾ:Jaʿfar [al-Khuldī] informed me that Abū ’l-Ḥasan told him that he heard al-Junayd say: On the day that al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī’s father died al-Ḥārith was in desperate need of a silver dāniq11 and his father had left a huge sum of money12 but he took nothing from it; he [al-Ḥārith] would say, ‘The people of two [differing] religions do not inherit from one another’,13 as his father was a Wāqifī.14, 15There can be little doubt that this text is indicative of al-Muḥāsibī’s extreme scru-pulousness (waraʿ ) as, indeed, he forfeited what can be considered a huge fortune, which was rightfully his and in spite of his grave need, for the sake of avoiding any remote chance of there being the slightest doubt (shubha) regarding his father’s wealth.16 The same report, upon refl ection, is also indicative of other factors, however; for example, it informs us that al-Muḥāsibī, despite his later poverty, may have been raised in a household with considerable wealth. This in turn may also cause us to conclude that due to this fi nancial stability he may have been privy to a high standard of religious education, which was common to the period in his places of residence, both Basra and Baghdad. This is also confi rmed by his familiarity with both the lawful (al-ḥalāl) and the unlawful (al-ḥarām) as indicated in the fi rst two reports and his knowledge of ḥadīth, as indicated by the third. In addition, the fact that his father held such a theological stance is indica-tive not only of the extent of the controversy concerning the created Qurʾān but"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"50 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamalso of the fact that al-Muḥāsibī’s father was equally acquainted with the issue and, consequently, may have been equally conversant with other aspects of religious knowledge and learning.Al-Muḥāsibī’s teachers17The primary education indicated in the anecdotes mentioned above was not only acquired by al-Muḥāsibī at the basic level but, like so many scholars of his period, he also undertook studies of an advanced type. Perhaps one of the most common forms of study was that of ḥadīth and, as with many of his contemporaries, he undertook instruction in this discipline with a variety of traditionists of the period. The very nature of ḥadīth transmission, i.e. its narration-based format, dictates that the number of narrations transmitted from a singe shaykh may vary from one scholar to another and in this sense al-Muḥāsibī was no different. Those from whom he relates only singular narrations include: Hushaym b. Bashīr (d. 183/799)18, Marwān b. Shujāʿ (d. 184/800),19 Wakīʿ b. Jarrāḥ (d. 197/813),20 ʿAbbād b. al-ʿAwwām (d. 185/801),21 ʿAlī b. ʿĀṣim (d. 201/816),22 Sulayman b. Dāwūd al-Ṭayālīsī (d. 203/818),23 Abū Nuʿaym al-Faḍl b. Dukayn [ʿAmr b. Ḥammād al-Taymī] (d. 219/834)24 and Abū Bakr b. Abū Shayba (d. 235/849)25 Similarly, there were other scholars from whom he related more than one narration and these included: Yaḥyā b. Abū Bukayr (d. 209/824),26 ʿAbd Allāh b. Bakr (d. 208/823),27 Ḥujayn b. al-Muthannā (d. 205/820),28 Abū ʿUbayd al-Qāsim b. Sallām (d. 224/839),29 Sunayd b. Dāwūd al-Miṣṣīṣī (d. 226/841),30 Surayj b. Yūnus (d. 235/849),31 ʿAffān al-Baṣrī (d. 220/835),32 ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz b. ʿAbd Allāh33 and Muḥammad b. Kathīr.34 In addi-tion, it is well documented that the most famous of his ḥadīth shaykhs was Yazīd b. Hārūn (d. 206/821), from whom he received a great many ḥadīth.35 In addition to ḥadīth, one of the other foremost religious disciplines studied at the time was jurisprudence (fi qh) and once again it is not surprising that al-Muḥāsibī also underwent a form of juridical training, which is apparent in many of his works but especially in Fahm al-Ṣalāt, Kitāb al-Makāsib and Kitāb al-Masāʾil fī Aʿmāl al-Qulūb wa ’l-Jawāriḥ. What is more striking, however, is that al-Muḥāsibī is not linked with one of the many, perhaps more obscure, per-sonalities but, indeed, is documented as being a pupil of none other than Muḥammad b. Idrīs al-Shāfi ʿī (d. 204/820), the founder of the Shāfi ʿī school of jurisprudence (al-madhhab al-shāfi ʿī ). However, many of the scholars of this school contest the notion that al-Muḥāsibī was a direct disciple of al-Shāfi ʿī and maintain rather that he was included in the fi rst generation of jurists to follow al-Shāfi ʿī who were not his direct pupils, as the following statement from Ibn Ṣalāḥ al-Shahrazūrī (d. 643/1245) indicates:Abū Manṣūr al-Tamīmī regarded him [al-Muḥāsibī] as being from the fi rst generation (al-ṭabaqa al-ūlā) of the Shāfi ʿī scholars who associated [directly] with (ṣaḥiba) al-Shāfi ʿī, saying, ‘[al-Muḥāsibī is an] imam of the Muslims in jurisprudence (al-fi qh), principles (al-uṣūl), Sufi sm (al-taṣawwuf), prophetic narration (ḥadīth) and scholastic theology (kalām). His books in these"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The life of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 51 disciplines are the foundation for whoever desired to write on such subjects. [In addition], most of the theologians of al-Ṣifātiyya36 are linked with him.’ He [al-Tamīmī] also said, ‘If there had been no one else than al-Ḥārith b. Asad al-Muḥāsibī from the companions of al-Shāfi ʿī in jurisprudence (al-fi qh), scholastic theology (kalām), principles (al-uṣūl), analogical deduc-tion (al-qiyās), abstinence (al-zuhd), scrupulousness (al-waraʿ) and gnosis (al-maʿrifa), it would have been “dust in the faces” of his opponents and all praise is due to God for that’.37Ibn Ṣalāḥ then states:I haven’t seen his [al-Muḥāsibī’s] association with al-Shāfi ʿī, may God be pleased with him, mentioned by anyone other than him [al-Tamīmī]. In this regard, Abū Manṣūr is not an expert, such that a unique opinion of his would be relied upon and, in fact, corroborating evidence bears witness to the lack of al-Muḥāsibī’s association with al-Shāfi ʿī.38Commenting on this appraisal, al-Subki (d. 771/1370) says:If Abū Manṣūr has clearly stated that he [al-Muḥāsibī] associated [directly] with al-Shāfi ʿī, then an objection to this is appropriate, otherwise when he said, ‘The fi rst generation’, he must have meant of those who were contem-poraries of al-Shāfi ʿī and, as such, those who were of the generation who took from his knowledge. Abū ʿĀṣim al-ʿAbbādī also mentioned him in the fi rst generation, saying, ‘He was from the contemporaries of al-Shāfi ʿī and chose his school’, and he didn’t say, ‘He was of those who associated [directly] with him’. So perhaps this is what Abū Manṣūr meant.39Thus, it would seem that al-Muḥāsibī did not in fact directly study with al-Shāfi ʿī but, nevertheless, it is apparent from these excerpts also that he was clearly regarded as a pupil of al-Shāfi ʿī’s in the sense that he adopted his principles and adhered to his school. In addition to traditionist and jurisprudential studies, al-Muḥāsibī also acquired knowledge concerning the Arabic linguistic tradition and the sciences of the Qurʾān (al-lugha wa ’l-Qurʾān). These disciplines were studied in particular with Abū ʿUbayd al-Qāsim b. Sallām (d. 224/839), who is famous for the works Gharīb al-Ḥadīth and Kitāb al-Amwāl and with whom al-Muḥāsibī also studied ḥadīth. It is likely, therefore, that under the tutelage of Abū ʿUbayd, al-Muḥāsibī mastered the concepts of abrogation (al-nāsikh wa ’l-mansūkh) and other Qurʾānic sciences such as the ‘general’ and the ‘specifi c’ (al-ʿāmm wa ’l-khāṣṣ), which are apparent in his work entitled Fahm al-Qurʾān. From this it is clear that from an early period al-Muḥāsibī understood that many of the disputes which raged in his time revolved around linguistic concepts regarding the Qurʾānic text and to this effect we fi nd that many of his narrations from Sulaymān b. Dāwūd al-Ṭayālīsī (d. 203/818), Surayj b. Yūnus (d. 235/849) and Yazīd b. Hārūn (d. 206/821) are related to these issues.40"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"52 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam Thus, it is clear from the accounts above that al-Muḥāsibī enjoyed an excellent education, typical of what the period offered in terms of instruction and the extent of which is apparent from the variety of sources that he quotes.Al-Muḥāsibī’s sources41In addition to and most probably as part of the learning al-Muḥāsibī undertook, we can identify numerous sources which he quotes, both to clarify his thought and add credence to it. As such, al-Muḥāsibī, in addition to quoting the Qurʾān and ḥadīth literature, provides a rich mosaic of opinions from the early generations of scholars, which at times reads like a ‘who’s who’ of famous and important Islamic personalities.42 Thus, in the Companion generation (al-ṣaḥāba) we fi nd a variety of names including the following: Abū Bakr [al-Ṣiddīq] (d. 13/634), ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb (d. 23/644), ʿUthmān b. ʿAffān (d. 35/655), ʿAlī b. Abū Ṭālib (d. 40/660), ʿAbd Allāh b. Masʿūd (d. 32/652), ʿAbd Allāh b. al-ʿAbbās (d. 57/678), Hudhayfa b. al-Yamān (d. 36/657), Muʿādh b. Jabal (d. 17/639), Abu Dardāʾ [ʿUwaymar b. ʿAbd Allāh] (d. 32/653), Abū Hurayra [ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Sakhr al-Dawsī] (d. 58/677), Abū Mūsā [ʿAbd Allāh b. Qays] al-Ashʿarī (d. 44/665), ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿAmr al-ʿĀṣ (d. 79/698), Tamīm al-Dārī, Kaʿb al-Aḥbār (d. 32/652) and ʿAbd Allāh b. Salām (d. 43/663) among others.43 In the following generation of the Successors (al-tābiʿūn) we fi nd an equally impressive array of personalities upon whom al-Muḥāsibī relies, including: Abū ʿĀliya (d. 90/708), Saʿīd b. al-Musayyib (d. 91/709 or 94/712), Ibrāhīm al-Taymī (d. 92/710), ʿAbd Allāh b. Qays (d. 103/721), Mujāhid b. Jabr al-Makhzūmī (d. 104/722) and Ṭāwūs b. Kaysān al-Yamanī (d. 105/723). However, the most impor-tant authorities of this generation with regard to al-Muḥāsibī’s works are Abū ʿAbd Allāh Wahb b. Munabbih al-Dimārī (b. 110/728) and the celebrated al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī (d. 110/728). Of the later luminaries of this period we also fi nd ʿAṭāʾ b. Abū Rabāḥ (d. 115/733) and the mystic students of al-Ḥasan, Thābit b. Aslam al-Bunānī (d. 123/741 or 127/745), Mālik b. Dīnār (d. 128/746) and Ayyūb b. Tamīma al-Sikhtiyānī (d. 131/749).44 Similarly, from around the middle of the second–eighth centuries we fi nd the following authorities quoted: Sulaymān b. Mihrān al-Aʿmash (d. 148/765), Ibn Jurayj al-Makkī (d. 150/767), ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. ʿAmr al-Awzāʿī (d. 157/773), Abū ʿUthmān Wuhayb al-Makkī (d. 153/773), Sufyān al-Thawrī (d. 161/777) and Ibrāhīm b. Adham (d. 160/777). Following on from this group of scholars we then fi nd a number of al-Muḥāsibī’s contemporaries who are also quoted: Fuḍayl b. ʿIyāḍ (d. 188/803), Shaqīq al-Balkhī (d. 194/809), Sufyān b. ʿUyayna (d. 198/814), Muḥammad b. Idrīs al-Shāfi ʿī (d. 204/820), Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal (d. 241/855), Abū Sulaymān al-Dārānī (d. 215/830), Bishr b. al-Ḥārith al-Ḥāfī (d. 227/842) and Dhū ’l-Nūn al-Miṣrī (d. 245/860).45 The selection of authorities quoted by al-Muḥāsibī alluded to in this section has been provided merely to demonstrate the range of al-Muḥāsibī’s learning and familiarity with a variety of fi elds of study and their major personalities."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The life of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 53Thus, within this representative collection we fi nd scholars famous as Qurʾānic exegetes (mufassirūn), traditionists (muḥaddithūn) and jurists (fuqahāʾ), all of whom al-Muḥāsibī quotes effortlessly, not only exemplifying his own level of knowledge and understanding but also adding – indirectly – ‘orthodox’ author-ity to his own works. Further, these quotations also indicate to us that al-Muḥāsibī did not consider himself to be ‘innovating’ a new technique of spirituality and purifi cation of the soul but rather, that he based his teaching on ‘classical’ Islamic sources of learning. Yet, at the same time, he was developing his own unique approach to moral psychology in an Islamic framework drawn from these very sources, which would be utilised by mystics for centuries to come.Al-Muḥāsibī’s students46The foremost student of al-Muḥāsibī is without doubt Abū ’l-Qāsim al-Junayd b. Muḥammad (d. 298/910), the celebrated latter-day leader of the Baghdadi school and through whom we have retained a great deal of information regarding al-Muḥāsibī, particularly in Abū Nuʿaym’s Ḥilyat al-Awliyāʾ.47 Another of the primary fi gures of the Baghdadi school who became synonymous with it and who was also associated with al-Muḥāsibī was Abū ’l-Ḥusayn Aḥmad b. Muḥammad al-Nūrī (d. 295/907).48 Similarly, Abū ’l-ʿAbbās Aḥmad b. Masrūq al-Ṭūsī (d. 298/910) also gained a considerable reputation within Sufi circles and was likewise an associate of al-Muḥāsibī, providing us with some of the anecdotal phrases we fi nd regarding his shaykh in Abū Nuʿaym’s Ḥilya.49 Another of al-Muḥāsibī’s associates who also had mystical proclivities and was also a traditionist, yet of whom little is known, is Aḥmad b. al-Ḥasan b. Abd al-Jabbār ‘al-Ṣūfī al-Kabīr’ (d. 306/918) who transmitted ḥadīth from his teacher.50 Perhaps the greatest contributor after al-Junayd to our portrait of al-Muḥāsibī in Ḥilyat al-Awliyāʾ is the little known Abū ʿAbd Allāh Aḥmad b. ʿAbd Allāh al-Khawwāṣ, whose many narrations also indicate his intimacy with our subject.51 Of the less well-known disciples of al-Muḥāsibī was Abū Bakr Aḥmad b. al-Qāsim al-Farāʾiḍī (d. 310/932), the brother of Abū Layth, who led an extremely ascetical lifestyle and who also related ḥadīth from his teacher.52 More famous in Sufi circles, being celebrated in their hagiographic works, was Abū Ḥamza Muḥammad b. Ibrāhīm al-Bazzāz [al-Baghdādī] (d. 269/883), who famously taught his ideas publicly and seemingly enjoyed the approval of Ibn Ḥanbal.53 A close associate of al-Muḥāsibī was Abū Bakr Ismāʿīl b. Isḥāq al-Sarrāj (d. 286/899) to the extent that his teacher would gather in the aforementioned stu-dent’s house with his other disciples.54 Finally, perhaps an unexpected associate of al-Muḥāsibī was Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥusayn b. Ṣāliḥ Ibn Khayrān (d. 310/923), who was a renowned Shāfi ʿī jurist (faqīh) known for his scrupulousness to the extent that he refused a judgeship (al-qaḍāʾ), yet despite his juridical background we fi nd him narrating directly regarding al-Muḥāsibī, thus once again indicating his intimacy with our subject.55"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"54 Spiritual Purifi cation in IslamRelated anecdotes regarding al-MuḥāsibīSince the historical and biographical works offer us very little information about the life of al-Muḥāsibī, other than a series of anecdotal statements, it is appropri-ate here that a selection of these be examined to assess exactly what kind of picture we are presented with regarding his life and personality. Much of this information is provided by his foremost student Abū ’l-Qāsim al-Junayd, from whom the following narration is transmitted in Abū Nuʿaym’s Ḥilya:Al-Ḥārith was very emaciated and as he passed by one day while I was sitting at our door, I saw that his face was further shrunken due to hunger, so I said to him, ‘O uncle, if you enter you can partake of something we have’. He replied, ‘Would you do that?’ and I said, ‘Yes, and by doing so you will have pleased me and honoured me’. So I entered and he followed; I proceeded swiftly to my uncle’s house, as it was more spacious than ours and was never empty of sump-tuous foods, the like of which we didn’t have in our house.56 I then brought a variety of foods and set them before him. He then stretched out his hand and took a morsel, raising it to his mouth; I saw him chew it but he did not swallow it and then he left without speaking to me. The next day I met him and said, ‘O uncle you pleased me and then you caused me distress’. So he replied, ‘O my son, as for my need it was great and I made every effort to partake of the food you set before me but there is a sign between myself and God57 – if the food is not acceptable to Him, a rancid odour arises in my nose from it, which I cannot accept,58 so I threw that morsel in your porch way and left’.59In some reports the narration continues with al-Junayd asking, ‘“Will you enter today?” and he said, “Yes!” So I set before him a piece of bread that we had and he ate it and said, “If you offer anything to the destitute (al-faqīr)60 then offer such as this”’.61 The reports in the primary sources vary somewhat regarding this par-ticular anecdote, casting some doubt as to its authenticity yet, at the same time, the main features remain consistent. The fi rst identifi able feature is al-Muḥāsibī’s desperate state of poverty being evidenced by his emaciated appearance, which was clearly visible to his disciple. Despite this being an indication of his other-worldliness, we can also conclude that this was not necessarily a state which he chose, since when he was invited to eat by his student, he dutifully accepted, ful-fi lling the Prophetic guidance on the subject. Where his true spiritual status is indicated is in the next part of the story; previous anecdotal narrations have shown al-Muḥāsibī’s extreme sense of scrupulousness but here, in this narration, this characteristic is enhanced further, as al-Muḥāsibī is held in a kind of ‘divine custody’ where, due to his own efforts at being scrupulous, God has granted him an elevated state of protection from all that is unlawful and doubtful from the perspective of sacred law.62 As such, this is indicative of not only his advanced spiritual station but also his preference of his Lord’s pleasure as opposed to the ephemeral enjoyments of the"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The life of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 55worldly life, as he forsakes the food from the wedding feast – usually the most delicious and well-prepared – for food which is not only lawful in a strictly legal sense but has also gained God’s approval. This is further evidenced by the addi-tion to the narration, which shows al-Muḥāsibī’s preference for the simple, humble sustenance of a true devotee of God, i.e. a simple piece of bread that will suffi ce his hunger and please his Lord, rather than a sumptuous banquet of ‘doubtful’ origins, suggestive of the fl eeting pleasures of this life. In another report preserved in Ḥilya we fi nd that Abū Nuʿaym narrates on the authority of Jaʿfar al-Khuldī that al-Junayd stated:I would often say to al-Ḥārith, ‘Seclusion is my delight and you extract me [from it] to the alienation of seeing people and [the “dangers” of ] the streets’, so he replied, ‘How often you say that seclusion is your delight! Yet if half of [God’s] creation came close to me I would fi nd no delight [in their company] and if the other half distanced themselves from me I would not feel alienated due to their remoteness’.63In this statement we also fi nd a variety of features that are used to indicate his spiritual station and ascetical nature. The fi rst feature is al-Muḥāsibī’s correction of the misplaced notion that being detached from the world in a spiritual sense or to refrain from sin requires that one remain secluded from society. On the con-trary, al-Muḥāsibī clarifi es for his student that being detached from the world requires no physical detachment but rather a spiritual detachment of the heart from the world and those who exist within it. This in turn clarifi es for us not only al-Muḥāsibī’s concept of this issue but also that this was indeed his own spiritual experience as he is talking from a purely personal perspective. In addition, it also gives a further indication of al-Muḥāsibī’s ability to discern the fi ner, more subtle qualities of human nature and, similarly, his pedagogical skill in providing guidance to an aspirant upon the spiritual path. In a seemingly related narration, again it is al-Junayd, who informs us in Abū Nuʿaym’s Ḥilya:Al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī would come to our house and say, ‘Come with me and let’s go to the desert’. So I would reply, ‘Would you turn me out from my seclusion and the security of my soul to the [‘dangers’ of ] the streets, tribula-tions and to witness carnal desires?’ He replied, ‘Come out with me and do not fear’. So I went out with him and it was as if the street was empty, such that we saw nothing that we disliked. When I reached the place where he would sit he said, ‘Ask me’, to which I would reply, ‘I have no question to ask’, and he would repeat, ‘Ask me about what occurs in your soul’, and questions would crowd in on me such that I would ask him and he would answer me immediately and then return home, writing them as books.64This narration begins by further reiterating the main message of the last anecdote, i.e. that al-Muḥāsibī was not merely an exoteric ascetic – although he was known"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"56 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamfor his outward renouncement of the world – but for him, it was an esoteric asceti-cism of the heart, which was also vitally important. Similarly, we fi nd him por-trayed as a man entirely certain of his reliance on God, as when questioned anxiously by his disciple he simply replies, ‘Come out with me and do not fear’, thus instilling a sense of calm and serenity in his student, allaying his genuine concern. Another, ‘miraculous’ event then ensues, with al-Muḥāsibī’s certainty proven true as God seemingly rewards his trust in Him by emptying the street of all that al-Junayd feared – which serves as a further indication of his elevated status and proximity to God. Perhaps the most striking feature of this narration, however, is the section relating to al-Muḥāsibī’s questioning of his associate, which is equally suggestive of his concern for his student and also of his quest to reach the depths of human experience and provide answers to the spiritual ailments of his peers. The very nature of the question and answer format referred to in the report – which also adorns many of his works – is also indicative of his intimate relationship with his disciples and a specifi c and unique, esoteric approach to purifi cation of the soul, rather than relying on a merely ritualistic enactment of physical acts of worship. In essence al-Muḥāsibī strives to reach the very core and nature of the soul so as to enhance its positive qualities and leave it bereft of the negativity of its base proclivities. Consequently, this unique and very ‘hands on’ approach supplied al-Muḥāsibī with the basis for his essential works on moral psychology for which he became renowned. Consequently, al-Muḥāsibī demonstrates a profound knowledge of human nature and its weaknesses that predates Freud by a millen-nium, albeit in a religious context, and reveals ‘the discerning wisdom and inspired insight of a true spiritual director and shepherd of souls’.65 In another such anecdote we fi nd the following story related in al-Hujwīrī’s (d. 465/1073 or 469/1077) Kashf al-Maḥjūb:He [al-Muḥāsibī] possessed a ‘king bird’ (shāhmurghī), which used to sing aloud. One day, Abū Ḥamza al-Baghdādī, who was al-Ḥārith’s pupil and an ecstatic man, came to see him and during his visit the bird sang and Abū Ḥamza shrieked out loud. Al-Ḥārith rose, seizing a knife and declared, ‘You are a disbeliever’, and would have executed him had it not been for the inter-vention of his disciples. Then he [al-Ḥārith] said to Abū Ḥamza, ‘Become a Muslim O reprobate!’ His disciples exclaimed, ‘O shaykh, we all know him to be one of the elect saints and monotheists, why does the shaykh regard him with suspicion?’ Al-Ḥārith replied, ‘I do not suspect him, his opinions are sound and I know that he is a profound monotheist but why should he do something that resembles the incarnationists (al-ḥulūliyyūn), which has the appearance of being derived from their doctrine? If a senseless bird sings capriciously after its fashion, why should he behave as though its song were the voice of God? God is indivisible and the Eternal does not become incar-nate, united with creation or merged with it.’ When Abū Ḥamza perceived the shaykh’s insight, he said, ‘O shaykh, although I am right in theory, nevertheless, since my action resembled those of heretics, I repent and withdraw’.66"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The life of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 57In this excerpt, al-Muḥāsibī is portrayed as a strict adherent to ‘orthodox’ doc-trines, not tolerating for one moment phrases resembling the ‘ecstatic utterances’ (al-shaṭaḥāt) of the so-called intoxicated school of Sufi sm (al-sukr), exemplifi ed by such notables as Abū Yazīd al-Bisṭāmī (d. 234/848 or 261/875) and al-Ḥusayn b. Manṣūr al-Ḥallāj (d. 309/922). Furthermore, al-Muḥāsibī is seen as a paragon of strict orthodox virtue, defending the beliefs of Islam to the extent of threatening one of his own students with the most severe of consequences for his errant mis-demeanour. Similarly, al-Muḥāsibī is also portrayed as an erudite spiritual master, explaining the reason for his apparently extreme reaction and, consequently, clarify ing for his students his views regarding spiritual purifi cation and develop-ment on the path to God. Thus for al-Muḥāsibī his goal is not divine union (al-ittiḥād) or incarnation (al-ḥulūl) like that of the ‘ecstatic’ Sufi s but rather an evacuation of all falsehood from the inner sanctuary of the soul, to allow it to be purifi ed and thus elevated by attaining closeness to God. In summary, in al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī we are presented with an image of a man who was erudite in the fi elds of learning of his day and strictly ‘orthodox’ in his belief, yet at the same time a man who had acquired great spiritual insight and a window upon the human soul, to the extent that his spiritual state and proximity with regard to God was of the highest rank. This is particularly true of the Sufi hagiographical works and their apologia, where al-Muḥāsibī is regarded as one of the early exemplars of their tradition, being held in the highest esteem. Neverthe-less, despite this ‘positive press’ al-Muḥāsibī was not without his detractors and, indeed, his personality is equally couched in controversy within sections of the biographical and historical literature.67Al-Muḥāsibī’s deathAlthough there is no confi rmed report of the date of al-Muḥāsibī’s birth, the historical biographers are in agreement that his death occurred in 243/857, approximately two years after that of his contemporary Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal. With regard to this incident, we fi nd the following report:Al-qāḍī al-Ḥusayn b. Ismāʿīl al-Maḥāmilī said Abū Bakr b. Hārūn b. al-Mujaddar told me, ‘I was present at the demise of al-Ḥārith – meaning al-Muḥāsibī – and he said to us, “If I see that which pleases me then I will smile at you but if I see something else [other than that which pleases me] you will fi nd it apparent on my face”.68 Then he smiled and passed away’.69This ‘pleasant’ end, indicative of piety in the hagiographical literature, was cer-tainly short-lived at his funeral, as, even if God had accepted his efforts during his life, the people of Baghdad were less forgiving, apparently due to Ibn Ḥanbal’s abjuration of al-Muḥāsibī and the population of Baghdad’s fanaticism for the great traditionist. In this regard we fi nd that Abū ’l-Qāsim al-Naṣrābādhī (d. 367/977–8) narrates:"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"58 Spiritual Purifi cation in IslamIt has reached me that al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī had spoken [on issues] regarding scholastic theology (al-kalām), so Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal repudiated him and he [al-Muḥāsibī] went into hiding in a house in Baghdad, dying therein; only four people prayed over him [at his funeral] and he passed away in the year two hundred and forty three.70The place of al-Muḥāsibī’s burial is therefore confi rmed as being Baghdad yet there is some dispute as to the actual location of his grave71; al-Mustawfī (d. 750/1349), for example, proposes in his work Nuzhat al-Qulūb that his grave is on the west side of Baghdad. On the contrary, al-Bundanījī (d. 1283/1866) in his Jāmiʿ al-Anwār goes into great detail, suggesting that al-Muḥāsibī is buried on the east side of Baghdad on the site of a mosque formally known as ‘Zāwiyat al-Mawlawiyya’ built by Dāwūd Bāshā and now known as ‘Jāmiʿ al-Āṣawiyya’.72The effect of al-Muḥāsibī’s milieu on his lifeHaving selectively examined the era in which al-Muḥāsibī lived in the last chapter and consequently shed considerable light on his personal biography in the current chapter, it is equally befi tting here to discuss to what extent this historical period had an effect on our subject, to try and assess the extent that his surroundings played in shaping his life. Although in reality little biographical detail is available regarding the specifi cs of al-Muḥāsibī’s life, one factor that is confi rmed is that his birth and formative years were in Basra. Similarly, the suggested date of his birth is 165/781 and at that time we may assume that Basra was at the beginning of its decline as a major urban centre, coinciding naturally with the rise and fl ourishing of Baghdad. Nevertheless, one may also assume that the ascetic tradition that was associ-ated with Basra did not die overnight and indeed, bearing in mind that this social trend is said to originate with the Prophetic Companion Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, one may suggest that this world view was deeply rooted in certain sections of Basran society. In fact this early pietistic trend was further developed with the group of individuals whom al-Nashshār terms ‘the fi rst Basran school’ (madrasat al-Baṣra al-ūlā), which culminated in the life and personality of Basra’s most famous son al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī and the development of another group of ascetics who formed the basis of ‘the second Basran school’ (madrasat al-Baṣra al-thāniya). Although al-Muḥāsibī was far too young to have met most of these personalities, some of them such as ʿAbd al-Wāḥid b. Zayd and his student Riyāḥ b. ʿAmr al-Qaysī were still alive in his childhood years and, despite having no fi rm evidence to support their meeting, it seems reasonable to assume that the trend towards religious aus-terity and moral excellence was still prevalent in his early life, a fact which seems confi rmed by the two narrations from Ibn Ẓafr al-Ṣaqlī. This was not the only tangible infl uence that may have had an effect on his early life in Basra, however, as the trend towards rational and dialectical theology seems also to have started there. Indeed, one of the earliest incidences of this sort – as the tradition would have it – appears to have occurred within the circle of al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī, ultimately leading to the exit of one of his students Wāṣil b."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The life of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 59ʿAṭāʾ. This incident is quoted as being the historical starting point for the Muʿtazilite movement and, consequently, al-Muḥāsibī was contemporaneous with some of the Basran school’s greatest fi gures, including Abū Hudhayl and al-Naẓẓām. Despite this, al-Muḥāsibī did not join or indeed even accept the teach-ings of the early Muʿtazilites but rather, in the tradition of al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī, remained strictly ‘orthodox’ in his outlook. At the same time, however, one cannot help but feel that this familiarity with such a methodology at an early stage may well have infl uenced his use of scholastic theology at a later stage. Having spent his formative years in Basra, he moved to Baghdad with his family at an early age, most probably due to the perceived opportunities therein and the relative decline of Basra, as Baghdad had now been established as the ʿAbbāsid state capital for at least 20 years or more. It is here that al-Muḥāsibī seems to have fl ourished as a young man, particularly in terms of his learning. It will be remembered from the last chapter that this period is often referred to as ‘the Golden era’ of Islamic learning and, despite that fact that there is no evidence to suggest that al-Muḥāsibī was involved with the ‘secular’ disciplines of medi-cine, philosophy and astronomy, there is ample evidence of his engagement with religious learning. Indeed, it is equally clear from the second quotation from Ibn Ẓafr al-Ṣaqlī that al-Muḥāsibī’s training began very early in the basics of reading, writing and memorising the Qurʾān, and we may assume that this process contin-ued after his move to Baghdad. In fact al-Muḥāsibī himself alludes to this at the beginning of his work al-Naṣāʾiḥ, and his studies in the Qurʾān and ḥadīth, as well as fi qh, have already been alluded to earlier in this chapter.73 The tendency towards the learning and teaching of the Qurʾān, ḥadīth and fi qh was not the only intellectual trend that was present in Baghdad, however, and, indeed, the inclination towards a moralising, spiritual asceticism that was preva-lent in both Kūfa and Basra prior to the establishment of Baghdad continued in a new form in the new state capital. The manifestation of this trend seems to have been a reaction to the affl uence and somewhat ‘irreligious’ lifestyle that was a remnant of the old Umayyad dynasty but continued – albeit in a form cloaked in a much more religious appearance – with the advent of the ʿAbbāsids and the expansion of their empire. As a consequence, such trends evolved in Baghdad became the fi rst ‘model’ to which the subsequent generations of Sufi s would turn to for inspiration, being known as the ‘Mystical school of Baghdad’. This ‘school’ combined a variety of ascetical and spiritual teachings and was developed by the efforts of a number of prominent personalities such as Maʿrūf al-Karkhī, Bishr b. al-Ḥārith al-Ḥāfī and Sarī al-Saqaṭī, as well as al-Muḥāsibī himself, and culmi-nated with the ‘sober’ (ṣaḥw) school of Sufi sm associated with al-Junayd. Such eminent company was no doubt a great infl uence on the life and teachings of al-Muḥāsibī and combined with the introspective asceticism of the Basrans, as exemplifi ed by al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī, provided the essence of much of his thought. What is equally apparent, however, in addition to the deep, spiritual tendencies found in the teachings of al-Muḥāsibī, is his staunch stance regarding the Muʿtazilites, of which there was by now a second school in the capital of Baghdad and, chronologically at least, many of their most famous exponents such as Bishr"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"60 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamb. Muʿtamir were also his contemporaries. His defence of ‘orthodox’ Sunni doc-trines reaches its pinnacle – as will be seen in the next chapter – in his works Māhiyyat al-ʿAql and Fahm al-Qurʾān but is equally tangible in his own personal life with both of the narrations elucidating his relationship with his father, all of which indicates not only the widespread extent of the Muʿtazilite doctrines but also the effect that this dispute had on him personally. One may also assume that this was a major factor in his employing scholastic theology (ʿilm al-kalām) as an approach, so as to hold a discourse with the Muʿtazilites, in an attempt to defeat them using their own vernacular and methodology. Related to this of course is the most singularly signifi cant reliogio-political event during al-Muḥāsibī’s life, i.e. that of the miḥna, since this was intrinsically linked to the Muʿtazilite movement and the caliph’s support for it at a state level. Bearing in mind al-Muḥāsibī’s strong refutation of Muʿtazilite doctrines, one may have expected to fi nd his name intrinsically associated with the event as a whole. However, in contrast, one fi nds that al-Muḥāsibī has no mention whatsoever during the miḥna accounts and this in itself requires some pause for thought. This is especially true if we consider the fact that he was involved in a public display of disavowal of the Muʿtazilites’ doctrines when he openly disowned his father at Bāb al-Ṭāq – an event that in all likelihood could not have failed to escape the attention of the state authorities. In this case, the incident may be explained from the perspective that al-Muḥāsibī was still fairly young and, as such, had no common backing or power – either religious or political – to wield, being relatively unknown, and thus having little or no popular support. This does not explain, however, his indirect attack on the state doctrine by the writing of specifi c refutations of the Muʿtazilites such as those found in Māhiyyat al-ʿAql and Fahm al-Qurʾān but this may also be understood in a number of ways: fi rst, al-Muḥāsibī wasn’t a judge (qāḍī) and did not occupy any other state appoint-ment. Likewise, he was not even a popular preacher or renowned scholar of ḥadīth and therefore was not in the direct ‘line of fi re’ in terms of the caliphal administra-tion, as it was only such people who could command popular support and who seem to have been targeted in the initial period at least. Secondly, it may have been the case that even if al-Muḥāsibī had been suspected, he would have been left alone as he was more commonly known for his exposition of spiritual matters rather than his scholastic theology or his political ambition. Indeed, al-Maʾmūn is even reported to have entertained those whom he considered ‘ignorant ascetics’.74 Finally, and most probably in the opinion of this writer, is that al-Muḥāsibī wrote works containing refutations of the Muʿtazilites such as Māhiyyat al-ʿAql and Fahm al-Qurʾān in the post-miḥna period, when the situation allowed him to do so due to the apparent ‘pro-Sunnism’ stance of al-Mutawakkil, or at the very least if al-Muḥāsibī did write such works in a pre-miḥna period, he kept them very close to his chest.75 In any case, the presence of an anti-Muʿtazilite trend within his works, in addition to the disavowal of his father, is suffi cient proof that al-Muḥāsibī was clearly affected by the impact of such theological issues to the extent that he took action in his own, personal way to uphold a belief, which he felt was under a critical attack and which he felt duty bound to defend."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The life of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 61 Thus, in summary we may regard al-Muḥāsibī as very much a product of his time in the sense that he engaged himself with the various fi elds of learning of the day and making the most of his presence in the thriving state capital. Indeed, he appears to have developed his own scholarly methodology in dealing with the deep, moral introspection of the human soul and actively engaged in the theologi-cal debates of his era, so as to provide a rational defence of Sunni ‘orthodoxy’. At the same time, however, this very approach, which in many ways seems diametri-cally opposed to the staunch traditionist stance, caused him to be reviled in his own time and in consequent generations and, as such, by the same token he may be viewed equally as a ‘victim’ of his own era, falling foul of the scholars whose very view he was trying to defend. Moreover, what is certain is that despite the Baghdad population’s disavowal of this scholar, this city and the Muslim community at large lost one of their great-est, erudite and innovative scholars of his generation. Consequently, his real value would only be suffi ciently realised in the years to come, through the examination of his legacy of works, which is the goal of the next chapter.Notes 1 Much of this is based on subsidiary historical information, such as the fact that al-Muḥāsibi related ḥadīth from the same shaykhs as Ibn Ḥanbal and that his father was involved in the theological controversies of the time. Despite this, however, there remains no clear statement in the classical literature regarding this issue but neverthe-less, the date supplied has little to refute it and, in the absence of an alternative, may be used from a practical perspective.

In any case, whatever the actual amount, it was a considerable sum of money for the time and certainly not an amount to be rejected so easily.13 This phrase is based on a statement attributed to the Prophet.

This of course was the great debate of the day, which ultimately led to the miḥna described above. It is also worth noting that the term Qadarite was almost synonymous with being a Muʿtazilite at this point and this too cannot be ruled out.15 See al-Aṣfahānī, Ḥilyat al-Awliyāʾ, vol. 10, p. 65; al-Kalābādhī, al-Taʿarruf, p. 165; al-Baghdādī, Taʾrīkh Baghdād, vol. 8, p. 214; al-Qushayrī, al-Risāla, p. 429; Ibn Ẓafr al-Ṣaqlī, Kitāb Anbāʾ Nujabāʾ al-Abnāʾ, p. 150; Ibn al-Jawzī, Ṣifat al-Ṣafwa, vol. 2, p. 623; Ibn al-Jawzī, al-Muntaẓam fī Tārīkh al-Mulūk wa ’l-Umam, ed.

Gibb Memorial (London: Luzac and Company, 1959), pp. 182–3 with some editing.67 Al-Muḥāsibī’s primary diffi culty in this regard seems to have stemmed from a some-what fractious relationship with Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal. The exact nature of the apparent dislike that Ibn Ḥanbal displayed towards al-Muḥāsibī is not at all clear but I have attempted to shed some light on this topic in a separate work. Needless to say, however, that incurring the wrath of one of Sunni Islam’s most heroic fi gures has not always endeared al-Muḥāsibī to the religion’s scholarly elite. See Gavin Picken, ‘Ibn Ḥanbal and al-Muḥāsibī: A study of early confl icting scholarly methodologies’, Arabica (Revue d’études arabes et islamiques), 55: 3 (September, 2008): 337–61.68 Al-Subkī affi rms the phrase ‘tanassamtum fī wajhī’ but I feel the original proposed by al-Khaṭīb, ‘tabayyantum fī wajhī’, is more accurate.69 See al-Baghdādī, Taʾrīkh Baghdād, vol. 8, p. 215; al-Shahrazūrī, Ṭabaqāt al-Fuqahāʾ al-Shāfi ʿīyya, vol. 1, p. 441; and al-Subkī, Ṭabaqāt al-Shāfi ʿīyya al-Kubrā, vol. 2, pp. 277–8.70 See al-Baghdādī, Taʾrīkh Baghdād, vol. 8, pp. 215–16; Ibn al-Jawzī, al-Muntaẓam, vol. 11, p. 309; Ibn al-Jawzī, Manāqib al-Imām Aḥmad b.

This is because from Ibn Ḥanbal’s perspective this issue was now gratefully over and, similarly, we must not forget his personal feelings on the issue, as he had personally suffered torture and imprisonment because of it. Therefore, for al-Muḥāsibī to retread the whole issue of the miḥna in his works by refuting the Muʿtazilite views must have been not only objectionable to Ibn Ḥanbal but also very painful for him, potentially inciting his anger in the process."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"3 The wayfarer’s legacyThe works of al-Ḥārith al-MuḥāsibīSince so little is known about the life of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī, it is worth survey-ing the works of this eminent scholar to glean more information regarding his thought and teaching, which will lay the foundation for the fi nal chapter. To this effect al-Muḥāsibī himself has made our task easier, as it has been reported by al-Subkī (d. 771/1370) that al-Muḥāsibī authored approximately 200 works.1 If, as al-Subkī claims, al-Muḥāsibī was indeed such a prolifi c writer then we have little evidence of it, due to the simple fact that only a fraction of these works has actually reached us. Consequently, the earliest generation of researchers in the modern period recorded less than 25 works being attributed to al-Muḥāsibī.2 However, as the various manuscript libraries throughout the world began to be catalogued, many of al-Muḥāsibī’s works came to light; not only this but a new generation of scholars began the process of editing al-Muḥāsibī’s works for pub-lication.3 Thus, both these factors have had an extremely important effect on the research that has been carried out on al-Muḥāsibī and, bearing this in mind, the goal of this chapter is to survey the works of al-Muḥāsibī mentioned in the literature, so as to provide an overview of the material written by this scholar.The published works1.Kitāb al-Riʿāya li Ḥuqūq Allāh4 (wa ’l-Qiyām bihā)5 [‘Vigilant observance of the rights of God (and their application)’]. This is arguably al-Muḥāsibī’s most famous if not his greatest work6 and therefore the discussion regarding the writ-ings that have reached us will start here.7 If we were to ask a simple question, ‘If no other work of al-Muḥāsibī’s was available to us, would Kitāb al-Riʿāya suffi ce us in understanding al-Muḥāsibī and his thought?’ In fact the answer to this query would almost certainly be in the affi rmative. This is due to the fact that al-Riʿāya contains all of the main ideas found in his other works such as al-Waṣāyā, al-Tawahhum, al-Makāsib, Badʾ Man Anāba ilā Allāh, Ādāb al-Nufūs and al-Masāʾil fī Aʿmāl al-Qulūb wa ’l-Jawāriḥ. Not only does al-Riʿāya encompass the ideas expressed in these works but it is also more comprehensive, better organised and more logical.8"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"68 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam Accentuating this notion, al-Quwwatlī summarises:This book represents the pinnacle in the development of al-Muḥāsibī’s thought: in it he leaves scholastic theology (ʿilm al-kalām) well behind him. Indeed, he leaves jurisprudence (al-fi qh) also; he uses ḥadīth sparingly and concentrates entirely on mystical subjects, which concerned every part of the Islamic world at that time. He becomes more precise and delves deeply into fi ne points of Sufi sm, along with a focus upon his favourite topic: the eti-quettes, desires and faults of the soul (al-nafs), including its treatment and its taking to account. Isn’t this al-Muḥāsibī?9Thus, if al-Riʿāya had been lost, we would still be able to acquaint ourselves with al-Muḥāsibī via his other works, but it is only through al-Riʿāya that we see the real quality of al-Muḥāsibī in exposing the secret hidden depths of the human soul and the consequent alleviation of its ills. It is here that we see al-Muḥāsibī as a true scholar in the disciplines of religion, an expert in human behaviour and a physician of the ego.10 Part of this is indeed due to the fact that al-Muḥāsibī had a particular and spe-cifi c goal in mind in writing al-Riʿāya, as the title would suggest, which is to clarify for the human being what is incumbent upon each individual with regard to fulfi lling the command of God. Despite this, however, he does not tackle the topic directly but believes that the human being requires wise advice at the begin-ning, before his travelling to the greater goal, which will open his heart and which will make his intellect attentive to the discourse.11 Similarly, al-Muḥāsibī, despite the title of the book, does not simply concentrate on quoting the permissible and the prohibited in religion but concerns himself with a methodology, which can be employed to perform these commands practically with sincerity. Bearing this goal in mind, al-Muḥāsibī observes that people in every place are slowly distancing themselves from this path day by day12 and therefore, he provides a description of the route to repentance and the subsequent return to God.13 In addition, in this particular work, al-Muḥāsibī is more concerned with giving precise meanings to the terms used, almost providing the reader with a series of defi nitions of the various concepts he discusses.14 The work itself is in the form of counsels given to the seeker in reply to his questions regarding the above-mentioned methodology. The book contains eight major books (kitāb, pl. kutub), each with numerous subsections (bāb, pl. abwāb), and indeed the fi rst of these books is preceded by various chapters (abwāb) dis-cussing a variety of topics.15 Thus, he begins by giving advice regarding being attentive while listening (ḥusn al-istimāʿ) and then he approaches the topic of the book, not in depth or with extensive explanation but simply clarifying the neces-sity of submitting of the ego’s will to the will of God. This is because it is through this submission that piety (al-taqwā) springs forth and it is this which will lead the person to fulfi l the command of God and shun that which He has forbidden.16 Al-Muḥāsibī then begins to explain the nature of al-taqwā defi ning it as being, ‘Shunning associating partners [with God] (shirk) and every sin lesser than this"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 69from that which God has forbidden, or neglecting any obligatory act, which He has prescribed’.17 He then continues to explain the nature of this taqwā and its virtues, clarifying the preparation that is required to be ready to stand before God on the Day of Judgement. He then defi nes scrupulousness (al-waraʿ), warning not to be deceived by external aspects of worship, and continues by describing exactly what steps need to be taken fi rst by the devotee on his journey on the path to his Lord.18 Having realised this aspect, varying levels of repentance (al-tawba) are reached and the intention that worship is sincerely for God alone. However, at this point the aspirant will be at odds with what may be termed ‘elements of evil’ (ʿanāṣir al-sharr), which may cause him to err from the straight path through heedlessness (ghafl a). These elements are particularly dangerous, as they are continuously on the alert and are constantly feeling out their prey in the human being, who is by his nature weak.19 Al-Muḥāsibī considers there to be two main ‘elements of evil’; the fi rst of these is the soul (al-nafs), which he considers to be the internal element of evil,20 whereas the Devil (Iblīs) is the external element, who manipulates the fi rst element by inspiring it to evil. He therefore cautions the reader concerning them and the complexity of their strategies.21 Al-Muḥāsibī does not stop there, however, but also warns against the other elements of evil such as negative com-panionship (ikhwān al-sūʾ) and corrupt environments (mujtamaʿāt al-fasād).22 Having clarifi ed the dangers of these aspects of human existence, al-Muḥāsibī further explains that this is not suffi cient to know; indeed, he then draws our atten-tion to the aspect of sincerity to God (al-ikhlāṣ), which is the foundation of all action and through which a person is rewarded. Having described this essential aspect of human endeavour, he then explains at length the quality that destroys such actions due to its opposing al-ikhlāṣ, which is ostentation (al-riyāʾ).23 Al-Muḥāsibī concentrates on this topic, as it is an aspect of behaviour that lowers the quality of the human being, since this is essentially his fi eld. He continues to discuss other negative human character traits by examining self-conceit (al-ʿujb), arrogance (al-kibr), self-delusion (al-ghirra) and envy (al-ḥasad), dedicating a complete book (kitāb) of al-Riʿāya to each of them. He is not satisfi ed, however, with merely describing these faults and their consequences but also clarifi es their causes, how they can be avoided and how they can be treated.24 Al-Muḥāsibī concludes his book with the section entitled Kitāb taʾdīb al-murīd in which he describes a programme designed to govern the conduct of the slave ‘by day and by night’, being always mindful of the One Whom he serves, of the con-stant self-discipline required to remain on this path and to guard against the tempta-tions, which may assail him after he has began to serve God with his whole body, mind and soul.25 It may seem an oversimplifi cation but al-Riʿāya is essentially a book concerning sincerity to God, cleansing the heart, purifi cation of the soul and a life of complete moral, ethical and behavioural perfection.26 In summary, we quote Smith, who has captured the essence of al-Riʿāya when she said:This is al-Muḥāsibī’s great treatise on the interior life, which reveals a pro-found knowledge of human nature and its weaknesses, while in the means"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"70 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamwhich he suggests for combating these weaknesses and for attaining to the single-hearted service of God, he shews also the discerning wisdom and inspired insight of a true spiritual director and shepherd of souls.272.Kitāb al-Waṣāyā/al-Naṣāʾiḥ al-Dīniyya28 [‘The book of counsels’]. After al-Riʿāya this work is one of the longest of al-Muḥāsibī’s books to reach us and therefore will be discussed next.29 In a similar manner to al-Riʿāya, this work represents a foundation in the skill of examining the soul, as it delves into its depths and quali-ties, which are seemingly hidden from the vast majority of people.30 As ʿAṭāʾ puts it:This book, along with the other works of al-Muḥāsibī, was a new develop-ment in the fi eld of Islamic psychology (ʿilm al-nafs al-Islāmī) for the ascet-ics (zuhhād) of the third century [hijrī] and the master of this development was indeed al-Muḥāsibī – the splendour of the scholars (zahrat al-ʿulamāʾ), the pride of the ascetics (fakhr al-zuhhād), the imam of the path of the people of God (ahl Allāh).31In addition to this, however, one of the most important aspects of this work is the fact that al-Muḥāsibī sheds light on his own life, his personal search for the truth and his despair at not fi nding the guidance he sought. He also sheds considerable light indirectly on the period in which he lived, in particular the political situation and the state of the people in his environment generally. These points become apparent from the very fi rst statement which he makes: ‘It has reached us that “This community (umma) will split up into seventy-three sects; of them only one will be saved”,32 and God knows best regarding the remainder of them’.33 By this very statement al-Muḥāsibī indicates his own mood and the mood of the period in general, as we know the state of the sects attributed to Islam at this time in addition to the political discord sewn through the dispute between al-Amīn and al-Maʿmūn. He continues by mapping out his own personal journey in seeking the truth, acquiring knowledge and practice of the religion. During this process he identifi es various types of people within the members of society he has come across and clarifi es his own stance regarding the path to take. Based on the ḥadīth mentioned above, he then searched for the ‘saved sect’ and after much hardship he fi nally found what he was looking for.34 Al-Muḥāsibī divides his work into 41 sections (abwāb) on a variety of topics. He proposes various counsels as to how to identify the faults of the soul via long research and refl ection, thus clarifying his path, and as a result it contains a summary of his experience. He does this by discussing his own thoughts and ideas but also lends great importance to the revealed texts also, with the goal of perfect-ing the human soul. He is concerned with avoiding misguidance due to the turmoil of the soul and the various facets of personality and, consequently, he attempts to deal with illness at its root.35"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 71 To this effect al-Muḥāsibī begins by reminding the reader that the origin of happiness lies in God-consciousness (taqwā) and that the basis of discontent is love of the worldly life (ḥubb al-dunyā).36 Al-Muḥāsibī then discusses one of the main topics of al-Waṣāyā which is the love of wealth, the desire to accumulate it and the power this has over the individual.37 He discusses this in a general manner but also discusses the position of the Companions regarding this issue, proving, as far as he is concerned, their extreme dislike of wealth and attachment to the worldly life.38 Whilst discussing this topic he covers the following areas: the earning of wealth in a permissible manner, being economical in the use of the sustenance provided, being careful not to waste what you have (isrāf) and at the same time avoiding being miserly (bakhīl).39 After explaining the importance of freeing oneself from the power that wealth can have over the human being, al-Muḥāsibī turns his attention to the topics for which he is familiar, i.e. those dealing with the internal workings of the mind, heart and soul. He deals with issues we have already seen, such as satisfaction with the God’s decree (al-riḍā bi qaḍāʾ Allāh), the traps of the Devil (makāʾid al-Shayṭān), self-conceit (al-ʿujb), arrogance (al-kibr), as well as dealing with the soul (al-nafs) and the heart (al-qalb).40 He then devotes space to warning the reader against the disputes within the community,41 and the concept of ‘being observant of God’s rights’ (riʿāya li ḥuqūq Allāh) is frequently quoted throughout al-Waṣāyā.42 In addition to this, al-Muḥāsibī also gives importance in this work to the subject of knowledge (al-ʿilm), clarifying the signifi cance of having sound knowledge, as this is the basis of sound action. He also indicates the importance of the intellect but at the same warns against misuse of both these important faculties, as well as discussing the defects knowledge can cause in character, if it is not kept in check.43 Another interesting aspect of al-Waṣāyā is al-Muḥāsibī’s in-depth discussion of the physical acts of worship that are either incumbent on all Muslims or are highly recommended. As one might expect, al-Muḥāsibī does discuss these in traditional jurisprudential manner, but links the legal element of these actions to their hidden, internal aspects. Thus, we fi nd him discussing such aspects as presence of mind in prayer (al-khushūʿ fī ’l-ṣalāt) and not just the physical mechanical movements of prayer and fasting but he also includes fasting from that which God has forbidden and not just from food, drink and sexual relations. In addition, he advises increas-ing the superogotary acts (al-nawāfi l) as a means of fulfi lling the compulsory duties and as a means of erasing the sins committed.44 He also mentions the importance of supplicating (al-duʿā) in private, having presence of heart whilst speaking and refl ecting and contemplating whilst reciting the Qurʾān.45 Al-Muḥāsibī continues throughout the various sections mentioned and continues in the latter part of the work by discussing more issues regarding the soul and heart and concludes his book by discussing sincerity to God in acts of obedience (ikhlāṣ al-ṭāʿa), as if to close the discussion on this fundamental point, which is of course the very cornerstone of much of his teaching.46 In summary we quote ʿAṭā who clarifi es clearly the result of implementing the methodology of al-Muḥāsibī in this work:"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"72 Spiritual Purifi cation in IslamThus if a person has been able to remove the power that wealth and knowl-edge have [over his soul], correct his intention in acts of worship, desire to work for God alone and has knowledge that pushes him forward, then he will be a human being who enjoys perfection of his soul and has complete peace of mind.473.Kitāb al-Tawahhum48 [‘The book of imagining’]. This work is one of al-Muḥāsibī’s most famous works and has received a great deal of attention, being published several times.49 This is indicative of the importance of this work and therefore it will be discussed here after al-Riʿāya and al-Waṣāyā. The work itself is a short treatise of an eschatological nature, which discusses the events that all human beings will face in the hereafter (al-ākhira). To this effect al-Muḥāsibī begins sequentially, starting with death, its pain and its agonies, describing how each person struggles with the throes of death and the events that occur in the grave, immediately after death, such as the questioning of the two angels and gazing into paradise and hell.50 Al-Muḥāsibī continues by painting a vivid picture of the resurrection where every soul will be summoned to stand before its Lord on the Last Day. He describes the events in detail; how all will stand equal in front of their Lord bereft of the virtue of wealth, status and position, which they enjoyed in the worldly life, as only faith and righteous deeds will avail them in the trials ahead. Due to this their state is one of fear, astonishment, desperation and regret. Not only this, but the other creatures that God created will be summoned devoid of their animal tendencies, standing still and humbly in front of their Lord; all will be gathered and wait meekly for the judgement of the King of kings.51 The heavens will then be cast asunder, being destroyed for ever, and the angels in all their glory, power and immense size and incredible creation will pour forth surrounding the assem-bly. The sun will then be drawn close and the resurrected will begin to sweat in accordance with the actions they did in the worldly life and there will be no shade from this intense heat except in the shade of the throne of God.52 Every soul will then cry for its own fate as the messengers of God are ques-tioned regarding the message that they brought and each individual tries to fl ee from even the most beloved people to them in this life. The deeds of each soul will then be weighed and their records distributed, as God questions them regarding all that they did. The records will then be given, in the right hand of those who were successful and the left hand for those who are disgraced to dwell in eternal para-dise or hell respectively.53 Each individual will then travel the bridge over hellfi re (al-ṣirāṭ), that is ‘fi ner than a hair and sharper than a sword’s blade’, the speed at which they pass across it being proportionate to the deeds that they performed in the worldly realm, to reach paradise on the other side or to fall from it into eternal damnation in hellfi re.54 As for those who survive this treacherous journey, their faces are enlightened and made radiant as they enter the gates of paradise, joyous in the company of the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 73righteous. They delight in the foods, drinks, clothing, vessels and palaces which have been prepared for them and, most of all the sheer unadulterated beauty of their companions, with whom they dwell therein.55 This, however, is not the only pleasure of paradise; in fact the greatest and most honourable of its bounties is still to come as it has been saved for God’s beloved elect (al-awliyāʾ); they will be summoned, the veils will be set aside and there they will gaze upon their Lord in all His majesty and splendour.56 The value of this work lies not only in the fact that al-Muḥāsibī substantiates it with a variety of verses from the Qurʾān, Prophetic narrations and statements of the earliest generations, providing it with authenticity from a traditional perspec-tive. It is also signifi cant due to the eloquent style in which it is written and because it constitutes an early example of prose writing in the formative period. Moreover, the vivid images he portrays are a decisive tool in effecting spiritual change via the power of imagination. Kitāb al-Tawahhum would also seem a very personal work, as it is clear from the expression of the thoughts that al-Muḥāsibī had actually imagined taking the same journey and thus is extremely signifi cant due to the extent it may have infl uenced others.574.Risālat58/Kitāb al-Makāsib wa ’l-Waraʿ wa ’l-Shubha wa Bayān Mubāḥihā wa ’l-Maḥẓūrihā wa Ikhtilāf al-Nās fī Ṭalabihā wa ’l-Radd ʿalā ’l-Ghāliṭīna fīhi59 [‘The book of licit earnings’]. The effect of al-Muḥāsibī’s environment becomes apparent on him again here as he discusses the manner in which daily provision and gainful employment should be sought. Thus, al-Muḥāsibī begins by present-ing the importance of the concept of putting absolute trust and reliance on God (al-tawakkul) and realising that He alone is their Sole Provider, the Sovereign over all things and the Most Generous of those who give. This, by its very nature, dictates that mankind be grateful, put their complete trust in Him and remember the bounty of their Lord but at the same time it does not mean that they should refrain from taking lawful means to earn a livelihood, or live idly at the expense of others.60 Al-Muḥāsibī then turns his attention to the topic of scrupulousness (al-waraʿ), explaining that this is to abstain from that which God has forbidden and that which is objectionable to Him, whether in word or deed, thought or motive and this can only be achieved through extensive self-examination prior to action.61 Having discussed various spiritual and theological dimensions of how provi-sion is earned, al-Muḥāsibī utilises the second half of the book to discuss a variety of issues of a juristic nature and gives his opinion regarding them. Such issues include the rulings regarding inheriting from a father who is a transgressor, doubt-ful matters (al-shubha), the permissible and the prohibited (al-ḥalāl wa ’l-ḥarām) and the permissibility of accepting gifts from rulers, as well as seeking out the ‘purest’62 forms of sustenance.63 He also uses this work to discuss various ascetic practices familiar at the time, including a refutation of those who claim that hunger is in itself an act of worship. He concludes this treatise with a discussion"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"74 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamof various juristic issues regarding the categories of land used for agriculture and the rulings regarding the permissibility of gaining sustenance from them.64 Con-sequently, this work is also signifi cant in presenting the personality of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī, as it not only presents his spiritual theology and his environment’s infl uence upon him but also his ability as a jurist, his familiarity with legal issues and the opinions of the scholars before him. Thus, it clarifi es a further facet to his already impressive list of subject areas in which he was well versed.5.(Risālat) Ādāb al-Nufūs65/Risāla fī ’l-Akhlāq [‘Etiquettes of the soul’/ ‘A treatise on moral character’]. In this work al-Muḥāsibī focuses attention on the two words used in the title; namely etiquettes (ādāb) and the soul (al-nafs). He combines these two concepts effortlessly throughout the work, combining both of these fundamental elements of the path to God in the form of counsels and extolling the reader to adopt such lofty qualities.66 In addition to discussing manners and eti-quettes, it is in the argument regarding the soul that al-Muḥāsibī excels, providing an in-depth examination of the nafs and its related topics. It is here that we glimpse the thought of al-Muḥāsibī fi rst hand as he clarifi es that the root of the cause must be dealt with fi rst before going forward any further. By this he means that the soul should be corrected fi rst before even considering performing supererogatory acts since there is no use in pruning the branches of a tree to assist its growth when it is the roots that are diseased.67 Al-Muḥāsibī, in a similar vein, also discusses the importance of purifying the soul of every blameworthy characteristic before performing any action. His rationale is simple; human beings are required to refrain from all forms of evil but are not ordered to perform all forms of good. Thus, they must able to distinguish between the two and prioritise regarding the actions that they perform, so that a good action is not mixed with evil, or consequently the whole action will be inval-idated. This, however, requires knowledge of such blameworthy characteristics and al-Muḥāsibī allots much time to this, as well as the praiseworthy characteris-tics that directly counter such negative attributes and which are consequently, absolutely necessary.68 The essence of the soul’s rebellious nature is its love of the worldly life and the soul’s adoption of it as its only concern and goal. As a result the soul separates the worldly life from that of the hereafter but, by doing so, fails to realise the true nature of the worldly life, which is that it is nothing more than a trial to test those who are best in action. Thus, the cure for many of the diseases of the heart and soul is to remember the hereafter and, in particular, death.69 It is true to say that al-Muḥāsibī has discussed much of the content of Ādāb al-Nufūs in other works in more depth, such as al-Riʿāya, but despite this the work has in return summarised much of what is contained in such extensive works without the reader having to consult them.70 Consequently, it is an invaluable contribution to the fi eld of works concerned with the human soul and, as al-Sayyid summarises, ‘This book is considered one of the hidden treasures that has reached from the earliest generation regarding the soul and its etiquettes’.71"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 756.Sharḥ al-Maʿrifa72wa Badhl al-Naṣīḥa73 [‘An exposition of intimate knowledge and the provision of good counsel’]. In this concise treatise al-Muḥāsibī deals with two fundamental elements concerning the disciplining of the soul, i.e. that of essential knowledge (al-maʿrifa) and appropriate advice (al-naṣīḥa), regarding the journey back to God.74 The importance of these two issues is clear, as they have an effect on both the individual and the community. As for al-maʿrifa, it plays an essential role in developing the individual because it teaches him the nature and essence of life, so that he can eventually contribute to his society and it provides him with a basis on which to act. With regard to al-naṣīḥa, it plays the equally important role of removing the ills of the individual and the society by correcting it with subtlety and wisdom. As for the subject of al-maʿrifa, al-Muḥāsibī is not concerned here with dis-cussing the theory of al-maʿrifa, as is done by the Sufi philosophers,75 but he is concerned with what could be termed ‘essential’ maʿrifa, which every Muslim should have a grasp of.76 This is summarised in the following topics:(a) The knowledge of God the Magnifi cent and Exalted (maʿrifat Allāh ʿazza wa jall). Al-Muḥāsibī begins discussing this element of maʿrifa by extolling the names and attributes of God in a manner which not only lists them but also shows how they play a practical role in the human being’s life.77 Al-Muḥāsibī is not content with this, however, but also describes the method, the means and the results of absorbing this form of maʿrifa.78(b) The knowledge of Satan, the enemy of God (maʿrifat Iblīs ʿaduw Allāh). This element of maʿrifa is deemed equally important since it is not suffi cient just to know who God is and His rights upon every individual but, indeed, it is of vital importance also to know one’s enemy on the path back to God. Al-Muḥāsibī begins his discussion by informing the reader that God has ordered His devotees to be at war with Iblīs and struggle against him at every moment. This is because Iblīs was the fi rst enemy of Ādam and thus of every prophet and of mankind as a whole. The danger arises from this adversary because of his continuous vigilance in trying to cause the devotee to falter; not only this, but his goal is not only to cause them to sin but also ultimately to disbelieve in God and, consequently, dwell in hellfi re eternally just as he will. Al-Muḥāsibī stresses that every one is in a tremendous struggle against this cunning opponent and that each and every person must turn to God in humility and humbleness to ask for assistance in overcoming this devious enemy.79(c) A person’s knowledge of his own soul (maʿrifat al-insān nafsahu) In this regard al-Muḥāsibī adopts his familiar position in warning of the danger of this internal element by advising the reader to approach the issue of one’s own soul by refl ecting on how its creator described it in the Qurʾān, i.e. that it ‘urges to evil’.80 Indeed, al-Muḥāsibī considers this ‘internal enemy’ more dangerous than Iblīs due to its nature and tendency to serve its own interests; Iblīs uses it to manipulate the human being, causing him to falter regarding"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"76 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamhis duty to his Lord. Despite this, however, al-Muḥāsibī is not satisfi ed with this warning only but also briefl y alludes to the manner in which one can combat the soul, which includes opposing it (mukhalāfatuhā), taking it to account (muḥāsabatuhā), knowing it (maʿrifatuhā), expending effort against it (mujāhadatuhā) and keeping it under strict observation (murāqabatuhā). Al-Muḥāsibī concludes by advising the seeker to expend effort in being sincere to God, seeking His assistance in combating the nafs and as a result he will acquire His pleasure.81(d) The knowledge of actions performed for God’s sake (maʿrifat al-ʿamal li Allāh). In this element of maʿrifa al-Muḥāsibī establishes a principle at the beginning of the discussion which lays the foundation for the rest of the section. Here he distinguishes two categories of actions; the fi rst of which are those that God has ordered and which as a result he considers to be obedience (al-ṭāʿa). The second type of action is that which God has forbidden and which, as a result, he considers an act of disobedience (al-maʿṣiya). In addi-tion to this, he once again reminds the reader that both of these types of actions require a third factor, which has also been ordered, that of sincerity (ikhlāṣ); this is clearly the most important concern of al-Muḥāsibī, as it is this factor which will determine the intention behind the action and which, if cor-rupted, will cause all actions to become acts of disobedience regardless. Thereafter he once again warns of the dangers of Iblīs, in the sense that he tries to invalidate these actions, not only by trying to make the devotee commit sins or corrupt his intentions but also by trying to make the person perform a lesser form of obedience rather than a more elevated one.82Based upon these four types of maʿrifa, al-Muḥāsibī describes the way in which a person should act; he should neither intend an action nor perform it without fi rst considering these four issues. This in turn has an important subsequent effect upon the soul, as it plays an essential role in taking the soul to account (muḥāsabat al-nafs); consequently, every claim that the soul makes can be examined in the light of this maʿrifa and, as a result, it can be seen in its true reality, despite the deception it may try to manifest regarding the good qualities it purports to have.83 The second half of the book contains a variety of pieces of practical and moral advice for those wishing to purify their souls and traverse the path leading to the hereafter and ultimately to their Lord, as is al-Muḥāsibī’s usual habit. In addition to discussing the usual topics for which al-Muḥāsibī is well known, he also includes a section where he discusses 10 characteristics (khiṣāl ʿashara), which all aspirants should have if they wish to reach the highest degrees of righteousness.847.Kitāb Badʾ Man Anāba ilā Allāh85 (taʿālā)86 [‘The book concerning the beginning of the return to God’]. Once again this work, despite its small size, represents one of the most important sources of al-Muḥāsibī’s thought and, in particular, his training of the soul, its self-discipline and its purifi cation.87 During the course of"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 77the book the author maps out the path that one must take in order to reach the truth for those who have committed sins, disobeyed God and whose hearts have hard-ened and are devoid of fear. He then presents the means and principles which will assist in disciplining the soul and so drive the human being to the straight path.88 The outstanding feature of this work, however, is that the author proceeds gradually, chapter by chapter, to produce discussions of vital importance regard-ing the soul. By doing so he imagines it as a separate entity whose nature is evil; this in turn is opposed by the facet of conscience, which is constantly anxious and in a state of turmoil due to the soul’s remoteness from the path of God. Al-Muḥāsibī here spends his utmost efforts to warn the reader and to ensure that he or she understands that the conscience must overcome the nafs, so that it can avert it from the amusement of the worldly life and return it to the path of God, which is its ultimate goal. Not only this, but in addition, al-Muḥāsibī expresses this internal struggle between the human being and his or her soul in such a vivid manner that it has the most profound effect on the reader.898.Kitāb al-Masāʾil fī Aʿmāl al-Qulūb wa ’l-Jawāriḥ90 [‘The book concerning issues related to actions of the heart and limbs’]. In this treatise, as the title would suggest, al-Muḥāsibī sheds light on a number of issues which concern both the interior and exterior forms of religion. He begins by stressing the importance of hiding some actions from the eyes of people and also when it is permissible to perform such actions openly. This leads quite naturally to the topic of notoriety (al-shuhra) and the seeking of it, where he provides a discussion involving the statements of the previous generations (al-salaf), regarding what is and is not permissible. In addition, he warns of a number of issues which the aspirant should be wary of, as well as discussing the merits of performing supererogatory acts.91 Al-Muḥāsibī then turns his attention to the heart, its duties, characteristics, its diseases, their cure, how the heart and soul may be purifi ed and the different cat-egories of people in this regard. He then discusses the merits and ordinances of silence and speech, including a section on debate and defence of the honour of a fellow believer. Al-Muḥāsibī also presents a section regarding entrusting one’s affairs to the will of God (al-tafwīḍ), its causes, types, the way in which people differ with regard to it and the relationship between this and trusting in God (al-tawakkul).92 In the next section al-Muḥāsibī returns to his favourite subject of the soul (al-nafs) but here discusses the relationship between it and the heart and how this may result in the attainment of true knowledge (maʿrifa). He also discusses how both heedlessness (al-ghafl a) and forgetfulness (al-nisyān) affect each individual, the difference between them, their types and their differing infl uences on believ-ers and non-believers alike. Al-Muḥāsibī concludes this work by presenting various juristic issues regarding what is and is not permissible to look at (al-naẓar) and the rulings regarding the swearing of oaths (al-nudhūr).93"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"78 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam9.(Mukhtaṣar)94 Kitāb Fahm al-Ṣalāt95 [‘The book concerning comprehending prayer’]. Once again we fi nd that despite the concise nature of this short work it sheds a great deal of light on not only the subject matter but also on al-Muḥāsibī as a scholar and an author. Here we see al-Muḥāsibī the jurist (al-faqīh) expounding issues concerning one of the most important elements of Islamic faith and practice – prayer (al-ṣalāt). In this sense we see him deal with the classical juristic issues such as ablution (al-wuḍūʾ), ritual bath (al-ghusl), the prerequisites of prayer (shurūṭ al-ṣalāt), the actions and what is read in prayer (afʿāl wa aqwāl al-ṣalāt), as well as what is forbidden in prayer (mā nuhiya ʿanhu fī ’l-ṣalāt) in much the same way that we might expect to fi nd in any classical juristic text.96 Despite this, however, Kitāb Fahm al-Ṣalāt is not an average fi qh manual but, as is expected, al-Muḥāsibī deals with the spiritual elements of prayer also, linking them directly to the juristic points he raises. As a result he provides a perfect and complete picture of how to pray in Islam in a way that not only fulfi ls the requirements of the Islamic Law (al-sharʿīa) but is also pleasing to God and gratifying for the soul.10.Kitāb Māʾiyyat (Māhiyyat97) al-ʿAql wa Maʿnāhā (wa Ikhtilāf al-Nās fīhā98)99 [‘The book concerning the essence of the intellect and its’ meaning’]. If we were to pose the question: ‘What is the intellect and what is its purpose?’ then we would fi nd the answer forthcoming in this concise but valuable treatise by al-Muḥāsibī. Bearing in mind the great importance of this seemingly innocent question during al-Muḥāsibī’s era, it is clear that he felt it needed addressing so as to clarify the role of the intellect from his interpretation of Islam’s primary sources.100 In answering this question al-Muḥāsibī begins by defi ning the intellect (al-ʿaql) as being an innate quality of the human being and not, as some scholastic theologians (al-mutakallimūn) suggest, the essence of the soul.101 Having dis-pelled this theory, al-Muḥāsibī then turns his attention to the use of the intellect to comprehend and gain understanding of God (al-ʿaql ʿan Allāh taʿālā), which manifests itself in the form of complete obedience to Him.102 Al-Muḥāsibī con-cludes this brief treatise by discussing various issues related to the intellect to clarify the subject further and manifest the true meaning of the intellect and its role in human discernment.103 In summary, the importance of this work cannot be underestimated due to several factors; fi rst, this work represents one of the fi rst, if not the fi rst such work, in Islamic literature to deal with the subject of the intellect and its purpose within the human being. Secondly, this work is indicative of the historical era in which al-Muḥāsibī lived, as it addresses the very essence of the debate of revelation versus reason, which raged between the so-called ‘rationalists’ (al-Muʿtazila) and the ‘orthodox’ scholastic trend, represented by the traditionists (al-muḥaddithūn).104 Finally, in this work al-Muḥāsibī lays the methodological foundation for the remainder of his written legacy, as much of what he discusses in his other works is dependent on the ground rules put in place in this treatise.105"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 7911.Kitāb Iḥkām al-Tawba wa radd Maẓālim al-ʿIbād wa Khalāṣ minhā qabl al-Maʿād106 [‘The book concerning perfecting repentance’]. This treatise deals with the issue of repentance, as its title would suggest, and in it al-Muḥāsibī affi rms his position that repentance is a duty upon the devotees as imposed on them by God. In addition, he employs this work to discuss the major (al-kabīra, pl. al-kabāʾir) and minor sins, as well as affi rming the need to repent for both.10712.Kitāb al-Mustarshid108 [‘A book for the seeker of guidance’]. Despite this being one of al-Muḥāsibī’s shorter works, it is nevertheless a very important one. This lies in the fact that this book contains all of the ideas and advice of the author that we fi nd explained at length in his other works. Thus, this treatise summarises his teachings in much the same way that the classical short texts (matn, pl. mutūn) of later writers did, which then would be memorised by students and studied later with their accompanying commentaries (sharḥ, pl. shurūḥ). Many of these mutūn would often be put into poetry to make memorisation easier and here once again we fi nd a common factor with this work as much of the text is rhyming prose.109 For the sake of analogy, Kitāb al-Mustarshid fulfi ls the role of such a matn, whereas al-Muḥāsibī’s longer works such as al-Riʿāya serve the purpose of a sharḥ. The work itself takes the usual form of a series of counsels for the ‘seeker of guidance’, which are short, concise, rich in meaning and often build on one another to link the various subjects the author wishes to present. The subject matter of Kitāb al-Mustarshid is, as already mentioned, a summary of al-Muḥāsibī’s thought and therefore, it contains the various subjects already discussed in detail above. Although it is slightly repetitive in parts, al-Muḥāsibī links the repetitive parts of Kitāb al-Mustarshid, to new topics so as to create a different link between them. In summary, Kitāb al-Mustarshid is a concise manual for the wayfarer jour-neying to God, which maps out the path before him and shows him how to adorn himself with all the etiquette and fi ne manners that the sharīʿa endorses,110 as Ḥasanayn Muḥammad Makhlūf says, after discussing the nature of ‘true’ taṣawwuf, ‘And in Risālat al-Mustarshidīn there is evidence to support what we have mentioned, as there is in it: instruction for the souls (tarbiya li ’l-nufūs), refi nement of human nature and true knowledge for anyone who reads it precisely and carefully.’11113.Kitāb Fahm al-Qurʾān112 [‘The book concerning comprehending the Qurʾān’]. This treatise is one the longest of al-Muḥāsibī’s works to reach us intact and there-fore is of considerable importance in clarifying further his teaching and thought. This point is compounded by the fact that Fahm al-Qurʾān is one of al-Muḥāsibī’s works in which he discusses many of the theological issues that were prevalent at"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"80 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamthe time. In essence Fahm al-Qurʾān is not only a book which discusses how the Qurʾān should be comprehended but is also concerned with how belief in God should be understood and is a refutation of those who do not conform to the theological methodology therein. To this effect we can identify six categories which al-Muḥāsibī discusses.(a) The QurʾānSince the Qurʾān has such an essential and important role in the understanding of Islam and since it is ‘the guardian of the intellect’, al-Muḥāsibī uses this section to discuss this fundamental element of the religion. In doing so, al-Muḥāsibī extols the virtues of the Qurʾān (faḍāʾil al-Qurʾān), describing the various qualities that it contains and the various disciplines related to it. In addition, he also makes mention of the excellence of Qurʾānic reciters (faḍāʾil al-qurrāʾ), their virtues, merits, etiquettes and the special position given to them by God.113(b) The jurisprudential issues within the Qurʾān (fi qh al-Qurʾān)Since the Qurʾān is also the primary source of Islamic Law, there are a series of disciplines that are required for the reader of the Qurʾān to understand so that they can comprehend its legal aspects. In this regard al-Muḥāsibī sheds light on several of these legalistic elements, including the abrogated and abrogating verses (al-nāsikh wa ’l-mansūkh), its precise and ambiguous verses (al-muḥkam wa ’l-mutashābih), the general and specifi c verses (al-ʿāmm wa ’l-khāṣṣ), as well as its unusual vocabulary (gharīb al-Qurʾān).114(c) The permissibility of abrogation (al-naskh)Having discussed abrogation in the previous section, al-Muḥāsibī elaborates further here to clarify when abrogation is permissible in the Qurʾān and when it is not. From the aspects of the Qurʾān in which there is no room for abrogation he includes the names and attributes of God (asmāʾ Allāh wa ṣifātuhu) and informa-tion given by God regarding past or future events (akhbār Allāh taʿālā ʿammā kāna wa yakūn).115 Therefore, as a result, al-Muḥāsibī concludes that abrogation is per-missible in only issues which involve legal rulings, as it is only that which has been ordered and that which is forbidden (al-amr wa ’l-nahy) which can be changed.116(d) Al-MuʿtazilaBearing in mind that al-Muʿtazila were the foremost sect at the time of al-Muḥāsibī, due to the state support of the Caliph, it is hardly surprising that he deals with them in a specifi c part of this work. This is compounded by the fact that many of their opinions, which differed from those of the traditionists (al-muḥaddithūn) of the time,117 were misinterpretations of concepts found in the Qurʾān and therefore it is to be expected that al-Muḥāsibī, being grounded in the traditionist method of"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 81learning, would deal with them here.118 Consequently, al-Muḥāsibī refutes their views, stating that they went to extremes in their use of analogy (al-qiyās), in addition to their ignorance of the Qurʾān’s interpretation and its sciences.(e) Abrogation in legal rulingsHaving dealt with the erroneous views of various sects during his era and their refutation, al-Muḥāsibī then turns his attention to subjects which would be tradi-tionally termed ‘Qurʾānic Sciences’ (ʿulūm al-Qurʾān) and, in particular, the issue of abrogation (al-naskh). In this section al-Muḥāsibī identifi es 15 categories of abrogation, based on his extensive knowledge of the Qurʾān, once again proving his authority on the subject.119(f) Qurʾānic stylisticsAl-Muḥāsibī concludes this work with a discussion of various fi elds of knowledge related to Qurʾānic exegesis (tafsīr al-Qurʾān) and in particular those related to linguistics, such as grammar (al-naḥw) and rhetoric (al-balāgha). In this sense al-Muḥāsibī discusses the bringing forward and delay of certain words (al-taqdīm wa ’l-taʾkhīr) to create emphasis, ellipsis (al-iḍmār), additional words (ḥurūf al-zawāʾid) to give the meaning more depth and eloquence, and the separation and combination of words (al-faṣl wa ’l-waṣl) to give the meaning continuance.120 In summary, once again one cannot underestimate the importance of this work with regard to his thought and teaching. His position regarding various issues of the day are presented here, including his refutation of what he considered innovation (bidʿa) in religion, proposed by the sects that were manifest during his lifetime, such as the ‘rationalists’ (al-Muʿtazila) and the Shiʿites (al-Rāfi ḍa). In addition to his vast knowledge of Islam’s belief system displayed in this work, he also demonstrates his equally extensive knowledge regarding the Qurʾān, as he discusses topics which had not been codifi ed at that time and therefore his contribution to the discipline of Qurʾānic exegesis (tafsīr al-Qurʾān) as a primordial science is also considerable.14.Kitāb al-ʿIlm121 [‘The book of knowledge’]. This once again is a very short trea-tise by al-Muḥāsibī but, despite its concise nature, it sheds a great deal of light upon al-Muḥāsibī’s own particular understanding of this facet of Islamic learning. He classifi es knowledge (al-ʿilm) as being of three types: fi rst, the knowledge of legal matters, quite literally the ḥalāl and the ḥarām, which are rulings concerning this world and, as such, are considered as outward knowledge (ʿilm al-ẓāhir).122 The second type of knowledge is that which concerns the affairs of the hereafter, dealing with the heart and soul, along with their various diseases and states and, as such, is inward knowledge (ʿilm al-bāṭin).123 The third and fi nal form of knowl-edge is that concerning God and the manner in which He deals with His creation in this life and the next.124"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"82 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam In addition, al-Muḥāsibī informs us of three categories of people who in turn involve themselves in each type of knowledge.125 As for the fi rst group, who are concerned with legal issues only, they have an outward appearance of piety but in reality they are corrupted internally as they have allotted none of their time or effort to curing the heart and soul of their diseases. As for the second group, they are those who have devoted themselves to the identifi cation of every internal fault and every hidden sin, being concerned constantly with the second type of knowl-edge in their quest for purifi cation. The third group are the elite, having concerned themselves with a knowledge which is ‘a bottomless ocean’, as they are the scholars from the people of true faith.12615.Muʿātabat al-Nafs127 [‘Repremanding the soul’]. This is yet another short treatise by al-Muḥāsibī expounding the virtues of returning back to God, causing each individual to reassess the way in which he lives his life. The work concerns three main topics: that of the heart (al-qalb), that of the soul (al-nafs) and the relation-ship of both of these with their Lord. Thus, the primary section concerning the heart deals with the means by which the heart can regain its awareness of its Sustainer to the extent that it becomes aware of God’s observance of both the inward and outward actions of the devotee. The advantage of this is that faith in the divine decree (al-qadar) becomes a reality and the constant awareness of God guides ultimately to the straight path (al-ṣirāṭ al-mustaqīm). In addition, al-Muḥāsibī discusses the diseases of the heart, warning of their effect on making the heart hard and indifferent to the remembrance of God, clarifying that this leads ultimately to God’s rejection of this category of the heart.128 As for al-Muḥāsibī’s treatment of the soul, he begins by reminding it that it is unable to bear the wrath of God, extolling it to the remembrance of death, to be ashamed in the presence of its Lord and to compare the punishment of the hereaf-ter to its pleasures.129 When discussing the relationship of the human being with his Lord, al-Muḥāsibī reminds the wayward soul to always seek the aid of God through supplication, to always bring to mind that God forgives all sins and to remember that it is destitute without the provision of God and His mercy.130 While following al-Muḥāsibī’s exposition of the above-mentioned subjects, the reader is struck by the unusual style that he employs throughout. He continu-ally addresses each subject, i.e. the heart, soul and God, as if they were in front of him and he is conversing with them directly.131 One feels that these are an out-pouring of al-Muḥāsibī’s thoughts, feelings and emotions, which have been written down and which, as a result, give us a very intimate view of the writer’s personality, thus making it an important addition to the literature concerning him.16.Al-Qaṣd wa ’l-Rujūʿ ilā Allāh132 [‘Wayfaring to God and the return to Him]. This is an interesting addition to the works of al-Muḥāsibī as it sheds light on his own"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 83path in searching for knowledge of the hereafter. The reason for this is that this work, like much of what al-Muḥāsibī wrote, takes the form of a conversation, where the aspirant asks his guide regarding the path returning back to God. The difference here, however, is that in this particular case al-Muḥāsibī himself is the questioner.133 This point is clarifi ed by the editor, ʿAbd al-Qādir Aḥmad Aṭā, when he says:This book runs the same course as most of his works: answers given in reply to questions proposed by his companions but in this book he says that he is the questioner and that Muḥammad b. Mūsā ‘Abū Jaʿfar’ replies. He also mentions him in ‘Aʿmāl al-Qulūb wa ’l-Jawāriḥ’ with the name ‘Abū Jaʿfar’ only without mentioning Muḥammad b. Mūsā.134As Aṭā has just mentioned, this work covers many of the topics that are included in his other works, but this particular source is also very important as it discusses many topics which are not included, for example in such works as al-Riʿāya, gnosis (al-maʿrifa), and wisdom (al-ḥikma).135 As for the actual content of al-Qaṣd wa ’l-Rujūʿ ilā Allāh, Aṭā summarises it, saying:The book is a summary regarding the return to God beginning with repent-ance and ending with the fear of God, passing through honesty (al-ṣidq), gnosis (al-maʿrifa), wisdom (al-ḥikma), asceticism (al-zuhd), scrupulousness (al-waraʿ), certainty (al-yaqīn) and satisfaction (al-riḍā), as well as other stages that a Muslim must pass through on his path to God.136; 13717.Kitāb al-Khalwa wa ’l-Tanaqqul fī ’l-ʿIbāda wa Darajāt al-ʿĀbidīn138 [‘The book of spiritual retreat and wayfaring through the categories of worship and ranks of worshippers’]. Al-Muḥāsibī begins this work by extolling the virtues of spiritual retreat from the worldly life (al-khalwa) and in particular when this is performed with constant reading of and refl ection upon the Qurʾān. He then continues by describing various states of worship – all internal of course – and various degrees and levels people reach regarding each of them. He facilitates this by presenting a series of counsels and answers to questions proposed by a would-be aspirant on the path to God.139 The fi rst virtue that al-Muḥāsibī discusses is that of certainty in God (al-yaqīn bi Allāh) that is the basis of faith. The next best action after this is the acknowledgement of divine bounties (maʿrifat al-niʿam) and as a result the manifestation of gratitude (al-shukr). Al-Muḥāsibī then clarifi es the various states that a devotee may fi nd himself in and the ability to progress from one stage to the next, which he considers to be intrinsically related to the knowledge of the soul’s faults (ʿuyūb al-nafs).140 He continues by urging the reader to maintain silence and to consider any speech that he is forced to make as a disaster that has struck. In addition, he warns of the importance of opposing one’s desires, as failure to do this is a quality which all people suffer from.141 He completes this section of the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"84 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamwork by discussing one of his familiar topics, such as that of ostentation (al-riyāʾ), and rulers (al-mulūk) are singled out for particular criticism.142 Al-Muḥāsibī also discusses the importance of distinguishing between fear (al-khawf) and hope (al-rajāʾ) and that both of these will not be fulfi lled except through a process of intimidating the soul (al-tarhīb) and awakening its desire (al-targhīb).143 He then furnishes us with his views regarding the importance of truthfulness (al-ṣidq) in the actions performed for the sake of God and even more importantly, the essence of the action, the intention (al-irāda). This concept is further developed and its importance discussed with regard to the compulsory acts (al-farāʾiḍ) in particular and, in addition, the supplementary acts (al-nawāfi l), as well as the internal virtues of fear (al-khawf) and hope (al-rajāʾ).144 Al-Muḥāsibī concludes this work with a long discussion concerning the importance of main-taining a good opinion with regard to God (ḥusn al-ẓann) and restraining oneself from despondency and despair (zajr ʿan al-qunūṭ), as well as discussing the neces-sity of realising the dangers of sin (al-sayiʾa) and preoccupying oneself with the performance of good (al-ḥasana).145 In summary this work, as with Ādāb al-Nufūs before it, is representative of much of al-Muḥāsibī’s teachings in his other works, in particular al-Riʿāya146 and al-Naṣāʾiḥ.147 Nevertheless, this work, as with Ādāb al-Nufūs is of equal impor-tance, as it not only summarises his teaching in a concise manner but also, to some degree at least, refl ects the period in which he lived.18.Kitāb Masāʾil fī ’l-Zuhd (wa Ghayrihi148)149 [‘The book of issues related renuncia-tion’]. From the title of this work it would be reasonable to expect a discussion regarding ascetic theology in Islam (al-zuhd) and in this sense al-Muḥāsibī does not disappoint but it would be misleading to think that this work deals exclusively with asceticism, as in fact it deals with numerous issues. He does begin this trea-tise, however, with the discussion concerning worldly renunciation (al-zuhd) and clarifi es its various types and rulings, as well as discussing the characteristics of the true ascetic (al-zāhid). Al-Muḥāsibī then turns his attention to the topics of silence (al-ṣamt) and refl ection (al-fi kra), stressing their important effect on the heart and the internal faculties they bestow. He then presents his views regarding the true nature of wealth (al-ghinā), poverty (al-faqr) and gratitude (al-shukr) for the bounties bestowed upon the devotee by his Lord.150 In the following sections al-Muḥāsibī deals with familiar topics which he has also dealt with in his other works such as arrogance (al-kibr), ostentation (al-riyāʾ), satanic incitement (al-waswisa) and the dangers of the desires (al-hawā).151 He continues by discussing the best of the acts of worship, in which he discusses such topics as the knowledge of God (al-ʿilm bi Allāh), prayer (al-ṣalāt), having sym-pathy with those less fortunate and coming to the aid of others.152 Al-Muḥāsibī continues this work with a discussion of the way a person can identify the sugges-tions of Satan (ḥadīth al-Shayṭān) from those of the soul (ḥadīth al-nafs) and concludes with a number of counsels on a variety of subjects.153"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 85Works attributed to al-Muḥāsibī1.Kitāb al-Baʿth wa ’l-Nushūr154 [‘The book of the resurrection’].

This work is a refuta-tion of al-Thanawiyya160 who had started to arrive in Baghdad and began ‘spread-ing an atmosphere of atheism (zandaqa)161 and scepticism (tashkīk)’.162 During the course of this work al-Muḥāsibī discusses the unity of God, His oneness and the impossibility of there being a second or third deity. Al-Muḥāsibī’s evidence for this is a rudimentary form of creationism that depends upon the ‘unity of crea-tion’, which espouses the idea that every created being has a known place in the scheme of things and a purpose for its creation. In addition, every created being is dependent on another and, as such, the creation as a whole is like a chain with many links so that consequently, if one were to break, the whole chain would collapse. This ‘unity of creation’ is thus indicative of a sole Creator Who is boun-teous to His creation, as He provides them with sustenance from the very moment they are brought into existence. In addition, al-Muḥāsibī exposes the fate of previ-ous societies who rejected faith in such a Creator and suggests that anyone who refl ects on this cannot fail but believe in God and His unity. It is through such a faith that al-Muḥāsibī suggests human beings will be guided, enter Paradise and reach perfect satisfaction with their Lord.1632.Risāla fī164 ’l-Taṣawwuf [‘A treatise on Sufi sm’].

In addition, the work is written in the form of a dialogue between the guide (al-murshid) and the aspirant (al-murīd), which is a common method employed by al-Muḥāsibī throughout his writings. Al-Hujwīrī (d. 465/1073 or 469/1077) discusses the aspect of riḍā in al-Muḥāsibī’s teaching in detail in his Kashf al-Maḥjūb and may well have derived it from this work in its complete form.177 He also presents al-Muḥāsibī’s teaching as being a new exposition of this topic, which was then adopted by later writers.17811.Risāla [‘A treatise’].

The actual text reads as follows:Writing of the Qurʾān was no novelty, for the Prophet used to order that it be written down, but it was in separate pieces, on scraps of leather, shoulder blades and palm risp, and [Abū Bakr] al-Ṣiddīq ordered that it be copied from the [various] places to a common place, which was in the shape of sheets, these [materials] were found in the house of the Prophet in which the Qurʾān was spread out, and he gathered it all together and tied it with a string so that none of it was lost.1866.Kitāb al-Dimāʾ/Kitāb al-Kaff ʿammā Shuḥira (Shajara) bayn al-Ṣaḥāba [‘The book of blood that was spilt’/ ‘The book concerning avoiding the disputes that"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 89occurred between the Prophetic companions’]. There can be no doubt that one of the most controversial topics in Islamic history is that of the disputes that occurred between the Companions of the Prophet (al-ṣaḥāba). In addition, the period in which al-Muḥāsibī lived was clearly affected by such disputes, as they were the subject of continuous critique, which can readily be seen in the various opinions of both the Muʿtazila187 and the Shīʿa188 regarding the Prophet’s Companions.189 Consequently, it is not surprising that al-Muḥāsibī authored a specifi c work on this topic and, in fact, this is stated by various authors.190 In actual fact, al-Muḥāsibī has touched on this topic in various places within his works, in addition to the specifi c treatise mentioned here.191 On examining these various extracts one fi nds that his stance regarding the issue is clear. We fi nd that al-Muḥāsibī, whilst addressing this issue, attempts to fi nd a middle ground between the extreme views of both the Muʿtazila and the Shīʿa, whose stances towards the issue by that time were well known. In addition, as we have already seen, he was concerned not only with scholastic theology (ʿilm al-kalām) but also its use in defending the classical Sunni position as far as he was concerned. After witnessing his defence of classical Sunni positions on such issues as the beatifi c vision and the divine attributes, it is no surprise that al-Muḥāsibī also refutes the ‘unorthodox’ position of various sects regarding the Prophetic Companions.192 On examining his approach to the topic, we can identify various aspects which are worthy of mention. First, whilst adopting the role of guide, al-Muḥāsibī advises his ‘brothers’ by warning them to avoid delving too deeply into this complex issue concerning the early generations of the Muslim community. The reason for this is then made clear; the cause of the disputes of those who came after the era of the Companions was their examination of and delving into the reasons behind these disputes. In addition, they then used the Qurʾān’s ambiguous verses (al-mutashābihāt)193 as opposed to its unambiguous verses (muḥkam) as proof for their stance as well as the various narrations (āthār) from the Prophet and the Companions, which were also open to interpretation.194In addition, their ‘mis-guidance’ (ḍalāl) is compounded by the fact that they fought, killed and aposta-tised anyone who opposed their whims. Al-Muḥāsibī includes within these sects the Qadariyya,195 i.e. the followers of Maʿbad and Ghaylān, then the followers of Wāṣil b. ʿAṭāʾ196 (who later became the Muʿtazila), the Murjiʾa,197 the Rāfi ḍa (i.e. the Shiʿa),198 the Jahmiyya199 and the Ḥarūriyya (i.e. the Khawārij).200; 201 Al-Muḥāsibī suggest that the safest path to adopt is to avoid delving into such complexities as the danger of doing so lies in the fact that these groups were all brothers before they adopted this position and, in addition, it is impossible to fi nd a solution which will satisfy everyone.202 Consequently, al-Muḥāsibī proposes that the path to salvation is by adopting that which the Muslim community (al-umma) has agreed upon (mujmaʿ ʿalayhi) in terms of faith in God, His mes-sengers (rusūlihi), His angels (malāʾikatihi), His books (kutubihi), the limits set by Him (ḥudūdihi), the acts made compulsory by Him ( farāʾiḍihi), the legal injunctions of His religion (sharāʾiʿ dīnihi) and all the issues that reached the status of consensus during the period of the earliest generations (al-salaf), as all of this is guidance (al-rushd) and truth (al-ḥaqq).203"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"90 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam Despite the advice proposed by al-Muḥāsibī regarding this sensitive issue, he also clarifi es his own personal point of view regarding the disputes that occurred between the Companions. In this sense, once again we fi nd him proposing the position of a classical sunnī scholar. He considers ʿUthmān and ʿAlī both to have been killed unjustly204 and considers ʿAlī to have been correct regarding the dis-putes with ʿĀʾisha, Ṭalḥa, al-Zubayr and Muʿāwiya.205 That is not to say that he is critical of this latter group either206; in fact, he considers them to have exercised their personal judgement but to have been mistaken in the conclusions they for-mulated (mujtahidūn mukhtiʾūn).207 This being the case, it is easy to deduce and there can be no doubt that al-Muḥāsibī’s goal of such a discussion was to absolve them of responsibility and any associated sin.208 For example, al-Samʿānī in his book Kitāb al-Anṣāb quotes Abū ʿAlī b. Shādhān (d. 350/961) as stating that al-Muḥāsibī wrote a book entitled Kitāb al-Dimā ’describing the circumstances in which the Companions’ blood was spilled and that these events did not affect the unity of Islamic faith. In fact, Ibn Shādhān goes as far as to say that this book was relied upon by him and his associ-ates.209 Similarly, Smith quotes al-Dhahabī as mentioning a work by al-Muḥāsibī entitled Kitāb al-Kaff ʿammā Shuḥira210 bayn al-Ṣaḥāba regarding the same topic.211 It is interesting that both Smith and Maḥmūd conclude that these two works are in fact one treatise, despite the differing titles, as it is highly improbable that al-Muḥāsibī wrote two books on the same topic.212 In either case, this work concerns the latter period of ʿUthmān’s era and the disagreements that occurred, which ultimately led to his death, as well as the dispute between ʿAlī on the one hand and ʿĀʾisha and Muʿāwiya on the other.2137.Kitāb al-Ḥubb li Allāh wa Marātib Ahlihi [‘The book of divine love and the ranks of lovers of the divine’]. Smith is alone in mentioning this work214 and identifi es it with Faṣl al-Maḥabba, included by Abū Nuʿaym in his Ḥilyat al-Awliyāʾ.215 She states that this is the most mystical of al-Muḥāsibī’s writings, in which he describes:The love of God for His saints, and the signs by which these lovers of God may be known while they dwell in this world among men. To such lovers is granted the Vision of God and that communion with Him, which is the aim of the mystic, the in-dwelling of the human by the divine.216The chronological sequence of al-Muḥāsibī’s worksHaving discussed the works of al-Muḥāsibī at length and in some detail, one is left with the issue of their chronological sequence. This is no easy task, since neither the classical Arabic scholars nor contemporary Western writers have contributed a great deal in this regard. In addition, there is little in al-Muḥāsibī’s works to assist us in this task as he provides only a minimum of historical detail.217 Consequently, it is also worth mentioning here the efforts of some scholars to provide a"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 91chronological sequence for these works in order to assess the various stages that al-Muḥāsibī may have gone through as an author and writer. There have been two seminal attempts to provide such information, namely by Maḥmūd, in his Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn and al-Quwwatlī in his edited version of al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān.The chronological sequence of al-Muḥāsibī’s works suggested by MaḥmūdThe essence of Maḥmūd’s discussion revolves around the concept of al-Muḥāsibī as a Sufi and he begins with the basic and logical premise that al-Muḥāsibī was not born a Sufi and therefore must have undergone various stages of development before he reached the level expressed in his more complex and in-depth works. Similarly, we do not fi nd any evidence of al-Muḥāsibī changing ‘overnight’ in adopting a spiritual path, nor do we fi nd him reaching an elevated form of Sufi sm until the latter period of his life. In fact, we fi nd that al-Muḥāsibī at the beginning of his career as a writer can be observed to have adopted the general style of religious writings of the period.218 However, as he progressed in his path to Sufi sm, he also grew older and as a result became more mature in his thinking, as it is at this stage that a person relies upon not only the knowledge he has aquired but also the experience he has gained. Consequently, al-Muḥāsibī gained a higher level of spirituality at this stage but this is not all, as this stage of al-Muḥāsibī’s life and career was also characterised by an outstanding ability to examine and diagnose the faults, diseases and treat-ment of the soul for which, of course, he later became renowned.219 Consequently, as he grew older and gained in spiritual experience, he reached the pinnacle of his Sufi teachings. It is in this period that we fi nd al-Muḥāsibī began writing works fi lled with counsels aimed at those searching for the correct path regarding spir-itual matters and that the examination of the human soul becomes less frequent as if it became only an echo of the previous stage.220 In summary we can say that Maḥmūd separates the stages of al-Muḥāsibī’s life with regard to his Sufi sm into the following three catagories:1. An initial stage where al-Muḥāsibī was essentially infl uenced by the style and writing of the scholars of his era.221 Maḥmūd exemplifi es this in al-Muḥāsibī’s Fahm al-Qurʾān, as this work concerns various religious issues and matters concerning belief, being written in a typically argumentative style which was common during this period.2222. An intermediate period where he progressed in his path to Sufi sm and became more mature in his thinking,223 characterised by an outstanding ability in his examination of the human soul.224 Maḥmūd exemplifi es this in al-Muḥāsibī’s al-Riʿāya, as this work shows his skill in determining the faults of the soul, his depth of comprehension regarding their cure and his powerful intellectual capacity.2253. The advanced stage of his life where he reached the peak of his teaching,"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"92 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamturning his attention to guidance of others specifi cally and reaching the pinnacle of Sufi sm. Maḥmūd exemplifi es this in al-Muḥāsibī’s al-Waṣāyā, as this work concerns the advice on how to attain the true path by advising the aspirant of the course of action he or she must adopt.226The chronological sequence of al-Muḥāsibī’s works suggested by al-QuwwatlīIn assessing the chronological sequence of al-Muḥāsibī’s works, al-Quwwatlī appreciates the suggestions made by Maḥmūd, but differs from him in the sense that he suggests only two periods in the chronological sequence of al-Muḥāsibī’s writing. He recognises the initial period suggested by Maḥmūd but pays little attention to it as he considers the information regarding this primary stage to be unreliable and, consequently, he distinguishes two main periods227:1.A period that he terms ‘a transition phase’ (fatrat al-taḥawwul), which he consid-ers to last from 195/811 to 207/823.228 By this al-Quwwatlī seems to suggest that this is a period in which al-Muḥāsibī’s tendency to intellectualism (al-nazʿat al-ʿaqliyya) is apparent in his writing, before a defi nitive change to Sufi sm became manifest. To this effect al-Quwwatlī, quite surprisingly, contradicts Maḥmūd by including al-Waṣāyā as being from al-Muḥāsibī’s works in this period.229 In addi-tion, other works included by al-Quwwatlī in this period are Kitāb al-Khalwa wa ’l-Tanaqqul fī ’l-ʿIbāda wa Darajāt al-ʿĀbidīn,230 Ādāb al-Nufūs,231 Risālat al-Mustarshidīn232 and al-Tawahhum.233; 2342.A period which he terms ‘an instruction phase’ (fatrat al-tadrīs), in which al-Muḥāsibī taught his thought to others and which al-Quwwatlī suggests lasted from 207/823 to 236/851. During this phase al-Quwwatlī alludes to the fact that al-Muḥāsibī’s tendency towards scholastic theology (al-nazʿat al-kalāmiyya) dominates the early period of this part of his life and begins to be mixed with a tendency also for Sufi sm. In addition, he also begins to include a large number of narrations to support his views, which al-Quwwatlī suggests was in reply to the harsh reaction of the Ḥanābila to his refutation of the sects common at that time. Al-Quwwatlī also suggests that it was in this era that al-Muḥāsibī’s writing style reached its pinnacle in terms of eloquence and subject matter. As for the works included by al-Quwwatlī in this period, they are: Kitāb Māʾiyyat al-ʿAql wa Maʿnāhā,235 Kitāb al-ʿAẓama, Kitāb Iḥkām al-Tawba,236 Kitāb al-Dimāʾ,237 al-Makāsib, Kitāb Masāʾil fī ’l-Zuhd wa Ghayrihi, Kitāb al-Masāʾil fī Aʿmāl al-Qulūb wa ’l-Jawāriḥ238 and al-Riʿāya li Ḥuqūq Allāh.239 In conclusion, it would seem that Maḥmūd’s survey of the chronological sequence of al-Muḥāsibī’s works is far more useful than that of al-Quwwatlī as it"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 93is not only more representative of his life and career but is also more accurate in attributing the works themselves to a specifi c period. It is also worth mentioning here that both scholars seem to have overlooked an important aspect regarding al-Muḥāsibī’s writings; in assessing the chronological sequence of his works, they have seemed to lay great emphasis on the role of subject matter, which is a rather arbitrary means of appraisal. For example, al-Quwwatlī casually groups together al-Makāsib, Kitāb Masāʾil fī ’l-Zuhd wa Ghayrihi and Kitāb al-Masāʾil fī Aʿmāl al-Qulūb wa ’l-Jawāriḥ, as being from one period and, while there can be no doubt that their subject matter is similar, there is little or nothing in fact to suggest that they were written in a similar time frame. In addition, al-Muḥāsibī himself was a unique author in his style, subject matter and, in particular, the method which he employed in authoring his works, as the incident with al-Junayd illustrates only too well. Al-Muḥāsibī was an author who wrote only when the need arose, whether for his own personal journey of discovery regarding his own soul or whether counselling his students concerning their journey along the path.240 However, even this is not easy to distinguish due to the common ‘question and answer’ style that al-Muḥāsibī adopts and in either case it provides little information regarding the sequence in which al-Muḥāsibī’s works were written.241 As has been mentioned previously, it would also seem that al-Muḥāsibī wrote various concise works, which were expounded in later, more expansive ventures and, as such, it further proves his ability as a teacher and a spiritual guide, as each of these treatises was written with a specifi c goal or spe-cifi c students’ needs in mind. Thus, more appropriate questions to pose than that of when al-Muḥāsibī’s works were written are, due to their methodological sig-nifi cance, why they were written and for whom.ConclusionAt the beginning of this chapter it stated that the works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī were reported to have numbered approximately 200. Having surveyed the avail-able literature and collated this information, it would appear that there are 36 works that can be confi rmed as being al-Muḥāsibī’s.242 This is by no means the 200 mentioned by al-Subkī (d. 771/1370) but it is, nevertheless, a signifi cant percent-age of them. What is also apparent from this discussion is the signifi cance of al-Muḥāsibī as a writer; not only was he the fi rst to write in depth on spiritual matters but he was also the fi rst to treat the human soul in so much detail. What is also clear is that this was not the only fi eld with which al-Muḥāsibī was familiar but, indeed, he was well aquainted with a variety of Islamic fi elds of learning, including the views of those before him and those of his own contemporaries. In addition, al-Muḥāsibī clearly refl ected the society in which he lived as he not only discussed the issues that were of concern to the scholarly elite but also debated the opinions of the various sects present at the time and paid great attention to the spiritual welfare of his community.

Smith also notes that Ḥājjī Khalīfa (d. 1067/1657) terms this work ‘Riʿāya fī Taṣawwuf’ and that a work attributed to al-Muḥāsibī entitled ‘al-Riʿāya fī Taḥṣīl al-Maqāmāt al-Sālikīn’ is appar-ently by a later author, though much of it is in accordance with al-Muḥāsibī’s teaching. See Smith, An Early Mystic, pp. 44–5; and Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, p. 76. 6 For example, ʿUwayḍa says, ‘This book contains a number of issues which were [sub-sequently] approved and reached a state of consensus amongst the Sufi s of ahl al-sunna.’ ʿUwayḍa, al-Ḥārith ibn Asad al-Muḥāsibī, pp. 32–3; and cf. al-Muḥāsibī, al-Riʿāya li Ḥuqūq Allāh, ed. al-Barr, p. 37. 7 That this is al-Muḥāsibī’s greatest work is testifi ed to by the great deal of attention it has received by various scholars throughout history. The book itself has had various publications, these include:1 Smith’s own edited version of al-Riʿāya. This is possibly the fi rst published version of this work being printed in 1940, as part of the E. J. W. Gibb memorial series by Luzac & Co. (London).

In addi-tion, the ‘referencing of the prophetic narrations (mukharrajat aḥādīthihā)’ was also misleading because this part of the research was littered with errors, as the editor has seemed to rely upon ‘al-Muʿjam al-Mufahras li Alfāẓ al-Ḥadīth al-Nabawiyya’, quoting from it extensively without verifying the ḥadīth from their original sources. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-Riʿāya li Ḥuqūq Allāh, ed. al-Barr, pp. 4–5; and al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-ʿIlm, p. 25.4 A version edited by ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ʿAbd al-Ḥamīd al-Barr, published by Dār al-Yaqīn (al-Manṣūra, Egypt), in 1999. The editor states that his reasons for working on al-Riʿāya are to produce an academic version of the text, including referencing of the narrations (takhrīj) whether they be from the Prophet, the Companions (al-ṣaḥāba) or the Successors (al-tābiʿūn) from their original sources and, consequently, state the authenticity of such narrations (darajat al-aḥādīth). In addition, he provides explana-tion of the peculiar words and ambiguous phrases in the text. Despite these useful additions there is no mention of which manuscripts (if any) were used by the editor to verify the original.5 A version edited by ʿIṣām Fāris al-Ḥarastānī and Muḥammad Ibrāhīm al-Zaghlī, pub-lished by Dār al-Jīl (Beirut), 2001. The editors of this particular version claim that the existing publications still require verifi cation of the text. In addition, they include referencing of the prophetic narrations (takhrīj al-aḥādīth) and state the authenticity of such narrations (darajat al-aḥādīth). Despite these useful additions, once again there is no mention of which manuscripts (if any), were used by the editors to verify the text.

In addition the handwriting is particularly poor.(c) No. 1416 taṣawwuf. This is the best of the manuscripts, being written in a clear, beautiful naskh style and has few mistakes.4 A copy located in The Chester Beatty Library under catalogue number 4918 and entitled al-Naṣāʾiḥ. The copyist is recorded as being Ismāʿīl b. Muhaymin al-Ṭaḥḥaz and the manuscript is dated Monday, 7th Ṣafar 734 /18th October 1333. As a result three edited copies of this work have been produced: (i) A version edited by ʿAbd al-Qādir Aḥmad Aṭā and published by Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyya (Beirut), in 1986. Aṭā relied on the manuscript mentioned above in 3.(c) while producing his edited version of this work and selected the title al-Waṣāyā as this conforms to the general nature of the book. In addition, he also included various other works by al-Muḥāsibī within this version; these included al-Qaṣd wa ’l-Rujūʿilā Allāh, Badʾ Man Anāba ilā Allāh, Fahm al-Ṣalāt and al-Tawahhum. As with his version of al-Riʿāya this version is said to be, ‘Edited (taḥqīq), annotated (taʿlīq) and have an introduction (taqdīm)’. However, similar to his version of al-Riʿāya, this research was also littered with errors, in terms of being distorted (al-taḥrīf ) and misread (al-taṣḥīf), as well as mistakes regarding the referencing of the narrations (takhrīj al-aḥādīth).(ii) A version published by Muʾassasat Qurṭuba, and entitled simply al-Naṣāʾiḥ, which has very little detail included other than that, as there is no place of publication, no date of publication and no mention of who exactly edited the work. The only information we can glean from this book is the manuscripts that were used in editing it; these were manuscripts 1 and 2 above, being copied versions found in Dār al-Kutub al-Miṣriyya. Having examined the descriptions of these two manuscripts, the author’s opinion is that the two of the three copies found in Dār al-Kutub al-Miṣriyya mentioned above may well be copies of manuscripts 1 and 2.

It is interesting that al-Muḥāsibī discusses knowledge in this regard, as for the majority of people wealth can be a source of corruption but knowl-edge, which is usually regarded by the majority as a source of benefi t, at the same time can be equally as deadly to the human soul.

See al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-Tawahhum (Aleppo: Dār al-Waʿī, 1979).4 A fourth version has been edited Muḥammad ʿUthmān al-Khusht and published originally in 1984 and then again in 1999, by Maktabat al-Qurʾān (Cairo), being entitled al-Tawahhum Riḥlat al-Insān ilā ʿĀlim al-Ākhira. Al-Khusht has relied on manuscripts ‘2’ and ‘3’ above in editing this work and clarifi ed the reason why he chose to edit this treatise as being the apparent mistakes in Arberry’s version, for which he gives various examples. Consequently, al-Khusht has provided a useful introduction regarding the concept of the Hereafter (al-ākhira), as well as the usual biography of al-Muḥāsibī. In addition, the editor states that he wished to produce an academic version of the text and as result includes referencing of the Qurʾānic verses and Prophetic narrations, as well as providing biographical details regarding the personalities mentioned. In addition, he provides explanation of the peculiar words and ambiguous phrases in the text and removes any distortion (al-taḥrīf) and misreading (al-taṣḥīf) that occurs.

Consequently, it is suggested that there may be more versions of this work than those mentioned here. In addition to the work itself, there is also an academic appraisal of it and its author, entitled Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Ḥārith b.

One day while I was looking through it, thinking how good it was, when a young man wearing shabby clothing came in, greeted me and said, “O Abū ʿAbd Allāh, is intuitive knowledge of God (al-maʿrifa) the right (ḥaqq) of the True One (al-ḥaqq) upon His creation (al-khalq) or the right of the creation the upon the True One?” So I replied, “It is a right of the True One upon His creation.” So he said, “It is more appro-priate that He unveil it to those who deserve it.” So I said, “Then indeed it is the right of the creation upon the True One.” To which he said, “He is more just than to treat them unfairly.” Then he bade me farewell and left, so I tore it [the book] up and said, “I will never discuss intuitive knowledge of God again.’’’ It is unclear if the book referred to in this narration is the work in question here, in which case there may have been versions of this work that had already been copied and thus, it remained extant. Alternatively, al-Muḥāsibī may have written a later work after he felt that he had gained a greater understanding of the subject matter, or one may simply view this narration as a later embellishment. See ʿAbd al-Wahhāb b. Aḥmad al-Shaʿrānī, al-Ṭabaqāt al-Kubrā, ed. Sulaymān al-Ṣāliḥ (Beirut: Dār al-Maʿrifa, 2005), pp. 113–14; al-Bundanījī, Jāmiʿ al-Anwār, p. 293; and Smith, An Early Mystic, pp. 11–12.73 This work more than any other has proven extremely diffi cult in drawing a conclusion regarding its actual status. This has been for a variety of reasons; the fi rst diffi culty is the title of the work itself. Abū Ghudda, for example, simply terms it Sharḥ al-Maʿrifa and does not refer to any of the titles which will be mentioned below. On the contrary,"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"104 Spiritual Purifi cation in IslamSmith mentions three different titles for the one work, namely, Sharḥ al-Maʿrifa wa Badhl al-Naṣīḥa, Risāla fī ’l-Muraqaba wa Inqisāmihā and Kitāb Muḥāsabat al-Nafs. It is clear from this that Smith saw all three titles on differing manuscripts and after comparing them concluded that they were the same work. Maḥmūd on the other hand confuses issues further by terming the work, Kitāb fī ’l-Murāqaba and then states that there is another, separate work by al-Muḥāsibī entitled, al-Maʿrifa. However, having examined the published versions of this work and comparing them to the quotes taken from what Maḥmūd terms al-Maʿrifa’ the present author fi nds it clear that in fact these quotes are from Sharḥ al-Maʿrifa wa Badhl al-Naṣīḥa, or what he terms Kitāb fī ’l-Murāqaba and therefore there is no separate work entitled al-Maʿrifa as he claims. See al-Muḥāsibī, Sharḥ al-Maʿrifa wa Badhl al-Naṣīḥa, ed. Ṣāliḥ Aḥmad al-Shāmī (Damascus: Dār al-Qalam, 1993), p. 23; al-Muḥāsibī, Risālat al-Mustarshidīn, ed. Abū Ghudda, p. 31; Sezgīn, Tārīkh al-Turāth al-ʿArabī, vol. 1, p. 117; Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, pp. 85–7; and Smith, An Early Mystic, p. 53. In addition, there are two published versions of this work:1 A version edited by Ṣāliḥ Aḥmad al-Shāmī, entitled Sharḥ al-Maʿrifa wa Badhl al-Naṣīḥa and published by Dār al-Qalam (Damascus), in 1993. In editing the book al-Shāmī has relied on the following manuscripts:(a) a manuscript found in the library at the King Faisal Centre for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, under number 3/73 fā. The original manuscript can be found in al-Azhar under no. 1208 taṣawwuf, consists of 10 fols. and was written in a clear naskh style in the ninth/fi fteenth century.(b) A manuscript found in the al-Azhar library in Cairo under no. 615 wāw taṣawwuf. It consists of 12 fols. and at fi rst glance appears complete but on examination there is gap in the copy equivalent to one page.(c) A manuscript found in al-Imam Muḥammad b. Saʿūd Islamic University, Riyadh, under number 4979 fā. The manuscript was written in Dhu ’l-Ḥijja 911/April 1506 and there are two places where it is incomplete.(d) A manuscript found in Dār al-Kutub al-Miṣriyya, Cairo, under number 4084 taṣawwuf. The manuscript consists of 8 fols., six of which are the work itself ending at the section entitled ‘the soul prone to evil (al-nafs al-amāra bi ’l-sūʾ), whereas fols. 7–8 contain a text copied from ‘al-Riʿāya’ by al-Muḥāsibī. As for al-Shāmī’s contribution regarding this text he has carried out a comparison of the manuscripts and edited them accordingly. In addition, he has attempted to produce a version with a minimum of annotation, so that the reader would not be lost within the footnotes at the expense of benefi ting from the main text. To this effect the editor does, however, provide footnotes explaining ambiguous terms, a well as having split the work into two sections according to the title, i.e. Sharḥ al-Maʿrifa and Badhl al-Naṣīḥa. See al-Muḥāsibī, Sharḥ al-Maʿrifa, ed. al-Shāmī, pp. 17–20.2 A version edited by Majdī Fatḥī al-Sayyid, entitled, Sharḥ al-Maʿrifa wa Badhl al-Naṣīḥa and published by Dār al-Ṣaḥāba li ’l-Turāth (Ṭanṭā, Egypt), in 1993. In editing this work al-Sayyid has relied on the manuscript found in Dār al-Kutub al-Miṣriyya, Cairo, under taṣawwuf al-Shanqīṭī no. 3 (microfi lm 3889). This manuscript consists of 12 fols., i.e. 24 pages with 22 lines to a page of good-quality handwriting. In addition there is another copy of this manuscript in the al-Azhar library under (3/634) taṣawwuf, no. 1207. Although al-Sayyid has only relied on the manuscript described above he does however mention other copies of it and they are as follows:(a) A manuscript found in Berlin under number 2815, fols. 208–10, copied in 1200/1786.(b) A manuscript found in the British Museum, appendix 1242, Oriental 3/4026, fols. 66bff."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 105(c) A manuscript found in Shahīd ʿAlī, Istanbul, under number 3/1345, fols. 37 alif–47 alif, copied in the eighth/fourteenth century.(d) A manuscript found in Ṣāʿib, Ankara, under number 1/3319, fols. 1 alif–11 bā, being copied in 731/1331.(e) A manuscript found in Chester Beatty, Damascus, under catalogue number 4969, consisting of 17 fols., being copied in 911/1505. As for al-Sayyid’s contribution regarding this text, he has added a great deal of annotation, in a similar manner to that of Abū Ghudda in his edited version of Risālat al-Mustarshidīn but not in such a profuse manner. To this effect the editor provides footnotes explaining ambiguous terms and various quotes from the pious predecessors (al-salaf al-ṣāliḥ), as well as dividing the work into sections and adding headings for each one. Despite this, however, there are major discrepancies between the two published versions of the work. On examining the introduction alone, the reader feels at times that he is reading two different books as al-Sayyid’s version lacks much of what al-Shāmī provides. This is clearly due to the fact that al-Shāmī has carried out a comparison of the manuscripts available to him and therefore his version is more complete, whereas al-Sayyid has relied on only one manuscript. What is not clear, however, is how such discrepancies occurred in the original manuscripts. There is no simple answer to this but it may go so far in explaining why one work had so many titles. Bearing this in mind, if the researcher quotes from Sharḥ al-Maʿrifa wa Badhl al-Naṣīḥa it will be al-Shāmī’s edition which will be meant, as it contains a broader view of al-Muḥāsibī’s teaching in this particular work.

The manuscript used by Aṭā is included within a collection of al-Muḥāsibī’s works entitled, al-Masāʾil, which also contains al-ʿAql and al-Makāsib, which made it particularly diffi cult to locate. This copy of this collection can be found in the Cairo University library and it was taken from an original in the Aḥmad al-Jazzār Baʿkā library, which was deposited in the al-Azhar library under taṣawwuf, no. 1367. This copy was made at the beginning of the sixth/twelfth century and is extremely diffi cult to read in places. In addition the copier switches the feminine and masculine pronouns and some displacement has also occurred. As for Aṭā’s contribution, he placed section headings for each subject, correcting the mistakes and displacement and added annotated footnotes where appropriate, as well as adding some words as to as to make the meaning more comprehensible.2 A version by Majdī Fatḥī al-Sayyid published by Dār al-Salām, Cairo, in 1991. Al-Sayyid has used a manuscript found in Dār al-Kutub al-Miṣriyya, Cairo, under taṣawwuf, no. 4064 and of which there is microfi lm copy under 5998. The manuscript consists of seven pages (14 sides) and has 20 lines to a page, averaging seven words a line. In addition, al-Sayyid also mentions another copy in Berlin under no. 3/66. As for al-Sayyid’s contribution, he has divided the work into paragraphs, placed section headings for each subject, correcting the mistakes and added annotated footnotes where appropriate. In addition to the manuscripts mentioned above, others also exist, they are:(i) A manuscript found in Carullah, under no. 1101/2 (fols. 18a–24b) being copied in 523/1129.(ii) A second manuscript in Dār al-Kutub al-Miṣriyya, Cairo, under taṣawwuf, no. 4664.(iii) A further manuscript found in Jāmiʿat Fuʾād, under no. 26048.

Al-Muḥāsibī, Risālat al-Mustarshidīn, ed. Abū Ghudda, p. 31.87 Smith suggests that this is an autobiographical account and it is clear that al-Muḥāsibī’s drew on his own personal experience as the account given is extremely subtle and precise. Despite this, some doubts surround the nature of the book as the customary qāla/qultu question and answer style is employed. This is not unusual but it begs the question: is this a conversation between al-Muḥāsibī and his teacher as we’ve seen previously in al-Qaṣd wa ’l-Rujū ʿilā Allā? Or is it, as al-Sayyid suggests, a conversa-tion between al-Muḥāsibī and one of his students, or simply an imaginary conversation, which took place in the author’s own mind and he recorded?’ The answer is not at all clear. See al-Muḥāsibī, Badʾ Man Anāba ilā Allāh, ed. al-Sayyid, p. 23: al-Muḥāsibī, al-Waṣāyā, p. 331; and Smith, An Early Mystic, p. 54.88 Smith describes this path and its goal when she says:But when God has stirred the conscience, then it is for man to examine and disci-pline himself, and to keep continually before the remembrance of death and the"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 107hereafter, and so, by attaining mastery of his lower soul, and keeping his eyes fi xed on higher things, he will make continual progress in the path of God, and having relinquished the pleasures and temptations of all that would hinder him from the service of his Lord, will attain fellowship to Him.

Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, p. 84.89 See Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, p. 84.90 There are two manuscripts mentioned in the literature:1 A manuscript located in Carullah, Istanbul, under number 1101, fols. 114a–145b, being copied in 523/1129.2 A manuscript located in Dār al-Kutub al-Miṣriyya under number 4064 taṣawwuf.3 A manuscript located in Jāmiʿat Fuʾād, under number 26048.4 A copy found in Cairo University from the original, which is part of the personal library of Aḥmad al-Jazzār Baʿkā, being stored in al-Azhar under number 1367 taṣawwuf. This particular manuscript is of extreme importance as it also includes a series of al-Muḥāsibī’s other works, namely Kitāb Masāʾil fī ’l-Zuhd wa Ghayrihi, al-Makāsib and al-ʿAql. Consequently, ʿAbd al-Qādir Aḥmad ʿAṭā edited the entire manuscript, producing all four works under one title of al-Masāʾil fī Aʿmāl al-Qulūb wa ’l-Jawāriḥ wa ’l-Makāsib wa ’l-ʿAql, which was published by ʿĀlam al-Kutub (Cairo) with no date. As for Aṭā’s contribution, he placed section headings for each subject, correcting the mistakes and displacement and added annotated footnotes where appropriate, as well as adding some words so as to make the meaning more comprehensible.

This usually indicates that this is an abridgement of a longer work but since there is no indication of the fact that al-Muḥāsibī wrote a separate work and as this work is already extremely short, the researcher sug-gests that the term mukhtaṣar has been used to indicate the concise nature of the work in question.95 There are only two published versions of this work:1 A copy edited by ʿAbd al-Qādir Aḥmad Aṭā which is included within his edited version of al-Waṣāyā, as has been mentioned previously. In producing this version Aṭā has relied upon a copy of this manuscript found in Dār al-Kutub al-Miṣriyya (Cairo), number 4064 taṣawwuf, which was copied from the original in Carullah, Istanbul, no. 1101, fols. 1a–17b. In addition, Aṭā states that there is another copy from this original in the University of Cairo’s library. As for Aṭā’s contribution, he placed section headings for each subject, correcting the mistakes and displacement and added annotated footnotes where appropriate, as well as adding some words so as to make the meaning more comprehensible.2 A version edited by Muḥammad ʿUthmān al-Khusht with the title Fahm al-Ṣalāt – Taʿlīm al-Ṣalāt – al-Kushūʿ fī ’l-Ṣalāt – ʿUqūbat Tārik al-Ṣalāt, being published by"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"108 Spiritual Purifi cation in IslamMaktabat al-Qurʾān (Cairo) in 1984. In producing this version al-Khusht has relied upon a copy of this manuscript found in the University of Cairo’s library, which was copied from the original in Carullah onto microfi lm (no. 9678) and is entitled Mukhtaṣar Fahm al-Ṣalāt. This manuscript begins from page 52 and carries on to page 59, each page containing around 20 lines and each line approximately 14 words. As for al-Khusht’s contribution, he has placed section headings for each subject, correcting the mistakes and displacement, and added annotated footnotes where appropriate, as well as adding some words so as to make the meaning more comprehensible. In addition he has included a brief introduction about al-Muḥāsibī, brief biographical notes for each personality mentioned and added an introductory chapter entitled al-ʿIbāda min Manẓūr Khārijī, where he discusses various aspects of the relationship between the human being and acts of worship. In addition to the manuscripts mentioned above there would appear to be another manuscript in Jāmiʿat Fuʾād, under no. 26048.

See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, ed. al-Quwwatlī, p. 193; and Smith, An Early Mystic, p. 56.99 There appear to be several available manuscripts of this work:1 A manuscript found in Carullah, under number 1101, fols. 51b–53b.2 A manuscript found in Cairo University from the original, which is part of the personal library of Aḥmad al-Jazzār Baʿkā, being stored in al-Azhar under number 1367 taṣawwuf. This is part of the manuscript entitled al-Masāʾil fī Aʿmāl al-Qulūb wa ’l-Jawāriḥ ed. ʿAbd al-Qādir Aḥmad ʿAṭā.3 A manuscript found in Dār al-Kutub al-Miṣriyya (Cairo), under number 4064 taṣawwuf.4 A manuscript found in Jāmiʿat Fuʾād, under number 26048. Based on these manuscripts three published versions have been produced, they are:(a) A work edited by Ḥusayn al-Quwwatlī entitled al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, published originally by Dār al-Fikr in Beirut and then subsequently by Dār al-Kindī, also in Beirut. This edited version is an indispensable addition to the literature concerning al-Muḥāsibī, as al-Quwwatlī has not only edited two of al-Muḥāsibī’s works in this book but also proved a variety of introductory chapters, dealing with his life, work, thought and era. In addition, he has provided a wealth of information regarding the concept of the intellect up until and including the period of al-Muḥāsibī, as well as assessing al-Muḥāsibī’s own theories regarding this subject.(b) A work edited by ʿAbd al-Qādir Aḥmad ʿAṭā."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī 109(c) A work edited by Muṣṭafā ʿAbd al-Qādir ʿAṭā and published by Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyya (Beirut), in 1986 and entitled Sharaf al-ʿAql wa Māhiyyatuhu.

However, he is not satisfi ed with only this and also qualifi es his opinions with Prophetic narrations (aḥādīth) and statements recorded from his predecessors (al-salaf).

Both researchers quote only one manuscript for this treatise, this being the one located in Cairo under taṣawwuf shīn 3, being copied in 1173/1759, and it also appears to have been edited. Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Qādir ʿAṭā states that he is in the process of publishing this work but the researcher was unable to source this published version. In addition, this work should not be confused with another work entitled al-Tawba, attributed to al-Muḥāsibī and edited by ʿAbd al-Qādir Aḥmad Aṭā. This work is in fact a compilation of works on the subject of repentance containing a work entitled Aḥkām al-Tawba by ʿAbd al-Qādir b. Ismāʿīl al-Nābulusī, an appendix on the topic by the editor and al-Muḥāsibī’s Badʾ Man Anāba ilā Allāh. It would seem that the nature of this work of al-Muḥāsibī’s and in particular the term anāba, having a similar contex-tual meaning to tawba caused it to be included with the rest of these works. However, this seems to have been a rather crass decision bearing in mind the fact that al-Muḥāsibī has another work with a very similar title. See al-Muḥāsibī, Muʿātabat al-Nafs, ed. Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Qādir Aṭā (Cairo, Dār al-Iʿtiṣām, 1986), p. 23; al-Muḥāsibī, al-Tawba, ed. ʿAbd al-Qādir Aḥmad ʿAṭā (Cairo: Dār al-Faḍīla, 1977); al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-ʿIlm, p. 29; Sezgīn, Tārīkh al-Turāth al-ʿArabī, vol. 1, pp. 117–18; Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, p. 86; Smith, An Early Mystic, pp. 56–7; and van Ess, Die Gedankenwelt, p. 12.107 See Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, p. 86; and Smith, An Early Mystic, pp. 56–7.108 This is the name cited by Smith and Maḥmūd. In addition the book has two published versions:1 An edited and annotated version by ʿAbd al-Fattāḥ Abū Ghudda. This copy has proven very popular, as it is in its fi fth edition, and has done a great deal to publicise"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"110 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamthe life and works of al-Muḥāsibī. It was fi rst published in the late 1960s and was consequently translated into Turkish by ʿAlī Arslān in Istanbul. Abū Ghudda’s work on this book is indeed very useful as he has provided considerable information regarding the life of al-Muḥāsibī in the biographical section of the introduction and in particular regarding the dispute with Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal. In addition to this he has provided profuse footnotes explaining ambiguous terms, referencing the ḥadīth and general narrations from the salaf according to the appropriateness of the subject matter in the text. In producing the edited work Abū Ghudda used a personal copy of the manuscript whose handwriting is clear and has very few mistakes; it consists of 33 small pages, was probably written after the tenth/sixteenth century by his own estimation and has no name attributed to it except that on page three the following was written in small dots, ‘Written by Aḥmad b. al-Ḥājj Ismāʿīl’. In addition to this personal copy of the text, Abū Ghudda also mentions another copy in the Maʿhad al-Makhṭūṭāt al-ʿArabiyya (Cairo). This version was copied from an original in the Municipal Library in Alexandria, no. 13/3023 jīm: it consists of 14 small pages and is in a North African hand but, similar to the fi rst, it has neither the copyist’s name nor a date. Thus, Abū Ghudda compared both of these manuscripts in producing this version of al-Muḥāsibī’s work and entitled it Risālat al-Mustarshidīn.2 An edited and annotated version by Amīn Nuʿmān Nār, published by Dār wa Maktabat al-Hilāl, Beirut, in 1983 and entitled Risālat al-Mustarshadīn wa Kayfa Yataqarrub al-Insān ilā Rabbihi. This version was produced after that of Abū Ghudda’s and the editor clarifi es that he was well aware of this copy but wished to produce a version with a minimum of annotation, so that the reader would not lose himself within the footnotes at the expense of benefi ting from the main text. To this effect the editor also provided footnotes explaining ambiguous terms, referenced the ḥadīth mentioned and included a brief introduction to the life and works of al-Muḥāsibī. It is not clear, however, which (if any) manuscripts he relied upon while completing this publication. It should also be noted here that, in addition to what has been quoted above, there are other manuscripts mentioned in the literature; they are:(i) Another manuscript in Dār al-Kutub al-Miṣriyya, Cairo, no. 3 shīn, taṣawwuf as alluded to by Smith.(ii) A copy of this manuscript in The Chester Beatty Library under catalogue number 4985.(iii) A copy of this manuscript in al-Khizāna al-ʿIlmiyya al-Ṣubayḥiyya under number 5/202 (cat. no. 556).(iv) A copy of this manuscript in the Manuscript Library of Kuwait University under number 3482 mīm kāf. In addition to the books produced regarding Risālat al-Mustarshadīn, there is also a set of 12 tapes (11 hours approx.) produced by Deen Productions, in 2000, entitled ‘Purifi cation of the Soul: al-Muḥāsibī’s Risalat al-Mustarshideen’ by the American scholar Zaid Shakir who reads the original text in Arabic, translates it into English and provides a commentary by himself and additional notes from Abū Ghudda’s edited version. The commentary is particularly useful in the modern context and the translation is indispensable. Indeed, Shakir has published a hard copy of this text separately, presumably as a companion to the audio version. See al-Muḥāsibī, Risālat al-Mustarshidīn, ed.

There is only one published version of this work, having been edited by Ḥusayn al-Quwwatlī, entitled al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, published originally by Dār al-Fikr in Beirut and then subsequently by Dār al-Kindī, also in Beirut. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, pp. 239–505.113 Ibid., pp. 246–7.114 Ibid., p. 248.115 It is clear that he does this to clarify and refute various misconceptions regarding the Qurʾān proposed by the numerous sects present at that time. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, pp. 248–53.116 Ibid.117 In fact they differed to such an extent that al-Muḥāsibī considers them to be ahl al-bidʿa (lit. the people of innovation). See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, p. 253.118 The discussion in this case centring on the issue of God’s promise of paradise for the righteous and promise of hellfi re for the sinful (al-waʿd wa ’l-waʿīd). Al-Muʿtazila argued that those who committed major sins (al-kabāʾir) would defi nitely be punished in hellfi re, whereas those who had committed only minor sins (al-ṣaghāʾir) would be forgiven and enter paradise. The position of the nascent Muslim community (Ahl al-Sunna wa ’l-Jamāʿa) on this issue was that those who committed major sins may also be forgiven if God so willed, based on the Qurʾānic verse, ‘Indeed God does not forgive those who associate partners with Him (al-shirk) but He forgives that which is lesser than this for whomever He wills’ (4: 48). Al-Muḥāsibī also provides several other arguments as to why the position of al-Muʿtazila is untenable.

Each page of the manuscript contains 25 lines but there is no mention of the copier, the owner or the date of the manuscript. This edited work is a particularly valuable addition to the literature, as the editor provides an invaluable survey of the works of al-Muḥāsibī, an account of his person-ality, his affect on later writers and a discussion of al-Muḥāsibī’s concept of al-ʿIlm in this and his other works. See al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-ʿIlm, pp. 13–78; Sezgīn, Tārīkh al-Turāth al-ʿArabī, vol. 1, p. 117; Sezgīn, Tārīkh al-Turāth al-ʿArabī, vol. 1, p. 117; Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, pp. 86–7; Smith, An Early Mystic, p. 57; and Oscar Löfgron and Renato Traini, Catalogue of the Manuscripts in the Biblioteca Amrosi-ana, vol. 1 [Antico Fondo and Medio Fondo] (Milan: Neri Pozza Editore, 1958).122 Al-Muḥāsibī, however, does not criticise this knowledge for its own sake; in fact he considers it to be an exalted knowledge (ʿilm jalīl), which is required by everyone according to their need and in respect of which it is a compulsory duty of the com-munity as a whole (farḍʿalā ’l-kifāya) to learn and teach . His contention, therefore, is not with this knowledge as such but with the sole study of it to the exclusion of the other two types. See al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-ʿIlm, pp. 82–3.123 Al-Muḥāsibī stresses the importance of this form of knowledge to the extent that he considers it to be compulsory for every individual no matter what their state. See al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-ʿIlm, p. 86.124 Ibid., p. 81; Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, p. 86; and Smith, An Early Mystic, p. 57.125 This once again is indicative of the effect al-Muḥāsibī’s environment had upon him, as he was clearly affected by the juristic and theological debates which surrounded him and were prevalent at the time. Ever the guide, al-Muḥāsibī was clearly trying to defi ne the path of the aspiring student by advising him to avoid secondary matters and concentrate on the true goal.126 See al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-ʿIlm, pp. 82–92; Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, pp. 86–7; and Smith, An Early Mystic, p. 57.127 There are two published versions of this treatise, they are:1 A version edited by Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Qādir Aṭā and published by Dār al-Iʿtiṣām (Cairo), in 1986. In editing the text Aṭā has relied on the manuscript found in al-Azhar University, no. 1039, pp. 1–19. This manuscript is of very poor quality both in terms of the script and the mistakes of the copier, as well as being affected by dampness. The manuscript itself consists of 20 pages, with 17 lines to a page and 10 words to a line. In addition, Aṭā mentions a second manuscript in the private library of his father (ʿAbd al-Qādir Aḥmad Aṭā) but this copy is incomplete and therefore was only used for reference purposes. As for Aṭā’s work on the manuscript, he has followed the traditional route of producing a version with a minimum of annotation, provided footnotes explaining ambiguous terms, references the verses of the Qurʾān and ḥadīth and includes a brief introduction to the life and works of al-Muḥāsibī. See al-Muḥāsibī, Muʿātabat al-Nafs, ed. Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Qādir Aṭā (Cairo: Dār al-Iʿtiṣām, 1986), pp. 24–6; al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-ʿIlm, p. 34; Sezgīn, Tārīkh al-Turāth al-ʿArabī, vol. 1, p. 118; and al-Maktaba al-Azhariyya, Fihras al-Kutub al-Mawjūda bi ’l-Maktaba al-Azhariyya ilā 1366 (Cairo: al-Maktaba al-Azhariyya, n.d.), vol. 3, p. 632.2 A version edited by Muḥammad ʿĪsā Riḍwān being published by Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyya (Beirut), in 1986. This copy is included with the editor’s version of Kitāb al-Baʿth wa ’l-Nushūr mentioned above. Although Riḍwān makes no mention of which manuscripts he used, it can be assumed that he used the same sources, as the literature makes no mention of a second manuscript.

See al-Muḥāsibī, Muʿātabat al-Nafs, ed. Aṭā, pp. 43 and 65; and al-Muḥāsibī, Muʿātabat al-Nafs, ed. Riḍwān, pp. 49 and 63.132 There are two published copies of this work:1 The fi rst version has been edited by ʿAbd al-Qādir Aḥmad Aṭā. During the course of editing the text Aṭā has relied on what he terms, ‘The only surviving manuscript of this work’, which is in the Shahīd ʿAlī library (Turkey) and which has been copied to microfi lm by Maʿhad Iḥyāʾ al-Makhṭūṭāt al-ʿArabiyya (Cairo). Thus, Aṭā made his own copy of the original and edited the text from its ‘only source’. In addition, he includes references for the Quranic verses and Prophetic narrations, a comparison of this book to al-Muḥāsibī’s other works, includes the statements of other Muslim scholars and begins by giving an introduction on the importance of understanding the actions of the heart and its effect on the development of the Muslim individual. This particular edited version was also included within the editor’s version of al-Waṣāyā but without the introduction regarding ‘the actions of the heart’.2 The second edited version is by Ḥusayn al-Quwwatlī and published in the Lebanese journal al-Fikr al-Islāmī. The work was published over a series of months beginning with an introductory article in December 1983 and continuing until February 1985. In the editing of this work al-Quwwatlī mentions the following three manuscripts:(a) A manuscript found in the Carullah section of the Süleymaniye library in Istanbul under number 1728.(b) A copy of (a) found in the Erdine library.(c) A manuscript found in the Rabat library, in which al-Muḥāsibī’s work is interpolated with statements from al-Shādhilī (d. 656/1258) and consequently is unsuitable to be used in editing the fi nal work. It is interesting to note here that this edited version in far longer than that of Aṭā; in fact the point at which Aṭā’s version ends al-Quwwatlī continues with another two pages of text, this being in the November 1984 edition of al-Fikr al-Islāmī. Not only this but al-Quwwatlī continues for another three issues, i.e. December 1984, January 1985 and February 1985. In addition, it is clear from the February 1985 issue that al-Quwwatlī had not fi nished with al-Qaṣd wa ’l-Rujūʿ ilā Allāh in this issue either. Therefore, it is absolutely certain that the version edited by Aṭā is incomplete and that al-Quwwatlī had found additions in the manuscripts that he used to edit his version of the work. Having examined subsequent editions of al-Fikr al-Islāmī, al-Quwwatlī did not provide any further excerpts from al-Qaṣd wa ’l-Rujūʿ ilā Allāh and the reason for this is unknown. Similarly, Ateş mentions a further manuscript in the Orhan library in Bursa under number 637, being copied by Yaḥyā b. ʿUmar al-Hamadhānī on Saturday 12th Ramaḍān 740/12 March 1340. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-Qaṣd wa ’l-Rujūʿ ilā Allāh, ed. ʿAbd al-Qādir Aḥmad ʿAṭā (Cairo: Dār al-Turāth al-ʿArabī, 1980), pp. 26–7; al-Muḥāsibī, Risālat al-Mustarshidīn, ed.

There seems to be little doubt, however, that this work is al-Muḥāsibī’s as it begins with the statement: ‘The shaykh Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Ḥārith b. Asad al-Muḥāsibī, may God be satisfi ed with him, said . . .’. After a customary introduction praising God and sending peace and salutations upon His Messenger, he continues by saying, ‘These are questions regarding intimate knowledge (al-maʿrifa), knowledge of the path of the hereafter and the aim and the return to God the Exalted, as He wishes and from God comes [all] success, if He wills’ (see al-Muḥāsibī, al-Waṣāyā, pp. 219–21 and al-Muḥāsibī, al-Qaṣd wa ’l-Rujūʿ ilā Allāh, ed. Aṭā, pp. 31–3). In addition there seems little purpose in attributing a book to yourself, when if fact it contains the teachings of your instructor and therefore, this would also suggest that al-Muḥāsibī wrote this work. This does raise an important question, which is: why did al-Muḥāsibī include this work at all when it is not even his own work? What is clear is that al-Muḥāsibī was in complete agreement with what is being said, as otherwise he would have recorded this dialogue for posterity. In addition, this work, as Aṭā mentions above, contains a discussion of topics that are not included in his other works and therefore has a uniqueness of its own, which he would have wanted to preserve. Finally, this work, in addition to containing a number of important teachings, serves as a model for both the student and the teacher, in terms of behaviour and etiquette, as well as representing a ‘manual’ of spiritual aspiration.134 Al-Muḥāsibī, al-Waṣāyā, p. 52; and al-Muḥāsibī, al-Qaṣd wa ’l-Rujūʿ ilā Allāh, ed. Aṭā, p. 27.135 Ibid.136 It is interesting to note here the effect that this teaching had on al-Muḥāsibī, how it was manifested in his later works and how he himself developed it until it became his own unique methodology.137 Al-Muḥāsibī, al-Waṣāyā, p. 52; and al-Muḥāsibī, al-Qaṣd wa ’l-Rujūʿ ilā Allāh, ed. Aṭā, p. 27.138 This work was unknown in the academic community’s bibliographical works until the Turkish scholar Ahmed Ateş discovered it in a large collection of Sufi works in one of the libraries in Istāna and consequently published the details in the journal Oriens. As a result, the priest Aghnāṭiyūs ʿAbda Khalīfat al-Yasūʿī, edited this work and published it in Christian journal al-Mashriq. In addition, the researcher located a copy of this manuscript in microfi lm form in the King Fahd National Library in Riyadh but on consulting the library staff they were unsure as to its origin and tenta-tively suggested it may have been copied from Leiden. This would seem to make sense as behind the manuscript a section of Latin script was apparent. However, without further verifi cation it is impossible to say if this is another manuscript of al-Muḥāsibī’s al-Khalwa or simply a copy of the Turkish manuscript. Consequently, up until this point, as al-Yasūʿī states, this is the only known copy of this work (al-nuskha al-yatīma).

This once again shows how critical al-Muḥāsibī was of his society. See al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-Khalwa, ed. al-Yasūʿī, al-Mashriq( Kānūn al-Thānī/Shabāṭ, 1955), pp. 50–1.142 Ibid., pp. 51–4.143 Ibid.

Consequently, there is only one published version of this work, being edited by Muḥammad ʿĪsā Riḍwān and published by Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyya in 1986.155 See Smith, An Early Mystic, pp. 48–50.156 Maḥmūd is the most ardent supporter of this view and quotes the following reasons as to why he is certain that book is not the work of al-Muḥāsibī:1 Al-Muḥāsibī has already authored a brilliant work on the same subject, namely al-Tawahhum, and therefore it makes no sense that he would have written another work of a much poorer quality on the same topic.2 In his work al-Tawahhum al-Muḥāsibī deals with the events of the resurrection in an organised and sequential manner: fi rst, he deals with those who were disobedient to God, describing the manner of their account, recompense and ultimate punishment in hellfi re. He then turns his attention to describing the pleasure of those who preserved the rights of God and their joy at being entered into paradise. Finally, he takes the reader slowly to the fi nal scene of the hereafter, the divine vision of God, reserved exclusively for His beloved elite, which is the ultimate reward and pleasure of paradise. As for the book al-Baʿth wa ’l-Nushūr, the sequence of events differ entirely and in fact take place in an ‘unorganised’ and ‘illogical’ manner. The divine vision of God, for example, comes in the middle passages, taking the emphasis away entirely from the greatness of this ultimate reward.3 Finally, Maḥmūd considers this work ‘laughable’ due to the many superstitious stories quoted within it, thus making it impossible to be from the hand of al-Muḥāsibī. See Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, pp. 71–2. In addition to what has been mentioned by Maḥmūd, on reading al-Baʿth wa ’l-Nushūr one is struck by the complete lack of scholarly ability exhibited in this work. There are few facts based on classical Islamic theology in which, as has already been noted, al-Muḥāsibī was somewhat of an expert, having even written refutations on various theological points. Similarly, al-Muḥāsibī’s works, in particular works such as al-Tawahhum, display the penmanship of an accomplished author able to create and express ideas fl uently but once again the style of al-Baʿth wa ’l-Nushūr is particularly poor, so much so that one does not feel as though one is reading the work of such an accomplished scholar. In summary, this work can be excluded from the list of works written by al-Muḥāsibī, as it seems unlikely that it he wrote it.157 See al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-ʿIlm, p. 38: Sezgīn, Tārīkh al-Turāth al-ʿArabī, vol. 1, p. 119; Massignon, Essay, p. 163; and van Ess, Gedankenwelt, pp. 16–18.158 The term ‘Risāla’ is Smith’s whereas both Aṭā and Maḥmūd term this work Faṣl min Kitāb al-ʿAẓama.

However, Spies himself states that, after examination of the available sources, he was unable to fi nd a work by al-Muḥāsibī entitled Kitāb al-Ṣabr wa ’l-Riḍā. As a result Maḥmūd believes that the work in question did not originally have this title and was in fact called only Kitāb al-Riḍā. He concludes this on the basis that since the topic of riḍā would automatically concern the subject of ṣabr, then it makes sense that the title was changed as it is inconceivable that al-Muḥāsibī would author two such works with similar titles.

See Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, p. 74.211 See al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-ʿIlm, p. 36; and Smith, An Early Mystic, p. 58.212 See Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, p. 74; and Smith, An Early Mystic, p. 58.213 Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, p. 74.214 It is interesting to note here that there is a certain amount of doubt surrounding the authorship of this particular work as it is not at all in keeping with the general style and teachings of al-Muḥāsibī. This is compounded by the fact that this treatise is related by al-Junayd whose own thought tended to the mystical more than that of al-Muḥāsibī. In addition, al-Junayd also narrated from another major Sufi fi gure of the period, namely Abū ʿAlī Aḥmad b. ʿĀṣim al-Anṭākī (d. 220/835), who had a long relationship with al-Junayd and many researchers consider this work to belong him for the following reasons: fi rst, he was from al-Muḥāsibī’s peers and became well known, similar to al-Muḥāsibī, for his discussion of the heart, to such a degree that al-Dārānī (d. 215/830) termed him ‘the spy of the hearts’ (jāsūs al-qulūb) because of his sharp perception. Secondly, these extracts regarding the topic of divine love are tainted with strong philosophical overtone uncharacteristic of al-Muḥāsibī’s method, teaching and style, as he was staunchly against this form of ‘intoxicated’ mysticism, indicated by the quote from al-Hujwīrī in the previous chapter. The contention of those who support the idea that al-Muḥāsibī did write this work defend their opinion by saying that if al-Muḥāsibī’s name had not been associated with his book al-Tawahhum then no one would have attributed this work to him, as it is also uncharacteristic of his general style. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether al-Muḥāsibī wrote this work especially since its content is beyond the regular scope of his teachings.

See Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, p. 92.224 Maḥmūd also concludes that al-Muḥāsibī’s al-Makāsib is also from this period not only because of the depth of knowledge and insight displayed therein but also due to the fact that al-Muḥāsibī mentions the death of al-Maʾmūn, which occurred in 218/833, making al-Muḥāsibī at least 53 at the time. See Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, p. 95.225 In addition, a second conclusive proof confi rms this as al-Muḥāsibī mentions the death of Bābak, which occurred in 221/836, meaning that al-Muḥāsibī wrote this work having reached the age of at least 56. Al-Quwwatlī confers with Maḥmūd on this point and consequently they agree that the work is of a later phase in al-Muḥāsibī’s life. Quite surprisingly Mazālī refutes this view with various rather unconvincing arguments. See Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, pp. 89–91, 93–4 and 95–6; al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, p. 75; al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-ʿIlm, pp. 67–72.226 See Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, pp. 90–1, 92–3 and 96.227 See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, p. 63.228 This being the period in which the control of the state came to rest in the hands of al-Maʾmūn. How al-Quwwatlī defi nes this so precisely, however, is not at all clear. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, p. 63.229 Al-Quwwatlī justifi es this by quoting the fact that al-Muḥāsibī warns of the schisms which affect the Muslim community, this being directly representative of the events of the dispute between al-Amīn and al-Maʾmūn, as well as the theological sectarian-ism, which was also apparent at the time. Despite this, this author feels that Maḥmūd’s is closer to the truth, i. e. that al-Waṣāyā is from the latter stages of al-Muḥāsibī’s writing. This is for a number of reasons; fi rst, the fact that al-Muḥāsibī mentions the schisms that affected the Muslim community is not suffi cient proof that the work itself is from this period as the whole work has a retrospective feel, as if al-Muḥāsibī is looking back on a period which he had experienced fi rst hand. In addition, the nature of this work, i.e. that it is a set of counsels, indicates that this was wise advice from a person who had experienced the hardship of such times and that he was only too eager to guide those at the beginning of their path to discovery. Secondly, al-Waṣāyā is written in an eloquent style, indicating that it is the product of an accomplished author who was not at the beginning of his career nor in a ‘transi-tion period’. Similarly, al-Quwwatlī himself mentions that al-Muḥāsibī includes a large section discussing taking the soul to account (al-muḥāsaba) and the dispraisal of ostentation (al-riyāʾ), these being pillars of his spiritual teaching and consequently it is unlikely that al-Muḥāsibī would include such a detailed account of this aspect of his thought while he was still in a preliminary stage of his career. Thirdly, al-Quwwatlī also mentions that much of the writing produced by al-Muḥāsibī was the familiar ‘question and answer’ format whereas al-Waṣāyā does not manifest this method. Thus, even the style employed by the author is different in this work, further suggesting that it is not from this period. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, pp. 63–5 and 68.230 Al-Quwwatlī justifi es this by stating that the subject matter of al-Waṣāyā and Kitāb al-Khalwa wa ’l-Tanaqqul fī ’l-ʿIbāda wa Darajāt al-ʿĀbidīn are similar and therefore from a similar period. However, this is hardly a convincing argument as the style of both works differs considerably. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, p. 65.231 Once again al-Quwwatlī justifi es this by stating that the ‘spirit’ of Ādāb al-Nufūs is similar to that al-Waṣāyā and Kitāb al-Khalwa wa ’l-Tanaqqul fī ’l-ʿIbāda wa Darajāt al-ʿĀbidīn and therefore they are from a similar period. However, this is also not a convincing argument, as the depth shown in Ādāb al-Nufūs regarding the treatment of the soul is far greater generally than in either of the other two works. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, pp. 65–6."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"122 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam232 Again al-Quwwatlī justifi es this by stating that the ‘spirit’ of Risālat al-Mustarshidīn is similar to that of Ādāb al-Nufūs and therefore they are from a similar period. It is true that the subject matter of each work is similar in content but the manner and style of each work is completely different. As mentioned previously, Ādāb al-Nufūs is an in-depth discussion of human psychology, whereas Risālat al-Mustarshidīn is more of a brief manual on behavioural conduct and ethical character traits. In addition the Risālat al-Mustarshidīn is written in a concise, often poetic style. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, p. 66.233 Al-Quwwatlī suggests that al-Tawahhum is also from this period as it demonstrates al-Muḥāsibī’s tendency to the intellect (al-nazʿat al-ʿaqliyya), as do the other books in this period. However, this author differs with both al-Quwwatlī and Maḥmūd – who consider this to be from what he terms his ‘second period’. This is due to the fact this particular work is characterised by its eloquent and powerful style, which through its vivid imagery has a profound effect on the reader. This is obviously not the product of a writer at the beginning of his career but is indeed the result of many years of accomplished penmanship. In addition, it has already been mentioned that this work has a very personal style and is without doubt the product of his own refl ection on the journey through the hereafter. Consequently, it is also highly likely that al-Muḥāsibī produced this work near the end of his life, while himself preparing for death. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, pp. 66–8 and Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, pp. 95–6.234 See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, pp. 65–8.235 It seems somewhat paradoxical here that al-Quwwatlī chooses to begin this section where al-Muḥāsibī is supposed to move away from his tendency to the intellect (al-nazʿat al-ʿaqliyya) by including a work that is concerned entirely with the intel-lect (al-ʿaql). See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, p. 69.236 Al-Quwwatlī considers both of these works to be of the same period that Fahm al-Qurʾān was written as they have a similar subject matter in the sense that they discuss various aspects of faith which were points of dispute at the time. However, as Maḥmūd asserted previously, these works are typical of the subject matter and style of al-Muḥāsibī’s contemporaries in the same period and as such are not likely to have written at this later, more advanced stage. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, p. 69.237 It is even stranger that al-Quwwatlī would attribute this work to any period so pre-cisely since it has been lost and therefore is impossible to verify. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, pp. 70–2.238 Al-Quwwatlī suggests that these three works are also from a similar period due to the comparable nature of their subject matter. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, pp. 72–4.239 Both al-Quwwatlī and Maḥmūd agree on the fact that al-Muḥāsibī wrote this work at a relatively late stage of his career, which is apparent both from the style of the presentation and the treatment of the subject matter. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, pp. 74–5; and Maḥmūd, Ustādh al-Sāʾirīn, pp. 89–90 and 95.240 Even al-Quwwatlī himself recognises this concerning al-Muḥāsibī but seems not to take this into account when discussing the chronological sequence of al-Muḥāsibī’s works. See al-Muḥāsibī, al-ʿAql wa Fahm al-Qurʾān, p. 62.241 In fact this information only benefi ts us if the student is mentioned, as in this case we can therefore assume such a work was written in a ‘teaching period’ and not in an initial phase of al-Muḥāsibī’s life.242 This is not taking into account the possibility of some of the manuscripts being multiple copies."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"4 Purifi cation of the soulThe concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in IslamAs the title suggests, this book aims to explore the concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam so as to draw a comparison between it and the teachings of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī. To achieve this aim the chapter will be divided into the following sections: fi rst, an examination of the meaning of the words tazkiya and nafs etymologically, within the Arabic language, by referring to classical and contem-porary lexical sources to arrive at a basic linguistic understanding for these terms. Secondly, an in-depth study of these two terms as found in the Qurʾān, being the primary source of Islamic thought and Law, by locating these words within their various Qurʾānic contexts and examining them in the light of the exegetical litera-ture (tafāsīr). Having derived a meaning for these two terms in the Qurʾānic context, the author will then turn the reader’s attention to the second source of Islamic thought and Law, i.e. the ḥadīth, by consulting the foremost collections of ḥadīth and their explanatory companion texts (shurūḥ) to arrive at an understand-ing of how these words were used by the Prophet, his Companions and the early generations who followed them. The fi nal section will deal with the statements of the scholars of Islam (al-ʿulamāʾ) throughout history, by consulting them in their various source works to examine their understanding of tazkiyat al-nafs, in the light of what was discussed in the previous sections.The concept of the terms tazkiya and nafs within the Arabic languageAlthough we wish to examine the concept of the compound phrase tazkiyat al-nafs as a whole, it suits our purpose here to treat each term separately and then attempt to derive an overall understanding of the phrase. Consequently, the term tazkiya will be dealt with fi rst and the term nafs will be dealt with thereafter. The term tazkiya is a verbal noun (maṣdar) of the form II verbal conjugation zakkā, the root of this verb being Zay Kāf Yā. On examining the lexical sources it is not surprising that this form of the verb is intrinsically linked to form I of the verb zakā and, as such, the discussion of the connotations of tazkiya will begin here. The essential meanings of this form of the verb are to grow and fl ourish (namā), or increase and augment (zād), or enjoy the blessing and abundance of God (tanʿʿama) but can also mean to reform (ṣalaḥa) if used in conjunction with a person. In addition,"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"124 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamit is also worth noting that the adjective derived form the verb zakiyyun (pl. azkiyāʾ) means righteous or pious and is synonymous with taqiyyun (pl. atqiyāʾ).1 As for the form II of the verb zakkā, it possesses the meanings alluded to above but the emphasis of the action is different, in the sense that the form II verb indicates a causal effect; for example zakkā does not just mean to grow, increase and reform but means to cause to grow, increase and be reformed. In addition, another of the essential meanings of the form of the verb is to be purifi ed (ṭahhara – [hu]) and is used in conjunction with himself (zakkā nafsahu) to indicate self-praise.2 This concept of ‘praise’ is also extended to other contexts where the term tazkiya is used, for example in the legal context, when tazkiya is used in conjunction with witnesses (shuhūd); it would indicate their suitability to perform this task in a court of law. Similarly, this concept of suitability is also seen when the term tazkiya is used in con-nection with a candidate for a particular post, as tazkiya here would mean ‘recom-mendation’.3 Perhaps the most familiar derivative, however, from the root Zay Kāf Yā in the Islamic context, is the term zakāt, this being the third ‘pillar’ of the Islamic faith and, indeed, when the form II verb is used in conjunction with a person’s wealth (mālahu) it means to pay the appropriate amount of zakāt which is due.4 As for the term nafs, it is a noun derived from the root Nūn Fā Shīn and is dis-tinguished by the second letter, i.e. Fā, having the sukūn vowel marking. The word nafs (pl. anfus/nufūs) is unusual in the sense that it has a variety of connotations. In this sense a survey of all the meanings of this noun will be made so as to provide the reader with a glimpse of the variety that this term provides. Thus, on examining the lexical sources regarding the word nafs, we fi nd the following usages.1. The soul (al-rūḥ)There seems to be a consensus in the sources consulted regarding this usage of nafs, as all of them allude to this meaning: the Arabs are known to say, ‘His soul left [his body]’ (kharajat nafsuhu). In fact, there seems to be an implicit under-standing that the terms nafs and ‘rūḥ’ are synonyms for the English equivalent of ‘the soul’. Despite this, however, as will become clear from the discussion below, some authors indicate that they are not synonymous with one another. In addition, it is worth mentioning that rūḥ is viewed as a masculine noun whereas nafs is regarded as being feminine.52. Blood (al-damm)Similarly, there seems to be a consensus in the sources regarding this usage of nafs, as all of them allude to this meaning, as the Arabs are known to say, ‘His blood ran’ (sālat nafsuhu).6 The implication of this, however, is far deeper than one might expect, because the ‘blood’ here signifi es the ‘life-blood’ of a living being, since it is blood that facilitates life through its passage along the arteries and veins. The link between this usage and the previous one is also not diffi cult to establish, since if one’s blood fl owed to such an extent that one’s life were threatened, then the soul would also follow it upon death.7"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 1253. Life (al-ḥayāt) and 4. The intellect (al-ʿaql)This is based on the statement which was related from the Prophetic Companion ʿAbd Allāh b. al-ʿAbbās (d. c. 67–8/686–8), who is reported to have said, ‘Every human being has two nafs; the fi rst of them is the nafs of the intellect (al-ʿaql), with which he discriminates and the other is the nafs of the soul (al-rūḥ) through which life exists’. The rationale behind this comment can be understood in the following way: when a person sleeps, the fi rst type of nafs, i.e. the intellect, is said to be taken by God and, as such, a person loses consciousness during sleep. Such a person may be unconscious but is still alive as the soul (al-rūḥ), which imbues him with life, is still intact and this person will not die until the soul is actually taken at death.8 Once again the link between the concepts expressed here and those proposed in the fi rst two meanings are not incredibly dissimilar and they accommodate each other quite easily.95. The selfThis is used as a refl exive pronoun in the same way that it is used in English to mean ‘myself’, ‘yourself’, ‘ourselves’, etc., as the Arabs use it in much the same way. For example, they would say, ‘He talked to himself’ (ḥaddatha nafsahu), or ‘He killed himself’ (qatala nafsahu) and ‘He caused himself to fall into destruction’ (ahlaka nafsahu).106. The essence (al-dhāt) and 7. The body (al-jasad)These two meanings are supported by examples in the Arabic language but do not transfer very well into English; for example, if we examine the concept of ‘essence’ (al-dhāt), the Arabs would say, Nafs al-jabal muqābilī (lit. ‘the essence of the mountain is in front of me’) and with regard to a person they would say, Raʾaytu fulānan nafsahu (lit. ‘I saw so and so [himself]’). As for the term nafs meaning the body (al-jasad), many sources quote this term but give no examples as to how it is used linguistically.118. The human being (al-insān)The word nafs may also be used to mean a human being as a whole (al-shakhṣ) as the Arabs would say, ‘I have three people with me’ (ʿindī thalātha anfus). It is also worth mentioning that when it is used this way many scholars consider it to take a masculine form.129. Manners/endurance/generosity (khuluq / jalāda/sakhāʾ)13In this instance the term nafs is used as an adjective to describe a person positively as the Arabs would describe a man as being rajulun dhū nafs, i.e. as having manners (khuluq), endurance (jalāda) and generosity (sakhāʾ).14"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"126 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam10. An evil eye (al-ʿayn)This usage of the word indicates that nafs is a synonym for the term ʿayn meaning an evil or envious eye, as the Arabs are known to say, aṣābat-hu nafsun, meaning ‘he has been affected by an evil eye’. In fact the source of the evil eye (al-ʿāʾin) is also termed al-nāfi s, the person affected by the evil eye (al-maʿyūn) is termed al-manfūs and the evil eyes themselves (al-ʿuyūn), which affect the wealth and possessions of people and so on, are known as al-nufūs, all of which are derived from the same root.1511. Punishment (al-ʿuqūba)This particular meaning of nafs is arrived from the discussion of two particular Qurʾānic verses, namely (3: 28) and (3: 30), where the phrase, Wa yuḥadhdhirukum Allāh nafsahu (‘And God warns you concerning His nafs’), is repeated and since this usage does not fi t with the usual usages discussed in this section, scholars allude to the concept of nafs here to mean punishment (al-ʿuqūba) and thus, the verse would read, ‘And God warns you concerning His punishment’.1612. Brother (al-akh)Similarly, this usage is narrated in the lexical sources to describe another Qurʾānic verse, namely (24: 61), where the phrase, Fa idhā dakhaltum buyūtan fa sallimū ʿalā anfusikum (‘And if you enter houses then greet anfusikum’), the literal meaning of which is ‘yourselves’ and in which case the verse would read, ‘And if you enter houses then greet yourselves’. Consequently, the verse seems to make little sense and therefore scholars have mentioned that the meaning is not literal here; thus, the suggested meaning of anfusikum here is ‘your brothers’, in which case the verse would read, ‘And if you enter houses then greet your brothers’.1713. Meaning ‘with’ (ʿinda) and 14. The unseen (al-ghayb)These meanings of the term nafs are also derived from a Qurʾānic verse, namely (5: 116), where the story of Jesus (ʿĪsā) is related, and the phrase, Taʿlamu mā fī nafsī wa lā aʿlamu mā fī nafsik (‘You know what is in my nafs but I do not know what is in Your nafs’), is found. As a result the interpretations regarding the meaning of nafs here have attempted to accommodate a usage consistent with the divine attributes of God and at the same time render an appropriate meaning. One of the suggestions made is that the meaning of nafs’in the verse is ‘with’ (ʿinda) and thus, the rendering of the verse would be, ‘You know what is with me (ʿindī) but I do not know what is with You (ʿindak)’. Similarly, another proposed meaning is that the term nafs here means the unseen, the hidden or that which is concealed (al-ghayb) and thus the understanding of the verse would be, ‘You know what I have concealed (ghaybī) but I do not know what You have concealed (al-ghayb)’.18 Another option was supplied by al-Fayrūzābādī (d. 817/1414), who suggests that"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 127nafs also implies the meaning of reality (al-ḥaqīqa) and thus he considers the meaning of the verse to be, ‘You know what the reality of me is (ḥaqīqatī) but I do not know what the reality of You is (ḥaqīqatak)’.1915. Majesty/might/zeal/pride (al-ʿaẓama/al-ʿizza/al-himma / al-anafa)20Al-Fayrūzābādī, Ibn Manẓūr and Lane all allude to these meanings of al-nafs but give little further qualifi cation, making it diffi cult to assess the usage of such terms in the Arabic language.2116. An amount of tanning material (qadr dabgha)This is perhaps the most surprising usage of the term but nevertheless the lexical sources regularly mention that the word nafs was used by the Arabs to denote a quantity of tanning material used for the tanning of hides and that the measure would be approximately a handful (milʾ al-kaff).22 Since the classical works of Islam are presented in the Arabic language, the goal here was to survey the lexical sources dealing with this language to arrive at an understanding that will provide the groundwork for subsequent discussions. This being the case, both the terms tazkiya and nafs were dealt with separately so as to survey the various meaning, usages and connotations that these words have within the Arabic language. The discussion has no doubt produced a variety of information, which in some cases may have been somewhat surprising. On examining the term tazkiya, it is clear that the usages of this word related to the payment of zakāt and self-praise/recommendation are of little worth to the current discussion, as their relevance is limited. Similarly, the form I verb con-struction gives little more than an indication of the meanings, which are appropri-ate to the subject matter as a whole. Not surprisingly it was the form II verb construction – of which tazkiya is a verbal noun (maṣdar) – that provided the most useful results. The meaning of purifi cation (ṭahhara) was very much expected as this is the most common phrase used by authors when discussing this topic. However, other, less expected meanings were also observed; these included to grow and fl ourish (namā), or increase and augment (zād), or enjoy the blessing and abundance of God (tanʿʿama) but can also mean to reform (ṣalaḥa), all of which indicate an overall process of development, which could be termed ‘purifi cation’ in the broad sense. As for the term nafs, the task has proved far more complex, as the usage of this word in the Arabic language seems to have a variety of meanings, many of which are not consistent with the topic of discussion here. Examples of this include: blood (al-damm), life (al-ḥayāt), manners/endurance/generosity (khuluq/ jalāda/sakhāʾ), an evil eye (al-ʿayn), punishment (al-ʿuqūba), brother (al-akh), ‘with’ (ʿinda), the unseen (al-ghayb), majesty/might/zeal/pride (al-ʿaẓama/al-ʿizza/al-himma/al-anafa) and an amount of tanning material (qadr dabgha). In contrast, however, the remaining usages may all have some signifi cance regarding the subject matter and as a result the terms ‘the soul’ (al-rūḥ), ‘the intellect’ (al-ʿaql),"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"128 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam‘the self’, ‘the essence’ (al-dhāt), ‘the body’ (al-jasad) and ‘the human being’ (al-insān) all require further qualifi cation. Thus, although at a very superfi cial level, the above discussion would suggest that the term tazkiyat al-nafs, from the perspective of the Arabic language at least, would indicate the growth, augmentation, reform and development of a human being’s soul, intellect, body and self. This, however, is the result of consulting the lexical sources of only the Arabic language and therefore it remains vital to examine this term in the light of Islam, which is the task of the next section, by referring to Islam’s primary source – the Qurʾān.The concept of the terms tazkiya and nafs within the QurʾānThere can be no doubt that the above-mentioned discussion has been enlightening but it is not suffi cient, however, as the goal of the current work is to examine such terms in the context of Islam as a whole. Thus, the next logical step is to examine these terms within the Qurʾān, as this is regarded by Muslims throughout the ages to be the direct, revealed word of God, in both word and meaning and, as such, is Islam’s primary source of thought and Law.23 Consequently, each of these terms will be examined individually to come to an understanding of the meanings within the Qurʾān, so as to shed light on their implications within a religious context.24 From the Qurʾānic perspective it is God who created the human being and his nafs, as the following Qurʾānic verse states: ‘O Mankind, fear your Lord Who created you from a single nafs . . .’25 (4: 1).26 Consequently, it may be argued that it stands to reason that the Creator of such a nafs would not only allude to its nature but also to the way in which tazkiya of it may be carried out. Thus, on examining the Qurʾān for the verb forms of the root z-k-y we fi nd numerous usages and derivatives. However, since the term tazkiya is a verbal noun of the form II verb, the emphasis in this section will focus on this usage.27 Perusal of the Qurʾānic text results in 12 instances of the form II verb being found in both its past and present tenses. The connotation of self-praise, when the verb is used in conjunction with the term nafs or its plurals alluded to in the previous section, can be located in two of these verses, namely (4: 49) and (53: 32), both being used in the present tense and indicating a blameworthy character trait.28 Another four verses containing the verb can be seen where God is the subject of the verb; in other words it is God who directly takes on the role of tazkiya of the human being. Two of these verses (4: 49) and (24: 21) indicate that it is God who decides who is worthy of tazkiya as in both verses the phrase ‘God purifi es (yuzakkī) whomever He wills’ is found, which is extremely signifi cant from a Qurʾānic perspective, as it indicates that not only is it God Who decides who will be purifi ed but it is He Who is the source of the tazkiya. In addition, this process of tazkiya is not arbitrarily decided but due to the need that the divine attribute of justice (al-ʿadl) be fulfi lled; the verses end, ‘. . . and God is not unjust in the slight-est’29 (4: 49) and, ‘. . . and God is the All Hearing, the All Knowing’ (24: 21). In the second two verses (2: 174) and (3: 77) where God is the subject, the context is the Day of Judgement and describes the state of the disbelievers. These verses"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 129indicate that God will neither address them (yukallimuhum) nor ‘purify’ them (yuzakkīhim) by forgiving them their transgressions and thus admitting them into Paradise. Once again the emphasis here is on the fact that in any eventuality it is God alone who is the source of tazkiya.30 In addition, another four verses can be observed where the subject of the verb is a divinely chosen emissary (rasūl). The sequence of verses begins in sūrat al-Baqara (second chapter of the Qur’an) with the supplication of the Prophet Ibrāhīm (2: 129) where he says, ‘O my Lord send them a messenger from them-selves who will recite to them Your signs (āyātika), who will teach them the book (al-kitāb) and wisdom (al-ḥikma) and who will purify them (wa yuzakkīhim)’. From the Islamic perspective this supplication was fulfi lled with the sanctioning of the mission of the prophet Muḥammad, as in the very same sūra (2: 151) we read, ‘Similarly, We sent among you a messenger from yourselves, who recites to you Our signs, purifi es you, teaches you the Book and wisdom and teaches you what you did not know’. In latter parts of the Qurʾānic text (3: 164) and (62: 2) we see that this concept is further reinforced as almost identical verses are found.31 In addition, there is also an indication as to how exactly the Prophet should ‘purify’ those around him in verse (9: 103), where we fi nd God addressing the Prophet saying, ‘Take a charity from their wealth to cleanse them (tuṭahhiruhum) and purify them (yuzakkīhim) . . .’. Thus, in this series of verses containing the verb yuzakkī we see that from a Qurʾānic perspective, although the source of tazkiya is God, He facilitates the process of tazkiya by the sending of Prophets, whose role is to instruct humanity as to how to perform the task of tazkiya, by various means, one of which is the giving of one’s wealth for God’s sake.32 The fi nal instance of the verb occurs in (91: 9) and is the only occurrence of this verb being used in conjunction with the term nafs; thus it is the most sig-nifi cant verse with regard to the current research and, as such, will be discussed in the next section, after the appraisal of the term nafs in the Qurʾān has been concluded. As was mentioned previously, from the Islamic perspective the nafs of the human being is believed to have been created by God and since the Qurʾān is also believed to be the fi nal revelation to humanity from Him, one might expect to fi nd various references to the nature and origin of the nafs in it. In fact, the term nafs and its derivatives occur in the Qurʾān 398 times,33 which provides the researcher with a vast wealth of material but it is also worth mentioning that most of these occurrences are usage of the refl exive pronoun and therefore are of little actual use in the current context. Despite this, there are numerous verses that are of sig-nifi cance when discussing the nafs from the Qurʾānic perspective. The following usages may be observed.a. The nafs meaning the soul (al-rūḥ)This is evidenced via the description of the souls being extracted from the body at death by the angels, who rip the souls of disbelievers from their bodies, ultimately causing their demise. The verse in question is (6: 93) where the angels are said to"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"130 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamstretch forth their hands to grip the souls and drag them outwards, the souls them-selves being termed, anfusikum.34b. The nafs meaning the human being (al-insān)Once again the Qurʾān, as one might expect, makes reference to the nafs with the meaning of the human being as a whole, including both the body and the soul. One of the verses which identifi es this usage is (31: 27) in which the creation and resurrection of human beings is discussed and is described as being easy for God, as if it were only the creation/resurrection of a single person (nafsun wāḥida).35c. The nafs meaning the human being’s power of understanding (al-quwā al-mufakkira)By this it is meant that the human being has the ability to comprehend and reason using his intellect to arrive at and perceive certain ideas and concepts. Not only this, but the Qurʾān has also clarifi ed that the human being may comprehend an idea until it becomes fi xed in his mind to the extent that he reaches a level of cer-tainty regarding the reality of this concept and it appears as fact, as far as he is concerned. The verse in question is (27: 14), where this level of certainty is described as having been reached and, in addition, is attributed to the nafs (wa istayqanat-hā anfusuhum).36d. The nafs meaning the heart (al-qalb)In addition to the intellectual implication of the term nafs in the Qurʾān, there is also an implication that an emotional aspect also exists. Verses that imply such a meaning include (7: 205) and (10: 77), where both the attributes of remembrance (al-dhikr) and concealing a secret (al-sirr) are described as being actions of the nafs. It is also worth noting that both these qualities are considered actions of the heart (al-qalb) and therefore such verses indicate an intrinsic and fundamental link between the heart and the nafs.37e. The nafs meaning the inclination to good and evil (quwā al-khayr wa ’l-sharr)The duality of the nafs to incline towards good and evil as described in the Qurʾān and its tendency to change between the two is one of its outstanding characteris-tics. Various verses indicate this including (50: 16), (75: 2) and (79: 40–1)38 and, due to the importance of such qualities, they will be discussed in detail in the following sections. From this discussion it is clear, as one might expect, that the Qurʾān uses the term nafs in a number of usages which, despite being identical or similar to the meanings alluded to in the section regarding the Arabic language, also have their own implica-tion within the Qurʾānic context.39 In addition to the general description of the nafs"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 131in the Qurʾān, there are also two main areas that become apparent on examining the Qurʾānic text: fi rst, qualities that the nafs itself manifests to which various verses allude and secondly, verses which describe the various states that the nafs experi-ences. This being the case, the following sections will attempt to shed light upon these phenomena in the Qurʾān.Qualities of the nafs within the QurʾānThe basis for this discussion lies in the information alluded to in verse (91: 7–8), which reads, ‘And [by] the soul (nafs) and the One Who proportioned it; then He inspired it [to discern between] its iniquity and its righteousness’. From this verse several issues become clear; fi rst, that once again we fi nd an inclination to the fact that, from a Qurʾānic perspective, it is God Who not only created the soul but also fashioned it as He willed. Secondly, part of this fashioning was to inspire the soul to know, put very simply, that which is ‘right’ and that which is ‘wrong’. As such, this ability to comprehend the difference between virtue and sin also implies the faculty of ‘free will’ to choose between the two and consequently, makes the nafs accountable for its actions in both this life and the next. In addition, this may also indicate that the nafs inclines to certain characteristic behaviours, which manifest themselves and are not only an indication of the soul’s inner state but also a manifestation of an individual’s humanity as a whole. As a result the following qualities of the nafs can be identifi ed and observed in the Qurʾān.a. It is the nafs that experiences deathAs has been mentioned, from the Islamic perspective, it is God Who created the human soul or nafs and consequently it is He who gives life to it also. Life is fi rst given to the human being when it comes into existence, where it undergoes a phase of trial to test which of them is best in action.40 Then death will be brought to the human being and the soul enters another sphere of existence (al-barzakh) where it remains for a considerable period, until it is resurrected and where it will return to its Lord, to be recompensed for its actions. Therefore, every soul will experience death to which a number of Qurʾānic verses make reference, namely (3: 185), (21: 35) and (29: 57) where the phrase, ‘Every soul will “taste” [lit.] death (kullu nafsin dhāʾiqat al-mawt)’ is reiterated.41 Also, in the same way that bringing life to the nafs is as a result of divine will, then similarly the causing of death is also by divine will (3: 145). In addition, the lifespan of the nafs (al-ajal) is also predetermined by God, Who will neither delay its term nor bring it forward (63: 11).b. The nafs has perceptive facultiesIn addition, the Qurʾān also indicates a number of sensations, feelings and emo-tions that the nafs perceives, is conscious of and which can be discerned. A survey of these is given below:"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"132 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islami. Desires (al-hawā); ii. Appetites (al-shahwa); iii. Needs (al-ḥājāt/al-maṭālib)The Quran confi rms for us that the nafs can be described as having desires (al-hawā) which are denoted in verses (79: 40–1). The hawā in turn act as emotions that drive it to fulfi l its needs (al-ḥājāt/al-maṭālib), which are indicated in (12:68). Moreover, such ḥājāt cause the human being to seek the fulfi lment of the soul’s pleasures and appetites (al-shahwa) which, in most cases, are harmful and destruc-tive for it in this world, but are part of the pleasures of paradise as in verse (21: 102).42iv. Diffi culty and hardship (al-mashaqqa)In addition the nafs is given to preferring ease over hardship and, as such, it dis-likes to be burdened with what it considers diffi cult tasks. Indeed, the soul can be burdened with hardship, which it fi nds diffi cult and which requires a great deal of effort from it, as implied by verse (16: 7).v. Endurance (al-ṣabr) and impatience43The nafs has the ability to endure hardship and be patient, persevering in adversity but its more common reaction is to be impatient with the events that befall it. The Prophet, despite his elevated status, is also encouraged to be patient, as the following verse (18: 28) suggests.vi. Generosity (al-jūd) and miserliness (al-shuḥḥ)Again the Qurʾānic text indicates the presence of the quality of miserliness (al-shuḥḥ) within the human nafs, suggesting that this is one of its overwhelming qualities, as it is commonly found in many souls. However, on the contrary, the Qurʾān also not only criticises this unenviable characteristic but also encourages its eradication and, in fact, extols the virtue of generosity (al-jūd), which is its direct opposite, suggesting that one replace the other entirely.44vii. Envy and jealousy (al-ḥasad)Another of the most blameworthy characteristics in the Qurʾānic context is that of envy and jealousy (al-ḥasad) and therefore it is not surprising that the Qurʾān would be critical of such a quality. In addition, however, this is not only regarded as being reprehensible but is also described as emanating from the nafs and, as such, it also has the potentiality of not being characterised by this negative descrip-tion but by positive counter qualities.45"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 133viii. Fear (al-khawf )Fear or apprehension (al-khawf) is a common psychological state which may be induced by a variety of stimuli and as such it is hardly surprising that the Qurʾān describes it as being a potential characteristic of the nafs. Similarly, the nafs has an equal potential to display directly opposing qualities such as bravery and self-confi dence.46ix. Conceit (al-kibr)Pride, arrogance and conceit (al-kibr) are all qualities that the Qurʾān states are present in the nafs and, similarly, the potential to attain modesty, humility and humbleness is also possible, if the negative characteristics are eradicated. However, as with many qualities of the nafs, arrogance and conceit (al-kibr) are commonly manifest in the majority of souls.47x. Anxiety (al-ḍīq) and distress (al-ḥaraj)Other psychological states, which result from personal discomfort, are anxiety (al-ḍīq) and distress (al-ḥaraj). Once again the Qurʾān counts these from being among the qualities with which the nafs is characterised and in the same way it can also be nurtured to adopt the contrary qualities of being relaxed (al-ittisāʿ) and tranquillity (al-inshirāḥ).48xi. Affected by eloquent speech (al-taʾaththur bi ’l-qawl al-balīgh)The Qurʾān also confi rms that the nafs may be affected by eloquent speech to the extent that the behaviour of a human being may be reformed due to it. As such, through being addressed with an eloquent, oratory or written style, the nafs may receive admonition and thus return to the truth.49xii. Regret (al-nadm) and grief (al-taḥassur)As well as psychological states, the nafs also experiences emotions and the Qurʾān implies this in a number of verses. Of these, the feeling of regret and grief over matters which may appear to be lost are mentioned in the Qurʾān. For example, in verse (35: 8) God informs His Prophet not to grieve over or feel regretful regard-ing the actions of his people in Mecca. Similarly, such feelings are also expressed in verse (39: 56), where the situation on the Day of Judgement is described and the nafs will regret and grieve over its defi ciencies regarding its duty to its Lord.xiii. The ability to comprehend (al-idrāk)As mentioned earlier, the Qurʾān, in verse (27: 14), has also clarifi ed that the human being may comprehend an idea until it becomes fi xed in his mind to the"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"134 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamextent that he reaches a level of certainty regarding the reality of this concept. Similarly, the ability of the nafs to completely comprehend may be impaired due to its consideration of baseless conjecture (al-ẓann), causing doubts and worries to fl ourish, as is found in verse (3: 154). As such, it could be argued that all other levels of understanding with regard to the nafs would fall between these two extremes. In addition, from the Islamic perspective, God as the Creator of all mankind has endowed every one of them with the ability to perceive and compre-hend righteousness (al-taqwā) and immorality (al-fujūr), or put very simply – the difference between good and evil. As such, every nafs is aware of its actions and is conversant with the nature of such actions, as a number of verses indicate.50 In the same way that the nafs can come to ‘know’ certain information, it may also be heedless or ignorant of other matters. Indeed, from a Qurʾānic perspective, the nafs is completely unaware of the unseen (al-ghayb), including the true nature of the hereafter, how it will act in the future and where its demise will be, as verses (31: 34) and (32: 15–17) indicate.xiv. The ability to conceal feelingsAs was mentioned earlier, the nafs manifests certain emotions but at the same time it also has the ability to conceal and hide its true feelings. Despite this, however, one of the major concepts progressed in the Qurʾān is that God is fully acquainted with even these concealed thoughts, emotions, ideas and feelings.51xv. ResponsibilityBearing in mind the various abilities described above that the nafs has been granted, including emotional, perceptive and intellectual faculties, as well as the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, the nafs is consequently responsible for its actions within the realms of its capabilities. As such every nafs has the ability to act and earn or acquire good deeds and bad deeds, based on its intentions, personal efforts, determination and free will. This responsibility is unique to each individual and, as such, every human being is personally responsible for their actions. Conse-quently, each person will be recompensed accordingly on the Day of Judgement, their ultimate abode being determined by their actions in this life.52States of the nafs within the QurʾānIn addition to the above-mentioned qualities of the nafs as expounded in the Qurʾān, there are a number of categories or states that the nafs experiences, which the Qurʾān has also elucidated. Each individual experiences these states as a result of their intentions, thoughts, motives, deeds and will, and consequently it is appropriate at this juncture to shed light on these states of the nafs. On examining the Qurʾānic text the reader fi nds three types of nafs described."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 135a. The soul inclined to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ)53This state of the nafs occurs when the human being is overcome by his desires, to the extent that he pursues the appetites of his soul, to the exclusion of everything else. As such the limits set by God are made secondary in comparison to the fulfi l-ment of his own needs and desires. Thus, the performance of forbidden acts is common and the ultimate result of this state is sin and transgression. The essence of this notion is evidenced in the following verse: ‘I do not absolve own self [of blame], as indeed, the [human] soul is prone to evil (inna ’l-nafs la ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ), except when my Lord bestows mercy, as indeed my Lord is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful’ (12: 53).54 This verse alludes to the lowest level of the human soul, which not only encour-ages the performance of evil but also exerts effort to make such actions acceptable and appealing. Thus, the nafs is described as enticing (sawwalat), subjecting (ṭawwaʿat) and tempting (tuwaswis) in verses (20: 96), (12: 18), (5: 30) and (50: 16) respectively. Therefore, it is not surprising that the exaggerative form ammāra is used to describe the nafs, as it literally means ‘constantly urging, always demanding, inciting and instigating’,55 as if this type of nafs is always command-ing the evil and the base. As such, al-Jurjāni (d. 816/1413) defi ned the al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ as follows: ‘It is the one [nafs] that inclines to the bodily nature, ordering [the pursuit of] physical pleasures and appetites, attracting the heart to base levels; as such, it is the abode of every evil and the source of blame-worthy characteristics’.56 In addition, this verse also implies that from the Islamic perspective it is from God’s mercy alone that this state of the nafs does not exist permanently, as this is its natural and regular state if left to its own devices and is not refi ned. As such, it is only from God’s benefi cence that the other states of the nafs, via repentance and turning away from the soul’s desires, become manifest in the human being. Also, on examining and contrasting these qualities of the nafs as described in the Qurʾān, one fi nds a direct comparison between such attributes and those used to describe Satan (al-shayṭān). In fact the Devil (Iblīs) has been characterised as enticing (sawwala), tempting (waswās) and misguiding (yuḍill) in verses (47: 25), (114: 3–4), (5: 30) and (4: 60) respectively. Thus, there is a clear and intrinsic link and relationship between the behaviour of the nafs and the role of Satan in infl uencing this behaviour. It would seem that the Devil entices and suggests actions and thoughts to the nafs, whereas the nafs itself, due to its self-serving outlook, pursues such deeds satisfying the conscience by making them seemingly acceptable and appealing. To this effect, Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyya (d. 751/1350) comments:As for the soul inclined to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ), Satan is its associate and companion; he makes promises to it and awakens its desires, casting falsehood into it, commanding it to evil and making it appear appeal-ing in a form that it will fi nd acceptable and condone, with a variety of pro-visions and falsehood, false hopes and destructive appetites. He seeks aid against it with its desires and wishes and through him every evil enters it.57"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"136 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamb. The self-reproaching soul (al-nafs al-lawwāma)This is the next level of the nafs, where it is elevated from the previous base state, so that the veil of disobedience is lifted and the soul begins to blame itself for the transgression it has committed, inclining towards repentance, regret, self-recrimi-nation and reproach. These implications are gleaned from the following Qurʾānic verse (75: 1–2): ‘Do not swear [an oath] by the Day of Judgement nor by the self-reproaching soul (al-nafs al-lawwāma)’. This verse is clear evidence of a second state of the soul, i.e. the soul being described as being self-reproaching or lawwāma. However, this particular adjective describing the soul has been the focus of discus-sion for numerous Muslim scholars, leading them to a variety of opinions. The fi rst of these views suggests that this term is derived from the Arabic verbal noun al-talawwum meaning ‘shifting repeatedly’ and being synonymous with al-taraddud. This state of the soul is characterised by its changeability, fi ck-leness, capriciousness and inconsistency, never truly remaining steadfast upon one state. Consequently, in this state, the soul is mindful then heedless, loves then hates, is happy then sad, is obedient then disobedient, righteous then immoral, as well as many other qualities and a variety of levels of each characteristic in between, changing from one state to another, never truly reaching equilibrium.58 The second view considers this to be derived from the term lawm meaning ‘blame’, the implication being that the soul blames itself or alternatively is blame-worthy. Consequently, the opinions regarding this derivation of lawwāma also vary. The fi rst of these is that the above-mentioned verse refers to the description of the soul of a believer (al-muʾmin). This opinion was common among the early Muslim scholars, as it is reported that al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī (d. 110/728) said regard-ing this verse, ‘By God, we do not see the believer except that he blames himself; [asking himself] “What did I intend by my speech? What did I intend by my eating? What did I intend by my thoughts?”, whereas the shameless reprobate (al-fājir) continues step by step, not sanctioning his soul’. Similarly, when Mujāhid b. Jabr (d. 104/722), the famous exegete (al-mufassir), was asked regard-ing the same verse he replied, ‘This is the soul that blames itself for what has passed and feels regret; it blames itself for the evil it has committed, as to why it did it and with regard to doing good, as to why it did not do more’.59 In a different view, al-nafs al-lawwāma is considered to refer to both the sinner and the righteous person in the sense that the righteous person blames his soul for the committing of a sin or the neglect of an act of obedience. As such, al-Jurjāni (d. 816/1413) defi ned al-nafs al-lawwāma as follows: ‘It is the one [al-nafs] that is illuminated with the light of the heart according to the amount that it has become awakened from habitual heedlessness; as soon as it commits a transgres-sion due to its naturally oppressive disposition it takes to blaming itself’.60 In contrast, the degenerate person blames itself for losing out on some form of carnal satisfaction. In a variation of this theme, this form of blaming is said to take place on the Day of Judgement, where every soul will blame itself for its deeds in the worldly life. Thus, there will be the sinful who will blame themselves for the sins they"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 137have committed, whereas the righteous will blame themselves for their defi cien-cies with regard to God’s rights over them.61 In this regard, al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī is reported to have said, ‘There is no one who exists in the heaven or on the earth except that he will blame himself on the Day of Judgement’.62 Commenting on these various views Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyya states:All these statements are true and do not contradict one another, as the soul (nafs) may be described as such, in the sense that it has been termed ‘self-reproaching (lawwāma)’. However, self-reproach (lawwāma) is of two types: self-reproach that is blameworthy (malūma), by which is meant the soul that is ignorant (jāhila) and tyrannical (ẓālima) and which has been censured by God and His angels. [The second type is] self-reproach that is not blameworthy (ghayr malūma), which is the soul that continues to reproach its owner regard-ing his defi ciencies in God’s obedience despite his best efforts; [in this sense] this is self-reproach that is not blameworthy (lawwāma ghayr malūma).63c. The tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna)This is the highest state of the nafs, having gained tranquillity from establishing God’s obedience, accepting His promise of threat of punishment and promise of reward in Paradise, being satisfi ed with His decree. Such a soul has put its trust in Him alone, tasted the sweetness of faith and felt the pleasure of communicating with its Lord, to the extent that it seeks no other substitute. Consequently, it has not deviated from God’s devotion or been affected by the changes in circum-stances that normally cause a change in the psychological state of the human being, and it is not attracted to the ornamentation of the worldly life. This state of the nafs and its ‘serenity’ and ‘stability’ is alluded to in the following verses (89: 27–30), ‘[It will be said to the righteous] O tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna), return to your Lord content [with Him] (rāḍiya) and pleasing [to Him] (marḍiyya), so enter into [the ranks of] My devotees and enter My paradise’.64 Commenting on this verse, early Muslim scholars provide a variety of views. For example, regarding the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna) Mujāhid said, ‘It is the soul that is satisfi ed with the decree of God; it knows that what does not befall it was not destined to do so and what does befall it was destined to do so’. Similarly, al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī clarifi es, ‘If God, the Mighty and Exalted, wishes to seize it [the nafs], it is contented with God and God is satisfi ed with it. As such, He commands its soul (rūḥahā) to be seized, enters it into paradise and makes it of His righteous devotees.’ In addition, Qatāda (d. 118/736) comments saying, ‘It is the believer (al-muʾmin) whose soul became assured regarding what God has promised’. Moreover, Ibn Zayd states, ‘It [the nafs] was termed tranquil (muṭmaʾinna) due to it being given glad tidings of paradise upon death, at resur-rection and on the Day of Judgment’. In a similar quote the famous Qurʾānic exegete Ibn Kathīr (d. 774/1372) commented regarding the last part of the verse (89: 30), ‘Enter My paradise’, that this will be said to the believer during the throes of death and on the Day of Resurrection.65"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"138 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam From the verse itself and the explanatory notes from Muslim commentators we can glean a reasonable amount of information; fi rst, that this particular state of the nafs has been described as muṭmaʾinna meaning ‘tranquil’ or ‘serene’ but one may well ask what is the source of this ‘tranquillity’ and ‘serenity’? Similarly, the nafs in this state of ‘serenity’ is commanded to return to its Lord being in a state of absolute contentment (rāḍiya) with Him. One may well query once again: in what way is satisfaction (riḍāʾ) a quality of the serene soul and what is the relation between them? In these verses the nafs is also described as being pleasing to God (marḍiyya) and we must also enquire as to what has brought about God’s approval of such a soul. As for the fi rst and paramount quality, i.e. that of ‘tranquillity’ and ‘serenity’, this is said to be brought about by this soul’s constant remembrance of God, relying on the following Qurʾānic verse (13: 38), ‘Those who have believed and whose hearts become tranquil through the remembrance of God; isn’t it through the remembrance of God that the hearts become tranquil[?]’ As such, one of the methods through which this state of the nafs may be attained is through being engaged in the remembrance of God as much as possible.66 This serenity of the soul is further aug-mented by the acquisition of the quality of satisfaction and acceptance (riḍāʾ). This can be understood in the very broad sense of satisfaction and acceptance of the reli-gion of Islam, as is indicated by the following narration transmitted on the authority of the Prophet’s uncle al-Abbās b. ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib (d. 33/654 or 34/655), where the Prophet is reported to have said, ‘The one who is contented with God as his Lord, Islam as his religion and Muḥammad as his prophet has truly “tasted the fl avour of faith”’.67 On a more specifi c note, however, this form of riḍāʾ is usually related to the devotee’s faith in the sixth pillar of Islamic belief, commonly referred to as faith in divine predestination (al-qaḍāʾ wa ’l-qadr), where the practitioner of Islam is required to believe in God’s preordainment of all matters. This fi nal article of Islamic faith is arguably the most diffi cult to actualise since it requires fi rm con-viction (yaqīn) in God’s overall wisdom and plan; as such this conviction is alluded to and hence nurtured in a number of Qurʾānic verses including (57: 23–4) and (64: 11). This being the case, there is an indication then that the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna) has not only reached this level but perfected it, in the sense that no matter what befalls it in terms of human or personal tragedy, its faith in the Almighty remains fi rm, as it knows that this has been preordained before it even existed. Similarly, it is not overjoyed by bounties it enjoys but on the contrary recognises God’s favour upon it and fulfi ls the divine right of gratitude. It is thus this elevated level of perfection in faith that brings about God’s pleasure and satisfaction regarding it, as no matter what such a soul endures it remains content with its Lord and, as a result, its Lord is satisfi ed with it.68 In this regard Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyy comments:If the nafs became at ease from doubt to certainty; from ignorance to knowl-edge; from heedlessness to remembrance; from deception to repentance; from ostentation to sincerity; from deceit to truthfulness; from being incapa-ble to being competent; from the tyranny of conceit to the submissiveness of"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 139humility; from arrogance to modesty and from laxity to action, then the soul has achieved tranquillity.69In addition to the perfection of faith alluded to in the above discussion, the quality of permanency also graces this state, in the sense that this type of soul is so well accustomed to this form of faith and practice that it becomes a resident feature of its nature and character.70 In this regard al-Jurjāni has defi ned the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna) as follows: ‘It is the one [al-nafs] whose illumination with the light of the heart has been completed to the extent that it has been divested of every blameworthy attribute and has been adorned with every praiseworthy characteristic’.71The single Qurʾānic verse mentioning both the terms tazkiya and al-nafsFinally, we turn our attention to the single, most important Qurʾānic verses regard-ing our area of enquiry, verses (91: 7–10). The signifi cance of these verses cannot be overemphasised due to their mention of not only the nature of the soul and the potentiality and duality created in it but also the matter of its purifi cation or defi le-ment. As such this is the only series of Qurʾānic verses that make mention of both the nafs and its tazkiya in one place and therefore is deserving of particular mention and merits specifi c attention. The verse itself reads, ‘And [by] the soul (nafs) and the One Who proportioned it; then He inspired it [to discern between] its iniquity and its righteousness; indeed, he who purifi es it has succeeded; and indeed, he who defi les it has failed.’ These particular verses are interesting in a variety of ways and, as such, merit some refl ection and discussion. The fi rst characteristic is that the series of verses begins with the swearing of an oath using waw al-qasm, which according to the Islamic exegetical tradition implies emphasis to draw the attention of the reader/ listener to the importance of the discourse being presented. Not only this but this particular verse comes at the end of six previous oaths at the beginning of each verse, the objects of the oath being the sun (al-shams), the moon (al-qamar), the day (al-nahār), the night (al-layl), the heaven (al-samāʾ), the earth (al-arḍ) and fi nally, the seventh oath concerns the soul (al-nafs). Commentators allude to the fact that this style in the Qurʾān is utilised to draw attention to the greatness and perfection of such creations, these ultimately being indications of the Creator Himself. Perhaps more subtly, however, it can be further noticed that the fi rst six items are manifest, i.e. ‘seen’ in the simplest sense, whereas the fi nal object of the oath is ‘unseen’, causing some exegetes to conclude that this is in fact the greatest of the ‘unseen’ creations.72 Similarly, there is a direct reference to the Creator of this soul; the word used in the verse is mā in this instance mā al-mawṣūla or the relative pronoun, carrying the meaning of alladhī and in this specifi c example meaning man or ‘the one who’.73 Thus, the verse speaks not only of the soul itself but also of the One, meaning God, Who sawwāhā carrying the meaning of ‘proportioned, made equal,"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"140 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islammade even and balanced’, suggesting not only that the soul created was thus in the body but also that the soul has been given ‘free will’ to choose at a moral level between good and evil, to which the following verse adds further credence.74 The next verse begins by making an important statement, i.e. that the soul is capable of receiving inspiration and insight, indicated to by the use of the verb alhamahā, once again the active participle being God, stating clearly that He is the source of inspiration. The subject of the inspiration is equally signifi cant, however, as it is stated as being the soul’s iniquity (fujūr) and its righteousness (taqwā), i.e. the soul has been inspired and given insight to be able to discern between and choose either right action or sin. In this regard Ibn al-ʿAbbās (d. c. 67–8/686–8) said that the verse means, ‘Clarifi ed for it [the soul] the good and the evil’ and this was also the opinion of Qatāda (d. 118/736), al-Ḍaḥḥak (d. 102/721) and Sufyān al-Thawri (d. 162/778).75 In addition, this is another indi-cation of the soul’s ‘free will’ and as such some commentators as a result consider this to be an indication of the human being’s rational faculty or intellect (al-ʿaql), this being the highest form of human capacity. However, it should be noticed that the subject of this inspiration is to choose between iniquity (fujūr) and righteous-ness (taqwā), which is essentially a moral dilemma, in which there can be no doubt that the intellect plays a role, but the infl uence here of the heart (al-qalb) and/or of the conscience (al-ḍamīr) cannot be underestimated. As such, this verse is also an indication of the dual potentiality within the soul, mentioned previously, and also alludes to its responsibility and accountability, in both this life and the next, as it has been endowed with the capacity to discern and the ability to choose the right course of action or alternatively its opposite.76 The results and consequences of such ‘informed’ choices are the subject of the next two verses, which is also the only time in the Qurʾān where the nafs is used in conjunction with a derivative of the term tazkiya. In the very next verse we are informed that true success, prosperity and salvation (falāḥ), meaning the acquisi-tion of God’s good grace and entry into His paradise, will be attained by a person who ‘purifi es it (zakkāhā)’. This is the usual form II usage of the verb alluded to previously and therefore gives the meanings of ‘bringing about or causing growth, augmentation, reform and development’ or ‘purifi cation’ in the broad sense. However, it is the subject of ‘it’ which concerns us here, as the attached pronoun being used is feminine, i.e. hā, and which, as such, refers directly to the term nafs mentioned previously. Thus, the verse in its broadest sense would mean, ‘He who has caused his soul to grow, be augmented, be reformed, developed and purifi ed has indeed attained true success, prosperity and salvation’. In this sense Qatāda (d. 118/736) said that the meaning of the verse is, ‘He who has purifi ed his soul through obedience to God and cleansed it from base characteristics and vices has indeed attained true success’.77 It is also worth mentioning that the subject of the verb ‘zakkā’ is not immedi-ately obvious and thus Muslim exegetes have differed regarding exactly ‘who’ it is that is doing the purifying; the fi rst of these views suggests that it is God which is the subject, in which case the verse would mean, ‘He whom God has caused his soul to grow, be augmented, be reformed, developed and purifi ed has indeed"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 141attained true success, prosperity and salvation’.78 In this regard it is related that it was the opinion of both al-Farrāʾ (d. 207/822) and al-Zajjāj (d. 311/923) that the meaning of the verse is, ‘Indeed, a soul which God has purifi ed is successful and indeed, a soul which God has defi led has failed’.79 The second view posits that it is the human being who brings about this process at a personal level, in which case the verse would mean, ‘He who has caused his soul to be purifi ed has indeed attained true success’.80 In this sense, Sufyān b. ʿUyayna (d. 198/813), Qatāda (d. 118/736) and others said regarding this verse that the meaning is, ‘Indeed, he who has purifi ed his soul with God’s obedience and righteous actions has succeeded’, and similarly, Ibn al-Jawzī (d. 597/1201), commented that the meaning of zakkāhā is, ‘Purifi ed it from sin and reformed it with righteous deeds’.81 It is not wholly implausible, however, that the process is indeed a combination of the two in harmony with one another. The alternative consequence of these ‘informed’ choices is clarifi ed in the very next verses, which alludes to the idea that whoever selects a path of iniquity will indeed have failed (khāba). The verse used in diametric opposition to zakkāhā is equally worthy of mention here; the conjugation used is dassāhā from the root dassasa, the fi nal radical of this verb being substituted for an alif to ease and facili-tate pronunciation (takhfīf). The meaning of this verb is to ‘hide’ or ‘conceal’, which at fi rst glance may seem obscure but the implication is that the person would commit sins, disbelieve and be disobedient, so much so that his soul would be ‘submerged’ in such reprehensible acts to the extent that his soul would be ‘buried’ in them.82 In this sense Ibn Qutayba (d. 276/889) said the meaning of dassāhā is, ‘Concealed it with iniquity and disobedience, as the reprobate hides his soul (dassa nafsahu) i.e. suppresses it through his committing of obscenities’.83 Similarly, al-Zajjāj (d. 311/923) commented by saying that such a person makes his soul lowly, despicable, vile and wretched.84 This emotive metaphor elucidates the state of such a soul and clarifi es exactly how its ‘failure’ is constituted. Our original conclusion at the end of the discussion of the linguistic implica-tions of these terms, i.e. ‘the growth, augmentation, reform and development of a human being’s soul, intellect, body and self’, has changed little having surveyed the Qurʾānic text for the same purpose. All this increases our understanding of the process and goal of tazkiyat al-nafs considerably. The subtle interplay between the divine (God), the human elect (Prophets/Messengers) and the humble wor-shipper (the human being) all have their parts to play; from divine guidance and inspiration, to human moral and spiritual excellence and example, to fi rm will, certitude and extreme effort. Similarly, that very essence of humanity – the human soul – has been seen to be multifaceted, multilayered and highly complex. Despite this, the Qurʾān has alluded to the goal of the above-mentioned process of tazkiya, i.e. the attainment of the state of the nafs known as the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna), which is its fi nal and ultimate product. Thus, we may conclude that our understanding of tazkiyat al-nafs has now developed to mean: the growth, augmentation, reform, development and purifi cation of the human soul, via divine guidance, Prophetic example and individual effort, to attain its most elevated form, that of the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna)."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"142 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam This discussion has shed a great deal of light upon the understanding of the concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam but no such discussion would be complete without reference to Islam’s secondary source of law and thought, namely the ḥadīth.The concept of the terms tazkiya and nafs within ḥadīth literatureFrom the Islamic perspective the Qurʾān is not the only form of divinely inspired revelation. Indeed, the very life of the Prophet is considered to be a source of guidance, where his customary practice known as the sunna is constituted by his statements, actions and tacit approval and is contained in a vast corpus of narra-tions transmitted by Muslims throughout history, known as ḥadīth.85 This litera-ture is viewed as complementary to the Qurʾān and it is seen to fulfi l an explanatory or interpretative role regarding Islam’s primary sacred text.86 Thus, it is impera-tive that any ‘Islamic’ term or concept be examined in the light of this literature and, as such, tazkiyat al-nafs is no exception. This said, the vast nature of the material means that only a representative survey will be made here and, indeed, only those texts that have a direct link with the subject matter will be considered. Following a similar methodology to the previous sections, each of these terms will be dealt with separately to shed light on their meanings and concepts. When surveying the usage of words with the z-k-y root within the ḥadīth litera-ture, perhaps the most familiar derivative in the Islamic context is the term zakāt, this being the third ‘pillar’ of the Islamic faith. Despite the vast wealth of narra-tions regarding this topic, as was mentioned earlier, this usage is of little use to us here and therefore will not be considered. This leaves rather a limited choice of ḥadīth to consider but fortunately the remaining narrations that contain the form II version of the verb zakkā also make mention of the term nafs. The fi rst of these is of particular signifi cance, as indeed it makes specifi c mention of tazkiyat al-nafs. The Prophet Muḥammad is reported to have said:There are three acts [whereby] whoever performed them has tasted the sweet-ness of faith; he who worships God, the Mighty and Exalted, alone as none is worthy of worship except Him; he who gives his zakāt willingly, not giving a weak, old animal, a mangy animal or a sick animal but, indeed, he gives from the median range of his wealth, as God, the Mighty and Exalted, does not ask you [to give] the fi nest of it and did not order you [to give] the least of it; and he who purifi es his soul (zakkā nafsahu). So a man asked, ‘And what is purifi -cation of the soul (wa mā tazkiyat al-nafs)?’ He [the Prophet] replied, ‘That he knows that God, the Mighty and Exalted, is with him wherever he may be’.87This ḥadīth seems to have solved the problem of the meaning of tazkiyat al-nafs since it is a direct defi nition and quotation from the mouth of the Prophet of Islam himself. Indeed, some scholars of the discipline of ḥadīth consider this narration to be authentic88 but under closer scrutiny, however, this seems not to be the"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 143case.89 Consequently, it will not be considered here due to its lack of authenticity and hence cannot be viewed as a statement of the Prophet.90 In the second of these narrations it is reported by the Prophetic Companion Zayd b. Arqam (d. 66/686 or 68/688) that the Prophet, would teach them the following supplication:O God, indeed I seek shelter in you from incapacity and laziness, senility and cowardice and miserliness and the punishment of the grave. O God, grant my soul (nafsī) its righteousness and purify it (zakkihā), as indeed, You are the best of those who purify it (zakkāhā), You are its Guardian and Master. O God, I seek shelter in You from a heart that has no fear [of You], a soul that cannot be satisfi ed (nafs lā tashbaʿ), knowledge of no benefi t and a request that will not be granted.91In comparison this second narration was related by the famous ḥadīth scholar, Imam Muslim, as well as others and consequently from the traditional Muslim perspective would be considered rigorously authenticated. Moreover, its signifi -cance is manifold since fi rst, this supplication (duʿā) was actually taught by the Prophet to his Companions, which in itself is enough to show the importance of the content of this particular prayer. The subject matter of this supplication is seeking shelter in God against negative or unbenefi cial qualities and as such the nafs occurs reiterated within it. We fi nd that granting the nafs its righteousness is attributed to God alone and is reminiscent of the Qurʾānic verse (91: 8) regarding the inspiration of the soul. Thus, it is a recognition that the soul has been inspired to the dual potentiality of both good and evil but, in the light of this, there is also a request made of the divine for only the positive facets of such inspiration. The supplication continues requesting divine assistance regarding the soul’s consequent purifi cation (tazkiya), which is indicative of the fact that this ‘purifi ca-tion’ is indeed what will bring about righteousness in the soul and which, in turn, is reminiscent of the qualities of the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna). Despite this, however, although God is regarded to be, ‘The best of those who purify it (zakkāhā)’, which clarifi es that there is primarily a divine role in purifi cation that has also been witnessed earlier, this also shows that tazkiya is not restricted to God alone but that it is He Who has achieved perfection in this regard. This also opens the possibility that other than God may undertake this process and, as we have also seen, this is the role of the Prophets and Messengers and, indeed, the individual.92 In addition, the fact the Prophet himself would make and teach such a supplication is an allusion to the enormity of the task in hand, as it would seem to be an indication that even God’s prophetic elect require His assistance in this regard and, as such, the need of the mere mortal is even greater. Indeed, it would seem in the light of this narration that to attain purifi cation of the soul is impossible without divine intervention and the humble request for it. Moreover, when surveying the vast corpus of the ḥadīth literature for the term nafs we fi nd a huge number of transmissions that contain this term. However, as was noticed previously, many of these narrations utilise this word as a refl exive"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"144 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islampronoun, and consequently, these usages will not be considered here. On examin-ing the remaining material, however, we fi nd many references to the negative aspects of the nafs. For example, in the ḥadīth discussed in the last section, in addition to the mention of the concept of tazkiya, we also fi nd the phrase, ‘O God, I seek shelter in You from . . . a soul that cannot be satisfi ed (nafs lā tashbaʿ)’,93 this being an indication of the nafs’s voracious appetite to fulfi l its desires alluded to earlier, which is a particular characteristic of the soul prone to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ). Indeed, al-Nawawī (d. 626/1277) comments that the meaning of this supplication is, ‘Seeking shelter [in God] from greed, avarice, voracity and the soul (al-nafs) having high hopes’.94 Furthermore, the nafs in question in the supplication is non-specifi c and may be the nafs of the person making the duʿāʾ or those of others; in either case this is further evidence of the need of divine assistance in protecting oneself from the evils of one’s soul and the souls of others.95 On a similar theme, in a famous public address made by the Prophet, known as khutbat al-ḥāja, we fi nd the phrase, ‘. . . We seek shelter in God from the evil of our own souls (shurūr anfusinā) and our sinful deeds (sayyiʾāt aʿmālinā) . . .’.96 This once again is a direct reference to the negative qualities of the nafs; in fact the narration is explicit in its choice of words, since the word shurūr is the plural of sharr meaning evil or wickedness, indicating the many types of iniquity found within the soul. Similarly, this seems to allude to the consequences of such evils as the very next phrase used is, ‘. . . We seek shelter in God from . . . our sinful deeds (sayyiʾāt aʿmālinā) . . .’, seemingly alluding to the fact that these sins that have been committed are no more than a product or a consequence of the evils of the soul. Once again there is the pedagogical aspect of teaching such phrases in a public arena and also the concept that such negative qualities found within the soul prone to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) will not be overcome except through seeking the assistance of the Creator of the soul, God, the Mighty and Exalted. Similarly, within the collections of ḥadīth literature the dual potential of the nafs for both positive and negative qualities can also be identifi ed. The following narration illustrates this dichotomy; the Prophet Muḥammad is reported to have said:Satan ties three knots on the nape of the neck of one of you when he sleeps, striking the place of every knot, [saying:] ‘The night is long so sleep’. So if one of you awoke and remembered God, one knot is untied; then if you per-formed ablution (wuḍūʾ), another knot is untied and if you prayed, another knot is untied. [Thus, such a person] will become energetic and genial (ṭayyib al-nafs) or otherwise he will be lazy and unpleasant (khabīth al-nafs).97In this narration we fi nd two diametrically opposed notions regarding the nafs, i.e. those of goodness (ṭīb) and malevolence (khubth), which manifest themselves behaviourally in terms of geniality and unpleasantness. These are again examples of the soul’s inspiration to both ‘good’ and ‘bad’, as alluded to in verse (91: 8)."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 145Moreover, the signifi cance of Satanic infl uence is also mentioned here and seems to fi t nicely with the description of the soul prone to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) and its inclination to devilish insinuation mentioned previously, which seems to interact at the ‘metaphysical’ level. Furthermore, this particular narration also suggests the role that ‘physical’ acts of worship can have on the nafs in chang-ing its state and presumably, its purifi cation, as this ḥadīth mentions specifi cally remembrance of God (dhikr), ritual ablution (wuḍūʾ) and prayer (ṣalāt), these being righteous deeds associated with the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna).98 The duality of the nafs is also indicated in another extended narration which discusses the fate of the soul upon death:The angels come to the dead person [upon death] and if he was righteous they say, ‘Exit O good soul (nafs ṭayyiba) that was in a good body; exit nobly and receive glad tidings of repose (rawḥ), benevolence (rayḥān) and a Lord Who is not wrathful’. This will continue being said to it until it exits [the body]. Then it will be elevated into the heavens and they will be opened for it. It will be said, ‘Who is this?’ And they [the angels] will say, ‘It is so and so’. It will be said, ‘Welcome to the good soul that was in a good body; Enter nobly and receive glad tidings of repose, benevolence and a Lord Who is not wrathful’, and this will continue being said to it until it reaches the heaven in which God, the Mighty and Exalted, is encountered. If [however] he was wicked, they say, ‘Exit O despicable soul (nafs khabītha) that was in a despicable body; Exit in disdain and receive tidings of scalding water and purulence and other forms and types [of punishment]’. This will remain being said to it until it exits [the body]. Then it will be ele-vated into the heavens and they will not be opened for it. It will be said, ‘Who is this?’ And they [the angels] will say, ‘It is so and so’. It will be said, ‘No welcome for a despicable soul that was in a despicable body, go back in disdain as the gates of the heavens will not be opened for you’. Then it will be sent [away] from the heavens and will go back to the grave.99In this detailed account of the fate of the soul after death we are given two contrast-ing images of the soul depending on its actions and state before death. On the one hand, the good soul (nafs ṭayyiba) will be encouraged to leave the body, being extolled with the good news of its entry into paradise and the pleasure of its Lord. This honorifi c position is enhanced by its ascension into the heavens, where it is welcomed and ultimately is favoured with being brought into the proximity of its Creator. This no doubt is reminiscent of the description of the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna) and the success (falāḥ) awarded to it. In contrast, the despicable soul (nafs khabītha) is granted no such luxury; indeed, it exits the body in humili-ation, being informed of the torments that await it. Similarly, there is no welcome for it in the heavens and it is commanded to return to its grave in disgrace. Once again this seems to allude to the fate of the soul prone to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) that has disgraced itself with continuous self-interest in the worldly life. Therefore, to avoid this form of humiliation there are a number of narrations"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"146 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islampraising the combating of the soul and disciplining it. It fact, one of the greatest acts of worship in Islam, that of struggle or jihad – usually associated with physi-cal combat – takes on a new connotation in this context. The religious warrior (al-mujāhid) is no longer merely a soldier in God’s path but, as the Prophet stated, ‘The religious warrior (al-mujāhid) is the one who struggles against his soul for the sake of God, the Mighty and Exalted’.100 Thus, from this we can glean that one of the essential qualities of dealing with the soul is to struggle and strive against it so as to purify it and, in doing so, the practitioner of this diffi cult task gains the privilege of being considered a combatant in the path of God. In a similar vain, it is reported that Abū Bakr al-Ṣiddīq (d. 13/634), the famous Prophetic Companion and the fi rst caliph after the death of the Prophet, said, ‘Whoever loathes his soul for the sake of God [then] God will save him from His wrath’.101 Thus, having disdain for one’s soul, particularly the state referred to as the soul prone to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) and its contemptible actions, is con-sidered praiseworthy in the process of disciplining it and ultimately purifying it. In addition to struggling against one’s own soul, commonly referred to as mujāhada and having contempt for the soul, a further course of action is found in the narrations related to the nafs – that of taking the soul to account or muḥāsaba, as it is known in Arabic. It is interesting to note that this concept was also found in the formative period, as it is related that ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb (d. 23/644), another famous Prophetic Companion and the second caliph in Islamic history is reported to have said:Take your souls to account before they are taken to account; weigh your souls [actions] before they are weighed as, indeed, it will easier for you in the Reckoning tomorrow that you take your souls to account today; adorn your-selves for the great display! On that day you will be brought forth and not even the most hidden secret will be concealed.102Thus, it can be seen that it is necessary to take the soul to account in this life in order to make the reckoning in front of God easier, since any sins committed would have obviated via repentance and consequently would be forgiven, making them insignifi cant on the Day of Judgement. Once again it is easy to see how this, along with other qualities mentioned above, is an intrinsic component in the process of purifying the soul. Despite the idea of implementing punitive measures on the soul to discipline it, described in the aforementioned narrations, we also fi nd a sense of balance in this process, as is related in the following ḥadīth regarding fasting in which the Prophet is reported to have asked ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿAmr al-ʿĀṣ (d. between 63/683 – 77/696):‘Do you fast continuously and pray the night prayer?’ To which he replied, ‘Yes’. The Prophet responded, ‘If you [continue] to do that the eyes will be overwhelmed and the soul will be exhausted (nafi hat lahu al-nafs). Do not fast continuously; fasting three days [a month is the equivalent of] fasting"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 147continuously’. So he said, ‘I am able to do more’. To which the Prophet replied, ‘Then fast the fast of Dāwūd, peace be upon him, who would fast one day and break his fast the next . . .’.103Thus, forcing oneself into a state of continuous, physically demanding acts of worship, such as fasting – which is normally considered a highly effective way of disciplining the soul – is not recommended, as ultimately it has a negative effect, as the ḥadīth itself suggests: ‘. . . the soul will be exhausted (nafi hat lahu al-nafs) . . .’. By implication also, this cannot be the method of purifying or disciplining the soul as otherwise this narration would have indicated as much; on the contrary this process must be balanced, bearing in mind both the physical and emotional needs of the person, whilst at the same time combating the negative qualities to which all souls are prone. Perhaps on a more positive note we fi nd that the Prophet is also reported to have said, ‘Being rich is not [due to] having a lot of material wealth but being [truly] rich is [having] richness of the soul (ghinā al-nafs)’.104 This is a very sig-nifi cant indication of the importance of purifi cation of the soul, as it alludes to the true meaning of happiness in the worldly life. It may be perceived that having vast amounts of money constitutes being wealthy and similarly that a penniless person is poor. However, this ḥadīth clarifi es Islam’s position regarding being rich; in reality the person who thinks that material wealth is in fact the true source of being rich is fooled, as he is not satisfi ed with what he has been given. Such a person continues trying to accumulate ‘wealth’ and consequently all forms of temporal benefi t, to the extent that they are indifferent as to the source of this ‘wealth’ due to their overwhelming greed. In this sense, according to the above narration, such a person is indeed ‘poor’ and not wealthy at all. Alternatively, if a person satisfi es himself with what he has been given, is satisfi ed and content with it, not desiring an increase in it, then this is the true meaning of ‘wealth’ since such a person does not feel ‘in need’ due to his satisfaction with what he has.105 In this regard al-Qurṭubī comments:The meaning of the ḥadīth is that richness that is benefi cial, great and praise-worthy is richness of the soul (ghinā al-nafs); this means that if a person’s soul is content, it refrains from desires, is enhanced and becomes superior, attaining respectability, prestige, honour and praise, which is more than the wealth that is acquired by someone who has poverty of the soul (faqīr al-nafs) due to his greed, as this embroils him in contemptible matters and despicable acts due to his base aspirations and his miserliness. [Such a person is] con-tinuously condemned by people, his position being diminished [in their sight], thus becoming the lowest of the low. As for the person who is described as having richness of the soul (ghinā al-nafs), he is content with what God has provided him, he does not seek an increase that is more than his need, nor is he insistent or demanding in his request; indeed he is satisfi ed with what God has ordained for him.106"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"148 Spiritual Purifi cation in IslamThis ‘poverty’ and ‘wealth’ is reminiscent of the characteristics of both the soul prone to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) and the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna) respectively. As for the fi rst, it remains self-serving, being controlled by its desires to the extent that accumulation – and consequent consumption – is its primary goal, to the extent that it ignores its duties to its Creator. On the contrary, the outstanding quality of those endowed with richness of the soul is their satisfaction with God, this being one of the most outstanding qualities of the tranquil soul, as described above. Similarly, it stands to reason that eradicating the soul of such ‘poverty’ and adorning it with ‘richness’ is a major goal of tazkiyat al-nafs. Having examined Islam’s secondary source of thought and Law, namely the sunna as preserved in the ḥadīth literature, we have found another source of valu-able information regarding the terms tazkiya and nafs. Concerning the term tazkiya, after initial disappointment regarding an inauthentic narration that con-tained the compound phrase tazkiyat al-nafs, another narration shed further light on the process and means of tazkiya. This narration, in the form of a Prophetic supplication, provided further clarifi cation on a number of issues; fi rst, that even the Prophet himself sought shelter and assistance in God regarding the process of purifying the soul. Indeed, God was further qualifi ed as the source and agent of this process but it was also found that the phraseology of the supplication did not also rule out the possibility of other agents taking a proactive role in the purifi ca-tion process. At the same time, however, this narration seemed to allude to the idea that ultimately this process would not be completed except by placing one’s trust in the guardianship of God, the Creator of the soul and ‘. . . the best of those who purify it (zakkāhā) . . .’. With regard to the term nafs it was also found that many of the concepts dis-cussed in the section concerning the Qurʾān were also reinforced. First, the nega-tive qualities of the nafs that are so indicative of the soul prone to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) were encountered; for example, the nafs is clearly character-ised by iniquity (sharr) and this innate quality leads to sins and misdeeds, which are ultimately so destructive in the Hereafter. Consequently, the importance of seeking divine assistance was also stressed, once again due to the fact that ulti-mately these negative qualities would not be overcome except once again through the intervention of the Creator of the soul and ‘. . . the best of those who purify it (zakkāhā) . . .’. Similarly, the dual potentiality of the soul was also seen in the ḥadīth literature; such phrases as genial (ṭayyib al-nafs) and unpleasant (khabīth al-nafs), the ‘good’ soul (nafs ṭayyiba) and ‘despicable’ soul (nafs khabītha) and richness of the soul (ghinā al-nafs) and poverty of the soul (faqīr al-nafs) were identifi ed, all of which are indications of the soul prone to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) and the tran-quil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna). The transformation of such negative aspects of the soul to their positive counterparts was also discussed and certain disciplinary practices such as having contempt for the soul (maqt al-nafs), struggling against one’s own soul (mujāhadat al-nafs) and taking the soul to account (muḥāsabat al-nafs) were also identifi ed. Despite this, it was also seen that there has to be a"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 149degree of balance in this process of purifi cation as the emotional, physical and spiritual needs of the human being need to be considered or, in the words of the Prophet, ‘. . . the soul will be exhausted (nafi hat lahu al-nafs) . . .’. Therefore, in many ways, the defi nition proposed at the end of the section concerning the Qurʾān, i.e. ‘the growth, augmentation, reform, development and purifi cation of the human soul, via divine guidance, Prophetic example and indi-vidual effort, to attain its most elevated form, that of the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna)’, has not changed greatly. However, despite this our understand-ing of the process has, since this purifi cation to bring about a ‘richness of the soul’ will not occur except by eliminating its ‘iniquity’ by a balanced and integrated process of ‘striving against it’ and ‘taking it to account’.The concept of the terms tazkiya and nafs in the view of Muslim scholarsHaving surveyed Islam’s revelatory sources and gained an understanding of the presentation of tazkiyat al-nafs therein, it is now equally appropriate that we examine the views of its scholarly circles, so as to extend our knowledge of this subject matter further. At the same time, however, this discussion is by no means intended to be exhaustive and comprehensive, as this itself would require a sepa-rate work. Instead, a selection of opinions will be presented here, to add to the discussion so far, in the sense that there will be an attempt to represent views that have not already been mentioned or that have their own specifi c signifi cance, thus adding to the richness of the discussion of this intriguing topic. In addition, the opinions discussed are merely representative of a wide range of similar views that exist and, as such, are not meant to represent a particular stance or school of thought. Similarly, little commentary will be provided due to the lucidity of many of the quotes, to let such opinions ‘speak for themselves’. Finally, in keeping with the methodology of the previous sections each of the terms tazkiya and ‘nafs’ will be discussed separately before discussing their compound derivative.The concept of the term tazkiya in the view of Muslim scholarsOne of the most prolifi c medieval scholars of Islam was the celebrated shaykh al-Islām Aḥmad b. ʿAbd al-Ḥalīm Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328) and, bearing in mind his extensive writings, it is not surprising that he also discussed the topic of purifying the soul. Concerning the linguistic considerations of the term tazkiya he said:Al-tazkiya is to make something pure (zakiyyan), either in its essence or in terms of belief (al-iʿtiqād) [in it] or informing (al-khabar) [regarding it], in the same way that it is said, ‘I straightened it’ (ʿaddaltahu); if you straight-ened it in itself or in terms of people’s belief regarding it. He the Exalted says, ‘And do not claim purity for your souls’ (wa lā tuzakkū anfusakum) [53: 32], i.e. [do not] inform [others] of their purity.107"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"150 Spiritual Purifi cation in IslamIn addition to discussing the linguistic implications of the word tazkiya, Ibn Taymiyya also makes an important point; that tazkiya is not only a process of purifi cation but indeed, this purifi cation requires that not only ‘good’ qualities are encouraged but also ‘bad’ characteristics are eliminated:The origin of al-zakāt is an increase in good; it is said, ‘The crop increased (zakā al-zarʿ) and the wealth increased (zakā al-māl)’ if it grew, and good will not grow except via the relinquishing of evil, in the same way that a crop will not grow (yazkū) until the weeds are removed from it. Similarly, the soul (al-nafs) and deeds (al-aʿmāl) will not be purifi ed (lā tazkū) until that which contradicts is removed; a man will not be purifi ed (mutazakkiyan) until he has relinquished evil and whoever does not relinquish evil will not ever be pure (zākiyan), as indeed evil pollutes the soul (al-nafs) and defi les it.108Regarding the process of purifi cation he recommends a ‘practical’ approach to the problem, beginning with the very essence of faith and moving on to the practical aspects of religious life. For example he says:As such, monotheism (tawḥīd) and faith (īmān) are the greatest things through which the soul (al-nafs) is purifi ed (tatazakkā), whereas polytheism (shirk) is the greatest thing which defi les it. It is also purifi ed by righteous deeds and acts of charity and all of this is what has been mentioned by the predecessors. They said, ‘He who is purifi ed is indeed successful [87: 14]’, as he who is purifi ed from polytheism and [purifi ed] from disobedience through repentance.109Of the contemporary scholars who have discussed the topic of tazkiya, Amin Ahsan Islahi’s account of the topic is easily one of the most lucid and comprehen-sive studies. In the following extended quote he clarifi es the effect of tazkiya on the individual:The spirit of purifi cation, growth and development and its fi nal perfection will be visible in its actions everywhere. For instance the action of tazkiyah may be performed on a tract of land and also on the inner self of a person. Although due to variations in the fi elds of action, there will be a difference in the form, yet in reality and in its object there will be no difference between the two. The tazkiyah of the tract of land will comprise clearing it of the weeds, brushwood and brambles, levelling it, ploughing it to make it soft and porous, then watering it so that it may become capable of developing the healthy seeds of some sort in keeping with its natural capacity, and take it to the fi nal stage of blossoming and fruition. The tazkiyah of the inner self of a person involves eradication of erroneous thought and false assumptions, the correction and levelling of the perversions and angularities created by the corrupt morality and bad habits; removal of the ills produced by the blind emulations and ritualism; treatment and cure of the evil of drooping spirits and cowardice created by craving for ephemeral carnal pleasures so that his"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 151eyes may be opened and his mind may become capable of thinking freely, his drooping spirits may be raised, his habits may be reformed and through development of his mental, moral and spiritual powers according to his natural capabilities, may attain the heights God endowed him with to reach. Technically it conveys the sense of checking ourselves from erroneous ten-dencies and learnings and turning them to the path of virtue and piety (fear of God’s displeasure) and developing it to attain the stage of perfection.110Regarding the vast scope of the purifi cation process he comments:On the contrary tazkiyah deals with all the apparent and hidden aspects of our selves. It critically judges all the powers and the capabilities of which we are constituted, discusses all our emotions and feelings and corrects and reforms them; it takes stock of all the variegated and multifaceted ties that we are bound with, and creates an order in and regulates them all under a particular principle and regulation. Our thoughts, our apprehensions, our inclinations our movements, our eating and drinking, our engagements, entertainments, and interests, the daily routines of our lives, in short, no department and nothing that touches our lives is outside the pale of tazkiyah.111Concerning the object of the purifi cation process he is no doubt:Tazkiyah does not demand only that our soul may somehow be subordinated to the Commandments of the Shari’ah, but its real demand lies in breaking this unruly steed of our soul in such a way that it carries out the orders of God and His apostle in the best possible manner. It does not only demand from us the service where the slave comes to imagine that he is beholding his Lord with his eyes (physical vision). In short, it means that tazkiyah places before us the demand of Iman or belief, Islam or submission and ihsan or utmost sincerity, at the same time. It demands that we believe in God with all His attributes, also that we obey His Commandments in every sphere of our lives and above all that this belief and obedience may not be formal and superfi cial but fully conscious and deeply sincere in which our hearts must coordinate with our physique.112Similarly, he considers the process of tazkiya to be a continuous one, where the human being continually strives for perfection:This nature of tazkiyah makes it a perpetual striving and a continuous struggle without any break or a period of rest.

Islahi alludes to this when he says:Evidently enough the theme of tazkiyah is the human soul. But what is the soul is an important question stressed in the Islamic philosophy and in that of Jahiliyah too, well enough. The arch of the doorway to the temple in ancient Athens bore the inscription of the sayings of Socrates: ‘Man know thyself!’ This is a pointer to the fact that in Greek philosophy knowledge and cogni-zance of the soul was considered of fundamental importance.114Thus, it is hardly surprising that Muslim scholarship has also addressed this fundamental question and, indeed, due to the nature of this enquiry, theologians discussed this issue at an early stage. One of the fi rst and still most popular ‘ortho-dox’ sunni creeds of Islam was that set down by Abū Jaʿfar al-Ṭaḥāwī (d. 321/933). In a classical exposition of this creed Ibn Abū ’l-ʿIzz al-Ḥanafī (d. 792/1390) alludes to the variety of opinions in this debate before clarifying the ‘orthodox’ position:There is a difference of opinion regarding the soul (al-rūḥ) as to what it is. Some say it is a body and some say it is an accident (ʿaraḍ).115 Others say that they do not know what it is, either a substance or an accident. Some say that the soul is nothing more than a balance of the four natural components [i.e. earth, air, fi re and water]. Some others say that it is pure blood free from impurities and putridity. Some say that it is the natural heat that is life itself. Some say that it is a non-composite substance spread throughout the animal world that drives and organizes that world and that it is not divided into essence and structure, being existent in every animal of the world, as one. Others say that it is the breath that enters and exits during breathing and yet others have further opinions . . . . The Qurʾān, sunna, consensus of the Companions and rational evidences prove that the soul is a body which differs in essence to that of the tangible body. It is a heavenly body of light that is agile, animate and is motile. It passes through the substance of the limbs in the same way that water spreads through a rose, or the way that oil diffuses through an olive, or the way fi re enfl ames a coal. As long as these limbs remain healthy to accept the effects of this delicate body [the soul], this delicate body remains diffused throughout the limbs and drives effects, such as sensory perception, motion and volition. However, if"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 153these [limbs] become compromised due to an imbalance in the body and it becomes unable to accept the effects [of the soul on it], the soul will separate from the body and leave for the sphere of souls (ʿālam al-arwāḥ).116In a similar attempt to defi ne the nafs in a terminological manner, seemingly basing his discourse upon verse (39: 42) and the commentary of Ibn al-ʿAbbās (d. c. 67–8/686–8) mentioned previously, we fi nd the following text from al-Jurjāni (d. 816/1413):It is an ethereal, delicate essence that carries the life force, sensory perception and motion; al-Ḥakīm called this the animal soul (al-rūḥ al-ḥayawāniyya). As such it is an illuminating essence within the body, so at death its light is detached from the internal and external parts of the body. As for during sleep it is detached from the external part of the body and not the internal, which confi rms that death and sleep are of one category, as death is a complete ces-sation whereas sleep is a partial one. Thus, it is confi rmed that the All Power-ful and the All Wise has connected the essence of the soul to the body in three ways: fi rst, if the light of the soul reaches all parts of the body, both the exter-nal and the internal, then this is [termed] wakefulness; if its light was from the external part of the body and not the internal, then this is sleep, or [if it is detached] completely, then this is death.117In addition to the theological attempts to defi ne the nafs, there have also been conceptual ideas regarding the soul from other sections of Muslim scholarship and the most obvious of these is Islam’s mystics. Bearing in mind the intrinsic nature of the subject matter and its relation to Sufi sm, it is particularly important to spend some time discussing these ideas. The main concept of the Sufi s is that nafs is the seat of every blameworthy quality; seemingly equating it entirely with the state of the soul termed ‘the soul prone to evil’ (al-nafs la ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) in the Qurʾān. In this regard, we fi nd the following statement from one of the early practitioners of Sufi sm, who discussed the nafs in detail, al-Ḥakīm al-Tirmidhī (d. ca. 300/910), who states:It is a ‘land’ (arḍ) of debauchery, inclined to carnal appetite after carnal appe-tite and desire after desire; it does not gain calmness nor does it gain stability. Its actions vary, none of them resembling the other; one time it is servitude and another it is divinity, one time it is surrender and another it is domination, one time it is incapacity and another it is capability. So, if the soul is con-tented and disciplined, it will become obedient.118Another of the early Sufi masters, Abū Saʿīd al-Kharrāz (d. 286/899), elucidates the importance of seeking divine aid when dealing with this ‘internal enemy’ and clarifi es exactly how the soul should be treated:From the characteristics of the truthful person (al-ṣādiq) in intending God the Exalted, is that he calls his soul (al-nafs) to God the Exalted’s obedience,"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"154 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamseeking His pleasure and if it responds he praises God the Exalted and treats it [the soul] well. If, however, it does not respond regarding that which pleases God, or he sees it slow [to respond] then he prevents it from its beloved in this life, opposes it regarding what it desires, takes it as an enemy for God’s sake and complains to God about it until He reforms it for him . . . Thus, it is related that some scholars said, ‘Indeed I know that part of reform-ing my soul is my knowing its vices’. Thus, it is suffi cient evil that a person knows that a fault exists in his own soul and doesn’t correct it.119Commenting on the importance of reforming and purifying this base form of the soul and realising the true potential of one’s own humanity, al-Suhrawardī (d. 632/1234) states:Whoever knows the essence of the soul (al-nafs) and its deceptions also knows that he has no power over it except by seeking the assistance of its Lord and Creator. As such, the devotee will not fully realise his humanity until he casts aside his animal instincts with knowledge and uprightness, by being careful to observe his excesses and his negligence. Through this his humanity will be enhanced, he will comprehend the satanic characteristics within him, the blameworthy qualities and the perfection of his humanity.120In dealing with the faults of the soul Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyya (d. 751/1350) enlightens us regarding his own personal account:One day I asked shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyya, may God have mercy on him, about this matter and how to eliminate faults and occupy oneself with the cleansing of one’s path. The gist of his reply was that the self is like a garbage pile: the more you dig in it, the more of it comes out to the surface; if you can pave a pathway over it and go past it, do so, and do not preoccupy yourself with digging into it for you shall never reach its bottom because the more you dig the more that surfaces. The similitude of the faults of the souls (āfāt al-nafs) is like that of snakes and scorpions upon the path of a traveller; if he started to examine the road for them and was preoccupied with killing them he would be halted and never be able to make progress. On the contrary, your aspiration should be to progress on your journey and to avert yourself from them [the faults] and not to pay any attention to them. However, if you are faced with something that prevents your journey then kill it and then continue on your way.121Bearing in mind the prolifi c writings of the celebrated ‘Proof of Islam’ (ḥujjat al-Islām) Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazzālī (d. 505/1111), it is not surprising to fi nd that he has commented on the concept of the soul and its states:Nafs: It also has several meanings, two of which concern us here; fi rst, it means the powers of anger and sexual appetite in a person, which will be"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 155explained later, this usage being mostly found among the people of taṣawwuf [Sufi s], who take ‘nafs’ as the comprehensive word for all the blameworthy characteristics in an individual. That is why they say, ‘One must certainly do battle with the ego and break it’, as is referred to in the ḥadīth, ‘Your worst enemy is your nafs which lies between your fl anks’.122 The second meaning of nafs is the delicate entity [the soul] we have already mentioned, the human being in reality, his self and his essence. However, it is described differently according to its different states. If it assumes calmness under command and has removed from itself the tumult caused by the onslaught of passion, it is called ‘the tranquil soul’ (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna), as the Exalted said regarding it [89: 27–30], ‘O tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna), return to your Lord content [with Him] (rāḍiya) and pleasing [to Him] (marḍiyya), so enter into [the ranks of] My devotees and enter My paradise’. In its fi rst meaning of the nafs one does not envisage its return to God, as it is far removed from Him and is from ‘the party of Satan’. However, when it does not achieve calm-ness, yet resists the base soul (al-nafs al-shahwāniyya), objecting to it, it is called ‘the self-reproaching soul’ (al-nafs al-lawwāma), because it rebukes its owner for his defi ciencies in worshipping its Master, as the Exalted said regard-ing it [75:12], ‘Do not swear [an oath] by the self-reproaching soul (al-nafs al-lawwāma)’. If it gives up all protest and surrenders itself in total obedience to the call of passions and enticement of Satan, it is named ‘the soul prone to evil’ (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) as the Exalted said regarding it, by way of informing regarding Yūsuf and the vizier’s wife [12: 53], ‘And I do not absolve my own self [of blame], as indeed, the [human] soul is prone to evil (inna ’l-nafs la ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ), except when my Lord bestows mercy, as indeed my Lord is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful’, which could be taken to refer to the soul in its fi rst meaning. Consequently, the nafs in the fi rst meaning is absolutely blameworthy, whereas in the second meaning it is praiseworthy, being the essence and reality of the human being that has cognisance of God and all other particulars.123Finally, a contemporary scholar Anas Karzūn, attempts to combine the various elements of the above discussion when he summarises, ‘Al-nafs: is something internal within the human being, whose essence cannot be comprehended; it is susceptible to being directed to good and bad, and encompasses many of the human characteristics and qualities that have a manifest effect on human behaviour’.124The concept of the term tazkiyat al-nafs in the view of Muslim scholarsSome Muslim scholars would argue that not only is tazkiyat al-nafs an intrinsic part of the Islamic teaching but, indeed, it is the ultimate objective of this religion as Saʿīd Murād comments, ‘The goal that Islam strives to fulfi l regarding mankind, in terms of belief and rectitude, is to combine in the individual travelling along"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"156 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamsuch paths, correct belief and methodology, so that he can be elevated to the rank of the “people of purity” (ahl al-ṣafāʾ)’. This is fulfi lled by struggling against the soul (al-nafs) and training it. Similarly, one of the fundamental tasks of the Prophets and Messengers was also to purify the souls of their followers. In this regard, Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyya (d. 751/1350) states:Purifi cation of the souls (tazkiyat al-nufūs) is more severe and more diffi cult than treating the body; so whoever purifi ed his soul by training (riyāḍa) and disciplining (mujāhada) [it] and spiritual retreat (khalwa) in a manner that was not brought by the Messengers then he is like a sick person who attempts to treat himself using his own opinion. And how does his opinion compare to that of a genuine physician? The Messengers are the physicians of the heart and, as such, there is no way to purify them or reform them except [by adopt-ing] their method, putting yourself in their hands, with absolute compliance and submission to them.125Continuing on this theme and developing it to express the scope and nature of purifi cation of the soul, Saʿīd Ḥawwā states:Tazkiyat al-nafs is one of the tasks of the prophets, it is the goal of the right-eous and through it will be salvation or destruction. Tazkiya linguistically has two meanings: [fi rst,] purifi cation (taṭhīr) and [secondly] growth (namūw). Similarly, it has the same meaning terminologically, as purifi cation of the soul (zakāt al-nafs) means its cleansing (taṭhīruhā) from sicknesses and faults, its realisation is through spiritual stations (maqāmāt) and its [the soul’s] adoption of [divine] names and attributes. Thus, tazkiya in summary is cleansing, realisation and adoption. Its means are legally legitimate and its essence and fruits are the sharīʿa. Its effect is seen in one’s behaviour, in one’s relationship with God the Mighty and Exalted, in one’s relationship with the creation and in one’s control of the limbs with regard to God’s command.126In addition to this, a number of contemporary scholars have attempted to elucidate this concept further. For example, ʿUmar al-Ashqar states:Tazkiyat al-nafs terminologically means the cleansing of the soul from cor-ruption that intermingles with it and its development with good and blessed things, which is all achieved by the performance of righteous deeds and the leaving of despicable acts. The purifi ed soul (al-nafs al-zakiyya) is the one that has been cleansed in accordance with the sharīʿa of God; it is the good soul (al-nafs al-ṭayyiba) being the one that is deserving of praiseworthy char-acteristics in the worldly life and reward and recompense in the hereafter.127Similarly, Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Qādir Abū Fāris, states, ‘Tazkiyat al-nafs is achieved through cleansing of the soul of polytheism, disbelief, base characteristics and"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 157 despicable acts; it is also achieved through developing the good and the growth of piety in the soul, which is a path that leads to paradise’.128 In an exposition of the singular ḥadīth mentioning this term, Karzūn, summarises, ‘Al-tazkiya: is the cleansing (taṭhīr) of the soul (al-nafs) from being inclined to iniquity and sin and the development of the natural disposition to good within it, which leads to its rec-titude and it reaching the level of spiritual perfection (iḥsān)’.129 Also, Āl ʿAbd al-Laṭīf defi nes the concept succinctly thus: ‘Al-tazkiya linguistically means cleans-ing (al-taṭhīr), growth (al-nimāʾ) and increase (al-ziyāda) but the meaning here is reformation of the soul and its cleansing via benefi cial knowledge, performing righteous deeds and carrying out what has been commanded and refraining from what has been forbidden’.130 Finally, in a more elaborate defi nition, Zarabozo states, ‘Purifi cation of the soul equals the process in which the healthy elements found in the soul are fostered, built upon and added to while any invading contaminants are removed or controlled such that the person worships God properly and fulfi ls his purpose in life, which can culminate in the ultimate expression of true ihsaan’.131 Upon examining the views of the ʿulamāʾ one cannot help but be impressed by the rich variety that is found, regarding both the terms ‘tazkiya’ and ‘nafs’, as well as their compound derivative. It must be said, however, that little has been for-warded in this section regarding the term ‘tazkiya’. Many of the scholarly opin-ions are somewhat repetitive, particularly in their exposition of the linguistic usage of the term and it remains very much with the realms of to grow and fl ourish (namā), or to increase and augment (zād), which indicates an overall process of development, which could be termed ‘purifi cation’ in the broad sense. Having said this, their interpretation of these implications in the Islamic paradigm does yield an interesting response. For example, as we have seen, Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328) develops this theme not just to mean the positive sense of ‘growth’ and ‘development’ but quite astutely observes that this process of development will not occur with the presence of negative infl uences. Indeed, the ‘cultivation’ simile is a common feature of the literature on this point, the negative qualities of sin and iniquity being likened to the ‘weeds’ that endanger the growth of any ‘crop’. Furthermore, there is a tendency to a very practical approach to the topic, being represented in an absolute and complete implementation of Islam at its every level, from issues of belief to physical acts of worship, to seemingly ‘beat’ the nafs into submission. This ‘broad scope’ of tazkiya, as Islahi suggests, needs to permeate every aspect of the human being; this encompasses not only the soul but also the intellect (al-ʿaql), actions, relationships, interactions and the very con-sciousness of a person’s humanity. Consequently, tazkiya is represented as an absolute method to reform the human state, which is the very goal of revelation. On examining the concept of the nafs, which by now we can comfortably equate to the human soul, we fi nd – somewhat expectedly – a much more diverse set of views. The very nature of the soul, its vague description and almost ineff-able quality, have occupied the minds of thinkers and ideologues for millennia and consequently it is not surprising that Islam’s scholarly elite have also engaged in this debate. Thus, almost every section of Muslim scholarship provides discus-sions whether they be of theologians or philosophers, or Sufi s and jurists. The rich"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"158 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamvariety of this debate can easily be seen in Ibn Abū ’l-ʿIzz’s (d. 792/1390) intro-ductory paragraph before discussing the theological view of the soul, where many non-Islamic infl uences seem equally evident. It may be said that when examining would-be defi nitions of the soul, such efforts often enlighten our concept of the soul rather than facilitating a defi nitive view of it. In fact, one may argue that attempting to defi ne the soul is a thankless task, let alone a near impossible one. The Qurʾān itself alludes to the ineffability of the human soul, in an incident where the Prophet is reported to have been asked regarding the soul, the Qurʾān responds (17: 85), ‘They ask you concerning the soul (al-rūḥ), say: the soul is the concern of my Lord and you [mankind] have been given nothing more than a little knowledge’. This verse is particularly poign-ant, as it not only affi rms the fact that both the soul and, consequently, its purifi ca-tion are concerns of the divine but also that whatever knowledge mankind has regarding the soul can only be a fraction of the true knowledge of its nature. Despite this, however, where the Qurʾān is particularly informative is regard-ing the description of the soul, its attributes and its states. In this particular fi eld the Sufi s have concentrated a great deal of effort; their entire concern has been to oppose the nafs and its every whim. This seems to be due to the fact that they equate the nafs with the base form of the soul, which the Qurʾān terms ‘the soul prone to evil’ (al-nafs la ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ). Consequently, much time is dedicated to discussion of the faults of the soul (āfāt al-nafs), its deception (khudʿa) and the duality of its nature, the goal of these discussions being to enlighten the owner of such a soul to its dangers and to put in place a programme to eliminate such negative qualities. This focus, however, is to the detriment of the other two states of the soul mentioned in the Qurʾān, i.e. the self-reproaching soul (al-nafs al-lawwāma) and the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna), which is the goal of the tazkiya process. In addition, many contemporary scholars have revived the study of tazkiyat al-nafs, seemingly in an attempt to oppose the ‘unorthodox’ nature of many Sufi practices and to accentuate the spiritual element of the Islamic faith. As such, they attempt to revive the practical approach so evident in the writings of scholars such as Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328) and his student, Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyya (d. 751/1350).132 These are useful attempts that provide a valuable addition to the literature, as well as the concept of tazkiyat al-nafs, which is apparent from their defi nitions of these terms.ConclusionAs the title of this book suggests, the main aim of this work is to explore the concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam and draw a comparison between it and the teachings of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī. In conclusion the author, rather than attempting to defi ne the term tazkiyat al-nafs in a strict sense as other writers have, would prefer to present an overview of the understanding of this term as discussed in this chapter. Consequently, it may be suggested that our understand-ing of tazkiyat al-nafs has now developed to mean: the growth, augmentation,"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The concept of tazkiyat al-nafs in Islam 159reform, development and purifi cation of the human soul, via divine guidance, Prophetic example and individual effort, to attain its most elevated form, that of the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna). This process involves the nurturing of its positive potentialities and eradicating its negative inclinations, to bring about its purifi cation (tazkiya) and eliminate its defi lement (tadsiya). This in turn is attained by executing a balanced and integrated process of punitive measures, such as striving against it (mujāhada) and taking it to account (muḥāsaba), as well as implementing both the basic beliefs and practical actions of Islam, to bring about a richness of the soul (ghinā al-nafs), which is indicative of the soul’s success (falāḥ) in both this life and the next. From an Islamic perspective, the religion of Islam, whether in terms of tenets of faith or legislation, is said to have been completed during the lifetime of the Prophet.133 Despite this, this teaching is thought to have lived on after his death, being preserved in the practice and teachings of his Companions and their Succes-sors, until the Islamic tradition was formalised and codifi ed in the second/eighth and third/ninth centuries. Nevertheless, this tradition, during this period and up until the present day, has had an ethos of informed interpretation and intellectual enquiry. Moreover, Islamic history bears the names of a multitude of theologians, exegetes and jurists who enhanced and enriched this tradition. It is suggested here that the fi eld of tazkiyat al-nafs was no different and in the same way that there were jurists (fuqahāʾ) capable of independent reasoning (ijtihād) known as mujta-hids in the fi eld of jurisprudence, outstanding exegetes (mufassirūn) in the fi eld of Qurʾānic interpretation (tafsīr) and exemplary intellectuals in the fi eld of ḥadīth (muḥaddithūn); there were also exceptional and erudite scholars of tazkiyat al-nafs. One may posit that Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Ḥārith b. Asad al-Muḥāsibī was one such scholar and, furthermore, one may also suggest that he and his works are a case study of how the concept of tazkiyat al-nafs may be implemented. Therefore, the fi nal chapter will discuss al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs in light of the understanding of this concept within the context of the current chapter.Notes 1 See Ibn ʿAbbād, Ismāʿīl, al-Muḥīṭ fī ’l-Lugha, ed.

See Gavin Picken, ‘Tazkiyat al-nafs: the Qur’ānic paradigm’, Journal of Qur’anic Studies, 7 (2,October 2005): 101–27.25 The word nafs here could have the any of the following meanings: ‘[from a single] soul, person, human being . . .’ and refers to the fi rst created man and prophet Ādam. This is signifi cant in itself as in the Islamic tradition God created Ādam as a ‘single nafs’ and then God created his mate from this single nafs; consequently, through a normal procrea-tive process many nafs were produced from a single lineage. Therefore, it is also logical that since the source of humanity is a single nafs, each of the individual human beings who followed would share some form of that humanity and certain qualities, which would be common to all.

The form V derivative, also meaning ‘to purify’ in both the past tense (tazakkā) and in the present tense (yatazakkā), is also used, (20: 76), (35: 18), (79: 18), (87: 14) and (35: 18) and (92: 18) respectively, and alludes to the human being taking the initiative to purify himself from the ‘fi lth’ of disbelief (kufr), polytheism (shirk), ignorance (jahl) and sin (dhanb). It should also be noted that this derivative also exists in a condensed form (yazzakkā) where the tā has been merged (idghām) as found in verses (80: 3) and (80: 7), with a similar connotation. Also, the superlative (azkā) is found on four occasions (2: 232), (18: 19), (24: 28) and (24: 30) with the implication of being ‘purer’ or more ‘pure’. The adjectival derivative is also used in both its masculine (zakī) and feminine (zakiyya) forms in verses (19: 19) and (18: 74) respectively, again with a similar con-nation of ‘purity’ or ‘innocence’ and in fact the feminine form, i.e. (18: 74), being used in conjunction with the word nafs. In addition, the derived noun ‘zakāt’ used as Islam’s monetary duty can be found in 32 verses in various places.

As such, there is a subtle indication of self-recrimination in the worldly life that is private and self-governed, whereas on the Day of Judgement, according to Muslim theology, the censuring will be imposed and extremely ‘public’.62 See Ibn Taymiyya, Tazkiyat al-Nafs, p. 47; al-Jawziyya, al-Rūḥ, p. 262; and Ibn Kathīr, Tafsīr al-Qurʾān al-ʿAẓīm, vol. 4, p. 448.63 See al-Jawziyya, al-Rūḥ, p. 262.64 See al-Ṭabarī, Jāmiʿ al-Bayān fī Taʾwīl al-Qurʾān, vol. 12, pp. 580–4; Ibn Kathīr, Tafsīr al-Qurʾān al-ʿAẓīm, vol. 4, pp. 511–12; al-Qurṭubī, al-Jāmiʿ li Aḥkām al-Qurʾān, vol. 20, pp. 52–4; al-Rāzī, al-Tafsīr al-Kabīr/Mafātīḥ al-Ghayb, vol. 30, pp. 160–2; al-Ālūsī, Rūḥ al-Maʿānī, vol. 15, pp. 345–8; Ibn Taymiyya, Tazkiyat al-Nafs, p. 47; and al- Jawziyya, al-Rūḥ, pp. 256–61.65 See al-Bukhārī, Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, p. 883; al-Ṭabarī, Jāmiʿ al-Bayān fī Taʾwīl al-Qurʾān, vol. 12, pp. 580–1; Ibn Kathīr, Tafsīr al-Qurʾān al-ʿAẓīm, vol. 4, p. 511; al-Qurṭubī, al-Jāmiʿ li Aḥkām al-Qurʾān, vol. 20, pp. 52–3; al-Rāzī, al-Tafsīr al-Kabīr/Mafātīḥ al-Ghayb, vol. 30, pp. 160–1; and al-Ālūsī, Rūḥ al-Maʿānī, vol. 15, p. 345.66 See al-Qurṭubī, al-Jāmiʿ li Aḥkām al-Qurʾān, vol. 20, pp. 52–3; and al-Jawziyya, al-Rūḥ, pp. 256–7."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"164 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam67 Muslim, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, p. 38.68 See al-Ṭabarī, Jāmiʿ al-Bayān fī Taʾwīl al-Qurʾān, vol. 12, pp. 581–3; Ibn Kathīr, Tafsīr al-Qurʾān al-ʿAẓīm, vol. 4, p. 511; al-Qurṭubī, al-Jāmiʿ li Aḥkām al-Qurʾān, vol. 20, pp. 53–4; al-Rāzī, al-Tafsīr al-Kabīr/Mafātīḥ al-Ghayb, vol. 30, pp. 161–2; al-Ālūsī, Rūḥ al-Maʿānī, vol. 15, pp. 345–8; Ibn Taymiyya, Tazkiyat al-Nafs, p. 47; and al-Jawziyya, al-Rūḥ, pp. 256–61.69 See al-Jawziyya, al-Rūḥ, p. 259.70 This is said to be one of the main differences between the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna) and the self-reproaching soul (al-nafs al-lawwāma); whereas the former has gained mastery over its appetites and desires through extreme effort, strong conviction and imposing punitive measures, the latter remains somewhat disposed to the soul inclined to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ), despite its best efforts to over-come it.

See Zarabozo, Purifi cation of the Soul, pp. 73–4.90 It is worth mentioning, however, that the meaning of this ḥadīth is contained in another famous authentic narration known as ḥadīth Jibrīl, where the Prophet is questioned by the angel Gabriel, ‘And inform me of spiritual perfection (iḥsān)’, to which he replies, ‘It is to worship God as if you see Him [and know] that if you do not see Him, He sees you’.

It is also worth mentioning that Ibn Kathīr relates similar narrations regarding the exegesis of verse (91: 8) mentioned above in the Qurʾān section, thus creating the link between Islam’s primary text and the sunna of its Prophet.

Asad al-Muḥāsibī, have now been completed it is appropriate in this fi nal chapter to discuss the concept of tazkiyat al-nafs from al-Muḥāsibī’s perspective, through the medium of his works. In this sense the current chapter will follow a similar structure to that of Chapter 4 where both the terms tazkiyat and nafs were discussed in detail. The major emphasis, however, will be on comparing the teachings of al-Muḥāsibī with the ideas presented in both the Qurʾān and ḥadīth, since, in terms of language, it is not expected that al-Muḥāsibī’s usage of the Arabic language would differ greatly and, similarly, much of what has been presented from the perspective of Muslim scholarship occurred in the post-al-Muḥāsibī period. Consequently, the current chapter will examine the usage of the term tazkiya in the works of al-Muḥāsibī and its various synonyms to establish this scholar’s understanding and usage of the term. Therefore, the analysis here will be con-cerned with the various facets of tazkiyat al-nafs within the works of al-Muḥāsibī, as well as discussing his concept of the term nafs; the qualities of the nafs; the states of the nafs; and the nature of the nafs, as presented in the extant works of this author. In addition, al-Muḥāsibī’s theory and methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs will be examined and the salient features of his approach will be identifi ed.The concept of the term tazkiya within the works of al-MuḥāsibīUpon surveying the works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī, it is of little surprise that the compound term tazkiyat al-nafs is found. However, what is surprising perhaps is the fact that the incidence of this phrase is very rare, occurring only on a few occasions, and what is more surprising is that it is not used at all in the context used thus far in this exposition. Indeed, on each occasion the phrase is used in an exclusively nega-tive context, as alluded to in both the language and Qurʾān sections of Chapter 4, meaning to indicate self-praise, this being considered a blameworthy quality. It is worth noting that al-Muḥāsibī, when discussing this concept, even uses one of the verses mentioned above, namely Qurʾān, verse (53: 32), ‘And do not attribute purity to yourselves’ (wa lā tuzakkū anfusakum), when commenting on the issue of a person attributing ‘purity’ and excellence to himself, particularly regarding religious"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 169practice. Furthermore, he adds the commentary of Zayd b. Aslam (d. 136/754), who is reported to have said that the verse means, ‘And do not attribute innocence to your souls’. In addition, al-Muḥāsibī himself comments in this regard saying that a person who engages in such self-praise (zakkā nafsahu) has indeed been affl icted with self-conceit (al-ʿujb) and consequently does not censure his soul regarding its contradiction of the divine command, which may ultimately lead to his destruction.1 In addition to this usage of the term tazkiya, other derivatives of the form II verb zakkā, are also found, but not in conjunction with the term al-nafs. Indeed, it is almost exclusively used with the term ‘deed’ (ʿamal ), where the phrases ‘pure deed’ (ʿamal zakkī ) and ‘the deeds have been purifi ed’ (zakkat al-aʿmāl/tazkū al-aʿmāl ) are found, seemingly indicating actions of the heart and limbs, which were performed sincerely, being free from any ulterior motive and, as such, are purely for God alone.2 Although the term tazkiya is somewhat of a rarity in the works of al-Muḥāsibī, it is also worth noting that other synonymous terms with similar connotations of ‘cleansing’ and ‘purifi cation’ are also found. One such word is taṣfi ya meaning to ‘clarify, rectify and purify’ and being used in conjunc-tion once more with the term righteous deeds (aʿmāl al-birr), in the sense of being purifi ed from the infl uence of the soul’s appetites (shahawāt).3 In a similar example, we also fi nd another synonymous term to that of tazkiya, which is the word yunqīʾ being derived from al-naqāʾ and once again meaning ‘purifi ed and cleansed’. In this instance al-Muḥāsibī uses this phrase regarding the heart (al-qalb) and denotes its ‘purifi cation’ from the infl uences of the soul (al-nafs), the desires (al-hawā) and the appetites (al-shahawāt).4 Despite this, however, by far the most commonly utilised terms synonymous with that of tazkiya are derivatives of the form I verb ṭahara and include both the form II verbal noun (maṣdar) al-taṭhīr and the equivalent form V conjugation al-taṭahhur, which once again all have the connotation of ‘cleansing, purging and purifi cation’. One of these derived phrases in particular, al-ṭahāra, seems to indi-cate a highly desired state of purifi cation as both the true believers and paradise are referred to as being ‘the people of purity’ (ahl al-ṭahāra) and ‘the abode of purity’ (dār al-ṭahāra) respectively.5 This term is also used for those wishing to ‘purify’ themselves ‘before meeting their Lord’ via repentance (al-tawba) and regret (al-nadm) for the defi lement (al-danas) of every sin (al-dhanb), transgres-sion (al-ithm) and evil deed (al-sayyiʾa) committed by the heart and the limbs and also, by turning away from all that God hates (al-ināba).6 In fact al-Muḥāsibī considers this so important that he states:The best and most benefi cial of virtues is that you consider your soul (nafsuka) lesser than its true position; that your inward (sarīra) be better than your outward (ʿalāniya) and that you are just to people without requesting justice for yourself, as there can only be purifi cation (taṭhīr) and then action (ʿamal ) and purifi cation is more appropriate for us than action. Purifi cation (taṭhīr) is to move away from all evil (al-sharr) to the foundation upon which all good (al-khayr) is built, as a building may collapse but the foundations will remain"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"170 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamintact and equally, it is impossible that the foundations collapse and the building remains intact.7Similary, he exhorts his readers thus: ‘My brothers, scrutinise the hidden aspects of the soul and the secrets of the hearts and purify them (ṭaharūhā) from enmity, envy, rancour, malice, having a bad opinion [of someone], animosity and hatred’.8 Therefore, we can see that even though the works of al-Muḥāsibī are not a rich source of the word tazkiya, they not only contain a great many synonymous terms and concepts, which are comparative to those already discussed regarding the prin-ciple of tazkiyat al-nafs, but also in many ways are closely identifi ed with them.The facets of tazkiyat al-nafs within the works of al-MuḥāsibīIt will be remembered from the previous chapter that from the Qurʾānic perspec-tive the process of tazkiya was a multifaceted and multilayered process, involving three main elements: the divine, the prophetic and the human being. Upon survey-ing al-Muḥāsibī’s works, we fi nd that there is defi nite reference to these three facets of tazkiya. Regarding the divine element of tazkiya, al-Muḥāsibī places so much emphasis on this that he holds the beginning of the aspirant’s path to God is that He makes him aware of the desires of his own soul, so that he is able to make it submissive to the wishes of his Lord.9 Even more important, however, is that al-Muḥāsibī lays great emphasis on supplicating to God (al-duʿā) for His bounty and assistance in attempting to make both the soul and its desires subservient to His command.10 One of the most eloquent of examples of this is his admonition of the soul where he addresses it directly:Woe unto you (wayḥaki)! Seek shelter (istaʿīnī ) in the Most Merciful of those who are merciful and raise your complaint to the Most Generous of those who are generous! Continually seek His aid and do not become weary due to the extent of your grievance, so that perhaps He may have mercy upon your weakness and answer you. Indeed, your disaster has been magnifi ed, your affl iction intensifi ed and your call unanswered; all of your stratagems have been undone and so there is no place to fl ee, no shelter [to be sought], no escape [from God’s anger] and no saviour except your Lord.11Therefore, it is clear to see that al-Muḥāsibī does not underestimate the divine element in the process of tazkiya but rather apportions it a vital role. The seeking of God’s aid is not only restricted to the soul, however, but also to the negative effect that the Devil has on it:And fl ee to God the Exalted and seek shelter in Him regarding all of your actions and demonstrate your poverty, your desperate need and your refuge in Him, as you have no stratagem [to save you] and there is no power save through Him. And ask God the Exalted to give you victory over him [Satan] through striving and fi nding pleasure in weeping and humility, by day and by"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 171night, secretly and openly, privately and publicly, until combating your soul becomes insignifi cant in your eyes because of your knowledge of your adversary [i.e. Satan] and due to God granting you success, as indeed he [i.e. Satan] is the enemy of your Lord.12Thus, reliance on God and seeking his assistance (al-istiʿāna/al-istghātha) is seem-ingly a recurrent theme within al-Muḥāsibī’s works as he continuously exhorts his readers to undertake this vital form of worship.13 From these sample texts alone it becomes clear that al-Muḥāsibī was not only aware of this divine contribution to the process of purifi cation but also gave it precedence when approaching the topic of reforming the soul. In this regard he was clearly of the opinion that the disciplin-ing of the nafs would not take place, fi rst of all, if God did not will it and grant it and, secondly, if the human exponent of tazkiya did not put his complete trust in his Lord and seek His aid upon such a path. Thus, we can conclude that al-Muḥāsibī was entirely aware of the Qurʾānic perspective on this issue, as his perspective is congruent with the concepts seen in the previous chapter. We also fi nd a number of references in the works of al-Muḥāsibī regarding the second element of the process of purifi cation, i.e. the role of divinely chosen mes-sengers sent with revelation to guide aspirants on the path to God. The fi rst of these examples was seen in the previous discussion concerning the divine element as we saw that al-Muḥāsibī consistently encourages the seeking of God’s help in purifying the soul via supplication – an act that was equally encouraged by the Prophet. Similarly, it was also seen while discussing al-Muḥāsibī’s scholarly background that he was known for his transmission of ḥadīth and upon examining his works we fi nd that this was far from being a purely academic exercise, as he utilises such narrations to add authenticity to the discussion and, more importantly, to act as a source of guidance for his readers.14 Indeed, al-Muḥāsibī encourages the examination and study of the knowledge associated with the narrations of the Prophet, since this has a direct effect on the soul, being an alternative to the mundane, worldly and quite often sinful discourse offered by the rest of humankind.15 His encouragement does not stop there, however, as he also enjoins strict adherence to the Prophetic practice (ittibāʿ ), this being the criterion with which all actions should be judged.16 In this regard he provides his own understanding of the term ‘sunna’:As for being correct (al-ṣawāb) it is the sunna; and by the sunna I do not mean excessive prayer, fasting or charity, nor [do I mean by the sunna] the intellect or understanding, nor peculiar wisdom, nor eloquence or admonition but rather, strict adherence and submission to the book of God and the practice of his Prophet and the rightly guided imams who came after him.17Moreover, the process of tazkiya by virtue of prophetic guidance is not only restricted to adherence to the Prophetic practice but al-Muḥāsibī also introduces a second concept in this regard, which may be termed ‘emulation of the Prophet’ (al-taʾassī bi ’l-rasūl ). This emulation is not merely a ‘blind following’ and"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"172 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamdiffers from strict adherence in the sense that al-Muḥāsibī intends that one should emulate the Prophet in his every action, not simply because one is commanded to do so but rather out of love and reverence for him. This may be considered a par-ticularly useful device in cleansing the soul as someone who undertakes such emulation prefers the actions, motives and practice of the Prophet to that of his own and, as such, leaves his nafs no portion from its needs, whims and desires. Furthermore, al-Muḥāsibī considers this to be the characteristic of the knowledge-able, spiritual guide and it is such people who should be followed and indeed he quotes this as being one of the attributes of the scholars of the hereafter (ʿulamāʾ al-ākhira), whom he sought in his youth and whom he eventually found.18 Thus once again it would seem that al-Muḥāsibī is following a similar methodology regarding this facet of tazkiya as that seen previously and in this respect is very much within the Islamic paradigm. This leaves the fi nal facet of the process of tazkiya, namely the human being as the individual who is personally responsible for undertaking the task of purifi ca-tion by employing the above-mentioned facets and by exerting his own efforts, in subjecting the negative qualities of his soul and enhancing its positive potential-ity. When surveying the works of al-Muḥāsibī one fi nds that this is by far the most important feature of tazkiyat al-nafs from his perspective. As such, his works have left a rich and insightful account of the human condition and, rather than discuss this important facet of purifi cation at this juncture, it will remain to be seen in the coming sections.The concept of the term nafs within the works of al-MuḥāsibīIt was noted previously that the most common synonymous term associated with the term nafs was the word rūḥ, which may be commonly referred to as ‘the soul’ in English. Since the term rūḥ is commonly associated with death, as this occurs when the rūḥ exits the body, it is little surprise that al-Muḥāsibī utilises this term in exactly the same context.19 We fi nd that when discussing the state of an immoral person, al-Muḥāsibī describes such a person thus: ‘Indeed some of them wish that their souls would never be extracted ( yunziʿa nafsuhu)’ and similarly, ‘. . . and then he will know that his weakness will not save him from the punishment of God but unfortunately his soul will be extracted (tanziʿu nafsahu) and then he will ask to return’.20 Therefore, it is easy to see from these two examples that al-Muḥāsibī uses the term nafs to mean its synonym rūḥ in exactly the same way that we have seen it used previously. Further evidence of this is that al-Muḥāsibī also comments on verse (39: 42) and quotes Ibn Jurayj (d. 150/767) in this regard who is reported to have said:The rūḥ and nafs are in the body of a person, being separated by something resembling a ray of sunlight. So if God takes the nafs [during sleep], the rūḥ remains in the body but if God seizes the nafs the rūḥ will also exit the body and if He doesn’t cause the person’s death, He will return the nafs to its place before the person awakes.21"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 173Al-Muḥāsibī then comments, ‘And Ibn al-ʿAbbās made a similar comment except that he termed the nafs the intellect (al-ʿaql )’.22 It is interesting to note here that al-Muḥāsibī quotes a text which differentiates between the rūḥ and nafs but at the same time demonstrates their intrinsic link with each other. Similarly, he follows up this quotation with another explanatory comment from the famous companion and exegete ʿAbd Allāh b. al-ʿAbbās, which we have also already seen regarding the same verse. Although less frequent than the usage of the term nafs to mean rūḥ, we can also locate in the works of al-Muḥāsibī the use of the word nafs meaning the human being’s power of understanding (al-quwā al-mufakkira), as seen in verse (27: 14) and characterised by the phrase, ‘. . . and their souls were convinced of it (wa istayqanathā anfusuhum) . . .’. The use of this concept is limited and, indeed, the exact phraseology differs slightly, being a derivative of the same verb, but nevertheless the concept remains intact, as al-Muḥāsibī comments regarding the self-deluded person (al-mughtarr) concerning the way in which he has deceived himself: ‘Indeed, within his own soul he is absolutely convinced (mūqin)’.23 Another connotation of the term nafs meaning the heart (al-qalb) is compara-tively rare, but nevertheless remains present in the works of al-Muḥāsibī. During the course of al-Muḥāsibī’s discussion concerning the torments and agonies in the hereafter in his work al-Tawahhum, the following phrase is repeated twice, ‘. . . so your “nafs” became constricted in your chest ( fa ḍāqat nafsuka fī ṣadrika) . . .’.24 Since the nafs with its other usages mentioned here is not usually associated with a specifi c locale within the body and, conversely, the position of the heart is exclusively linked to the chest, we can safely assume that Muḥāsibī’s usage of the term nafs in this context means the heart (al-qalb). In addition, the implication of the nafs meaning ‘the inclination to good and evil’ (quwā al-khayr wa ’l-sharr) and hence, the duality of the nafs, is also tangible within the works of al-Muḥāsibī. Since this dual potentiality of the soul will be discussed in more detail in a later section, only a minimal exposition will suffi ce here. In one such example of this, al-Muḥāsibī speaks in broad terms stating, ‘And know that you have been created with the innate quality of good and evil (maṭbūʿ ṭibāʿ ḥasana wa sayyiʾa)’ and further gives a specifi c example of this saying, ‘. . . all of mankind have been created with a natural disposition (ṭubiʿa ʿalā) to heedlessness (al-ghafl a) and attentiveness (al-tayaqquẓ) . . .’.25 Thus, from these two quotes it is easy to see that al-Muḥāsibī understood the very nature of the nafs to have a dual potentiality to both good and evil in the very broad sense and to particular manifestations of these in the specifi c sense. Indeed, his use of language is equally interesting here, as al-Muḥāsibī uses derivatives of the verb ṭabaʿa as if to indicate that these dual qualities are ‘imprinted’ and ‘stamped’ upon the soul and, as such, part of the very make-up of human nature. Furthermore, one may attain knowledge and insight into the potential duality of the nafs, as al-Muḥāsibī also states, ‘And know that whoever was from the people of solicitude with his soul (ahl al-ʿināya bi nafsihi) and had been granted compre-hension of experience, then he has reached the understanding of good and evil (al-khayr wa ’l-sharr) . . .’.26 Therefore, al-Muḥāsibī maintains that, through having care and concern for the soul and understanding of its varying experiences"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"174 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamand conditions, one may be able to differentiate between the two potentialities that exist within it and consequently act appropriately. As for the fi nal connotation of the nafs meaning the human being (al-insān), then this is equally well evidenced in the works of al-Muḥāsibī, so much so that one may even be surprised by the extent of the physicality of the description of the nafs, since it is described variously as having a body ( jism); tongue (lisān); tears (dumūʿ ); speech (lufẓ); silence (sukūt); nourishment ( ghidhāʾ) and nakedness (ʿawra). This notion is extended even further as al-Muḥāsibī also attributes to the nafs a heart (qalb), intellect (ʿaql ), a conscience (ḍamīr) and even a soul (nafs).27 Thus, we may also safely assume that, bearing in mind both the physical ‘exoteric’ and the hidden ‘esoteric’ aspects of the nafs as described in his works, al-Muḥāsibī clearly means the human being as a whole in his every attribute.28The qualities of the nafs within the works of al-MuḥāsibīIn addition to the various concepts of the nafs that can be identifi ed within the Qurʾān as discussed in the previous chapter, it was also seen that there are a variety of qualities and attributes which can also be identifi ed with the human soul. When examining the works of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī, we can also identify the vast majority of these qualities and, as such, we can see that the nafs: experiences death29; has perceptive faculties30; has needs (al-ḥājāt/al-maṭālib)31; experiences diffi culty and hardship (al-mashaqqa)32; can exhibit generosity (al-jūd) and miser-liness (al-shuḥḥ)33; experiences anxiety (al-ḍīq) and distress (al-ḥaraj) as well as relaxation (al-ittisāʿ) and tranquillity (al-inshirāḥ)34; is affected by eloquent speech (al-taʾaththur bi ’l-qawl al-balīgh)35; has the ability to comprehend (al-idrāk)36 and the ability to conceal feelings37; all these are observed in the works of our author to a greater or lesser degree. Similarly, the qualities of the nafs specifi cally seen in the ḥadīth literature, such as wealth of the soul (ghinā al-nafs)38 and the good soul (al-nafs al-ṭayyiba) vis-à-vis the despicable soul (al-nafs al-khabītha),39 are also identifi able within the discussions provided by al-Muḥāsibī. Bearing in mind the great deal of attention al-Muḥāsibī affords to the negative attributes of the nafs, it is little wonder that in his exposition such qualities are mentioned more frequently, and good examples of these are envy and jealousy (al-ḥasad)40 and conceit (al-kibr).41 In addition, it is also worthy of note that the more ‘positive’ qualities of regret (al-nadm), grief (al-taḥassur)42 and fear (al-khawf )43 are equally well represented. Despite this, however, most of the quali-ties of the nafs mentioned thus far are relatively rare in the works of al-Muḥāsibī and so will not be discussed at length here. Conversely, there are qualities of the nafs in the works of al-Muḥāsibī such as the desires (al-hawā) and appetites (al-shahawāt) that are continuously reiterated throughout and therefore, due to their importance, the discussion of the qualities of the nafs within this section will concentrate on these attributes of the soul. Of the above-mentioned qualities of the nafs, perhaps the most commonly mentioned attribute is that of the desires (al-hawā) and indeed this is very much a recurrent theme within al-Muḥāsibī’s works.44 The problematic nature of this"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 175quality of the soul is made extremely clear in the works of al-Muḥāsibī, as it is the primary source and cause of disobedience, being the result of heedlessness, that allows the desires to fl ourish and ultimately cause the corruption of the worship-per’s intentions, motives and deeds.45 In this regard al-Muḥāsibī provides a working defi nition of the desires, which he describes as follows, ‘The attachment of the soul to its appetites (al-shahawāt) and its inclination to ease and comfort. Thus, according to the strength of the appetites, the soul will be affl icted with weakness and then the desires (al-hawā) will overpower it’.46 Consequently, such a person eventually becomes overwhelmed by his desires, becomes dependent upon them and fi nds pleasure in them until hey is eventually consumed by them.47 Thus, the desires are an intrinsic quality of the nafs:If the truth is required of it [al-nafs] it prefers its desires (hawāhā). If the time came for its actions to be tested it clings to its desires, divesting itself of knowledge, insight, the manifest aspects of its intellect and the hidden quali-ties of wisdom. Thus, it withdraws [from action] due to its desires, it acts in accordance with its desires, it becomes angry for the sake of its desires and it is pleased [with something] because of its desires.48Moereover, every good that is lost and every mistaken or incorrect opinion leading to innovation (al-bidʿa) is a result of desires of the soul (hawā al-nafs).49 There-fore, the soul’s desires are pivotal in the growth and production of a number of negative potentialities within it. For example, when asked regarding the esoteric aspects of the world (bāṭin al-dunyā) al-Muḥāsibī replies that it is:Strict adherence to the desires (ittibāʿ al-hawā) that are concealed within souls (al-nufūs), which are consequently pursued by the heart such as: conceit (al-kibr); malice (al-ghill); envy (al-ḥasad); ostentation (al-riyāʾ); having a bad opinion [of someone] (sūʾ al-ẓann); believing in the evil of the con-science (iʿtiqād sūʾ al-ḍamīr); fallacious fl attery (al-mudāhana); the love of praise (ḥubb al-maḥmada); the love of accumulating wealth (ḥubb jamʿ al-māl ); excess (al-takāthur); bragging (al-tafākhur) and the love of rank (ḥubb al-sharaf).50Indeed, the soul’s adherence to this facet is fuelled by high hopes (ṭūl al-amal) and equally the desires of the soul are manipulated by Satan until one becomes a slave to them, being ultimately destroyed by them.51 It is little surprise then that al-Muḥāsibī exhorts his readers to gain mastery over the soul’s desires (ghalabat al-hawā).52 In this regard al-Muḥāsibī does not under-estimate the divine role in the process of purifying the soul of its desires as he sug-gests that it is only through God and through His assistance that the desires can be overcome.53 As for the human being himself, then his greatest weapon against his soul’s desires is his intellect (al-ʿaql ), which God awakens and through which the human being may make his desires subservient by overcoming the emotions of the soul with the light of reason, as al-Muḥāsibī states, ‘The soul awaits its desires and"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"176 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamthe desires await the intellect; so if the intellect restrains them, then they hold back but if it relaxes then they continue onward’.54 Clarifying this further he says, ‘If you want your intellect to be dominant over your desires, then do not rush to fulfi l your appetites until you have considered the outcome, as indeed, it has been said, “regret for fulfi lling one’s appetites remains longer in the heart than the pleasure the heart experiences through fulfi lling its desires”’.55 Consequently, he equally exhorts his readers to: oppose their desires (mukhālafat al-hawā)56; disassociate themselves from their desires (mufāraqat al-hawā)57; to wear down the desires (mukābadat al-hawāʾ)58; combat their desires (mujāhadatal-hawā)59; avoid adhering to the soul’s desires (ittibāʿ al-hawā)60; avoid the desires (mujānibat al-ahwāʾ)61 and repudiate the desires (khalʿ al-hawā),62 all of which indicates how dangerous this facet of the soul is and how important it is to disci-pline the nafs in this regard. It is worth noting here, however, that al-Muḥāsibī’s exposition regarding opposing one’s desires is not only theoretical but rather he also gives practical advice and indicates, in the following text, as to how one should begin this process:The fi rst stage of opposing the desires (mukhālafat al-hawā) is to gain control over one’s stomach, since if the devotee can control his stomach he will have charge of his limbs; he will have full knowledge of his heart; taking his soul to account (al-muḥāsaba) will become easy and he will be able to oppose his soul in everything it desires, if God wills. However, if you lose control of your stomach then the issue will become diffi cult for you, your limbs will go astray, your heart will overstep the bounds and be misguided, you will not truly know your state and you will not be able to take your soul to account.63Similarly, al-Muḥāsibī also provides a number of other devices that help in the process of restricting the desires, such as: remaining silent instead of indulging in vain talk; lowering one’s gaze; avoiding backbiting; the avoidance of indulging in sins and excesses, as well as contemplation and remembrance of God, as all of these acts preoccupy the soul from its desires. Moreover, he gives a full account of how the desires may be weakened in the following excerpt:Persist in: refl ecting upon your past sins; fear regarding the hardship God has imposed upon you because of them; contemplating the resurrection; the ques-tioning; hellfi re and being forbidden paradise, as indeed you will have to answer to all of this. Also persist in: renewing your repentance and intention; caution regarding that which awaits you in the future and forbidding the soul (al-nafs) its pleasures, which its Lord, the Mighty and Exalted dislikes. If it [al-nafs] falters then return quickly and renew your intention and repentance. If you continue with the thought of instilling fear into your soul then your fear will be strengthened and if you continue to refute your soul and be disobedi-ent to it, leaving the entertainment of its desires, then it [al-nafs] will be severed from its habits, despair from you providing it its pleasures and its"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 177appetites will be terminated, as they are not being entertained. However, if you do entertain them [the appetites], you censure it [al-nafs] with fear and grief and then it will be strengthened and become upright upon truthfulness, ascending in the vigilance of God, the Mighty and Exalted, and [ascending] in sincerity to Him.64Thus, we may summarise al-Muḥāsibī’s regarding the desires of the soul in his own words as he states, ‘If the benefi t of the soul (al-nafs) and its welfare lay in that which it desires and wishes for, then all of mankind would be from the right-eous (al-ṣāliḥīn), so consider its reform to be in that which it dislikes and its corruption in that which it loves and wishes for’.65 What is clear from the above discussion of the soul’s desires is the intrinsic relationship between this and another quality of the nafs, that of the appetites (al-shahawāt). Indeed, on surveying the works of al-Muḥāsibī we fi nd that this quality of the soul is mentioned with equally impressive frequency, thus indicat-ing to us the importance that our author gives this facet of the nafs.66 In his exposi-tion of this quality of the soul al-Muḥāsibī relies on both Prophetic guidance through the medium of ḥadīth and the explanation of his Companions to elucidate the dangers of the nafs’s appetites, as the following quote shows:Abd Allāh b. Masʿūd is reported to have said, ‘Do not exceed the limits set by God’ and then he mentioned the ḥadīth of the Prophet, ‘Indeed, paradise is surrounded by unpleasant things and hellfi re is surrounded by appetites (al-shahawāt)’.67 He [Ibn Masʿūd] then commented, ‘Whoever lifted the veil will fall into what is beyond it’, [Al-Muḥāsibī] meaning: whoever exceeded the boundary of hellfi re will fall into it, as its boundary is the appetites and the boundary of paradise is that which is unpleasant68; so whoever went beyond the unpleasant entered paradise and whoever preferred the appetites entered hellfi re and thus it is known that the point of departure (al-maṭlaʿ) is exceeding [the limits] (al-mujāwaza).69In a variation of this ḥadīth, al-Muḥāsibī relates another narration to clarify his point further where the Prophet is reported to have said:Indeed, God the Blessed and Exalted, created hellfi re and said to Jibrīl, ‘Go and look at it’, so Jibrīl went and looked and said, ‘By your Might, no one will hear of it and consequently enter it’. Then it [hellfi re] was surrounded by appetites (al-shahawāt) and He said [to Jibrīl], ‘Go and look at it’, so Jibrīl went and looked and said, ‘By your Might, I fear that there will be no one who didn’t enter it’. Then He created paradise and said [to Jibrīl], ‘Go and look at it’, so Jibrīl went and looked and said, ‘By your Might, no one will hear of it and consequently not enter it’. Then it [paradise] was surrounded by unpleasant things (makārih) and He said [to Jibrīl], ‘Go and look at it’, so Jibrīl went and looked and said, ‘By your Might, I fear that there will be no one who will enter it’.70"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"178 Spiritual Purifi cation in IslamAl-Muḥāsibī then comments, ‘So whoever leaves what his heart desires (yahwā qalbuhu) and his soul wishes for (tashtahī nafsuhu) from that which his Lord, the Mighty and Exalted, dislikes then he has protected himself from hellfi re and brought about proximity to God’.71 As with the soul’s desires (al-hawā), the appe-tites of the soul (al-shahawāt) are equally destructive and, indeed, there can be only one outcome from pursuing them – annihilation in hellfi re. Consequently, al-Muḥāsibī expends a great deal of effort to explain what the appetites are and also their nature. Seemingly relying on the Qurʾānic verse (3: 14), al-Muḥāsibī enumerates a number of such appetites in the following excerpt, ‘. . . the bodily appetites (shahawāt al-jasad ) are women, children and excess food, drinks, cloth-ing and riding animals. These are all detrimental to abstinence (al-zuhd ) . . .’.72 Thus, al-Muḥāsibī describes the bodily, carnal and ‘physical’ appetites, which he commonly terms ‘worldly appetites’ (shahawāt al-dunyā)73 and which are inher-ent in all human beings, but also distinguishes a further ‘esoteric’ or ‘psychologi-cal’ category of appetite that is, in his opinion at least, even more destructive, as the following quote clarifi es:. . . The appetites (al-shahawāt) are not sins (dhunūb) and evil deeds (sayyiʾāt): the appetites are foods; drinks; clothing; buildings; riding animals; women; gold and silver. However, the most destructive of appetites are [craving] status; the love of leadership; establishment of prestige; the attainment of rank; [the desire for] the acceptance [of one’s] command and prohibition; the fulfi lment of needs; the love of good reputation among neighbours, friends and brothers and to be praised for the righteous deeds one has performed.74Therefore, all human beings are not only subject to a variety of ‘physical’ appe-tites, many of which are part of human innate nature,75 but also a variety of ‘psy-chological’ appetites, which are hidden and much harder to identify.76 This is, therefore, what al-Muḥāsibī terms ‘hidden appetites’ (al-shahawāt al-khafi yya), which are concealed within the soul and which he contrasts with the ‘manifest’ appetites (al-shahawāt al-ẓāhira) that are the focus of the body. The danger of such ‘hidden’ appetites is that a person may well exhibit the outward manifesta-tion of righteousness, but inwardly may be affl icted with other ailments, which have a detrimental effect on the individual’s sincerity to God, as al-Muḥāsibī explains: ‘This does not become clear except through knowledge that indicates the nature of his intention, as they [al-shahawāt] are hidden and concealed from the person undertaking the act if he is not illuminated by knowledge’.77 Apart from the hidden aspects of the appetites, which by default makes them treacherous, the appetites are also subject to many of the factors that affect the desires (al-hawā). For example, the appetites are a product of heedlessness (al-ghafl a) and forgetfulness (al-sahw) and are increased by entertaining high hopes (ṭūl al-amal). Similarly, the soul by its very nature is given to its appetites being agitated (hayajān) and stimulated ( jayyāsh) and, once again, Satan duly obliges by instigating the appe-tites by inviting the soul to them.78 Indeed, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that the soul takes pleasure in (ladhdha) and enjoys the ‘sweetness’ (ḥalāwa) of its"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 179appetites79 and thus, if denied one of them, it immediately seeks out another, as al-Muḥāsibī observes: ‘The soul, if it is forbidden from certain categories of appetites (abwāb al-shahawāt), then it will seek other appetites for its enjoyment, as a substi-tute for the appetites and pleasures it has been prevented from’.80 Despite the complex nature of this adversary, al-Muḥāsibī remains undeterred and indeed in a similar fashion to the way in which he deals with the desires (al-hawā), he urges his readers to: be cautious from falling into the enticements of the appetites81; oppose the soul’s desires (mukhālafat al-shahawāt)82; to combat their appetites (mujāhadat al-shahawāt)83; to wear down their appetites (mukābadat al-shahawāt)84; overcome their desires (ghalabat al-shahawāt)85; avoid their desires (mujānabat al-shahawāt)86; be fearful of the voraciousness of the appe-tites (ḍarāwat al-shahawāt)87 and to have enmity towards their appetites (al-bughḍ li ’l-shahawāt).88 Similarly, one of the consistent counsels that al-Muḥāsibī gives is to abandon one’s appetites (tark al-shahawāt) for God’s sake, so as to be safe from their harm and, indeed, this again is one of the attributes of the guiding scholars whom he sought in his youth.89 Furthermore, as with the desires of the soul (al-hawā), al-Muḥāsibī’s exposi-tion of the soul’s appetites is not just a theoretical presentation but rather he also gives practical advice: ‘The most effective way to mortifi cation of the appetites is to maintain grief (al-ḥuzn) in the heart’.90 In a similar quote, he advises, ‘Avert the sudden occurrence of appetites with grief (al-ḥuzn) and regret (al-nadāma) for the fulfi lment of previous appetites, whose pleasures have been gratifi ed but whose consequences have remained with you’.91 Therefore, we can assume that maintaining and inculcating grief (al-ḥuzn) into the nafs is a major goal in al-Muḥāsibī’s system of purifying the soul from the negative quality of its appetites. Another measure that al-Muḥāsibī suggests is the imposition of hunger (al-jūʿ), which he considers a valuable method of severing the soul from its appe-tites (qaṭʿ al-shahawāt). If done sincerely for God, the divine element of tazkiya also plays a role, since God then causes such a person to ‘taste’ the ‘fl avour’ of divine love and the ‘sweetness’ of conversing with Him, which in turn further severs him from his desires. Consequently, the carnal pleasures of the appetites are replaced with the spiritual delights of divine satisfaction.92 Thus, the greater the extent to which the soul is disciplined (taʾdīb) the easier it is for the individual to reject his soul’s desires (rafḍ al-shahawāt).93 In this regard, al-Muḥāsibī comments: ‘Indeed, the appetites (al-shahawāt) are a mere amusement (liʿb), but if amusement exists, then seriousness is absent. However, the world will not exist and religion (al-dīn) will not be reformed except through being serious’.94 Therefore, for al-Muḥāsibī the purifi cation of the soul and its disciplining regarding its appetites is a pinnacle feature of spiritual life upon which the very status of religion is dependent.States of the nafs within the works of al-MuḥāsibīDuring the discussion of the human soul it was discovered that, from the Qurʾānic perspective, the soul may experience three states, namely the tranquil soul"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"180 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam(al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna), the self-reproaching soul (al-nafs al-lawwāma) and the soul inclined to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ). Upon surveying the works of al-Muḥāsibī for the phrase ‘the tranquil soul’ (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna), one does not fi nd exact wording but only derivatives of it. For example, when discussing the importance of intimately knowing the soul al-Muḥāsibī states:So if you gained knowledge of it [al-nafs] you will increase in love and affection for God and in hatred and enmity for it; similarly [you will increase in] trust and confi dence in God, the Magnifi cent and Exalted, and in despair of it. Likewise, you will increase in tranquillity towards God (ṭumaʾnīna ilā Allāh) and in cautiousness concerning it.95On the same theme al-Muḥāsibī also states, ‘And whoever gained knowledge of his soul (ʿarafa nafsahu) then self conceit (al-ʿujb) will leave him, his gratitude to God will increase and his cautiousness regarding it [al-nafs] and his tranquillity and his trust in his Master will be intensifi ed’.96 This is not exclusively an attribute for the worldly existence, however, as when clarifying the state of the believer who has been informed of their admittance into paradise post-mortem in the grave, al-Muḥāsibī describes him as follows: ‘. . . and so your soul will fi nd tranquillity with God (taṭmaʾinnu ilā Allāh nafsuka)’.97 Moreover, during the exposition of the tranquil soul, it was seen that reason behind the soul being described as ‘tranquil’ was the satisfaction (riḍāʾ) of both parties – the divine and the human – with one another and in particular the human being’s satisfaction with divine predestination and predetermination (al-qaḍāʾ wa ’l-qadar). When surveying the works of al-Muḥāsibī we also fi nd a great deal of emphasis laid on these qualities.98 For example, when asked regarding the meaning of al-riḍāʾ he replies, ‘It is the satisfaction of the heart with the “bitterness” of divine predestination’,99 and with regard to the manifestation of al-riḍāʾ in reality he reiterates, ‘It is satisfaction with divine predestination, meaning: the compo-sure of the heart regarding the judgement of God and to entrust (al-tafwīḍ ) [all affairs] to God before satisfaction (al-riḍāʾ) and to be satisfi ed after having entrusted [all affairs to Him]’.100 Thus, we can conclude that even though al-Muḥāsibī does not use the specifi c phrase al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna, the concept was not alien to him and indeed, when dealing with the human soul, the quality of tranquillity and serenity (al-ṭumaʾnīna) is seen to be an attribute of the person who has truly understood the nature of the nafs and consequently gained success in the hereafter because of it. Similarly, he also exhorts his readers to the qualities that will bring about the reformation of the soul until its reaches a state of ‘tranquillity’, namely al-riḍāʾ with divine predestination, which in turn results in the pleasure of God. This is further evidenced by the following excerpt which is an intuitive descrip-tion of the tranquil soul:So when his [the believer’s] state changes and it [al-nafs] deems agreeable that which it used to be averse, found pleasant that which it found to be"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 181 distasteful and was abstinent concerning that which it desired, then his heart will be purifi ed. As such, his heart will be illuminated with certainty in the hereafter and he will witness in his mind that which is unseen in the next life. Then, the exaltation of God will be strengthened in his heart, his fear of Him and hope in Him will be intensifi ed and his shame in front of God will be awakened. Moreover, he will be irritated by every barrier that prevents him from proximity to his Lord and every issue that preoccupies him with other than Him.101If mention of the tranquil soul is rare, then mention of the self-reproaching soul (al-nafs al-lawwāma) is even rarer, as it is not mentioned by name even once in the works of al-Muḥāsibī. Despite this, however, we can deduce some inference to the self-reproaching soul in a limited number of examples in al-Muḥāsibī’s works. The fi rst of these describes the actions of someone who has just come to the realisation of the true nature of his soul and his past misdeeds and, as such, al-Muḥāsibī describes his state thus:And when this has become clear to him, he will know that in being obedient to it [the nafs] lies his perdition on the Day of Judgement and in being diso-bedient to it lies his salvation in the hereafter and that it has habitually attempted to destroy him, becoming accustomed to extended reticence and aversion to that which pleases his Lord.102In a similar example, al-Muḥāsibī describes the course of action of such a person as follows: ‘So then he rebukes it [the nafs], reminding it of its sins; he then strikes fear into it that it may have incurred [God’s] wrath because of them and that it did not perform its duty to Him as He truly deserves and also, as it does not know in what state it will die. Consequently, it became submissive, fearful, trembling and humbled’.103 Moreover, although al-Muḥāsibī does not mention the self-reproaching soul (al-nafs al-lawwāma) by name, he does describe its state and the circumstances that bring about this state. Therefore, the description of the nafs given above is neither the base state of the soul inclined to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) but nor is it the elevated state of the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna) and thus we can conclude that it is an intermediate state where the soul begins to blame itself for the transgression it has committed, inclining towards repentance, regret, self-recrimina-tion and reproach, these being salient features of the self-reproaching soul (al-nafs al-lawwāma). Bearing in mind the importance that al-Muḥāsibī gives to the discussion of the negative qualities of the nafs in general and of the desires and appetites specifi -cally, as seen in the last section, it is little wonder that of the three states of the nafs related in the Qurʾān by far the most common in the works of al-Muḥāsibī is the third and fi nal state, the soul inclined to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ). Indeed, al-Muḥāsibī makes mention of this form of the soul in both terms of concept and exact phraseology and this is indicative of the importance that al-Muḥāsibī gives to this state of the soul and the emphasis he lays on gaining"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"182 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamknowledge of it, combating it and reforming it.104 Thus, his concentration on dealing with this form of the nafs is due to the fact that, as we have seen, it alludes to the lowest level of the human soul, which not only encourages the performance of evil but also exerts effort to make such actions acceptable and appealing. Thus, the nafs is described as enticing (sawwalat), subjecting (ṭawwaʿat) and tempting (tuwaswis), causing the human being to be overcome by his desires, to the extent that he pursues the appetites of his soul, to the exclusion of everything else. Consequently, the limits set by God are made secondary in comparison to the fulfi lment of his own needs and desires. It is no surprise then that al-Muḥāsibī warns the aspirant on the path to God regarding this state of his soul, from associating with it, being in agreement with it and the effect of its desires on acts of obedience to Him, as the following excerpt clarifi es:And know that I am not suggesting that you abandon the performance of righteous actions, as every action you do not perform today will have no reward tomorrow but, rather, I am warning you concerning the deception of the Satan and the desires of your soul that is inclined to evil (hawā nafsika al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ).105Similarly, al-Muḥāsibī considers this state of the soul so important that he makes it one of the essential elements of his system of intimate knowledge and insight (al-maʿrifa), stressing its importance as follows:And as for intimate knowledge of the soul inclined to evil (maʿrifa al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) then abase it [al-nafs] as God has abased it, describe it as God has described it [i.e. that it is inclined to evil] and attack it with that which God has commanded you, as it is a greater enemy for you than Iblīs, since he gains infl uence over you through it, due to its acceptance of him.106Therefore, a person who has gained such intimate knowledge of his soul has, ‘Comprehended from God that He has described his soul as being inclined to evil (ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) and enticing towards sins (li ’l-dhunūb musawwila) and it is the soul that has performed the transgressions for which his Lord will take him to account’.107 Consequently, having achieved this understanding, the believer who attempts to purify this base form of his soul has:Left the external defects and turned his attention to the internal defects, engaging the soul inclined to evil (al-nafs ammāra). Thus, he disciplines it until it renounces such characteristics and strives against it ( jāhadahā) until it submits, being sincere in combating it (mujāhadatihā) until it becomes righteous. As a result, he will approach his Lord purifi ed, repentant and divested of both external and internal defects.108"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 183 This being the case, from al-Muḥāsibī’s perspective it is the soul inclined to evil that presents the greatest danger in this regard, since it is the biggest factor in the potential destruction of the human being in both this life and in the hereafter and therefore it is the target and goal of tazkiya. Thus, in summary we may quote al-Muḥāsibī, who, when discussing the danger and nature of this state of the soul said, ‘It is suffi cient for you to know that God, the Magnifi cent and Exalted, informed you that it is ever commanding to evil (ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ), except for whomever your Lord had mercy upon and upon whom He bestowed His favours’.109 Once again we may conclude that despite al-Muḥāsibī not always specifi cally mentioning the three states of the soul alluded to in the Qurān, he clearly under-stood the implications of these phrases, being entirely in agreement with them conceptually at least. This is particularly true of the base form of the soul, the soul inclined to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ), which is specifi cally mentioned in his works and which is the focus of his attention due to the danger it poses to the security of the human being and. as such, from his perspective, it is this lowest manifestation of the nafs that must be purifi ed.The nature of the nafs within the works of al-MuḥāsibīIt was observed in the previous chapter that the creator of the human soul is God, as the following verse alludes: ‘O Mankind, fear your Lord Who created you from a single nafs . . .’ (4:1) and it is worth noting that al-Muḥāsibī also understood this point as the following excerpt shows: ‘A person should know that the nature of all souls (al-nufūs) is quite similar. Indeed, all of them are prone to forgetfulness (al-sahw) and heedlessness (al-ghafl a), and that his [the person’s] soul is from the souls of creation, derived from the son of Ādam, peace be upon him’.110 Consequently, when al-Muḥāsibī speaks regarding the nafs it seem that he is virtually referring exclusively to the base form of the soul – al-nafs ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ.111 In understanding the nature of soul, as we have already seen in this chapter, al-Muḥāsibī relies heavily on both of Islam’s revelatory sources, namely the Qurʾān and ḥadith, as well as the opinions of the earliest generations, as the following extended quote indicates, where he is asked about the nafs:Haven’t you heard God, the Exalted’s statement, ‘Indeed, the soul is prone to evil (inna ’l-nafs la ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) [12: 53]’? And His, the Exalted’s state-ment, ‘As for the one who feared the position of his Lord and forbid his soul (nafsahu) its desires (al-hawā) [79: 40]’?112 And in the story of the son of Ādam, ‘Then his soul made the murder of his brother seem appealing (ṭawwaʿat lahu nafsuhu) and so he killed him’ [5: 30]? ‘He [Yaʿqūb] said: indeed your souls have enticed you (sawwalat lakum anfusukum) to some matter, so patience is more befi tting’ [12: 18]? ‘He [Moses] said: And what have you to do with this O Sāmirī?’ until His statement, ‘Thus did my soul entice me (sawwalat lī nafsī )’ [20: 95–6]? In addition, the Prophet, may the peace and blessings of God be upon him, said, ‘You have returned from"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"184 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamthe lesser jihad (al-jihād al-aṣghar) to the greater jihad (al-jihād al-akbar); the struggle against your souls (mujāhadat al-nufūs)’. A man asked the Prophet, ‘What is the best form of jihad?’ and he replied, ‘Your personal struggle against your soul and your desires (mujāhadatuka nafsaka wa hawāk)’. . . . Al-Ḥasan [al-Baṣrī] said, ‘Revive your hearts with the remem-brance of God as indeed, they soon become rusty and vilify these souls (al-anfus) as indeed they are lame (ẓulʿa)’. . . . And the Prophet, may the peace and blessings of God be upon him, and his Companions would seek shelter in God from the evil of their own souls (min shurūr anfusihim) as, indeed, the soul (al-nafs) has the propensity to incline to the fulfi lment of its desires, as long as it has not been ‘etched’ (yaḥfi ruhā) by fear (al-khawf) . . . .113Therefore, it is little surprise that, when discussing the nature of the soul, al-Muḥāsibī expends a great deal of effort to clarify the dissension of the soul (munāzaʿat al-nafs)114; the enticement of the soul (taswīl al-nafs)115; the doubts of the soul (rayb al-nafs)116 and warns against the sinister aspirations (amānī )117 and unrealistic hopes of the soul (irtijāʾ al-nafs),118 as well as the ailments and cure of the soul (daʾ al-nafs wa dawāʾuhā).119 Advancing the exposition of the soul above, which was entirely based upon classical Islamic sources, al-Muḥāsibī provides a no less negative but more ‘psychological’ and ‘introspective’ appraisal when asked about how to have con-tempt (al-izdirāʾ) for the soul:[t]hrough your knowledge of its true position and the evil of its aspirations and deeds. By knowledge of its true position I mean how it was created with a natural disposition and form; how it considers the path to salvation to be burdensome, not out of enmity for salvation but because it despises the impo-sition of hardship and equally despises having to abandon the things it adores from the transient world. Similarly, how it deems insignifi cant that which will bring about its destruction, without having any affection for destruction in the hereafter but, rather, due to its avoiding its pleasures and avoiding its desires therein. This is despite its affi rming that both the reward and punish-ment in the hereafter are greater and more lasting and that both the pleasant and unpleasant aspects of the worldly life are lowly and ephemeral.So despite its knowing and grasping that [the world is] lowly and ephemeral, it still prefers it to the greater and more lasting, not out of denying that [the hereaf-ter] is greater and more lasting but rather, out of preferring something from the transient world, whether it be the fulfi lment of a pleasure, comfort from hardship, or that it be diverted from its passions . . .It is incumbent on someone who has comprehended this from God, the Mighty and Exalted, that if he wants to bring about its [al-nafs] salvation that he never leaves being attentive and contemplative and is never heedless of it or feels secure from it. Indeed, he should divest himself of having a good"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 185opinion of it and be quick to accuse it if it was swift in seeking salvation, due to him knowing that it opposes this and due to what has already occurred in terms of the evil of its aspirations and deeds, as he knows that it considers the path to salvation to be burdensome, considers the path of destruction insig-nifi cant and that it will not submit to the path of salvation except through compulsion and coercion.120Bearing these factors in mind, al-Muḥāsibī warns against the destruction of the soul (halk/talif al-nafs)121; its procrastination (taswīf al-nafs) regarding the performance of righteous acts122; its wickedness (sūʾ al-nafs)123 that leads to it committing offences ( jināyāt al-nafs)124 and the many faults of the soul (ʿuyūb al-nafs),125 which constitute the many things that it conceals and attempts to keep hidden (khabāyā/khafāyā/sarāʾir al-nafs).126 Indeed, the cunning nature of the soul is manifested in the fact that it is given to deception (khidʿat al-nafs),127 deceit and falsehood (kidhb al-nafs)128 and employs subterfuge and various strata-gems (ḥiyal al-nafs)129 to ensure that its appetites and desires are fulfi lled. In this regard he says:Don’t be deceived by what it makes manifest to you, do not hope for what it wishes, if you released it you will have gone astray and if you fulfi lled its request you will be destroyed. If you became heedless of taking it to account, then you will have fl ed [responsibility], if you were unable to oppose it, you will be drowned and if you submitted to its desires you will have been appointed [a place] in the hellfi re. It [the nafs] has no truth and no good can come from it; it is the cause of every tribulation, a treasure trove of disgrace, the vault of Iblīs and the abode of every evil. It is as its Creator described it [i.e. ammāra bi ’l-sū], every time it manifests fear then you are secure, every time it claims to be truthful it is lying and every time it mentions sincerity it is ostentation and self-conceit.130Therefore, even to have empathy for the soul is considered a mistaken approach as he explains, ‘You have mercy on it [al-nafs] but it does not have mercy on you . . . it strives in that which pleases Satan and in that which lies the anger of your Lord’.131 Consequently, it is little surprise that al-Muḥāsibī considers the nafs a deadly adversary and the ‘enemy within’, which is clear from his statement, ‘And take every precaution against your contemporaries (ahl zamānik) and especially against your soul, as indeed, it is your true enemy’.132 Similarly, he clarifi es:So through what God has commanded, be its [al-nafs] adversary opposing that which it invites you to from its desires. Spend all your time in mortifying its desires, burying its wishes and be cautious concerning its aspirations and procrastination. Turn to it repeatedly with disparagement and deprecation, reminding it of its shortcomings, so that perhaps its authority may dwindle and be crushed. May God, the Exalted, aid us and you against it without any punishment from Him! Thus, if you acted to extinguish this ‘darkness’ and"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"186 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamthese despicable characteristics from your heart, you will have become puri-fi ed with your Lord and nothing will defi le your soul (nafsaka).133Thus, al-Muḥāsibī expends very effort to avert his readers from being overcome, conquered and subdued by the soul and its desires (ghalabat al-nafs).134 In summary, we can conclude that al-Muḥāsibī’s view of the soul is heavily grounded in not only his understanding of the revelatory sources of Islam and the tradition of early scholarship but also in his own, personal experience of refl ec-tion, introspection and contemplation. Consequently, he has a highly developed and intricate vision of the nafs, which forms the basis of much of his discourse within the fi eld of Islamic spirituality and mysticism. His theory of the soul revolves around his censuring of its inclination to the fl eeting and ephemeral and its proclivity to relaxation and comfort, these being its outstanding characteristics, which are seemingly ‘imprinted’ upon its nature. Moreover, he sets out to enlighten his readers about these facts and illuminate them to the subtle and precise facets of the soul, so as to ultimately bring about its reform and avoid its destruction.Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafsDue to the nature and importance al-Muḥāsibī lays on the nafs in his works, much of this chapter has been concerned with providing an exposition of his view regarding the human soul and, having done so, it is now time to turn our attention to the way in which al-Muḥāsibī proposes to treat such a soul and, indeed, ulti-mately bring about its purifi cation. Upon surveying the works of al-Muḥāsibī, one fi nds a great many expressions and phrases that may be conceived to relate to what could generally be termed the ‘training’ of the soul. In fact, careful examina-tion of such phrases suggests that despite the almost exclusively ‘negative’ view of the soul that al-Muḥāsibī holds, his approach to disciplining the nafs is not exclusively ‘negative’ also, but includes terminologies which may be broadly considered to be ‘positive’ attitudes to the ‘training’ of the soul. The following discussion attempts to identify and isolate both these ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ approaches employed to bring about the soul’s purifi cation. With regard to the ‘negative’ perspective, one is able to identify a number of concepts that al-Muḥāsibī employs to bring under control the detrimental potentiali-ties within the human soul. These include dispraisal of the soul (dhamm al-nafs)135 for its evil actions and intentions and the pursuit of its desires, the accusation of the soul (ittihām al-nafs)136 due to its deceptive and deceitful nature described above and having contempt for the soul (izdirāʾ al-nafs),137 as it is the ‘enemy within’ and exhibits behaviour that ultimately leads to the human being’s destruction. Similarly, al-Muḥāsibī suggests that the soul be ‘broken’ (inkisār al-nafs),138 through imposing punitive measures upon it (ʿuqūbat al-nafs)139; that the soul be abased (muhānat al-nafs)140 due to its evil nature; that the soul be coerced (ilzām al-nafs)141 towards correct action and, on occasion, he even describes the soul as an enemy combatant that should be fought against (qitāl al-nafs).142"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 187 Of the more common ‘negative’ themes within the works of al-Muḥāsibī is censuring of the soul (muʿātabat al-nafs)143 and in this regard al-Muḥāsibī clarifi es that a person should:. . . Censure his soul regarding its inadequacy (tafrīṭihā) and rebuke it for its committing of sins (dhunūbihā), out of adherence to the command of God, the Mighty and Exalted, to do so. He should also know that he is not consist-ent in this except that God, the Exalted, to Whom he has entrusted his affairs, has caused him to be successful. Thus, it is He Who has destined it for him, awakened him and granted him success to censure his soul.144Furthermore, one of the more severe descriptions is that remembering the torments of the hereafter is a ‘cauterising’ of the soul (taldhīʿ li ’l-nafs).145 More conventional descriptions, however, suggest that the soul be made to proceed cautiously (tathbīṭ al-nafs) by instilling fear into it (al-takhwīf),146 that it be forced to shun (ʿazūf al-nafs)147 the worldly life (al-dunyā), its pleasures (ladhdhātihā) and appetites (shahawātihā), to inculcate wisdom into it (al-ḥikma) by averting it (inṣirāf al-nafs)148 from its nature and restricting it (habs al-nafs) from its desires.149 Conversely, al-Muḥāsibī equally utilises a number of more ‘positive’ terms and concepts regarding disciplining the soul; these include that one should have both care (riʿāyat al-nafs)150 and concern (al-ʿināya bi ’l-nafs)151 for the soul; counsel and exhort the soul (waṣīyat/naṣīḥat al-nafs)152; be concerned with its state (al-ishtighāl bi ’l-nafs)153 and even on occasion have gentleness with the soul (al-rifq bi/al-shafaqa ʿalā ’l-nafs).154 Similarly, al-Muḥāsibī frequently attempts to bring out the generosity of the soul (sakhāʾ al-nafs)155 and, as well as instilling fear into the soul regarding God’s punishment and its own destruction, also encourages his readers to instil hope into the soul (rajjāʾ al-nafs)156 that its repent-ance be accepted and God’s satisfaction be attained. Indeed, another feature of al-Muḥāsibī’s discourse is the reformation of the soul (iṣlāḥ al-nafs),157 regarding which he says, ‘And be carefully observant concerning your aspiration and pre-occupy yourself with the reformation of your soul (iṣlāḥ nafsika) rather than being concerned with the faults of others, since it used to be said, “It is suffi cient a fault in a person that he brings to light in people that which is hidden from himself in his own soul”’.158 Furthermore, when clarifying the initial stage of the process of reformation of the soul and explaining its true position, al-Muḥāsibī says, ‘The fi rst thing that is incumbent upon you with regard to reformation of your soul – which will not be reformed by any other means and which is the beginning of ‘concern’ (al-riʿāya) – is that you know that it [al-nafs] is an indentured slave’.159 In making the soul realise this reality and the reality of its state, al-Muḥāsibī once again employs the intellect encouraging his readers to look closely at this intrinsic part of humanity (naẓar ilā al-nafs bi ’l-ʿaql ),160 such that it acts as a protection (ḥirāsat al-nafs),161 guarding over the soul’s treachery and deception. In addition, however, the reformation of the soul ultimately requires not only ‘rational’ exami-nation but also ‘physical’ action and in this regard al-Muḥāsibī suggests spiritual"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"188 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamexercises (riyāḍat al-nafs)162 for the soul with the goal of weaning it from its habits (ifṭām al-nafs)163 and bringing about its rectitude (istiqāmat al-nafs).164 Thus, in summary al-Muḥāsibī introduces a number of terms and concepts, both punitive and progressive in an integrated manner, according to the state, condition and qualities of the soul, to nurture it and develop it and ultimately bring about its purifi cation. This being as it may, these terms are relatively rare when compared to other concepts presented in the works of al-Muḥāsibī and, as such, are only part of the story regarding his methodology of purifying the soul. Indeed, al-Muḥāsibī himself alludes to other, more important methods in the following text regarding how to deal with the soul: ‘It is incumbent upon you to oppose it (mukhālafatihā), take it to account (muḥāsabatihā), be knowledgeable concern-ing it (maʿrifatihā) and strive against it (mujāhadatihā) . . .’.165 This being the case, it is equally vital that these concepts also be examined.Intimate knowledge of the soul (maʿrifat al-nafs)As the above quote indicates, one of the principal features of al-Muḥāsibī’s teach-ing is intimate knowledge of the soul (maʿrifat al-nafs) and, indeed, it is a recur-rent theme throughout his works.166 Similarly, as we have seen previously, al-Muḥāsibī considers this aspect of the soul so important that he makes it one of the essential elements of his system of intimate knowledge and insight (al-maʿrifa). It may seem entirely obvious to indicate that one requires a certain amount of knowledge of a thing before one may begin to understand it and, indeed, in this case set about its purifi cation. Yet, as the discussion so far has alluded, the nafs is a particularly unique adversary, since it dwells hidden deep within the nature of humankind and, this being the case, its faults and hence their elimination are espe-cially diffi cult to identify. To this effect, al-Muḥāsibī has seemingly spent the better part of his scholarly career in attempting to elucidate and verify this esoteric knowledge (ʿilm al-bāṭin), so that his peers and the latter-day Muslim community may be fully aware of the dangers of their own souls and the terrible consequences of ignoring such dangers. Thus, when asked regarding intimate knowledge of the soul (maʿrifat al-nafs), al-Muḥāsibī replied:You have asked about the ‘root’ (ʿaṣl) of all good and evil and its branches ( furūʿihimā), its outward and its inward, what is known of it and what is unknown. You have asked about a knowledge that no one can endure these days and whoever does endure it, does so only verbally, as they cannot endure action. This is because in this knowledge there is patience, hardship, strug-gling against outward and inward evil, enduring outward and inward good, which is the reality of sincerity in word and deed, true repentance, continuous grief and contemplation of the hereafter. How impossible it is that the servant will reach the knowledge of the faults of his soul (ʿuyūb nafsihi), except through extensive knowledge and use of the intellect, unequivocal understanding, profound wisdom and penetrating insight.167"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 189Therefore, refl ecting on this quote from al-Muḥāsibī, it is easy to see the great emphasis that he places on this facet of the purifi cation process, as he deems it to be the essence of distinguishing between good and evil, which is also seemingly an indication of the dual potentiality within the soul. Consequently, it is only through an intimate and erudite understanding of the soul that such potentialities will be distinguished. At the same time, however, due to the struggle and effort required in undertaking the study of this knowledge and its consequent implementation, al-Muḥāsibī also informs us that there are very few people who adopt such a path. Indeed, this path requires that every motive and action be examined through utilis-ing not only the knowledge gained but also every asset of the perceptive faculties to reach the true nature of the human soul. Thus, despite the diffi culties of acquir-ing intimate knowledge of the soul (maʿrifat al-nafs), it is an essential fi rst step in the purifi cation process, as without it the aspirant upon the path to God could not possibly hope to succeed. No one can even begin to purify his soul, therefore, without fi rst attaining some familiarity with it and, in this regard, al-Muḥāsibī says, ‘If a person didn’t know the faults of his soul (ʿuyūb nafsihi), then came to know them and rejected them, then he will be truly repentant’.168 The implication of this is that true repentance – often regarded by Sufi s to be the fi rst stage on the mystical path169 – cannot take place until knowledge of the soul’s defects is comprehended and consequently, they are rejected. Indeed, by this statement al-Muḥāsibī alludes to another com-pletely different concept of repentance, in the sense that repentance is customarily associated with the expiation of sins, whereas here al-Muḥāsibī suggests that one should fi rst eliminate the cause of the sin in the fi rst place – the faults of the soul. Therefore, the concept of purifi cation commonly associated with repentance, i.e. that one is ‘cleansed’ from one’s sins, is taken a step further to mean the ‘cleans-ing’ of the cause of the sin, which therefore extends the scope of purifi cation to a new level. Indeed, this is one of the reasons why repentance (al-tawba) has not been included here in al-Muḥāsibī’s theory of tazkiya, even though it is com-monly associated with the ‘cleansing’ process. This is because al-Muḥāsibī, as alluded to here, seems to have been concerned with a completely different form of purifi cation – that of identifying the defects of the soul and consequently purify-ing them so that the incidence of sin would be minimal in the fi rst place and, as such, the need for repentance was equally limited. In this context, the consequences of al-Muḥāsibī’s understanding of maʿrifat al-nafs are often far-reaching, as the following excerpt indicates:You will not be sincere to God until you are sincere to your own soul; and you will not be sincere to your own soul until you know it well; and you won’t know it well until you examine closely and subject it to [remembering] death and the display in front of God, then its [true] states will be made mani-fest; and its [true] states will not be made manifest until you accuse it regard-ing that which it considers itself righteous therein and judge it according to its misdeeds. If you have accused it, then you have examined it and if you have examined it, then its [true] states will be made manifest. If its [true] states"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"190 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamhave been made manifest, then you will also know its pretence, deception and deceit. So if you came to know it well you would be cautious concerning it; and if you were cautious concerning it, you will have scrutinised it; and if you have scrutinised it, you will see the true nature of its fl ight from the obedience of its Lord, the Mighty and Exalted, and its simulation of that which its Lord dislikes, as it is the treasure trove of every evil and the inviter to every affl ic-tion. Its Creator, the Mighty and Exalted, has informed you that it is ever inclined to evil (bi ’l-sūʾ ammāra), so take every precaution regarding it and accuse it for the sake of your religion.170According to this account of al-Muḥāsibī’s conceptualisation of maʿrifat al-nafs, the very essence of religious practice – sincerity to God – is intrinsically related to the intimate knowledge of the soul, as sincerity of word and deed will not be attained except through this facet of purifi cation. The acquisition of intimate knowledge of the soul is equally dependent, however, on subjecting the nafs to precise examination and scrutiny, through which its true nature of deception and deceit is known. Once a person has gained an understanding of these qualities of the soul, this in turn instils caution into him regarding it, which causes him to strive against it, further purifying it. Therefore, maʿrifat al-nafs, as al-Muḥāsibī views it, is also a multifaceted, multilayered process that has many positive con-sequences in dealing with the human soul and, indeed, he regards it as being pivotal to the essence of religious praxis. The results of this ‘essential knowledge of the soul’ also become clear in the following text taken from al-Muḥāsibī’s work that specifi cally deals with the concept of maʿrifa:So if you come to know it, it will become contemptible [in your eyes] and you will have gained infl uence over it. Thus, if these three qualities existed in you,171 then remain steadfast and seek God’s aid in maintaining them and do not be heedless. Then, if you managed to discipline your soul (adab al-nafs) and oppose it (mukhālafatihā) in that which it desires and wishes for, you will be strong in all characteristics, if God wills.172Thus, once one has gained a knowledge of the soul, its true nature becomes mani-fest, i.e. that it is lowly and despicable and, as such, once this is known the soul will hold no infl uence, since one is under no illusion as to the claims it makes nor the deceptions it attempts to mask. However, this particular quote is also signifi -cant from two other perspectives; fi rst, that this is not the result of a singular effort but rather it requires continual, renewed perseverance and steadfastness, and sec-ondly, even though one was characterised by the above-mentioned attributes, the divine role in tazkiya remains constant as this whole process will be impossible without God’s assistance. Therefore, in summary we may conclude that intimate knowledge of the soul (maʿrifat al-nafs) is an essential and intrinsic, primary facet of al-Muḥāsibī’s vision of the soul’s purifi cation – a fact to which both the discussion in this chapter"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 191so far and the works of al-Muḥāsibī himself bear testimony. Indeed, one brief statement from our author may summarise his whole approach to the topic, as he states, ‘And the sign of truly knowing the soul (maʿrifat al-nafs) is having a bad opinion of it (sūʾ al-ẓann bihā)’.173Observance of God (al-murāqaba)In addition to the facets of purifi cation mentioned in the above quote by al-Muḥāsibī, one is also able to identify another aspect of the tazkiya process, which is the continual observance of God (al-murāqaba). By this we mean the constant cognisance of divine observance of every thought, word and deed and therefore, both the external (al-ẓāhir) and internal (al-bāṭin) actions, which in turn causes the devotee to act in his every circumstance as if God is ‘watching’ his every move. In fact, this is a common feature of al-Muḥāsibī’s works,174 both conceptually and in terms of phraseology and indeed we have seen this concept alluded to previously, where the Prophet, when asked concerning spiritual perfec-tion (iḥsān), is reported to have said, ‘It is to worship God as if you see Him [and know] that if you do not see Him, He sees you’. Thus, we can conclude that the concept of observance of God (al-murāqaba) is virtually synonymous with that of Prophetic notion of spiritual perfection (iḥsān). Having understood this and in an attempt to actualise this Prophetic narration, al-Muḥāsibī is unequivocal in stressing the importance of al-murāqaba, ‘You should be concerned with three characteristics to the exclusion of all others: your Lord’s observance of you (murāqabatika rabbika), taking your soul to account (muḥāsabatika nafsika) and reminding yourself of your sins (mudhākaratika dhanbika)’.175 Therefore, from al-Muḥāsibī’s perspective, this facet of the purifi -cation process is a vital concern for any aspirant seeking to undertake the task of tazkiya and indeed, it is interesting to note that this along with another facet – that of taking your soul to account (muḥāsabat al-nafs), which will be discussed shortly – constitute the only factors that one should be concerned with, indicating their vital and essential nature. Al-Muḥāsibī exhorts his readers to give special emphasis to this quality, saying, ‘I advise you, O my brother, after the observance of God (murāqabat Allāh) in your aspirations and in your every movement; to listen attentively to God and understand through Him, as indeed, within this Qurʾān, which has been revealed to us, is the clarifi cation of everything and the knowledge of every-thing’.176 Consequently, the essential nature of al-murāqaba is made absolutely clear, as the very fi rst piece of advice al-Muḥāsibī offers is regarding it and not only this but also that it has a primary place in the advice he gives, as it precedes his counsel regarding the Qurʾān. Similarly, the subject matter is also made clear as it not only concerns outward action but also the inward facets of the human being. Therefore, regarding the ‘outward’ acts of worship, this facet of tazkiya even has an effect on the most basic of Islamic duties – that of prayer, as, when describ-ing the state of someone praying al-Muḥāsibī says, ‘It is appropriate for anyone"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"192 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamwho knew that God is approaching him and is in front of him [in prayer] that he be fearful, not be distracted and turn his attention elsewhere, as he should be ashamed that He is looking at him while he has turned away’.177 However, as one might expect from al-Muḥāsibī’s discourse, it is in the more ‘esoteric’ aspects of religious practice that one fi nds the greatest benefi t:The best of stations (al-maqāmāt) and the most noble of them is the observ-ance of God (murāqabat li Allāh). And from the best of the observance [of God] (al-murāqaba) is that the slave is observant of being grateful for the bounties [he receives], acknowledges his misdeeds and turns his attention to pardon for them. Thus, his heart adheres to this station in all his actions and whenever he becomes heedless he returns to this [state], with the will of God. This [process] is assisted by abandoning sins, being free of preoccupations and being careful to critically examine [one’s soul] (al-murājaʿa). And from the actions of the heart that are purifi ed (tazkū) through it [al-murāqaba] are: sincerity (al-ikhlāṣ); certitude (al-thiqqa); gratitude (al-shukr); humility (al-tawāḍuʾ); submission (al-istislām); counsel (al-naṣīḥa) and love and enmity for God’s sake (al-ḥubb wa ’l-bughḍ li Allāh).178It is worth noting here that al-Muḥāsibī considers al-murāqaba to be of the spirit-ual stations (al-maqāmāt), commonly associated with the Sufi path,179 indicating his familiarity with this concept. Not only this, however, but in addition to acknowl-edging this idea, he also considers al-murāqaba to be the best of such spiritual stations, clearly indicating the importance he attaches to it and, by implication, its importance in the process of tazkiya. Al-murāqaba is also important, however, due to the fact that it instils gratitude into the believer for God’s favours and also brings him to the realisation of his own shortcomings, for which he consequently seeks forgiveness.180 The last phrase is the most important, however, as when discussing the effect of al-murāqaba on actions of the heart, al-Muḥāsibī describes these actions as being ‘purifi ed (tazkū) through it [al-murāqaba]’, this being a clear indication of this facet of tazkiya’s contribution to the overall purifi cation process. In this regard, al-Muḥāsibī identifi es two categories of al-murāqaba; the fi rst of these deals with the ‘outward’ aspects of observance, whereas the second is concerned with the ‘inward’ aspects of religious life:The best form of shyness (al-ḥayāʾ) is the observance of God, the Mighty and Exalted, (al-murāqabat li Allāh). Observance [of God] (al-murāqaba) is in three things: observance of God regarding His obedience by action; observ-ance of God regarding His disobedience by abandoning it; and observance of God regarding intentions and fl eeting thoughts due to the statement of the Prophet, may the peace and blessings of God be upon him, ‘Worship God as if you see Him [and know] that if you do not see Him, He sees you’. Indeed, the heart’s vigilance of God, the Mighty and Exalted, is harsher on the body than enduring the night prayer (qiyām al-layl ), fasting during the day and spending one’s wealth in the path of God.181"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 193It is equally interesting to note here that al-Muḥāsibī alludes to the intrinsic link between al-murāqaba and shyness/shame before God (al-ḥayāʾ/al-istiḥyāʾ), which is an equally common theme within his works and he concludes that this facet of tazkiya is indeed the best form of the quality of al-ḥayāʾ.182 In addition, al-Muḥāsibī also distinguishes three forms of al-murāqaba; the fi rst two of which may be regarded as ‘outward’ forms, whereas the third form is solely related to the ‘inward’ aspect of observance. It is equally interesting to note that al-Muḥāsibī, in this regard, relies on the very same ḥadīth that was quoted at the beginning of this section, indicating that he too understood al-murāqaba to be synonymous with the concept of iḥsān alluded to in this specifi c Prophetic narration. What is more important to observe, however, is the emphasis that al-Muḥāsibī places on al-murāqaba, since he considers it to be more effective in the purifi cation process than many of the more familiar, ‘physical’ acts of worship. With regard to the actualisation of observance [of God] (al-murāqaba), al-Muḥāsibī notes that its origin lies in, ‘The heart knowing the proximity of its Lord, the Mighty and Exalted’, which is perfected in, ‘The heart maintaining and persisting in the knowledge that God, the Mighty and Exalted, has knowledge of your every movement’.183 Therefore, we can conclude that al-murāqaba is an intrinsic feature of the heart, as, when discussing the three qualities that a person should maintain in his heart, al-Muḥāsibī states: ‘Having fear in the heart that he will be heedless or falter and thus, be lowered in His sight, as such a fear will make him attentive, his attentiveness will make him mindful and his remembering will make him cautious, until he [reaches the stage where he] is observant of his supreme Sovereign ( yurāqib malīkahu)’.184 In addition, the process of al-murāqaba brings about other positive qualities, as al-Muḥāsibī elucidates: ‘It causes him to have shame (al-ḥayāʾ) in front of God, the Mighty and Exalted and reverence for Him’.185 Indeed, this quality of al-murāqaba is the antidote to the ailment of heedlessness (al-ghafl a), which, as was seen earlier, leads to the affl iction of the desires (al-hawā) and the appetites (al-shahawāt). At an advanced stage, someone may even reach a level where they are occupied with the affairs of the world externally but. at the same time, they are observant of God’s pleasure in their hearts. When this stage is reached, three qualities become apparent:First, the joy of satisfaction that awakens in his heart out of hope for the pleasure of God and not that of the people; secondly, being secure from the sins of the heart due to [the heart] being occupied with conversing with his Lord the Mighty and Exalted and fi nally, security from the sins [he commit-ted] in the rest of his life in his dealings with people, which brought no benefi t, neither in the religious nor in the worldly life. Such a person is observant of his Lord (murāqib li rabbihi), fearful of Him in his innermost thoughts, prefers His love to what he himself loves and has detached himself from creation preferring God, glorifi ed be He. As such, his outward appear-ance is that of the people of the worldly life, whereas his inward state is that of those who revere their Lord and are in awe of Him.186"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"194 Spiritual Purifi cation in IslamThus, for such a person, through al-murāqaba the outward state of the worldly life is maintained, being comparable to that of the rest of his peers but inwardly, within his heart, he is in the ‘presence’ of his Lord. Seemingly relying on the Qurʾān as his source,187 al-Muḥāsibī then clarifi es the need for intensity and precision of al-murāqaba:So do not be heedless of observance [of God] (al-murāqaba) such that even an atom’s weight [of something] does not escape your mind and do not become satiated or bored with it as, indeed, God is not heedless of you; He observes you and watches over your conscience, accounting for even an atom’s weight or the weight of a mustard seed,188 so that He may recompense you for it.189As such, every thought, word and deed must be carefully observed, as indeed, even the motives, intentions and aspirations of each of these very hidden, internal actions is subject to divine scrutiny, as the following excerpt indicates:O young man, indeed the state (ḥāla) in which all the states are combined is one state – that of observance [of God] (al-murāqaba). So maintain in your heart and your soul the knowledge that God is watching you in your every movement as, indeed, you are fi xed in the sight of God, the Mighty and Exalted in your every moment; you are in His grasp wherever you are and the eyes of God are cast upon your heart, examining your internal and external [states]. O young man, this characteristic is an ocean that has no shores; an ocean from which streams and rivers fl ow and ships sail therein to acquire its treasures.190Thus, in summary we can conclude that continual observance of God (al-murāqaba), being synonymous with the Prophetic concept of spiritual perfection (iḥsān), is a salient feature of al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs. Moreover, it is a vital and essential facet of the purifi cation process and, at the same time, is intrinsi-cally linked to the fi rst element of his approach, as the following quote bears testi-mony: ‘No one sought aid against his own soul and sought to fortify his religion with anything better than the observance of God (murāqaba li Allāh) and through it [he would] attain shame in front of God, the Mighty and Exalted, this being the essence of intimate knowledge and insight (al-maʿrifa)’.191Combating the soul (al-mujāhada)It will be remembered from the previous chapter that when discussing the nature and purifi cation of the soul the following ḥadīth was quoted: ‘The religious warrior (al-mujāhid ) is the one who struggles against his soul for the sake of God, the Mighty and Exalted’, and, indeed, in this chapter we have also seen al-Muḥāsibī quote the following narrations attributing them to the Prophet:The Prophet, may the peace and blessings of God be upon him, said, ‘You have returned from the lesser jihad (al-jihād al-aṣghar) to the greater jihad"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 195(al-jihād al-akbar) – the struggle against your souls (mujāhadat al-nufūs)’. A man asked the Prophet, ‘What is the best form of jihad?’ and he replied, ‘Your personal struggle against your soul and your desires (mujāhadatuka nafsaka wa hawāk)’.In the same way that Prophetic guidance provided al-Muḥāsibī with the second facet of his methodology of purifying the soul, other such narrations also fur-nished him with the third aspect – that of combating or struggling against the soul (mujāhadat al-nafs). Indeed, al-Muḥāsibī himself mentions this aspect of tazkiya in the above-mentioned quote from Sharḥ al-Maʿrifa and upon closer examina-tion one fi nds that this methodological tool in purifying the soul, although not as common as the previous two aspects, still occupies a central position in the works of our author.192 Once again, with regard to combating the soul (mujāhadat al-nafs) al-Muḥāsibī is unequivocal in clarifying the importance of this task as he addresses his readers, telling them that they have been affl icted with the duty of struggling against their souls and exhorts them saying, ‘Fight your souls with a war that is more benefi cial for you than any other type of war’.193 Thus, al-Muḥāsibī clarifi es in no uncertain terms that the devotee has to do battle with his own soul to bring about its reformation and in this sense can be viewed as ‘the greater jihad (al-jihād al-akbar)’, referred to in the above ḥadīth, since. as we have already seen in this chapter so far, the nafs is a more than capable adversary. Al-Muḥāsibī sets about the task of explaining in what respect the soul is to be fought against and in his work al-Naṣāʾiḥ we fi nd a number of aspects in which he explains that mujāhadat al-nafs must be employed. To this effect al-Muḥāsibī utilises the phrase, ‘. . . and struggle against your souls regarding . . . (wa jāhidū anfusakum ʿalā . . .)’, and then lists various aspects of the soul that require disci-plining. The fi rst of these qualities is to struggle against one’s soul to be patient when affl ictions and disasters strike, since even though the soul has the potential to be patient, it is rarely the case that it is. The danger in this, as al-Muḥāsibī clari-fi es, is that impatience with an event that befalls one is tantamount to rejecting the predestination of God and may consequently incur His wrath. Conversely, if one were to be patient when affl icted, then one would have gained God’s pleasure and satisfaction (al-riḍāʾ), a quality that, it will be remembered, was closely associ-ated with the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna). Thus, by undertaking the process of al-mujāhada, one may purify the soul and so attain an attribute of its most elevated form.194 Similarly, al-Muḥāsibī also encourages the struggle against one’s soul in loving that which God loves, since if someone was to fulfi l this, they would not only please their Lord but also deny the soul its inclination to its own passions at the same time, causing it once again to be purifi ed.195 From these few examples alone it is easy to see the positive effect that al-mujāhada has on the soul and we may summarise al-Muḥāsibī’s view with one of the counsels he provides from the very same work:My brothers, this is the path to God, so adhere to what I have described to you, believe in it in your heart, construct your actions based upon it and"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"196 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islamstruggle against your souls ( jāhidū anfusakum) to establish it as, indeed, I see that the soul inclined to evil (al-nafs al-ammāra) is determined to disregard the command of God, the Mighty and Exalted. So be observant of God (rāqibū Allāh) and do not neglect it [al-nafs] or your religion will be destroyed.196Therefore, al-mujāhada is an essential feature of the purifi cation process and especially in its initial stages as al-Muḥāsibī, when describing the beginning of the path for the aspirant and his attempt to be sincere, asserts that it is attained:[w]ith struggle (al-mujāhada) and endurance (al-mukābada) due to the strength of the appetites, the weakness of his intention, the lack of practice at being sincere and being habitually ostentatious. This is because the weak slave, since his childhood, has been used to being insincere in front of his peers and if he wished to wean his soul away from this habit and break the strength of his appetites whilst his intention is weak and he lacks practice at being sincere, his soul will refuse and deem it diffi cult. Thus, he struggles ( jāhada) and endures (kābada) until he is consistent in refuting his soul, sincerity becomes the norm and ostentation is rejected. Then the reward of sincerity from God enters his heart with light and insight, the soul is broken due to it being prevented its pas-sions for a protracted period and the enemy [Iblīs] despairs and withdraws, awaiting [the advent of] the appetites and heedlessness. Then God, the Mighty and Exalted, draws near with assistance and aid due to what He has seen of his patience for His sake and his consistency in combating his desires (al-mujāhada li hawāhu).197Therefore, through continuous struggle against one’s soul, one is able not only to overcome the base qualities of the nafs but also to bring about the most essential feature of a religious act – that of sincerity for God alone. In addition, when this act of sincerity is observed at the heavenly level, the divine facet of tazkiya plays its role also, as God then grants His servant the bounty of His assistance in main-taining this heightened spiritual state, further adding to the process of reform and purifi cation. The divine facet of tazkiya is further evidenced in the following text:So when God, the Mighty and Exalted, grants the devotee strength of convic-tion, consistency in combating it (mujāhadatihā) and subduing it [al-nafs] will despair from him giving it its desire, its nature will be made subservient by strength of conviction and the light of truth, it will be overcome by the con-cerns and worries of the hereafter, becoming tranquil to its [the hereafter’s] invitation, severing hope in seeking its habits.198The practice of al-mujāhada is not restricted to the novice, however, and indeed it is an attribute of the most spiritually advanced on the path to God, as when discussing the characteristics of the spiritual instructors (ṣifāt al-murabbiyyīn) whom he sought in his youth and whom he eventually found:"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 197The sign of this in the truthful person (al-ṣādiq) is that when he contemplates he is admonished, when he is silent he refl ects, when he speaks he is reminded, if he is prevented [from something] he is patient, if he is presented [with something] he is grateful, if he is tried he recalls, if [some act of] ignorance was committed against him he forbears, if he gains knowledge he becomes humble, if he teaches he is gentle and if he were asked he expends [his efforts in answering]. He is a healing for the aspirant, an aid to the seeker of guid-ance, an ally of truth, a repository of righteousness, easily pleased regarding his own rights and is zealous regarding the rights of God. His intentions are better than his actions and his actions are more effective than his words. His abode is the truth, his sanctuary is shyness, his knowledge is scrupulousness and his witness is reliable. He has insights from light that he sees with, reali-ties of knowledge which he speaks with and evidences from certainty which he expresses. Those who reach this are only those who have strived against their own souls for God, the Exalted’s sake (jāhada nafsahu li Allāh taʿālā), made their intention sincere for His obedience, feared God secretly and openly, reduced their hopes, ‘buckled the belt’ of caution and ‘set sail with the wind’ of salvation ‘upon a sea’ of supplication.199Thus, a major factor in bringing about this change in state and undertaking the process of tazkiyat al-nafs, culminating in the highest of spiritual levels, is com-bating one’s soul for God’s sake and the positive consequences of this are many and varied, as he continues to enumerate its benefi ts:Thus, his time is a blessing, his affairs are secure, he is not deluded by the adornment of the abode of deception and he is not distracted from the torments of the day of resurrection by the lustre of a mirage’s breeze . . . so he [became] learned after ignorance, rich after poverty, genial after ferocity, intimate after being remote, rested after fatigue, his affairs were united and his concerns drawn together . . . the ignorant consider him speechless but it is his wisdom that has silenced him. The foolish consider him to be talking idly but it is his advice which has caused him to speak. [Some] consider him rich but it is his modesty which has suffi ced him and [some] consider him poor but it is his humility which has humbled him. He doesn’t involve himself in that which doesn’t concern him, he doesn’t burden himself more than he needs, he doesn’t take that which he doesn’t require, he doesn’t leave that with which he has been entrusted and people are comfortable with him, while he is in a state of fatigue. He has killed his avarice with scrupulousness, termi-nated his greed with piety and annihilated his appetites with the light of knowledge.200In addition to al-mujāhada being implemented on the soul, as may have been noticed in previous excerpts, the target of al-mujāhada is also the two most mani-fest negative qualities of the nafs, i.e. the appetites (al-shahawāt) and the desires"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"198 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam(al-hawā).201 As such, the phrase ‘combating or struggling against the soul’ (mujāhadat al-nafs) can be understood to mean the soul and its every negative facet. It is also worth noting that the practice of al-mujāhada is not restricted to the soul only in the works of al-Muḥāsibī but also to the other hidden adversary – Satan. In this regard, al-Muḥāsibī states, ‘And know that your love for obedience lies in fi ghting your enemy (al-muḥāraba li ʿaduwik), combating your soul (al-mujāhada li nafsika) and opposing your desires (al-mukhālafa li hawāk), espe-cially if your soul is compliant with its desires, as your desires are Iblīs’s poisoned arrow, through which he reaches your heart’.202 Moreover, in al-Muḥāsibī’s system of intimate knowledge and insight (al-marʿrifa), Satan plays in intrinsic part and as such, al-Muḥāsibī explains, ‘And as for the intimate knowledge (marʿrifa) of the enemy of God, Iblīs, it is that you should know that the Almighty, may He be praised and His names sanctifi ed, has commanded you to fi ght him (muḥārabatihi) and to combat him (mujāhadatihi), in secret and in public and in obedience and disobedience’.203 Further clarifying the manner in which one should approach this despicable adversary, he says, ‘So fi ght him with the most severe battle and combat him with the most intense war, in secret and in public, outwardly and inwardly and do not be defi cient in this until you have expended every effort in fi ghting him and combating him, as combating him is fi ghting him in every thing that he invites you to, whether it be good or evil’.204 Therefore, in summary we can clearly see that combating the insinuations, enticements and whisperings of the Devil are an equally intrinsic part of the prac-tice of al-mujāhada and, as such, an equally intrinsic part of tazkiya. Conse-quently, the targets of al-mujāhada are both Satan and his ally, the negative facets of the human soul and thus al-mujāhada consists of a two-pronged attack on both the hidden external enemy and his internal counterpart.205 In addition, it also worth noting that al-Muḥāsibī utilises a similar concept to al-mujāhada, namely that of opposing or contradicting the soul (mukhālafat al-nafs) and once again we fi nd this phrase well-evidenced in his works.206 More-over, we may consider these two terms as being synonymous since whoever opposed his soul has most certainly struggled against and combated it. In this regard, al-Muḥāsibī states, ‘. . . Look at what your soul desires and then oppose it (khālifhā), as its desires only invite [you] to the affairs of the worldly life, so oppose (khālif ) the invitations of your soul and adhere to the command of your Lord, the Mighty and Exalted . . .’.207 Therefore, it is easy to see the similarity between mukhālafat al-nafs and mujāhada al-nafs, which is further evidenced by the following excerpt, which also stresses the divine facet of tazkiya:It has been affi rmed by the people of understanding (ūla ’l-nuhā) that whoever attained righteousness and obedience did so through opposing (yukhālif) the soul’s passions, via some fatigue that affl icts it or by preventing it from some relaxation or pleasure it attempts to gain. As such, this is a clear proof and clear testimony against it [al-nafs] that the one who caused it to oppose its passions is not the soul itself but, rather, the One Who is bounteous to it and as such, all praise and gratitude is due to Him.208"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 199Therefore, in summary we can conclude that, as al-Muḥāsibī himself alludes to, mukhālafat al-nafs and mujāhada al-nafs are intrinsic features of the purifi cation process through which the soul and its base qualities of the appetites (al-shahawāt) and the desires (al-hawā) are purifi ed and the soul’s nemesis – Satan – is control-led. This in turn brings about the pleasure of the soul’s Creator and consequently, His greatest reward, as al-Muḥāsibī alludes to when describing the believer who is a ‘worker’ (ʿāmil ) and merchant (tājir) for God’s pleasure in the hereafter saying, ‘He is a combatant of his soul (mujāhid li nafsihi) and endures his desires (mukābid li hawāhu); he hopes that He will look at him whilst in that state and thus, be pleased with him (yarḍā ʿanhu), which in turn brings about his eternal existence in His abode and secures him from His punishment’.209Introspective examination (al-muḥāsaba)In addition to the multifarious verses related to the concept of the account and recompense (al-ḥisāb) in the hereafter, exhibited in the Qurʾān,210 it was found in the previous chapter that the earliest authorities in Islam are said to have made reference to the concept of ‘examining the soul’. Taking these sources into consid-eration, al-Muḥāsibī would apply a method of intricate, precise and introspective examination and taking the soul account (muḥāsabat al-nafs) to himself so seri-ously, out of fear for the evaluation of his deeds on the Day of Judgement by God, that he became famous for it to the extent that it became synonymous with him. Therefore, it is little surprise that he employs the concept of introspective examination (muḥāsabat al-nafs) as a valuable and intrinsic facet of the purifi ca-tion process. In addition, it is worth noting, however, he also utilises other differ-ent but related terms within this context such as ‘appraisal and evaluation of the soul’ (murājaʿat al-nafs) and ‘inspection of the soul’ (mufātashat al-nafs), which are used collectively and frequently throughout his works.211 Similarly, he also makes use of the phrase ‘scrutinising [the hidden aspects] of the soul’ (tafaqqud [sarāʾir] al-nafs )212 with an analogous connotation and together these phrases all indicate an in-depth, insightful, precise and exact examination of the soul and its qualities, which is invaluable as a method of tazkiyat al-nafs. One may be struck by the fact that a scholar is attributed an appellation based on an esoteric spiritual practice but, when examining the works of al-Muḥāsibī, it is not surprising that he was renowned as ‘al-Muḥāsibī’, bearing in mind the huge stress he places on this facet of purifying the soul. Regarding the great emphasis al-Muḥāsibī places on introspective examination and taking the soul to account, he explains this to one of his students saying, ‘And know that I only frequently remind you and myself of appraisal [of the soul] (al-murājaʿat) because it has been made clear to me how necessary it is’.213 The necessity of introspective examination lies in the fact that it plays an essential role in religious and spiritual life as a whole, as al-Muḥāsibī explains, ‘The basis of obedience is scrupulous-ness (al-waraʿ) and the basis of scrupulousness is “God consciousness” (al-taqwā); the basis of God consciousness is examining the soul (muḥāsabat al-nafs) and the basis of examining the soul is hope (al-rajāʾ) and fear (al-khawf )’.214"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"200 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam Therefore, as far as al-Muḥāsibī is concerned muḥāsabat al-nafs is a pinnacle feature of the internal faith system since it is the basis of God consciousness (al-taqwā), this in turn being the very essence of piety and righteousness. The relationship between muḥāsabat al-nafs and al-taqwā therefore seems to lie in the fact that introspective examination is based on two other essential features of the contemplative, moral faith system in Islam – those of hope (al-rajāʾ) and fear (al-khawf ) – since if one is continually hoping in God’s mercy and paradise and fearing His wrath and punishment it would seem reasonable that a person may be described consequently as ‘God conscious’. Similarly, it is also understandable that al-Muḥāsibī would consider hope and fear as the basis for al-muḥāsaba, since if one were continually hoping in God’s mercy and paradise and fearing His wrath and punishment, they would clearly be concerned with making their account in front of God on the Day of Judgement as easy as possible and consequently would take great pains to make sure that this account was fully in order in this life. Although al-Muḥāsibī mentions in the previous excerpt that the important moral quality of scrupulousness (al-waraʿ) is intrinsically related to God con-sciousness (al-taqwā), he also states that scrupulousness also has an important link to al-muḥāsaba when he says, ‘The beginning of scrupulousness (al-waraʿ) is introspective examination of the soul (muḥāsabat al-nafs) when fl eeting thoughts occur in the heart’.215 Consequently, when asked by one of his students to elucidate the form of al-muḥāsaba that brings about scrupulousness, he clari-fi es that it is:Proceeding cautiously in every circumstance before acting or abandoning an act, whether it be an intention in the heart or an action of the body, until it becomes clear that he should either act or abandon the action. Thus, if it became clear to him that it is something that God hates then he avoids it with a fi rm intention in his heart and he causes his body to refrain from that which God, the Mighty and Exalted, hates or [alternatively] he prevents his soul from non-performance of a compulsory duty and was swift to fulfi l it.216Thus, for al-Muḥāsibī the process of al-muḥāsaba concerns every type of action that the human being performs, both the exoteric and esoteric, and revolves around God’s pleasure and command. With regard to the esoteric aspect, with which al-Muḥāsibī seems more concerned, before relating the narration of ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb seen in the previous chapter, he says, ‘And examine your soul (ḥāsib nafsaka) regarding every fl eeting thought (khaṭra) and be vigilant of God (rāqib Allāh) in every breath (nafas)’.217 As such, al-Muḥāsibī considers the practice of al-muḥāsaba so important that it should even be carried out upon the most hidden of human faculties – the thought process – that may not even last for a fraction of a second. In addition, he also alludes to the fact that an intrinsic feature of al-muḥāsaba is another facet of tazkiya that we have already seen – that of al-murāqaba, since through maintaining vigilance of God one may establish whether the action at hand is indeed pleasing to Him or not. Al-Muḥāsibī makes this even clearer in the following text:"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 201It is not appropriate for an intelligent person to be indifferent regarding inspecting his aspirations (mufātashat himmatihi), examining his soul (muḥāsabat nafsihi), purifying his conscience (naqāʾ ḍamīrihi), being vigi-lant of God (murāqabat Allāh), Glory be to Him the Exalted, concerning every action he wants to perform – or otherwise he is deceived.218In an even more apparent exposition of the esoteric aspect of al-muḥāsaba, al-Muḥāsibī makes clear that another important aspect of this practice when he says, ‘And from examining it [al-nafs] (muḥāsabatihā) is that you be alone with it and remind it of its deeds, saying, “O soul, you cannot deceive and overcome God, so do not accept Satan’s deceit and his attempt to overcome [you] and do not follow your desires as they will ruin and destroy you”’. Therefore, as we can plainly see from this text and from others he provides,219 al-Muḥāsibī even advo-cates addressing the soul as if it were another person, as the effect of this is more manifest when attempting to censure the soul (muʿātabat al-nafs) regarding its immoral behaviour. In addition to this, it is also worth noting that al-Muḥāsibī apportions the intel-lect (al-ʿaql ) a pivotal role in introspective examination as he explains that al-muḥāsaba is, ‘The intellect (al-ʿaql ) being put in charge over guarding the soul’s treachery and scrutinising its accomplishments from its defi ciencies’.220 Thus, it is the light of reason that is an indispensable tool in discerning the motives and intentions of the soul and differentiating between acts performed sincerely for God alone or, alternatively, carried out at the behest of the soul’s appetites and desires. With regard to discriminating between such features of the believers’ interior life being related to God’s pleasure and command in the process of al-muḥāsaba, al-Muḥāsibī clarifi es the criteria for action when he says, ‘Ask before any act you intend to perform, “Why and for whom?” So if it was for God then you continue in performing it but if it was for other then God then you refrain from it’.221 Thus, the only criterion for action is God’s pleasure alone, this being the pinnacle of sincerity. Similarly, al-muḥāsaba saves one from the fear of defi ciency and the disgrace of loss in the hereafter, since in the same way a merchant takes his business part-ners to account for the state of their business affairs, out of trying to avoid a defi cit and in the hope of attaining profi ts, the believer equally has to take his soul to account to ensure that he to has no ‘defi cit’ with his Lord.222 Moreover, al-muḥāsaba produces an increase in insight (al-baṣīra), makes one swift in being able to establish proofs, makes one refi ned in discernment and increases one in understanding, according to the extent that one maintains examining the heart and soul.223 In addition, the practice of al-muḥāsaba inculcates the faculty of atten-tiveness (al-tayaqquẓ) into the practitioner of introspective examination of the soul and, as such, brings him out of a state of forgetfulness (al-sahw) to one of remembrance (dhikr).224 Bearing in mind the many positive qualities that adopting al-muḥāsaba brings about, this also has an effect in the divine realm as al-Muḥāsibī considers such people to have attained a noble rank and position with God (maqām sharīf/manzila sharīfa) due to their sincerity to God.225"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"202 Spiritual Purifi cation in Islam Conversely, the negative effects of not carrying out the process of al-muḥāsaba are equally disastrous as al-Muḥāsibī observes: ‘The farthest person from justice and the most heedless of them is the one who examines his soul the least (aqal-lahum muḥāsabatan li nafsihi)’.226 Similarly, when describing a person’s slippery slide into sin and disobedience al-Muḥāsibī observes:The beginning of indifference is laziness (al-kasal ), so if ‘concern’ (al-riʿāya) has any power over him then laziness will be suppressed but if not, then it will increase until it becomes ‘uneasiness’ ( jaziʿ); so if compassion prevents him he desists [from uneasiness] but if not then it will increase until he becomes averse to obedience; so if he has softness in his heart he desists but if not he will become astray and we seek shelter in God from that. Thus, if he was astray he has exited the authority of fear and is left to the deception of security227; then he will increase in error to the abode of destruction, the veil of integrity will be lifted from him and he will be disgraced by the witnessing of glory.228 And this is all due to a lack of examining the soul (muḥāsabat al-nafs).229Therefore, the solution and cure to all of the above-mentioned ailments is the application of this facet of the purifi cation process. In addition, al-muḥāsaba’s effect is not only limited to the soul but its sphere of infl uence extends to the heart also:The basis of the heart’s corruption is abandoning examining the soul (al-muḥāsabat li ’l-nafs) and being deceived by high hopes (al-ightirār bi ṭūl al-amal ). So if you wanted to reform your heart then pause to examine your intention and every fl eeting thought, accepting that which is for God, aban-doning that which is for other than Him and seeking aid against high hopes with consistent remembrance of death.230It is also worth noting, however, that with respect to the application of introspec-tive examination of the soul, al-Muḥāsibī distinguishes between two categories of al-muḥāsaba, which he terms examining the soul regarding future actions (muḥāsabat al-nafs fī mustaqbal al-aʿmāl ) and examining the soul regarding past deeds (muḥāsabat al-nafs fī mustadbar al-aʿmāl ).231 With regard to the fi rst cat-egory, al-Muḥāsibī states, ‘It is to contemplate while proceeding cautiously before slipping into error, to discern that which harms you from that which benefi ts you; consequently, you abandon that which harms you according to knowledge and you act in accordance with that which benefi ts you according to knowledge’.232 As a result, even before performing an action al-muḥāsaba is employed to differenti-ate between good and evil actions to act as a preventive measure and thus it limits the potential to commit sins before the action even takes place. As for the second category of al-muḥāsaba, then this – as the name suggests – takes place after the action has been completed. In this sense the deed is evalu-ated in its every aspect and a series of questions need to be posed, such as: ‘Why"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 203and for whom?’, regarding the intentions behind the action, ‘How would it be if it were presented in front of the Creator?’, ‘Has it been performed in a way it would be pleasing to Him?’ and ‘Was it completed in the way that He commanded?’ Depending on the answers to these questions, the person performing these deeds will then need to make amends for the defi ciencies therein by seeking God’s for-giveness and repenting or fi nding a way in which the deed can be consequently made acceptable.233 Furthermore, to make this process effective, al-Muḥāsibī suggests that the following three qualities be observed:First, to sever oneself from the relationships that hinder focusing one’s concern on al-muḥāsaba, as whoever wanted to take his debtor to account emptied his heart of all preoccupations. Secondly, to dedicate oneself to it out of choice because of the benefi t that is hoped for from it and thirdly, the fear that God, the Mighty and Exalted, will ask him concerning what he neglected regarding that which reached him upon the tongue of His Prophet, peace be upon him, when he said, ‘The believer should be seen at four “hours”: [from them] an hour in which he examines his soul (yuḥāsib nafsahu)’.234However, people vary in their ability to apply this process of al-muḥāsaba as al-Muḥāsibī observes:People with regard to assessing their deeds are of two types: fi rst, a person who evaluates his soul and examines his habitual practice and when he fi nds out that the burden of proof is established against his soul, he casts it aside and, as a result, falls into the snare of Iblīs. Secondly, a man who evaluates his soul and made his intellect the burden of proof between him and his desires, so whatever was found to be acceptable by his intellect he accepted it and whatever was found to be unacceptable by his intellect he discarded it. Therefore, this man knew his faults through examining his soul (muḥāsabat nafsihi) and opposing his desires (mukhālafat hawāhu), such that he contin-ued to change until he became from the party of God (ḥizb Allāh), the Exalted, and became one the most anxious and worried of people in the worldly life, until death came to him and he was apprehensive, afraid and trembling.235Thus, the effect that al-muḥāsaba has on those who apply it is tremendous and con-sequently it is an essential feature of the purifi cation process. As testimony to this, after elucidating the state of the worst of God’s servants, al-Muḥāsibī then says:Then there is the servant who is an aspirant and is concerned with his soul, who is heedful of the book of God, the Mighty and Exalted and the sunna of His Prophet, may the peace and blessings of God be upon him, whose aspira-tion is examining his soul (muḥāsabat nafsihi) to distinguish his inner thoughts; [ask yourself] with which of them is God more pleased and with which of them is He more angry?236"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"204 Spiritual Purifi cation in IslamTherefore, in summary, we may conclude that the practice of introspective exami-nation (muḥāsabat al-nafs) has a deep-rooted basis in the Islamic revelatory sources and, in addition to this, has been developed further by al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī into an in-depth, insightful, precise and exact examination of the soul and its qualities, to the extent that he became synonymous with the practice he played a huge role in developing. In addition, this process takes into consideration not only the past deeds of a person but also his future actions and thus subjects them to a simple, yet strict set of criteria to establish their validity in the religious context. Furthermore, it can be observed that the practice of muḥāsabat al-nafs has numerous benefi cial results and conversely there are equally numerous nega-tive consequences in not applying it. Consequently, we can see that this contem-plative and highly spiritual exercise has a profound effect on the soul and, as such, is an essential and vital facet of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs.ConclusionIn summary, one is able to provide a variety of conclusions regarding al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs: fi rst, although he does not use the term tazkiya in the technical sense employed in the current work, his in-depth knowledge and insight regarding the nature of the human soul and its consequent nurturing and disciplining intrinsically link al-Muḥāsibī’s teachings with the process of purifi -cation and development indicated by the term tazkiya. Indeed, it is his profound knowledge of the intricate workings of the inner sanctuary of the human soul that makes his work unique and to try and encapsulate his ideas regarding it is by no means an easy task. However, the discussion in this chapter has also shown that al-Muḥāsibī’s thought regarding the purifi cation of the soul, the exposition of the nafs, its faults and consequent training are thoroughly grounded in Islam’s revelatory sources, namely the Qurʾān and the ḥadīth, as many of the concepts and terms alluded to in Chapter 4 are reiterated in our subject’s works. In consequence, al-Muḥāsibī gives importance to both the divine and prophetic facets of the process of tazkiya but, at the same time, by far the greatest emphasis is given to the personal element in this process, as it the individual who is ultimately responsible and has a vital role to play. Similarly, although he makes brief reference to the two ‘higher’ forms of the soul, i.e. ‘the self-reproachful’ (al-nafs al-lawwāma) and ‘the tranquil’ (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna), it is the base form of the soul, the ‘soul inclined to evil’ (al-nafs al-ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) which is the target of al-Muḥāsibī’s exposition, as it is this internal adversary that threatens the individual’s ultimate destruction and, there-after, must be transformed. In addition, however, al-Muḥāsibī is not satisfi ed merely by explaining such concepts, as many authors have attempted, but rather he develops them further, introducing his own vernacular regarding the nafs, and provides practical, methodological advice regarding the purifi cation of the soul. Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology as described here revolves around an in-depth and intimate knowledge (maʿrifa) of the nafs and its nature, which thus provides the"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Al-Muḥāsibī’s methodology of tazkiyat al-nafs 205basis for the reformation of the soul, since one could possibly bring about this change without fi rst knowing the ‘enemy within’ and the enormity and complex-ity of the task. Thus, al-Muḥāsibī provides a practical method in dealing with such a ‘rebellious’ soul that revolves around the individual continually maintaining of God’s observance of him (al-murāqaba), out of fear of His punishment and wrath and out shame (ḥāyaʾ) of committing an offence in His ‘presence’ and thus, by doing so, reaching the state of spiritual excellence (iḥsān) described by the Prophet. Similarly, bearing in mind the soul’s nature, i.e. that it is inclined to evil (ammāra bi ’l-sūʾ) and the negative personal and moral qualities associated with it, al-Muḥāsibī also suggests a continual striving against the nafs (al-mujāhada), including censuring it (al-muʿātaba), imposing penalties upon it (al-ʿuqūbāt), causing it to proceed cautiously (al-tathbīṭ) and restraining it (al-habs) and avert-ing it from its nature (al-inṣirāf ) to reform it (al-iṣlāḥ) and ultimately eradicate evil from it and its actions. In addition, an intrinsic part of the above-mentioned process is an assessment of one’s external state through an introspective analysis of one’s motives and intentions (al-muḥāsaba) to ascertain their sincerity for God. This is undertaken not only regarding past deeds as one may expect but also in the present before one acts, in an attempt to avoid an indiscretion before it even takes place. This conse-quently facilitates the initiation of repentance (al-tawba) for past misdeeds, further instils the maintaining of God’s observance of one’s state (al-murāqaba) and, if negative elements are found, the extent to which the soul is to be combated (al-mujāhada). Thus, al-muḥāsaba is pivotal in governing and regulating the other various facets of the purifi cation process. Therefore, in addition to the multifaceted and multilevel exposition of tazkiyat al-nafs within the Islamic paradigm supplied in the previous chapter, al-Muḥāsibī, through his knowledge of this and his development of a methodology regarding it, has provided an equally multifaceted approach to tazkiyat al-nafs. It is through this methodology that he seeks to bring about the reform of the human being as a whole and thus reach the perfection of the human state described as ‘the tranquil soul’ (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinna), which is both satisfi ed with its Lord and has, at the same time, attained its Lord’s satisfaction.Notes 1 See al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-Khalwa, in al-Mashriq (Kānūn al-Thānī/Shabāṭ, 1955), p. 49; al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-Naṣāʾiḥ, ed.

Therefore, al-Muḥāsibī is not suggesting that one divest oneself of this quality, as this would be simply preposterous but rather he is proposing that such appetites be controlled and reined in. The consequence of not doing this is that the appetites can then lead to an excess that in turn causes an exceeding of the limits, which is exactly what the above ḥadīths are referring to.76 Thus, once again al-Muḥāsibī shows just how adept he was at identifying the character traits of the human soul.77 See al-Muḥāsibī, al-Riʿāya li Ḥuqūq Allāh, ed. al-Barr, p. 200; and cf. al-Muḥāsibī, Kitāb al-Naṣāʾiḥ, ed.

Asad al-Muḥāsibī. It has been demonstrated that the discipline of tazkiyat al-nafs has a fi rm foundation in the classical Islamic disciplines but, at the same time, many would associate it with what is now included under the broad heading of ‘Islamic Mysticism’ or, more commonly, ‘Sufi sm’. The two major terms used to describe Sufi sm are the words ‘spirituality’ and ‘mysticism’, which in turn are often prefi xed by the term ‘Islamic’ to distinguish them from other forms of spirituality or mysticism. Therefore, bearing in mind the nature of al-Muḥāsibī’s discourse, it is equally important here to comment on spirituality and mysticism in general, so as to understand where both he and tazkiyat al-nafs ‘fi t’ in the overall picture of these concepts.SpritualityThe fi rst of these terms, ‘spirituality’, is particularly diffi cult to defi ne due to its derivation from another problematic term, namely ‘spirit’.1 Its roots, however, would appear to lie in the Christian tradition where it has a long history of theol-ogy and religious practice.2 The spiritual can be understood by contrasting it with the physical, material and external, being primarily an internal quest. Some under-stand the ‘spiritual’ as more diffuse and less institutionalised than the ‘religious’. Others, however, understand spirituality to be the very core of religion, particu-larly through religious and mystical experience. The subject matter of sprituality has been a perennial human concern and modern interest in spirituality has been combined with an emphasis on the individual subject and self-development, thus becoming a universal term to indicate a search for direction and meaning.3 Similarly, spirituality has often been descibed as an attempt to grow in sensitivity – to the self, to others, to non-human creation and to God, or as an exploration into what is involved in becoming human; a quest for full humanity. Thus, spiritu-ality, not as an idea or a concept, but as a praxis found throughout human history, is resonant with the longings of the human heart for the permanent, eternal, ever-lasting – for wholeness, peace, joy and bliss – which have concerned human"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Conclusion 217beings through the ages and which many people continue to search for today.4 In the past, however, much of the spirituality that was taught and lived was developed by a social, cultural and intellectual group which alone had the necessary devotion for cultivating mind and spirit.5MysticismAs for the term ‘mysticism’, its origin lies in the Greek root mu-,6 suggesting something closed, hidden, or secret and the group of words constructed from it – mystikon, mysterion, and mystes – were used in connection with the Greek mystery religions.7 Mysticism is not necessarily confi ned to ‘religion’, however, as many describe ‘mystical experiences’ in a non-religious context. Thus, in theistic tradition it is often described as a fundamentally unitive experience of love and communion with God, whereas in non-theistic traditions it is described as an intuitive, contem-plative approach to ultimate reality. In either case it is understood as an experience beyond ordinary human experience and reason but at the same time is not antago-nistic to them. The study of mysticism is undertaken from the perspectives of theology, philosophy and psychology and examines the nature and interpretation of religious experience.8 For most people, mystical experience is only indirectly accessible via mystical literature, which exists in many different genres. Common to them is the insist-ence on an experience of fundamental unity or oneness transcending the diversity of everyday life. To this end many religions prescribe techniques of contempla-tion and meditation, as well as a variety of spirtual diciplines and ascetic prac-tices, as a means to reach mystical experience. The majority of mystics maintain that their experience is fundamentally ineffable, i.e. it cannot be adequately expressed; yet this claim does not preclude the describability of such experiences to which the mystical literature in all religions bears witness.9 Despite this, however, when trying to defi ne mysticism we encounter as many, if not more diffi culties than with spirituality.10 A myriad of defi nitions exist but due to the concise nature of the discussion, there are a limited number of diction-ary defi nitions which will suffi ce. In the fi rst mysticism is said to be, ‘Reliance on spiritual intuition or exalted feeling as the means of acquiring knowledge of mys-teries inaccessible to intellectual apprehension’. This, however, does not mean that mystics discover new facts as this is the role of science, but we mean that they seek a wisdom that gives a new vision and understanding of the world.11 The dic-tionary also gives its central defi nition of mysticism as, ‘belief in the possibility of union with the divine nature by means of ecstatic contemplation’ and it further defi nes the mystic as ‘one who, whether Christian or non-Christian, seeks con-templation or self surrender to obtain union with or absorption into the Deity’.12 Even from the brief discussion above it is clear that spirituality and mysticism are not the same; although they may occupy a similar sphere of existence, their goals are clearly quite different. As will be seen, the initial period of Islamic history was fi lled with individuals, al-Muḥāsibī included, who were essentially trying to realise a form of the spirituality described above. However, as time"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"218 Conclusionpassed and the spirituality born out of asceticism progressed, new concepts were derived and an elaborate tradition known by the name ‘Sufi sm’ was born and often combined many of the ideas presented above as ‘mystical’. Thus, if we were now to attempt to identify the concept of tazkiyat al-nafs with either of these disciplines, we would fi nd that this concept of disciplining the soul in Islam has far more in common with spirituality than mysticism, since in spiritu-ality, the longings of the human heart for the permanent, eternal and everlasting would easily fi t in with the concept of the tranquil soul elucidated in Chapter 4. Conversely, tazkiyat al-nafs has little to do with mysticism’s quest for a unitive experience of the divine, since this concept has not been cited during the examina-tion of this term and thus we may conclude that tazkiyat al-nafs is essentially a ‘spiritual’ quest rather than a ‘mystical’ one. In addition, it should also be noted that from the very outset al-Muḥāsibī was regarded by Smith – as the title of her book suggests – as a mystic, seemingly based primarily on his exposition of divine love in the treatise Faṣl al-Maḥabba.13 However, upon examining this work and al-Muḥāsibī’s other ‘mystical’ teach-ings, it emerges that they are not as ‘mystical’ as Smith suggests but rather seem to fall within the realms of Islam’s broader teaching. This is especially true when examining the remainder of al-Muḥāsibī’s works, as one fi nds that they are usually within the precepts of Islam’s ascetic and spiritual tradition and have a strong theological basis in both of Islam’s revelatory sources. Indeed, if one were to characterise al-Muḥāsibī, it would be more appropriate to perhaps consider him as an ‘introspective moral psychologist’ because his teaching revolves around the reformation of the moral and ethical, esoteric nature of humanity, rather than a mystic seeking experience of unity with the divine, which is a concept that has not presented itself in the current study.14 Equally, with regard to the relationship of Sufi sm with the two topics of tazkiyat al-nafs and al-Muḥāsibī, one has to begin by posing the question: ‘What form of Sufi sm do we mean?’ Indeed, if we mean the ascetical tradition prevalent in the fi rst two Islamic centuries, then there is a strong suggestion that in both cases a link may be established, since the concept of tazkiyat al-nafs and teachings of al-Muḥāsibī bear a strong resemblance to the early ascetical teaching of the likes of al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī, for example. However, if we mean by the term ‘Sufi sm’ the intoxicated mysticism of al-Ḥallāj (d. 309/922) or the mystical theosophy of Ibn ʿArabī (d. 638/1240), then one would have to conclude that there is little evidence to suggest a close relationship between these contrasting approaches. In addition, concerning al-Muḥāsibī specifi cally, although there is clearly a tangible link to the sober mysticism associated with the Baghdadi school through his student al-Junayd in particular, it is diffi cult to attribute the term ‘Sufi ’ to al-Muḥāsibī stricto senso, as both he and his teaching were not especially ‘mysti-cal’. He was, ultimately, not a mystic striving for union with the Divine but rather an expert in the human condition and masterful exponent of the inner depths of the soul. He does, however, occupy a fascinating position within Islamic history as he is an intermediate between the nascent asceticism of the post-Prophetic era and the mystical schools of third-/ninth-century Baghdad and thus acts as a"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Conclusion 219conduit between these two worlds. Perhaps it is for this reason, and bearing in mind the deep and insightful knowledge of al-Muḥāsibī manifested in the current study, it is little surprise that outside fanatical Ḥanbalite circles al-Muḥāsibī enjoyed a great deal of praise and infl uence. Indeed, one may attribute this to the relevance of his works in every age since, from the Islamic perspective and as al-Muḥāsibī himself notes, the nature of human souls is quite similar and therefore for aspirants on the path to God his works are as relevant today as they were when he fi rst wrote them. In conclusion, it has been shown that, far from being a simple Sufi , al-Muḥāsibī was a multifaceted and multi-talented scholar who wrote in a variety of fi elds of Islamic learning and, consequently, he made a considerable contribution to the tradition as a whole but most notably in the fi eld of tazkiyat al-nafs. Perhaps it is fi tting to end with a quote from the most famous of the later Ḥanbalite scholars, the eminent shaykh al-Islām Aḥmad b. ʿAbd al-Ḥalīm Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328), who did not follow his school’s eponym in repudiating al-Muḥāsibī but rather appreciated the value of his teachings saying, ‘He possessed knowledge, virtue, asceticism and discourse regarding the spiritual realities (al-ḥaqāʾiq), which has been widely celebrated’.15Notes 1 John R. Hinnels (ed.), Penguin Dictionary of Religions, pp. 492 and 494; and Gordon S.

See Geoffrey Parrinder, Mysticism in the World’s Religions (London: Sheldon Press, 1974), p. 8. 7 Wakefi eld (ed.), A Dictionary of Christian Spirituality, p. 272. This developed in the theory and practice of Christianity; already in the Apocrypha of the Old Testament a ‘mystery’ was known to the initiated (mystes) as a secret doctrine, which, though not necessarily diffi cult to understand, should not be revealed. In the New Testament the ‘mystery’ is the revelation of the word of God, which had not been known in previous ages but was now revealed to the believers. Paul developed this further using terms that could have a technical, mystical association, such as ‘illuminated’, ‘fullness’ and ‘wisdom’. Other, later Christian writers and theologians spoke regularly of the sacra-ments as mysteria, baptism as mystikon and the celebrants of the Eucharistic mystery were ‘mystagogues’. The basis of all of this, however, was in the Neoplatonism of Plotinus, who combined Platonic and other mystical ideas into a coherent whole and whose essays are from the classics of mysticism. Plotinus taught the union (enosis) of the soul with the divine one, which is the Good and the source of all existence and"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"220 Conclusionvalues. Later Christian writers absorbed Neoplatonic ideas and a crucial role was played by the short but potent writings of the so-called ‘pseudo Dionysius’. Pseudo Dionysius seems to have been an anonymous Syrian monk who lived around 500 CE and who used many technical terms of the Mysteries. He, like Plotinus before him, wrote of the ‘union’ of the soul with God and the gradual ‘divinisation’ (theosis) of man, and says that by the exercise of mystical contemplation, the mystic will rise ‘by unknowing’ (agnosia) towards the union, as far as it is attainable, with him who transcends all being and knowledge. See Parrinder, Mysticism in the World’s Religions, pp. 8–10. 8 Hinnels (ed.), Penguin Dictionary of Religions, p. 333. 9 Ibid., p. 334.10 For an excellent discussion regarding the defi nition of mysticism see Robert S. Ellwood (Jnr.), Mysticism and Religion (Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall Inc., 1980), pp. 27–31. The author eventually settles for the following defi nition: ‘Mystical experi-ence is experience in a religious context that is immediately or subsequently interpreted by the experiencer as an encounter with ultimate divine reality in a direct, non-rational way that engenders a sense of unity and of living during the experience on a level of being other than the ordinary’.11 Ellwood, Mysticism and Religion, p. 11.12 Ibid., p. 12.13 See Smith, An Early Mystic, pp. 57–8 and 222–52.14 Indeed, al-Muḥāsibī was extremely critical of expressions of such unitive and mystical experiences, as the incident with Abū Ḥamza related by al-Hujwīrī in his Kashf al-Maḥjūb indicates.15 Ibn Taymiyya, Majmūʿat al-Fatāwā, vol. 6, p. 521."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Appendix 1Map of Iraq and its surrounding regions at the time of the early ʿAbbāsids"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Appendix 2Map of Baghdad at the time of the early ʿAbbāsidsA.
