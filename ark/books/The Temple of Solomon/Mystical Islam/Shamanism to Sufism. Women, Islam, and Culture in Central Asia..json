How could I research such a topic in our ancient lands, when the study of religion was forbidden and the amalgam of ‘music and religion’ said not to exist? According to the Soviet account at that time, all Soviet republics, including Uzbekistan, were populated exclusively by ‘atheists’. Not only the relationship between music and religion, but the very pres-ence of such a phenomenon as Islam was under question. I remembered myself that in the early 1980s several of our relatives from Andijan, which is in the Ferghana Valley, were excluded from the Communist Party just because they had buried one of the family members in a traditional Muslim way.After several weeks of fieldwork in and around the same Andijan, I discovered that, in fact, the area was deeply involved in musical religious activity performed by women, each village having its own female repre-sentatives. It transpired that the whole Ferghana Valley area harboured the most interesting, intensive and varied forms of religious rituals, none of which had previously had any opportunity of being mentioned in any official papers, research projects, books or articles. I felt just like Columbus discovering America.I must mention that after speaking to these women, and having reas-sured them that I was not going to give away their secrets, I was allowed to join their rituals, to make recordings and take interviews. But there was a long way to go. I still had no idea how I could approach the many hours of recordings to examine this heritage. There were several questions to be answered. How was it that this whole phenomenon had gone unnoticed, delib-erately or naturally, for a whole century, without being acknowledged by researchers, folklorists, or the media? Could these rituals be categorised as a musical phenomenon, as their status was not that of a musical perfor-mance but an integral part of daily life? How could one recognise such performances within the long-standing tradition of ‘liturgical music’ (a term accepted in Islamic music study) if, as forms of religious service, they Prelims.indd xiPrelims.indd xi1/5/11 4:18 PM1/5/11 4:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xiiFROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMwere interwoven with the routine of everyday life? Should they count as a ‘musical phenomenon’ at all, consisting as they do of vocal recitation with-out any instruments? Should they be classified simply as recital of poetry?I had some practical questions for myself too: how in the late 1980s could I conduct research into this rich unknown material, and speak up about the amazing, all-female rituals of religious nature, when female members of local communities were still involved in them? What should be the focus in studying these rituals? What was the right angle from which to scrutinise them? Should I look at this phenomenon as an insider, as a person for whom the Ferghana Valley was a native place, or as an outsider for whom the rituals were just another example of live music performed in local communities with limited access for outsiders? Eventually, hav-ing looked through other research and having found many interesting sources to help me to approach these recordings, I was convinced that what I had found there and then in Uzbekistan was a unique genre of religious ritual based on poetry and music, or, more precisely, Sufi poetry and music, which had undergone development deep underground. For centuries scholars and historians studied those questions focusing only on male involvement leaving behind its overshadowed female face. Therefore this book is a long journey to Central Asian culture, religions, and music-making traditions performed in female communities. Pre-Islamic religious practices and mainly Shamanism as well as Islamic Sufism are the main stops on that journey and women are the main heroines.Prelims.indd xiiPrelims.indd xii1/5/11 4:18 PM1/5/11 4:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"11Historical Overview1. EARLY RELIGIOUS PRACTICES AND BELIEFSAt the dawn of Central Asian civilisation the sun shone above the moun-tains, steppes, and valleys. The sun was considered to be a god and people worshipped it every single day. The sun was pre-eminent and everyone knew that life depended on it. The sun was the centre of attention and crowds of pagans knelt down at its appearance, setting rituals for its honour. The sun would set and yet return, and people would celebrate this again and again. Prayers and hymns were sung to please the divinity at sunrise.Sun-worshipping rituals developed into other rituals and people cel-ebrated every important event with singing and dancing. The sun was associated with different aspects of the culture of the universe, and sunlight was praised from dawn to dusk. Central Asian peo-ple considered the sun to be their God . . . Fire, as sun’s reflection, was also worshipped, creating the basis for Zoroastrianism.1 It also features in many other belief systems, including Central Asian Tengrianism,2 Manichaeism,3 and Shamanism.The questions we investigate in this book are: How are all these reli-gious practices reflected today in Central Asian culture and music? Where one can find their traces? Who performs these rites? As in the past, female gatherings in Central Asia area relate to the system of celebrations based predominantly on Islam but also on the solar/lunar calendar or on different religious beliefs, such as Manichaeism, Tengrianism, and Zoroastrianism. Women celebrate the most famous events like Navruz (pre-Islamic New Year celebration) with singing, to the accompaniment of doira (frame drum) or clapping, featuring solo, duet, or chorus singing which are based on repetitive forms of blessings, greet-ings, or jokes. Ceremonial singing is built on simple melodic patterns, short metrical and rhythmical structures that date back to the time when singing was intended to protect, and to deflect the power of spells and the Chapter 01.indd 1Chapter 01.indd 112/27/10 7:28:36 PM12/27/10 7:28:36 PM"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMevil eye. The music-making process in general is associated with the nature of the universe.According to scholars, at the very beginning of human history the sky was mythologically associated with the ‘mother goddess’, the giver of life, representing all time and space. Myths accounted for planetary cycles, marking days, nights, months, and years of unending time. So, in general, spiritual practices were based on local beliefs that god is a woman. Mythical and cosmological views developed in Central Asia were associated with the motion of the solar system – the sun, moon, planets, comets, and so on. In ancient times nomads of the Great Steppes of Central Asia believed in a god of the Sky called Tengri.4 This faith was based on the belief that Tengri created everything in the world from chaos and oceans.5 Tengri had two halves: the male and the female – Tengri Umai. Tengri Umai lived on the top of the mountain Sumera, in the upper sky near the milky mountain lake Sutkol. From the foot of Tengri Umai was born the goddess Ot-Ona (mother-fire), who resides in the fireplace of every house, being responsible for meals and warmth.6Central Asian peoples believe that fire is sacred. In Zoroastrian belief an Indo-Iranian cosmological figure, Anahita (Aredvi Sura Anahita in the Avestan language), was the goddess of water and rain. Associated with fertility, healing, and wisdom, she looked after the well-being of women, promoting fertility, safe childbirth, and making the life of women a lit-tle easier. In the area of Khorezm (west of Uzbekistan), Anahita became known as Ambar-Ona, whose power comes from the Amu Darya River. Female Shamans still invoke her name for the success of healing rituals. At Navruz, songs are performed in her honour during the preparation of the sacred meal Sumalyak (Photo 1).7In the Boisun area, in the southern part of Uzbekistan, the story ofBibi-Seshanba (Lady Tuesday) is still widely popular today. The female goddess Bibi-Seshanba is believed to be the protector of all women in the world. She is praised, and her help is invoked where women are gathered together. At these gatherings the women sit on the floor around a table-cloth set for lunch, light candles, burning off the isrik (dried herb healing treatment).All appeals are made to the goddess in collective prayers and singing, in the dark, smoky room. The ritual proceeds slowly, and begins with prayers said aloud and the singing of devotional poetry – this is the main part of the ceremony. This is followed by confessions in which every participant joins in, and discussion across the room. The full ritual is performed on a Tuesday, Chapter 01.indd 2Chapter 01.indd 212/27/10 7:28:36 PM12/27/10 7:28:36 PM"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"3HISTORICAL OVERVIEWwhich, as we shall see, is appropriate. The very name of the ritual means an appeal to Mother-Mushkul Kushod, ‘the lady who solves problems’. The roots of this tradition lie in the distant past when Turkic people believed in Mother Umay, a Turkic goddess. Later, these beliefs were trans-formed into the Islamic cults of Mother Aysha, the wife of the Prophet Mohammad, and of Mother Fatima, his daughter. Their image as protec-tors of fertility and patronesses of women became extremely popular with Islamic women. 2. ISLAM IN CENTRAL ASIAThe Muslims first entered Central Asia in the middle of the seventh century during their conquest of Persia. The local peoples of Mawarannahr, as the Arabs called this place between the two rivers Amu Darya and Syr Darya, were unable to defend their land against the Khilafah because of internal divi-sions and the lack of strong indigenous leadership. Nevertheless, for a long period, the Muslims were unable to conquer the territory, and the process was completed only in the eighth century. An important role in the conquest was played by the Arabian military leader Qutaybah ibn Muslim (killed in 718). Arabs were highly motivated not just by the desire to spread Islamic ideology but by the wish to annex new territories with rich resources.8Photo 1: Navruz ritual – making Ser-Malyak Chapter 01.indd 3Chapter 01.indd 312/27/10 7:28:36 PM12/27/10 7:28:36 PM"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"4FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMThe new way of life brought by the Muslims spread throughout the region. In the ensuing centuries native cultures were replaced or trans-formed as Islam moulded the people into a single community – the Islamic umma. However, the destiny of Central Asia as an Islamic region was firmly established in 750 by the victory of the Khilafah (Caliph Abu’l-Abbas) over Chinese armies in a battle at Talas River. Under Islamic rule, Central Asia was, for centuries, an important centre of culture and trade. The language of government, literature, and commerce – originally Persian – was replaced by Arabic. Mawarannahr continued to be an important political player in regional affairs. During the height of the Abbasid Caliphate in the eighth and the ninth centuries, Central Asia and Mawarannahr experienced a blossoming, and Bukhara became one of the leading centres of learning, culture, and art in the Muslim world, its magnificence rivalling contemporaneous cultural centres such as Baghdad, Cairo, and Cordoba. Some of the greatest historians, scientists, and geographers in the history of Islamic culture were natives of the region. One should mention here that Imam Muhammad ibn Isma‘il al-Bukhari (810–70), the author of Sahih al-Bukhari (or: Al-Djami al-Sahih) (The True Collection of Sayings and Actions of the Prophet Muhammad), which is considered to be the most reliable and important code of hadiths – the second most important source in Islam after the Holy Qur’an – was born in Bukhara, the fourth holiest place in Islam after Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem. The names of al-Khakim Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Ali al-Tirmizi (ninth century), Burhan al-Din Marginani (twelfth century), Abu Nasr al-Farabi (d. 950), Abu Ali ibn Sina (Avicenna, d. 1037), Abu Raihan Muhammad al-Biruni (d. 1048), Mirza Ulughbek (killed in 1449), and others were well known not just in the Islamic world, bringing fame to the area and generating respect across the world. Many scientific achievements at this time had a great impact on European science.9 Avicenna’s Canon of Medicine, translated into Latin in the twelfth century by Gerhard von Cremona, was for centuries the pre-dominant medical book in all European universities. Words like ‘algebra’ and ‘algorithm’ are rooted in the Islamic history of Central Asia, being references to the name of Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khorezmi (eighth century) and his work Al-Kitab al-muhtasar fi hisab al-jabr va-l-mukabala (The Brief Book on Accounting Algebra and Mukabala).There is an opinion that Central Asia entered a ‘golden age’ at the time of Amir Temur, who was also known as Tamerlaine the Great (1370–1405), Chapter 01.indd 4Chapter 01.indd 412/27/10 7:28:37 PM12/27/10 7:28:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"5HISTORICAL OVERVIEWwhen Samarkand became the centre of political, scientific, and cultural life. There, Amir Temur gathered architects, craftsmen, builders, musi-cians, singers, and dancers from all the neighbouring countries that had been conquered by him. Cultural life was a mix of many different eth-nic–national traditions, and it flourished spectacularly well. Architectural marvels from that epoch can still be seen today – the splendid mosque Bibi-khanum, Shahi-Zinda, Registan Square in Samarkand, Aq-Saray pal-ace in Shahrisabz, and the magnificent shrine of Saint Ahmad Yassavi in Turkestan. Temur the Great celebrated each of his victories, diplomatic successes, and family events (especially weddings) splendidly, with music, poetry, and dances. Hundreds of thousands of people took part in the festivals and holidays, which took place in Samarkand and Shahrisabz. Splendidly-decorated city arches and pavilions were especially built for the celebrations, some of which continued for as long as three months. Singers, actors, dancers, circus acrobats, fighters, hunters, horsemen, and thousands of musicians all took part, providing contact with various neigh-bouring countries and historical-cultural territories such as India, China, Eastern Turkestan (today Kashghar in Northwestern China), Turkey, and Iran. No wonder, then, that, as the historian of Temur’s life and epoch, Sharaf ad-Din Yazdi wrote in his book Zafar-name (The Book of Victo-ries), the musicians and singers played and sang to (according to the origi-nal text) ‘yusuns of Turks and ayalghu of Moghols, rools (rasm) of Chinese and qaida-yi Arabs, tariqa-yi Persians and tartib-i Ajam’ (Persian tunes, Arabic melodies, Mongol vocal styles, Turkish customs, Chinese singing rules, and Altai metres).10Women also took part in these celebrations as musicians, singers, and dancers. The main form of gathering was known as majlis. These ‘feasts’ or ‘meet-ings’ brought together poets, musicians, scholars, artists, and other people from the intellectual community; even some members of the ruling (shah’s) family played instruments at the assembly. That epoch continued for some time after Amir Temur died, as his most wonderful heritage during the period of the Temurids. The great poet and founder of classic Turkic and Uzbek literature Alisher Navoiy (1441–1501) was not only one of the viziers of the Temurid ruler Husain Baiqara (d. 1506), but also a great poet who participated in the court’s entertainment life. Navoiy liked music very much and involved himself from time to time with performance and music com-positions, creating pieces in the genres of Naqsh and Peshrav. At the courts, benefactors such as Alisher Navoiy created artistic dynasties that continued Chapter 01.indd 5Chapter 01.indd 512/27/10 7:28:37 PM12/27/10 7:28:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"6FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMfor generations. The British Museum has a collection of magnificent manu-scripts with miniatures produced by those who were working for him.While the Age of Enlightenment was progressing through Europe, Islamic Central Asia entered a period of long deep stagnation crisis in its development (which, according to some scholars, had started in the sixteenth century), engendered by many serious causes, such as trans-regional and international economic routs; and it was torn apart by self-destructive wars, ideological paralysis, and economic problems.3. CENTRAL ASIA UNDER RUSSIAN AND SOVIET RULETsarist troops invaded Central Asia in the second part of the nineteenth century as a part of the ‘Great Game’, whereby both Russia and the British Empire were intent on securing part of the southern frontier for economic, social, political, and strategic purposes. The Russian conquest of Central Asia in the nineteenth century was easily accomplished owing to tribal or clan warfare. During the colonisation of Central Asia, Russian forces confronted resistance by members of the Sufi orders rather than opposition from local feudal lords, the state apparatus or the armies of local rulers. Nonetheless, at that time, the Russians were mere intrud-ers and did not overtly attempt to transform Islam in Central Asia: for the most part, they ignored Islam and focused on expansion. Tsarist Russia did not exert much power, money, or time in what is modern-day Uzbekistan, and generally did not interfere with the Muslims or Islamic observance.11However, Islam in Central Asia was affected by Russian colonisation. A reformist movement called Jadidiya (jadid means new in Arabic), which initially started in Russian Muslim regions, especially in Povolj’e (Kazan and Ufa) and Krym, and also in Turkey, spread among young Islamic intellectuals in Bukhara, Samarkand, Tashkent, and other cities of Russian Turkestan. They argued for political, economic, and social progress, for reforming Islam and Islamic lands according to modern civilisation. The names of Mahmudhodja Behbudi, Abdurauf Fitrat, Munavvar Qori, and others are still remembered in Central Asia.12In 1917, the Communist authorities of the Soviet Union inherited Central Asia from the old Tsarist Empire, which had collapsed during the First World War. In spite of the political turmoil existing within the former Tsarist Empire, heightened by the civil war that followed, the newly created Communist Chapter 01.indd 6Chapter 01.indd 612/27/10 7:28:37 PM12/27/10 7:28:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"7HISTORICAL OVERVIEWregime did not allow the Central Asian region to escape its clutches. It became clear to the Muslims of Central Asia that the Bolsheviks had no intention of granting Muslim independence, even though the Muslims, and particularly Jadids, initially supported the Bolshevik Revolution.The Communists viewed Islam, like any other religion, as ‘the opium of the people’. It was treated with hostility and suspicion, and the Muslims of the Soviet Union were subjected to countless secularisation campaigns. Initially, Bolsheviks adopted a policy of assimilation that was passive enough to preserve the archaic form of Islam and Islamic culture, but which soon took a more aggressive stance against Islam. The acceptance by Central Asian Muslim groups of certain socialist ideas did not imply any change in the orientation of their campaign. It was simply the revo-lutionary aspect of the Russian socialist movements that attracted them, not Marxist doctrine. Muslim freedom fighters, called Basmachi (rob-bers), fought alongside the White Russians in the civil war against the Bolsheviks, fought largely on Muslim soil. By 1920, Russian troops had stormed the Islamic citadels of Central Asia and present-day Uzbekistan, Bukhara and Khiva, and transformed them into People’s Soviet Republics. They also tried to replace the region’s Islamic identity and loyalty with ethnically created republics.In 1924, the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialistic Republic, Bukhara and Khorezm People’s Soviet Republics were carved up by the then Commissar of Nationalities, Joseph Stalin. Over a period of time, five ethnic republics were created, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan in 1924, Tajikistan in 1929, and Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in 1936. Shirin Akiner notes that, ‘These republics were entirely new state formations with no basis in historic nation-states. They were created not in response to popu-lar demand, but at Moscow’s behest.’13The Soviets had clear political reasons for creating what were formerly known as Turkestan and Bukhara and Khorezm, into five new republics. The first was based upon a clear policy of divide and rule. Moscow did not want the creation of an ‘Islamic Turkestan’ to be a singular republic within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Moscow was particularly virulent in quashing all forms of Islamic identity that existed in the region, and sought its replacement with attempts to form loyalties to the newly-created republics and to Marxist ideology. Martha Brill Olcott has argued that ‘Stalin drew the map of Soviet Central Asia not with an eye to consolidating the natural regions, but rather for the purpose of reducing the prospects for regional unity.

Moreover, boundaries were set to insure the presence of large irredentist populations in each republic.’14The Muslims of Central Asia were thus subjected to living within the Soviet Union under an authority and an assumed identity to which they did not adhere. The emphasis which the Soviets placed upon ‘ethnicity’was formulated to channel the allegiance of the Muslims towards the newly created republics, while their Islamic identity was viciously suppressed.15It is interesting to see what happened to the Islamic and traditional identity of Central Asian people during the 1930s, the time of the ‘cultural revolution’ when the Soviets were enthusiastically creating a new Soviet ideal.4. ‘LAND PLOUGHED BY CULTURAL REVOLUTION’The cultural situation in the Central Asian republics during the 1930s was as complex and controversial as in many other regions of the former Soviet Union. The introduction of a new alphabet was accompanied by a revolutionary upheaval in culture and the arts, creating tension between new things found to be in the spirit of the time and old ones rejected as obsolete. The latter were mostly seen in the system of cultural traditions. The new cultural policy favoured mass art on a large scale, in keeping with modern life, ‘taken out of the narrow national confines and opened to boundless internationalism’. That was achieved by encouraging amateur art – large companies of amateur musicians, sometimes reinforced with a few professionals, performing new genres. It should be noted that the ori-ental world of Central Asian republics was, at that time, particularly rich in professional music of ancient oral tradition with a whole constellation of great names representing its splendour. How did that new socialistic art emerge and evolve against the back-ground of highly developed traditional culture? The only sources available on the subject are press reports and reviews which bear witness to the pro-cesses and events of those years. The slogans of the new cultural revolution in Central Asia were far-reaching. Here is a report by A. Bender entitled Musicians of the Great October : ‘Chopin and Beethoven will be heard from the states of our Chapter 01.indd 8Chapter 01.indd 812/27/10 7:28:37 PM12/27/10 7:28:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"9HISTORICAL OVERVIEW factories’ and collective farms’ clubs, they will be given a new sound and inspire our socialist Beethovens, Tchaikovskys, and Mussorgskys. Where only yesterday all was obscurity and ignorance, where vicious exploitation and colonial plunder suffocated all talents, magnificent self-taught musi-cians of the Great October are flourishing in the land ploughed over by the great revolution.’16The epithets ‘obscurity, ignorance, suffocated talents’, so arrogantly applied by the reporter to a millennium-old culture, seem all the more mis-placed when we think of the many illustrious names which stood in those years for the best achievements in the Asian oral artistic tradition. Music researchers noted at the time: ‘great love of poetry, music, and other arts among the working people of Uzbekistan. Nearly each home has ( popular folk instruments) tanbur, dutar, and nai. The Uzbek people highly esteem their poets and prose writers, also their singers, particularly with high voices.’17Great popularity was enjoyed by leading musicians, such as Maqam singer Domulla Khalim Ibadov, or mullah Tuychi Tashmuhamedov, a con-noisseur and performer of traditional music, widely known far beyond our Central Asian republics. Another celebrated name was Hoji Abdulaziz Rasulov, a singer and dutar player from Samarkand, who had visited Mecca and studied the music of Iran, Arabia, India, and Afghanistan. Shorakhim Shoumarov, a singer loved in Ferghana and Tashkent, was invited to Bukhara by its last Emir Alimkhan (1910–20). Another voice much valued in Bukhara belonged to Levi Babakhanov, who was recorded by the Riga Gramophone Company before the 1917 October Revolution. The best-known Maqam singer in Khorezm was Madraim Jakubov (also called Sherozi). His reputation was so great that the best way to gather people for any purpose was, they say, for the royal herald to call out, ‘All go to Nurlibay (the former palace of the Khiva Khan) to hear Sherozi sing his songs.’18 Kyrgyzia also had its own flourishing school of singers and other performers: the singer-poet (akyn) Toktogul Satylganov and his followers are well remembered to this day. The history of oriental music of that time would not be complete without mentioning the glorious contribution of the Turkmen masters Shukhur-Baqshi, Mollanepes Sari-Baqshi, Tourli-ogli, and Targmamed Sukhunkuliyev. Kazakhstan – the land of the legendary singer Korkut-Ata – treasures the names of Ykhlas Dukenov and Makar Sultanaliyev. The republic’s west rang with the fame of Kurmangazi Daulekterey and Dina Nurpeisova, the east with that of Tattimbet and Dayrabay.

But the many names representing Central Asian traditional culture helped little in getting it official recognition. On the contrary, traditional art, as something belonging to the old world, was judged critically, and rejected in shame. The Communist Party’s cultural policy was set in the speeches of its leaders, such as the First Secretary of the Uzbekistan Communist Party’s Central Committee, Akmal Ikramov: ‘The average collective farmer is beginning to feel that old Uzbek music is not satis-factory. It was created many years ago when the Uzbek working people were doubly oppressed by the Khans and Beks and by the yoke of Russian imperialism, so that the leading motifs in Uzbek music were lamentation, wailing, and tears. That no longer meets the needs of our day.’19 Such a primitive sociological approach towards culture and the arts was the hall-mark of the time. The cultural revolution of that period was an active attempt to create a new culture in the region, based on a complete rejection of the old one. ‘The culture we are developing is in principle, in form, and in content different from the pre-revolution Kazakh culture,’ to quote the republic’s Communist Party press.20Cultural reforms were seen as a vehicle for new ideas and a new way of life. ‘Cultural work with the masses is not an end in itself,’ wrote cultural ideologues, ‘but a means to organise and edify young people including the Young Communists, a means to reach the principal goals set before us by the Party and Comrade Stalin.’21 The utilitarian attitude towards culture was not concealed, but flaunted in a form sometimes driven to the absurd: ‘Cultural work should arm collective farmers in their struggle for a successful spring sowing, in the organising of weed-ing, and in the campaign for good crops.’22 Further, ‘It should increase the class vigilance of the working masses and help expose the class ene-mies and their agents – defeated, but not yet completely crushed, the still lurking remnants of the Bai and Kulak classes (feudal lords and rich farmers).’23Thus, step by step, a new socialist culture was instilled and the old one ousted. Part of the programme was ‘a wide network of mass amateur art clubs – choirs, drama groups, and music companies – with a view of turning them eventually into collective fans’ theatres’.24 The result was a booming mass amateur movement encouraged and patronised from above. Amateur theatricals cropped up everywhere, reported in upbeat press reviews. ‘On Chapter 01.indd 10Chapter 01.indd 1012/27/10 7:28:37 PM12/27/10 7:28:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"11HISTORICAL OVERVIEWthe initiative of the Tashkent city council’s cultural department, weekend performances by Tashkent workers’ clubs are organised in the city park.

In his report to the 18th Congress of the Communist Party, Stalin mentioned a rise in the number of amateur clubs between 1933 and 1939, from 61,000 to 95,600.27 That was followed by a trium-phant report in the Kazakh Communist Party journal: ‘From the cultural development point of view the 1934–38 period was a true cultural revolu-tion. The number of clubs has risen in Kazakhstan to 4,119 by 1938.’28 To a superficial observer, the region’s culture had really undergone sub-stantial changes: within a short time, new artistic forms had sprung up to express new content in keeping with the time. But how had that been achieved? To what extent was that art new in reality? Who were the per-formers obeying the Communist Party orders in the newly recruited armies of amateur artists? Let us analyse, for instance, the way amateur orchestras were set up. The traditional folk instruments were meant to play in unison, each improvising in turn. Music was never fixed in writing, but existed in the artist’s memory. The basic melody was readily recognised and there-fore had no need of musical notation. Its further dynamic development depended on the skill and taste of the performer, who was highly sensitive to the response of the audience. New improvisations were produced for more sophisticated listeners; the culmination of the piece – the so-called Awj – was played with extra care, and so on. Such was the system of oral, unwritten, oriental monodic improvised music. Those original characteristics were then distorted, the ancient refined manner of solo improvisation was standardised to suit European ideas of polyphonic orchestra sound. It was done crudely and awkwardly, as witnessed by one of the conductors: ‘We had to overcome the folk musi-cians’ solo traditions . . . to tune all the instruments to a single orchestra pitch, and to get all its members, used to creative improvisations, to play in a similar manner. Each had to be taught anew even those pieces he had known before.’29Chapter 01.indd 11Chapter 01.indd 1112/27/10 7:28:37 PM12/27/10 7:28:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"12FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMIn that way, amateur orchestras ‘stormed’ the unfamiliar technique, often without proper command of their instruments. Commenting on the first women’s dutar ensemble founded in Uzbekistan in 1939, the leading Uzbek musicologist Ilyas Akbarov remarked: ‘Most of the girls had a very vague idea of their instruments’ technique.’30 Moreover, by their nature, the folk instruments had a soft chamber sound which was not suited to the new repertoire. So, the instruments were modernised to get them closer to the European look and sound. The need for such a revamping is still hotly debated, but remember that the first step in that direction was taken during the 1930s. Another barrier then breached by the new type of music was the use of written notation previously unknown to oriental musicians. ‘A most radical shock for the monodic oral tradi-tion was to start playing with sheet music. It was a kind of aural and psychological revolution for both musicians and their listeners,’ writes N.G. Melik-Shahnazarova.31Other genres were easier to adapt. As to songs, the old tradition of textual contamination made it particularly convenient to set new words to old melodies. ‘For the coming tenth anniversary of the Turkmen republic the central commission for the celebrations will hold a contest for the best mass song. Ten prizes are offered. The texts are to reflect the main themes of socialist construction,’ announced the Turkmen press.32 And the required songs came forth: verses about ‘The Factory’ glorifying free col-lective labour with the ‘Omonyor’ refrain were set to the old Uzbek song of that name; the melody ‘Omonyor III’ was used for the verses ‘Salute the Kremlin’.33 The lively songs of the Koshuk, Lapar and Yalla genres were chosen for new texts, along with instrumental dance tunes and Ufar melo-dies from Maqams suitable for ‘singing glory’.34A similar process of creating new songs was followed by each choir or ensemble. Radio Tashkent set up a folk ensemble of musicians drawn from all over Uzbekistan. ‘The traditional folk songs are not the only ones mak-ing up the ensemble’s repertoire, there are also new ones about building collective farms, factories and plants, about the new free and happy life. The songs on the themes of the day are composed by the members of the ensemble. The most popular ones are “The Song of the Factory”, “The October Dawn”, “Our Epoch”, and many others.’35New songs to familiar old melodies adorned the programmes of con-certs and contests of folk art. This, as well as folk orchestras, was the sign of new times, of ‘reshaping the old way of life’. New conditions demanded an adaptation of that most venerated ancient Asian genre – the art of Chapter 01.indd 12Chapter 01.indd 1212/27/10 7:28:37 PM12/27/10 7:28:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"13HISTORICAL OVERVIEWimproviser-poets. The Turkmen Baqshi was now singing of heroic labour, new great names, and new ideas. A modest tune like Layale, limited formerly to everyday themes, was now used for grandiose modern sub-jects. Here is a new text to one of the girls’ layales: Sow your fields, collective farm!Manure them well, collective farm!Uproot the Bai and KulaksAnd burn them up, collective farm!Girls, sing a songOf a gallant riderWho fights with gloryFor his land.36The well-known song about a happy Kazakh mother by a Kazakh akyn (i.e. singer-poet) glorified the Stalin era. Lovely flowers on the rugMade by mother’s skilled hands. . .You’ll be, my baby, a mighty man,The flowers are for you.The steppe is singing songs for you,Stalin, radiant like the sun, is holding out to youGolden keys to a happy life.37That song, made up of traditional images and phrases, illustrates very well the ease with which new names entered the familiar patterns. A Kazakh improviser-poet usually freely adapts a stock of pre-set motifs to fit any current situation. He is ready on the spur of the moment, in any circum-stances, to pay homage to the victorious hero, or to salute the central figure of the feast, be it an old man celebrating his jubilee, or newlyweds, or a newborn baby, or just any hospitable host. A true singer can do that, effortlessly fitting any important name in his story, from the village elder to a khan or emir. With an ease characteristic of improvisational art, any ruler can be honoured, and from the 1930s that was, naturally, Stalin. That is the explanation for lines like these:We treasure our honour and our hoards,We’ll cut our foes to pieces with swords,We’ll fight in the sun, in the rain, in the snow,Till at last we make all our enemies go,Chapter 01.indd 13Chapter 01.indd 1312/27/10 7:28:37 PM12/27/10 7:28:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"14FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMThat at the victory Stalin should touchHis hand in contentment to his moustache.38Jamboul Jabayev, the author of the above lines, merits special attention. This Kazakh akyn was born in 1846 and created many epic poems in the Aytys, Tolgau, and Ornau genres – rich in form and colourful language. Jamboul enjoyed nationwide renown and was named ‘the patriarch of folk poets’. In 1938, he was elected deputy of Kazakhstan’s Supreme Soviet (parliament). He had won his fame long before the revolution, but the new events, the changing life, found response in his chants, adding new facets to his work. That included, of course, homage to Stalin:Sleep, my little one, Kazakh baby-boy,You’re safe in good hands.Stalin looks out the window.He sees all our land,He sees you, little one,He loves you, little one,The whole country cares for you,My warm little pet.39After Stalin’s death, Jamboul was accused of ‘creative contradictions’ and ‘ideological and artistic weakness’. His reputation was reassessed. What can we make of Jamboul’s art after all these years? Was it genuine and sincere? Or was he merely fawning to the Communist Party elite? Research into the contemporary press throws some light on the questions. The newspapers and magazines of the 1930s reveal that akyns were given literary secretaries, or consultants, who were supposed to docu-ment the singers’ improvisations. Moreover, there is evidence that the akyns’ texts were ‘edited’ and the poets were urged to learn the corrected versions for future use. Even should the authors reject the corrections, their written texts continued to have an independent existence, with accents shifted in such a way as to make the poetry ‘a product of the time’. It was admitted by some researchers that some of the editors added whole stanzas to Jamboul’s original texts in the personality cult vein. ‘I find the attitude towards folk poets far from deferential. Their work is often glossed over. Translators of Jamboul sometimes make fourteen lines out of his four . . .’ wrote the folklore scholar T. Vladimirsky in 1939.40 Because of this cavalier treatment, Jamboul himself felt highly respon-sible about his mission as a popular akyn. ‘When I sang about myself ’, he Chapter 01.indd 14Chapter 01.indd 1412/27/10 7:28:37 PM12/27/10 7:28:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"15HISTORICAL OVERVIEWsaid, ‘I also sang about my people . . . and my songs flew above our Jatys like free birds.’41So what was the effect of the 1930s on the cultural situation in Central Asia? The new genres fostered among amateurs have long been represented as ‘art of the new time’ alternative to the national artistic tradition of the region. True enough, in their external form, the mass amateur performances seemed very different from meditative oriental art. Ostensibly, the aim of creating a new art that differed from the national, regional, types had been achieved. But a more careful look at the content of amateur music of the 1930s reveals another picture: through the veneer of ‘new’ amateur forms we distinguish the inimitable features of Asian folklore with its unmistakable colour and flavour. No doubt, national art was used as a basis for some new artistic forms. But how could that new socialist culture emerge at all without the ancient traditional one that had existed for centuries in the land ‘ploughed over by the great revolution’?The Soviet Union attempted to challenge Islam intellectually with Marxist dogma and suppressed any public manifestation of Islam. Throughout the history of the Soviet Union and its dealings with Islam and the people of Central Asia, outright repression through to cooption were the mechanisms employed by the state. Although Soviet officials had previously confiscated religious property and either arrested or exiled mul-lahs, placed them under strict government control or forced them out of their religious positions (my own grandfather-in-law was shot dead in a Stalinist prison in 1939), that policy was relaxed during the Second World War to keep up the morale of the army and the people, since millions of Muslims were fighting on the Soviet side. In 1944, the Spiritual Board of Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan was created, thus allowing reg-istered clerics to worship within the constraints of state-sponsored Islam. The Soviet Union, as the state, sought to bring in certain aspects of Islam and tried to incorporate them within the state’s structure. This leads to a Soviet ‘official Islam’, sanctioned and acceptable to the regime, and an ‘underground Islam’, which sought to keep alive pre-Soviet Islamic ideas and practices.Soon after the end of the war Stalin’s attacks on religion resumed under the excuse of ‘fighting cosmopolitanism’, and new waves of arrests of national intelligentsia began to take place.The real boost to Islamic aspirations followed Uzbekistan’s independence in 1991, though political Islam has become one of the most contradictory Chapter 01.indd 15Chapter 01.indd 1512/27/10 7:28:37 PM12/27/10 7:28:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"16FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMand complicated problems of modern Uzbekistan and the whole of Central Asia. Civil war in Tajikistan (1994–97) and militant incursions into Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan (1999–2000) are the indicators of that difficulty.Uzbek life demonstrates the strong influence of Islam up to the present day. Like most Sunni peoples, the people of Uzbekistan have inherited and followed Islam in every aspect of their lifestyle, family norms, legal system and culture. The real boost to Islamic aspirations carried Uzbekistan’s inde-pendence in 1991, though the authorities, fearing the upheaval of radical Islam, started implementing their policy of repression under the banner of fighting fundamentalism. Out of nearly 5,000 newly opened mosques, at the time of writing, almost two-thirds have been closed or converted into sports halls or other public facilities. Thousands of Islamic figures have been arrested and imprisoned. This harsh policy towards Islam caused another wave of Islamic radicalisation, with incursions of Islamic guerrillas to the southern parts of Uzbekistan.On the other hand, the authorities could no longer deny Islam as a new source of people’s identity. They tried to make strong and clear separation between traditional or ‘enlightened’ Islam, which is supported by the state and considered as key national value, and fundamentalist Islam, which has to be dismissed from the country.42Chapter 01.indd 16Chapter 01.indd 1612/27/10 7:28:37 PM12/27/10 7:28:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"172Shamanism in Nomadic Culture5. THEORY AND PRACTICEShamanism probably developed in the Stone Age (possible the Palaeolithic era) and was known to all people in the early stages of their history. It has often been declared that originally, in deep antiquity, anyone was able to Shamanise.43Without going into the existing theories on Shamanism, I would like to draw reader’s attention to the most important elements of this practice, by considering the following questions: Who is a Shaman? How does a Shaman communicate with spirit? How is Shamanism connected to Islam? How popular is Shamanism among women? What is the role of music in Shamanic rituals? Those questions are addressed below.Examining the present rich variety of forms of Shamanism in Central Asia, numerous scholars mentioned that ‘in Central Asian culture Shamanism was an essential part of religious beliefs’.44 Based on cults of ancestors, stones, mountains, and the earth goddess Otukan, Shamanism was shared by the Uzbeks of the Oxus delta, and the Mongols and Turkmen.45 Nineteenth-century Russian ethnographers reported the presence of Shaman-sorcerers and exorcists in Tajikistan, who employed human skulls drums, smoke, and animal blood in their rituals.46 Similarly, the Uzbek and Kazakh Shamans, until the nineteenth century, had beaten sacred drums and were adept at divination and healing. Among the Kazakhs these specialists were known as Baqshi. They were said to have been able to communicate with jinns (spir-its, in Arabic), who acted as their familiars, helping them to cure illness, foretell the future, and combat the malicious influence of evil spirits.47The Turkmen also had Shamanistic beliefs, several of which persist in Afghan Turkestan. Among the Kirghiz and Uighur, Shamans were also known as Baqshi. While curing illness and foretelling the future, they Chapter 02.indd 17Chapter 02.indd 171/5/11 11:08 AM1/5/11 11:08 AM"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"18FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMused to beat drums, enter into trances, and invoke Allah, Adam, Noah, and other members of the ‘Biblical-Qoranic pantheon’.48 Ancient Turks called Shamans Kam. They are first mentioned in the Tan’shu, Chinese manuscripts of the tenth century, which refer to Hakass and their Kams (Shamans). Some evidence of Central Asian Shamanism is displayed in Kutadgu Bilig by Yusuf Hos Hajib (eleventh century) and the Dictionary of Turkic Dialects by Mahmud Kashgari (eleventh century).49Today, in Ferghana Valley, Shamans are mostly women. Shamanic ritu-als there take place during daylight hours, not in the dark as in Kazakh or Turkmen cases. In Ferghana Valley, Shamans are called baqshy, parihan, (Pary – a spirit, hondan – to read), or falbin (fal – a destiny, bin – to see). Also they could be called taib (tabib in Arabic) or kinanchi (the person taking evil from a patient). The predominant tool for Shamanic healing rituals is a frame drum.50According to the study of Shamanism, the term ‘Shaman’ is derived from the Tungus-Ewenki (the ethnicity living in the forests north and east of Lake Baikal in Siberia, speaking Altaic language) word saman or vaman,51 meaning a magician, healer, priest, mystic, poet, and performer of miracles, or a Shaman as ‘one who uses specific techniques of ecstasy’.52 These tech-niques include music, rhythmic dancing, seclusion, and, most frequently, Zikir (i.e. Zikr) – the repetition of mystical formulae.53 Therefore, the most distinguished features of Shaman should be: ‘unique ritual paraphernalia, a specialised mystical language, and operational procedures such as working for a fee’.54 It is a common picture to see that a Shaman ‘begins to pro-nounce his incantations and, holding a drum, strikes it forcefully against the ground’.556. HOW TO BECOME A SHAMAN?In studying Shamanism as an important phenomenon in Central Asian culture, we cannot avoid the usual question related to the origin of such experience: how to become a Shaman. What precedes a Shaman’s train-ing? By what means did the Shaman grasp the secrets of their compli-cated skills?It has often been declared that originally, in deep antiquity, anyone was able to Shamanise.56 However, the situation has changed these days. It seems difficult to imagine that the novice Shaman could begin prac-tising without first undergoing an apprenticeship from an experienced master (Photos 2 and 3). Nonetheless, ethnographers have gathered little Chapter 02.indd 18Chapter 02.indd 181/5/11 11:08 AM1/5/11 11:08 AM"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"19SHAMANISM IN NOMADIC CULTURE Photo 2: Healing Shamanic ritual with sweets sharing (Surkhandarya district, Uzbekistan) Photo 3: Magic fire ritual – purification prior to Navruz information confirming the existence of a ‘school’ of Shamans.

Here he would be taught to handle the drum, ‘dissemble, perform tricks, recite incomprehensible words, howl like all the animals, imitate the hissing of the snake, mimic, in sound, the ambling of the bear through brushwood and the scurrying of the squirrel along branches’. And among the Selkup, ‘a Shaman who agreed to teach (a beginner) would often remain in the tent of the young Shaman’s family and live there a certain time, less commonly taking the pupil to his home.’57However, among many peoples, no traditions of direct teaching have been found. For example, the Nganasan ‘oppose the view that a Shaman school exists, or that the Shaman is taught by anyone’. According to the Nganasan, the Shaman is supposed to do what the spirits and gods tell him.58Central Asian Shamans also made do without teaching. How can the absence of a Shamanic ‘schools’ be explained? Perhaps this teach-ing takes place in strict secrecy? No, quite simply, the ‘school’ is not the only, compulsory form of learning. Knowledge necessary to a Shaman can be gained independently. The ideas regarding the organisation of the world and the spirits have been known by the entire communities, and each member of the Shaman’s tribe interested in the subject would be well informed on the details of the Shamanic rites. As for the skills, these come with practice. Kharuzin himself stressed this fact. ‘The actual instruction involved not only mastering the ritual but also developing the essential qualities of the Shaman,’ he wrote. A person who is willing to become a Shaman ‘will develop and perfect these qualities during a preparatory period. He will strive to increase the number and clarity of his visions and dreams, have more frequent attacks, and place himself in a stimulated state.’59The novice Shaman seeks solitude. Away from the eyes of others, he tries his power in singing and in the art of mastering the drum. The Shamans of the Tajiks and Uzbeks stayed at home for forty days in ritual isolation. Alone with himself, the Shaman learned his new role. Not only did he learn to sing and perform the ritual, but most especially he developed the ability to fall into ecstasy and to contemplate the spirits. He was expected to master the technique of self-hypnosis, and this was done by continual practice. The training of the Shaman did not end with the preparatory period. According to the ethnographer G.D. Verbov, one night was usually sufficient for the future Shaman to learn the basic technique, but many years were needed to achieve mastery.Chapter 02.indd 20Chapter 02.indd 201/5/11 11:08 AM1/5/11 11:08 AM"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"21SHAMANISM IN NOMADIC CULTURE7. WOMEN AND SHAMANISM IN CENTRAL ASIAThe question of women’s role in Shamanism in Central Asia deserves special attention. Female Shamanism in the area has had a long develop-ment and is still popular today.The presence of female Shamans in Central Asia was documented at the beginning of the twentieth century as a phenomenon ‘under the sound of the drum and the singing of the Shamaness’.60 Female Shamans, like men, have also been through the ‘rites of initiation’ where spirits have given them the right to Shamanise.Very often, women became Shamans at a mature age. As Basilov noticed, ‘The good many Uzbek Shamanesses underwent the ‘Shamanic illness’ well after marriage, already having one to three children’.61 There are some special reasons for female participation in Shamanism. As the scholar and expert on Shamanism, Vladimir Basilov, assumed: ‘Belief in spirits, in saints, or simply in certain supernatural forces continues to attract to Shamans people, chiefly women, who are troubled with illness of a child or their own ailments. Sometimes those whom modern medicine has not been able to help will go to Shamans. They reason: Why not try my luck, just in case? And like hundreds of years ago, a homemade lantern for the sprits will be lit and the drum will sound.’62The social separation of male and female members of community pre-scribed by Islam, particularly Sunni Islam, is undoubtedly another reason for the wide spread of female Shamanism in Central Asia, where only female Shamans can assist women.According to Basilov’s reports, Shamanism is most deeply entrenched among the people of Central Asia and Kazakhstan. Describing a visit to the 80-year-old Kazakh Shamaness, Balbike-baksy (Southern Kazakhstan), Basilov mentioned that she told him ‘how she cures patients by playing on the kobuz and summoning the Muslim saints and spirits, the peri. At times she puts aside the kobuz and takes up a knife.’ Recounting the names of the saints, she touches the patient’s body with the knife. If the illness is grave, it is necessary to perform a Zikr; and those attending the ritual, along with the Shamaness, shout the names of Allah or phrases such as ‘There is no God but Allah!’Traditional forms of Shamanism are preserved among the Tajiks and Uzbeks. Their Shamanism has long been distinguished by great diversity. Male and female Shamans have different helping spirits, and different healing and fortune-telling practices. Instead of the drum (or sometimes additionally), a lash, a sieve, a wooden serving spoon, a staff, a mirror, and a cup with water are used as ritual objects.63Chapter 02.indd 21Chapter 02.indd 211/5/11 11:08 AM1/5/11 11:08 AM"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"22FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMAnother example was documented in Uzbekistan where Basilov met another Shamaness on many occasions. Describing the meeting in 1983 in southern Uzbekistan, the Shamaness ‘called her pari spirits by playing the drum and looked at the open pages of a book – the Birthday of Ker-Ogly, a folk epic (dastan). The spirits also aspired her to sing. After we became better acquainted she took up the drum and in high strong voice sang a song praising the scientists of the Academy of Science. “you see, my pari send you greetings”, she said.’64Female presence in Shamanic rituals affect even the province of fashion! According to Basilov: ‘The spirits are also favourably disposed to mod-ern fashion. I recall the village women talking about a twenty-year-old girl who had become a Shamanesss: Her dress is short, and her shoes are high-heeled, And she wears lip-stick! . . . the girl was dressing as the spirits commanded.’65We can further see that the female role in both religious practices devel-oped in similar way. When Shamanism was declining, women took it up. As we will see below, the same happened in Sufism: when male leadership was banned by Soviet policy, women took over and preserved that knowl-edge for new generations.8. EPIC FORMS: KYRGYZ HEROIC MANASEpic forms played an important role in Central Asian culture, where the Kyrgyz are the most ancient people of the area. An exclusive place in their cultural heritage is held by the heroic epic Manas, which is the chronicle and encyclopaedia of the Kyrgyz people, consisting of over one million lines. According to Jirmundskyi, Manas is longer than any other of the world epics. Sayakbay Karalaev’s version of Manas, for example, is twenty times as long as the Iliad and the Odyssey together, five times Shah-name, and two-and-a-half times as long as the Mahabharata.66Manas is also Kyrgyz sacred wisdom, which marks every state and family event from Independence Day to every single domestic celebration.As with all these examples of heroic epics, the place of Manas in Kyrgyz mentality could be described in the following words of Karl Reichl: ‘In the performance of heroic epics tribal and cultural origins are explored and hence the primary function of epic is not entertainment but the search for ethnic and cultural identity.’67 Despite its huge size, every Kyrgyz knows the main plot of Manas, can name all the main characters, and describe the most important episodes.

This phenomenon of esoteric knowledge transmission is widespread among Turkic-speaking people.68According to Rahmatulin: ‘the legend of spiritual contact is something special about Manas himself, as it brings the image of Manas to the highest accomplishment and prestige.’69 There is a widespread opinion that becom-ing a Manaschi is possible only when there has been a dream about it. Probably, such a dream makes a performer more confident in his talents and his destiny.70For example, Manas performer Saparbek Kasmambet, listening to famous Manaschi including Sayakbay Karalaev from early childhood, absorbed the best forms of its performance. Today he is a bard-improviser and a storyteller. When he was 12 years old he went through a severe ill-ness, dreaming about Manas every night, hearing voices and sounds of battle and war. His mother told stories about that difficult time. Once Saparbek woke up in the night claiming the horses of Manas were sur-rounding their house. He wanted to get out of the house but his mother, seeing he was ill and feverish, would not let him go. When she went out in the morning, to her surprise she found that the grass around the house had been trampled by horses – in a village where there were none! To get the boy out of trouble his mother slaughtered a goat to appease the spirits. Soon he recovered, and after that he began to perform Manas, as his mis-sion had been approved by the spirits. However, as he jokes himself, his voice is not deep and strong, but high and weak like a goat’s. If his mother had had enough money to slaughter a lamb, he would sound like a real singer!Everyone can tell fairytales, claim the Kyrgyz, but only professionalscan tell them as an artistic performance. Kyrgyz consider that Manas belongs to the genre style jomok (the narrative of the past). It is not only heroic genre images that are represented in Manas: there are laments (Koshok); songs of complaint (Armans); a statement of a will (Kereez); educational songs (Sanaat Nasiyat); descriptions of rites of passage (wedd-ings, engagements, feasts, mourning, burial); episodes of land division; tales of moving from one land to another; and so on.The epic Manas is considered to be an art of syncretism reminiscent of the theatre, with the remarkable singing of an inspired performer, his emotional excitement, his rich gestures, his body movements.Chapter 02.indd 23Chapter 02.indd 231/5/11 11:08 AM1/5/11 11:08 AM"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"24FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISM‘Within centuries the Manas epic played a role of education book-novel influencing the audience as a play, as a staged performance, screen, reflect-ing historical events from the past of the nation.’71 The vital force of Manas is reflected in its poetry echoing sounds of people and nature’s cry pen-etrating earth and sky:There was a great cry!The people cried!Weeping trees were crying!The grass was crying!Tears came out of the ground!Mourned the earth!There came a black dayDays and nights the dog of ManasKumayuk was whining!The cry went on days and nights.72Manas is performed only by men. Women also work on old Kyrgyz epics, for the purpose of healing and entertainment.73 Usually, they use their own preferred style for epic performance. One remarkable Kyrgyz female musician who works on the old epic style today is Roza Amanova. Coming from a traditional musical background (her mother Chonmurun kyzy Marjankul was a famous singer), Roza sings little-known genres, but her powerful voice captures you and the sounds stay with you for a long time. Her performance recreating the centuries-old epic Kurmanbek (the national hero of the sixteenth–seventeenth century) could, owing to its universal content, be of widespread interest today.74Kyrgyz epics and songs are moving and impressive. The world-famous Kyrgyz writer Tchingiz Aitmatov, in his novel Jamilia spoke of the ten-der, penetrating, yearning loneliness expressed in Kyrgyz songs, when the voice wavers and rings out with increasing power. These songs are able to evoke everything – mountains, steppes, grass, clouds, rivers, and people’s feelings.759. SHAMANISM AND ISLAMIslam in Central Asia was no different from other world religions from the point of its social functions. However, in the history of the area, Islam as the form of social conscience fostered wide growth in the humanities, phi-losophy, logic, linguistics, literature, and the arts.

The historian Narshahi wrote about that time: ‘Every time people of Bukhara were converted into Islam they soon gave up again.’76 All resistance was developed on theoretical issues of pre-Islamic religions of Central Asia like Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, and others. This could possibly explain the wide development of numerous Sufi orders within Central Asia as resistance against Islamic dogma and belief.77Islam and Shamanism in Central Asia are contrasting phenomena: Islam is a mass religion whereas Shamanism is represented only by rare individu-als, and was present in those lands which Islam conquered in the seventh century. Shamanism is usually associated with ‘marginal hunting cultures’ based on agriculture and animal herding, which lack the complex technical and social organisation of Islamic civilisation.78 Shamanism is represented by individual, personal communication with the spirits whereas Islam and Sufism are meant to be communal, mass association with God.Indeed, Shamanic beliefs in Central Asia have shown a remarkable abil-ity to persist alongside major religious traditions, from Islam’s point of view, Shamanic traditional tolerance for adat (from the Arabic for custom-ary practices) has enabled it to accommodate Shamanism as well as other indigenous cultural practices and beliefs.79 The main Shamanic attributes are represented by the upper and lower worlds. We may trace the develop-ment of the community priesthood from Shamanism. In southern Siberia, this process led to differentiate Shamans into ‘black’ and ‘white’ (where ‘black’ Shamans were servant of evil spirits and ‘white’ of good spirits), relating to the idea of the ‘lower’ and ‘upper’ worlds, though ‘the greater’ Shamans Shamanised to both.80The figure of the prophet, familiar to virtually every religion in the world, is also connected with Shamanism. In the prophet – chosen by god, who proclaims to the people revelations heard from the deity itself (or an angel) – it is not hard to recognise the Shaman, divested of ritual guise. The legend of Muhammad’s ascent into the sky riding a fantas-tic beast, from which he was shown heaven and hell, could be also of a Shamanic nature.81Islam had a well-organised clergy and enjoyed the support of the author-ities. All of them tried to do away with Shamanism.

However, in everyday life, many of those beliefs were adopted in a culturally disguised forms and therefore in an ‘Islamised’ way (i.e. adjusted to Islamic practices). In Central Asia, Shamanism took on a Muslim cast. Conflicts between mullahs and Shamans remained, but became a ‘professional competition’ rather than a collision of different ideologies. In their outlook, Shamans did not differ from other orthodox Muslims. When beginning a rituals, Shamans appealed first to Allah, then to the various Muslim saints, and only afterwards to their helping spirits, who were considered a kind of genie (jinn), so often mentioned in the Qur’an.82A typical synthesis between Shamanism and Islam can be observed in Uzbekistan where Uzbek Shamans began a seance by singing:For this undertaking of mine – bismilla,For all of my undertakings – bismilla,I lie down, I get up – bismilla,I set out on the journey – bismilla.Bismilla is a shortened form of the Muslim formula Busmillakhi-r-rakhmani-r-rakhim (in the name of Allah, the merciful, the good). It is to be uttered before beginning any undertaking, the Shamans of the other Central Asia people also began their rituals singing with similar phrases.83So, one can see that Shamanism employs divine forces for practical purpose: to heal, to solve a problem, and so on, when Sufism focuses on mys-tical union with no practical profit other than spiritual personification.Shamanism employs a spiritualist/medium. A sage establishes a direct line of connection with the spirits without any mediators. This means stronger links, a go-between for the physical and spiritual realms, having prophetic and healing powers, seeking therapeutic and curing effects for people. As mentioned above, no teachers are involved in a Shaman’s train-ing, only spirits.Sufism, a mystical development within Islam, is based on a different technique: on a well-established teaching system with ‘ladder’ structured development related to the idea of spiritual perfection following a master’s instructions. This is called Usto-Shogird. As we will see below, all profes-sional schools in Islamic civilisation are founded in this way, acknowledg-ing the influence of the teacher and all previous contributors.Chapter 02.indd 26Chapter 02.indd 261/5/11 11:08 AM1/5/11 11:08 AM"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"27SHAMANISM IN NOMADIC CULTUREAs shown, pre-Islamic religious practices have been integrated deeply with local traditional culture and art.

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTOur understanding of Islam in Central Asia would not be complete without considering the Islamic teaching called Sufism. The word Sufism (originally tasavvuf ) is, according to one widespread explanation, probably derived from the Arabic suf (wool; hence sufi, a person wearing an ascetic’s woollen garment), denoting Islamic mysticism. Although outside movements have had some influence on Sufi terminology, Sufism is definitely rooted in Islam itself. During the early years of Islam’s development (under the Prophet Muhammad, and later Abu Bakr, Omar, Usman, and Ali) the rule of law did not exist, and a source for the solution of every single problem occurring in social life had to be found somewhere. The Holy Qur’an, as the revelation of Allah, was the first book used in this way, and the Hadith – the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad – were added later. The profession of Muhaddith – collector and interpreter of the Hadiths – was developed at that time, and was close to the role of the contemporary lawyer.84 As the Muhaddith would make adjustments from time to time, according to his ability, to suit the government’s situation rather than considering the needs of society, compulsory law was soon established. Each Muhaddith had to follow, in his own life, prescriptions as set down in the Hadith. As the French scholar L. Massinion has pointed out, to follow Hadith meant to follow in every single step of private life the lifestyle of the founder of Islam, Prophet Muhammad – that is, an ascetic lifestyle full of trembling admiration for Allah.This ascetic development within the Muhaddith is considered to be the embryo of Sufism. Consequently, within the first century of Islam, for every Muslim believer, the image of God (Allah) appeared mixed with threats and admonishments concerning every single step of his life. Allah warned everyone that there was no escape from consequences, and that every single matter would be questioned in the next world.

A second figure, Rabi’ah al-Adaviyah (d. 801), culti-vated the attainment of mystical union with God through the love of God. A third, and controversial, mystic, al-Hallaj (857–922), lived as a wandering preacher, who gathered around him a large number of disciples. Such was al-Hallaj’s sense of the intimate presence of God that he sometimes appeared to be identifying himself with God. He is reported to have made a famous statement Ana-l-Haqq! (I am the Truth!), which caused such outrage that he was imprisoned for eight years, and in 922 executed in a horrible man-ner. Al-Hallaj’s death illustrates, in an extreme way, the tensions that would characterise the relationship between Sufi mysticism and the Islamic legal authorities. It was only in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that orders or Tariqahs emerged, which were stable enough to continue after the death of the founder. This continuity was achieved through the current master nominating a successor who would lead the order after his death. Thus, the origins of these orders could be traced through a chain of masters.The three regions principally associated with Sufism are Central Asia, Mesopotamia (Iran and Iraq), and North Africa. In Central Asia a num-ber of major Sufi orders emerged between the twelfth and seventeenth centuries. The earliest of these, Yassaviya, was founded in the region now known as Turkestan and played a major role in spreading Islam among the nomadic Turkic tribes of Central Asia.86 Possibly deriving from Yassaviya is the Bektashiyya order, which spread in Turkey. According to tradition, Hajj Bektash, the founder of Bektashiyya, originally belonged to the Yassaviya order. Another Central Asian order is Chishtiyya. The origins of this order are uncertain, although the founder is generally believed to be Mu’in al-Din Chishti (c. 1142–1236), a native of Sijistan. The order gradually spreads into India where it remains today as the largest and most important Sufi order.Chapter 03.indd 29Chapter 03.indd 291/5/11 11:14 AM1/5/11 11:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"30FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMMawlaviyya traces its origins to the famous Turkish mystic and poet al-Rumi (1207–73). The order’s name comes from the Arabic word Mawlana (our master), a title given to al-Rumi by the order. Mawlana was born in Balkh (nowadays northern Afghanistan) and later moved to the Turkish town of Konya, the home of the famous ‘whirling dervishes’.Kubraviyya was founded by Najm ad-din Kubra (1145–1221), a famous Sufi from Khorezm (nowadays Uzbekistan), and a pupil of Abu Najib Suhrawardi. Qadiriyya is also rooted in Central Asia, being founded by Abd al-Qadir Gilani (Djilani, 1077–1166). The Naqshbandis is possibly the most famous and widespread Sufi order nowadays. Founded by Baha ad-din Naqshband (d. 1389), based on the theory and practice of Yassaviya and the previous mystic school of Khajagon in a village near Bukhara in modern-day Uzbekistan, the order gradually spread eastwards into India and westwards into Turkey.Before describing specifics and differences of some major Tariqahs let us examine the common principles and practices that unite them under the name of Sufism. The Sufi path leading to God and the higher mysteries of the human ‘self ’ is based on the doctrine of stations (maqamat) and ‘states’ (hal or ahwal), which retains its importance for the Muslim mysteries, and is considered to be the cornerstone of Sufism. It may therefore serve as an apt introduction to the fundamental points.The Way (the form of mystical perfection) suggests at least three dif-ferent stages: Shariah, Tariqah, and Haqiqah. Shariah means to follow the public law. After learning Shariah one can reach the Tariqah (the Way, hence its second meaning as a Sufi order). This term Tariqah appeared in the ninth century representing not only the image of the Journey but also the image of the traveller and his stations (Maqams), which are essential for Sufism.Maqams (stations) of the Tariqah (way) are:Tawbah – confessionWa ra – circumspectionZuhd – temperanceFaqr – povertySabr – toleranceTawakkul – hope, prospect of God.87Maqams (stations) are stable, but there are other sudden outpourings of divine grace which are Hal (or plural: Ahwal ), that is, instant states of the soul. They could be different, introducing various emotional feelings and sentiments:Chapter 03.indd 30Chapter 03.indd 301/5/11 11:14 AM1/5/11 11:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"31SUFISM IN CENTRAL ASIAQurb –  closenessMuhabba – loveHauf –  fearRaja –  hopeShawq – passionUns –  friendshipItmanina – peace of mindMushahada – contemplationYaqin – confidence.After achieving all of these states, the traveller approaches the last stage, which is Haqiqat, meaning the ‘true being’.88 The culmination is that Sufis can sometimes feel so close to God that they lose the sense of their own self-identity and feel themselves to be completely absorbed into God. This, in fact, is the goal or Haqiqat of the Sufi. Through following a series of devotional practices, which lead to higher levels of ecstasy, Sufis aspire to realise a condition in which they are in direct communion with God. Ultimately, the individual human personality passes away and the Sufi feels his soul absorbed into God.Sufis strive to ‘constantly be aware of God’s presence’, stressing ‘con-templation over action’, spiritual development over legalism.

Sufism depends on emotion and imagination in the divine–human relationship. Sufism is unrelated to the Sunni/Shii split, schools of jurisprudence, social class, gender, geog-raphy, or family connections. It is closely associated with both popular religion and orthodox expression of Islamic teachings. It has been both opposed and supported by the state. Sufi rituals consist of the recitation of prayers, poems, and selections from the Qur’an, and methodical rep-etitions of divine names (Zikr) or Qur’anic formulas, such as Shahadah. In communal gatherings, Sufis perform Zikr aloud, often with musical accompaniment. The specific structure and format of the daily devotional exercises and activities were set by each order’s founders as a distinct spiri-tual path. The founder was the spiritual guide for all followers, who swore a special oath of obedience to him as their teacher, their Sheikh (or Sheikh). The record of the transmission of the rituals was preserved in a formal chain of spiritual descent (silsilah) extending back to the founder and then usually to Muhammad. Leadership was passed down either within a fam-ily line or on the basis of spiritual seniority within the Tariqah (order). The typical initiation rite transmits a blessing (Tarakah) to the disciple, transforming his or her soul.89So the main features of Sufism are: regular community meetings for religious purposes; a clear hierarchy within a constant number of members of the congregation, which is supposed to have a leader (Sheikh, Pir, or Imam) and his subordinates, and to include two or three generations; the presence of a succession, called silsilah, aimed at the transmission of sacred knowledge from older to younger members of the congregation; and the performance of Zikr (remembrance of God), an act of devotion during and after a prayer.11. MAIN TARIQAHS OF CENTRAL ASIA:NAQSHBANDIYYA, KUBRAVIYYA, YASSAVIYA,AND QADIRIYYANaqshbandiyyaNaqshbandi (Naqshbandiyya) is one of the major Sufi orders (Tariqah) of Islam. Formed at the end of the fourteenth century in the holy city of Bukhara, and based on the theories and practices of the previous orders (Yassaviya, Khajagon), the order is considered by some as ‘sober’, and Chapter 03.indd 32Chapter 03.indd 321/5/11 11:14 AM1/5/11 11:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"33SUFISM IN CENTRAL ASIAknown for its silent Zikr/Zikr (remembrance of God) rather than the voca-lised forms of Zikr common in other orders.The Naqshbandi order is also notable as it is the only Sufi order to trace its spiritual lineage (silsilah) to the Prophet Muhammad through Abu Bakr, the first caliph. In contrast, most other Tariqahs trace their lineage to Ali ibn Abu Talib, the prophet’s son-in-law and fourth caliph. The word Naqshbandi is Persian, taken from the name of the founder of the order, Baha ad-din Naqshband Bukhari. Some have said that the translation means ‘related to the image-maker’; some consider it to mean ‘pattern maker’ rather than ‘image maker’, and interpret Naqshbandi to mean ‘reformer of patterns’; others consider it to mean ‘way of the chain’ or ‘golden chain’.90This is the chain from Prophet Muhammad to Baha ad-din Naqshband Bukhari:Prophet Muhammad – Abu Bakr Siddiq – Salman the Persian, – Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, – Ja’far al-Sadiq, – Bayazid Bistami, – Abul-Hassan Kharaqani, – Bu Ali al-Farmadi, – Yusuf Hamadani, – Abul Abbas al-Khadr, – Abdul Khaliq Gijduwani, – Arif al-Reogri, – Mahmood al-Injir al-Faghnawi, – Ali- Ar-Ramitani, – Muhammad Baba as-Samasi, – Sayyid Amir Kulal, and, the last one, Baha ad-din Naqshband Bukhari – namesake founder of the Naqshbandi order in Bukhara.From here, the order branches into several sub-orders. One of the most important and widespread is the Naqshbandi-Mujaddadi branch founded by Ahmad Sirhindi. The chain between Baha ad-din Naqshbandi and Ahmad Sirhindi continues as below:Alauddin al-Bukhari al-Attar, – Yaqub al-Charkhi, – Ubaydullah al-Ahrar, – Muhammad Az-Zahid Wali, – Muhammad Darwish, – Khawaja al-Akmangi, – Muhammad al-Baqi Billah, – Ahmad Sirhindi.There are several existing branches of Naqshbandiyya in India, Pakistan, Turkey and Cyprus, and one in Uzbekistan, each with its own Sheikhs and silsilahs. There are 11 main principles of Naqshbandiyya first stated by Abdul Holiq Gijduwani:1) Conscious Breathing (Hosh dar dam). This means, according to Abdul Khaliq al-Gijdwani, that ‘the wise seeker must safeguard his breath from heedlessness, coming in and going out, thereby keeping his heart always in the Divine Presence; and he must revive his breath with worship and servitude and dispatch this worship to His Lord full of life, for every Chapter 03.indd 33Chapter 03.indd 331/5/11 11:14 AM1/5/11 11:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"34FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMbreath which is inhaled and exhaled with Presence is alive and connected with the Divine Presence. Every breath inhaled and exhaled with heedless-ness is dead, disconnected from the Divine Presence.’Ubaidullah al-Ahrar said, ‘The most important mission for the seeker in this Order is to safeguard his breath, and he who cannot safeguard his breath, it would be said of him, “he lost himself.”’Sheikh Naqshband said, ‘This Order is built on breath. So it is a must for everyone to safeguard his breath in the time of his inhalation and exhalation and further, to safeguard his breath in the interval between the inhalation and exhalation.’912) Observe Your Steps (Nazar bar qadam ). This means that the seeker must keep his eyes on his feet while walking. Wherever he is about to place his feet, his eyes must be there. He is not allowed to cast his glance here or there, to look right or left or in front of him, because unnecessary sights will veil the heart. This is why Sufi saints do not allow their followers, who have purified their hearts through constant Zikr, to look elsewhere other than at their feet. Their hearts are like mirrors, easily receiving and reflect-ing every image.Lowering the gaze is also a sign of humility – proud and arrogant peo-ple never look at their feet. It is also an indication that one is following the footsteps of the Prophet, who never used to look right or left when he walked, but used to look only at his feet, moving steadfastly towards his destination. Sheikh Naqshband said, ‘If we look at the mistakes of our friends, we will be left friendless, because no one is perfect.’923) Journey Homeward (Safar dar watan ). This means to travel to one’s homeland. It indicates that the seeker travels from the world of creation to the world of the Creator. It is related that the Prophet said, ‘I am going to my Lord, from one state to a better state and from one station to a higher station.’The Naqshbandi divides that travel into two categories. The first is external journeying and the second is internal journeying. External travel is from one land to another searching for a perfect guide to take and direct you to your destination. This enables you to move to the second cat-egory, the internal journey. Seekers, once they have found a perfect guide, are forbidden to go on another external journey. The second category is internal journeying. Internal journeying requires the seeker to reject his lowly manners and embrace a higher form, to cast out of his heart all worldly desires. He will be lifted from a state of uncleanliness to a state of purity.93Chapter 03.indd 34Chapter 03.indd 341/5/11 11:14 AM1/5/11 11:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"35SUFISM IN CENTRAL ASIA4) Solitude in the Crowd (Khilwat dar anjuman). Khilwat means seclusion. It signifies to be outward with people while remaining inward with God. Seclusion also is divided into external seclusion and internal seclusion. External seclusion requires the seeker to seclude himself in a private place away from other people. Staying there by himself, he con-centrates and meditates on the remembrance of God. This leads to the second category, internal seclusion. Internal seclusion means seclusion among people. Therein the heart of the seeker must be present with his Lord and absent from His creations while remaining physically present among them.It is said, ‘The seeker will be so deeply involved in the silent Zikr in his heart that, even if he enters a crowd of people, he will not hear their voices.’ This is the highest state of seclusion, and is considered the true seclusion, as mentioned in the Holy Qur’an: Men whom neither business nor profit distract from the recollection of God [24:37]. Sheikh Naqshband emphasised the goodness of gatherings when he said: Tariqatuna as-suhbat wa-l-khairu fil-jamiyyat (Our Way is Companionship, and Goodness is in the Gathering).945) Essential Remembrance (Yad kard ). The meaning of Ya d is Zikr. The meaning of kard is ‘do’, that is, the essence of Zikr. The seeker must make Zikr by negation and affirmation on his tongue until he reaches the state of contemplation in his heart.That state will be achieved by reciting every day the negation (La ilaha – no Gods) and affirmation (Il allah – but Allah) on the tongue, between 5,000 and 10,000 times, removing from his heart the elements that tar-nish and rust it. This daily Zikr will bring the seeker into the perfect pres-ence of Allah. The Zikr by negation and affirmation, in the manner of the Naqshbandi Sufi masters, demands that the seeker close his eyes, close his mouth, clench his teeth, glue his tongue to the roof of his mouth, and hold his breath.956) Returning (Baz gasht). This is a state in which the seeker, who makes Zikr by negation and affirmation, and comes to understand the Holy Prophet’s phrase, ilahi anta maqsusdi wa ridaka matlubi (O my God, You are my Goal and Your Good Pleasure is my Aim). The recitation of this phrase will increase in the seeker the awareness of the Oneness of God, until he reaches the state in which the existence of all creation vanishes from his eyes. All that he sees, wherever he looks, is the Absolute One. As Bayazid said: ‘When I reached Him I saw that His remembering of me preceded my remembrance of Him.’96Chapter 03.indd 35Chapter 03.indd 351/5/11 11:14 AM1/5/11 11:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"36FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISM7) Attentiveness (Nigah dasht). Nigah means sight. It means that the seeker must watch his heart and safeguard it by preventing bad thoughts from entering. It is acknowledged in the Naqshbandiyya that for a seeker to safeguard his heart from bad inclinations for fifteen minutes is a great achievement. For this he would be considered a real Sufi. One Sufi Sheikh said, ‘Because I safeguarded my heart for ten nights, my heart has safe-guarded me for twenty years.’978) Recollection (Yada dasht ). This means that the performer of Zikr safeguards his heart with negation and affirmation in every breath without leaving the Presence of Allah.9) Awareness of Time (Wuquf zamani ). This means to watch one’s composure and check one’s tendency to heedlessness. The seeker must know how much time he has spent in moving towards spiritual maturity and must recognise at what place he has arrived in his journey towards the Divine Presence. Ya’qub al-Charkhi recounted that his Sheikh, Ala’uddin al-Attar said, ‘In the state of depression you must recite istighfar (asking forgiveness) excessively, and in the state of elation, praise of Allah exces-sively.’ And he said, ‘To take into consideration these two states, contraction and expansion, is the meaning of wuquf zamani.’ Sheikh Naqshband explained that state by saying, ‘You have to evaluate how you spend every moment: with Presence or in Negligence.’9810) Awareness of Numbers (Wuquf àdadi ). This means that the seeker who is reciting Zikr must observe the exact number of repetitions entailing the silent Zikr of the heart. To keep an account of the Zikr is not for the sake of the account itself, but is for the sake of securing the heart from bad thoughts and to cause it to concentrate more in the effort to achieve the repetition prescribed by the Sheikh as quickly as possible. Sheikh Naqshband said, ‘Observance of the numbers in Zikr is the first step in the state of acquiring Heavenly Knowledge (ilm ul-ladunni ).’9911) Awareness of the Heart (Wuquf qalbi ). This means to direct the heart of the seeker towards the Divine Presence, where he will see nothing other than his Beloved One. It means to experience His Manifestation in all states. Ubaidullah al-Ahrar said, ‘The state of Awareness of the Heart is the state of being present in the Divine Presence in such a way that you cannot look to anyone other than Him.’100One of the most popular sentences belonging to the Naqshbandiyya is ‘Heart to Beloved and hands to business’ (Dil ba Yar va dast ba kar), which reflects the main social basis of the order (e.g. traders and artisans in urban Chapter 03.indd 36Chapter 03.indd 361/5/11 11:14 AM1/5/11 11:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"37SUFISM IN CENTRAL ASIAareas of Central Asia) and demonstrates the balance between spiritual and practical components.All together, the 11 main principles of Naqshbandiyya Sufi order were: 1) Conscious Breathing (Hosh dar dam) 2) Observe Your Steps (Nazar bar qadam) 3) Journey Homeward (Safar dar watan) 4) Solitude in the Crowd (Khilwat dar anjuman) 5) Essential Remembrance (Yad kard) 6) Returning (Baz gasht) 7) Attentiveness (Nigah dasht) 8) Recollection (Yada dasht) 9) Awareness of Time (Wuquf zamani)10) Awareness of Numbers (Wuquf àdadi)11) Awareness of the Heart (Wuquf qalbi).KubraviyyaSheikh Najm ad-din Kubra, a famous representative of Sufism in Central Asia, was a scholar who left behind him a rich legacy in the many sci-ences. His teachings, called Kubravia or Zahabia (golden teaching) have had a great impact on the spiritual life not only in Khorezm, but in the entire Islamic world. Najm ad-din Kubra was a connoisseur of souls. In his view, man is a microcosm (olami sugro) that has all the properties of a macrocosm (olami kubro). In the process of spiritual perfection, a teacher (Pir, Sheikh, murshid) should lead his apprentice (Murid) through the ten stages of Tariqah (Tawba, Zuhd, Tawakkul, Qanoat, Uzlat, Tavajjuh, Sabr, Murokaba, Zikr, Rizo)101 to the truth, Allah.Najm ad-din Kubra emphasises the theory of latif (tenderness), accord-ing to which space consists of a glass house, which is surrounded by con-sciousness, feelings, the spirit, and the body. Through special exercises, a seeker must feel and see the centre, which is the result of a change in the conditions, forms and colours. Kubra states that the spiritual condition of a seeker must pass through three shapes: circle, ellipse and point. The circle is the universe, the ellipse is the image of the world, and the point is the centre (wahdat) of the universe. Awareness of that fact is a reflection of the divine essence of peace. This pattern (circle – ellipse – point) is in con-stant motion, and has some colour, which depends on the distance from Chapter 03.indd 37Chapter 03.indd 371/5/11 11:14 AM1/5/11 11:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"38FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMthe centre. Every religion or ideology contributes to the theory a colour of their understanding. The theory of colour exists in almost all Sufi Tariqahs. It is typical for Yassaviya, Bektashiyya, and Kubraviyya.Kubraviyya colours progress as follows: white-yellow-blue-blue-green-red-black. The seven colours are associated with the seven states of the murid’s spirit: white – Islam, yellow – iman (conscience), blue – ahawan (gift), blue – imtinan (faith), green – iman (full faith), red – irfan (knowl-edge), black – hayrat, hayajan (surprise, admiration).102Each colour symbolises something. White for many people symbolises purity, innocence, honesty. For Najm ad-din Kubra this colour is a symbol of purification. Only after the through cleanliness and honesty can the murid embark on the road of Tariqah.Yellow, unlike white, is not valued by many people. For Najm ad-din Kubra this colour symbolises a heightened sense of love for God at the beginning of life in the name of God.Blue is the colour of the sky and the sea, marking the cold Arctic light and the shadows of the east – infinity and eternity. In Kubraviyya it sym-bolises a gift, the dedication of a new life to good, to the understanding and purification of sins, to the transition from everyday life to spiritual development. Blue is also the colour of dreams, tenderness, warmth, water. Najm ad-din Kubra places it after tawba on the path of faith, the exemp-tion from impure thought and deeds, transition from harom (abstinence from what is prohibited by God) to the pure halol.Green is a symbol of awakening life, recovery, new growth, the colour of grass and leaves. In Kubraviyya it is the colour of faith, the state of the murid when his soul is fully absorbed by genuine faith in God.Red has, on the one hand, a sense of protection, symbolising fertility, beauty, joy, love, and on the other hand, revenge, hatred, war, bloodshed. For the Kubraviyya red clothing is not quite the same as a separation of the spirit from the body, but a call to take care of the soul, spiritual awareness of the world.Black for many people means darkness, misery, grief, and is the colour of mourning, death, mystery, the underworld, and so on. For Najm ad-din Kubra black reflects our approach to the goal of the threshold of the divine world. A special place in the theory of Kubra includes colourlessness, which symbolises the achievement of the goal of haqiqat – true unification with the divine world, the truth. Development of the theory of ‘colour’ of the soul (according to Kubra) is called Tayawwun.103We shall examine the poetic and musical applications of this theory later in the book.Chapter 03.indd 38Chapter 03.indd 381/5/11 11:14 AM1/5/11 11:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"39SUFISM IN CENTRAL ASIAYassaviyaHodja Ahmad Yassavi (also spelled Khoja Ahmad Yassavi or Ahmed Yesevi) was born in Sayram (now in South Kazakhstan) and died in 1166 at Yasi, Turkestan (nowadays in South Kazakhstan). He was a Turkic poet and a Sufi, an early mystic who exerted a powerful influence on the development of mystical orders throughout the Turkic-speaking world.Very little is known about his life, but legends indicate that his father Ibrahim died when the boy was young, and his family moved to Yasi (today called Turkestan). There he became a disciple of Arslan Baba. After the death of the latter, Ahmed Yassavi moved to Bukhara and followed his studies with the Sufi Yusuf Hamadani (d. 1140). Later, he made the city of Yasi into the major centre of learning for the Kazakh steppes, and then at the age of 63 retired to a life of contemplation. He dug himself an under-ground cell where he spent the rest of his life.A mausoleum was later built on the site of his grave by Timur the Great. The Yassaviya Tariqah, which he founded continued to be influen-tial for several centuries afterwards, with the Yassavi Sayyid Ata Sheikhs holding prominent positions at the court of Bukhara into the nineteenth century. There are ten Adabs or rules of behaviour in Yassaviya: 1) Nobody should be respected more than the murid’s Master. 2) The murid or seeker should be clever enough to understand the hints and symbols of his Master. 3) The murid should accept whatever his Master says or does without challenge. 4) The murid should seek Riza (acceptance) of the Master. 5) Be honest and faithful, do not give way to doubt. 6) Be ultimately loyal to the Master. 7) Be ready to give up everything for the sake of the Master. 8) Keep the secrets of the Master and don’t reveal them. 9) Follow what is advised by the Master.10) The murid should be ready to give his life for the sake of the Master and for the union with Allah.104There are main eight Maqams or stations on the way to perfection according to this Sufi order:Chapter 03.indd 39Chapter 03.indd 391/5/11 11:14 AM1/5/11 11:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"40FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISM1) Maqam of Tawba or repentant people, whose Master is Prophet Adam.2) Maqam of Ilm or knowledgeable people, whose Master is Prophet Hidhr (Iliya).3) Maqam of Zuhd or people of temperance, with Master Prophet Isa (Jesus).4) Maqam of Sabr or patient people, with Master Prophet Ayyub (Jove).5) Maqam of Riza or people of acceptance, with Master Prophet Musa, (Moses).6) Maqam of Shukr or people of thankfulness, with Master Prophet Nuh (Noah).7) Maqam of Mahabba or people of love, with Master Prophet Ibrohim (Abraham).8) Maqam of Urfan or enlightened people, with their Master Prophet Muhammad.105QadiriyyaThe Qadiriyya order, widespread in Egypt, Turkey, and India, has a strongly instituted system of Zikr, wird, hidhb, which are in use among different communities. Qadiriyya uses Zikr, prayers, liturgies, and differ-ent invocations. Its founder ‘Abd al-Qadir was regarded as the founder of a system involving rites and practices, or as a worker of miracles. He eventu-ally became the most popular saint in Islam. Women in the Khlot and Tlik practise the cult of ‘Abd al-Qadir most ardently. They come to the khalwa or a place for meditation for all sorts of reasons, to satisfy their loves and hates in all the acts of their existence’.106 Their ceremonies always terminate with the words, ‘Thus spoke Mawlây ‘Abd al-Qadir’ or ‘O Mawlây ‘Abd al-Qadir’ – the same is found in Central Asia.According to the description of Muhammad ‘Alî al-Sanusî (1785–1859) in his Manhal al-rawi al-ra’iq, the Zikr of the Qadiri takes place with par-ticipants sitting in a circle. It should be accompanied at the start by the prayer Jalâ Allâh wa ‘azamâtihi (the glory of God and His majesty). During this prayer, the breath is suppressed and purified, one sits cross-legged then one speaks the name of God, prolonging it for a time, and extending it with an emphatic pronunciation (tafkhîm) until the breath is cut off, making Chapter 03.indd 40Chapter 03.indd 401/5/11 11:14 AM1/5/11 11:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"41SUFISM IN CENTRAL ASIAthe words ‘Azamât al-Haqq (the majesty of the true) while exhaling the breath. One continues in that way until the heart is relaxed and the Divine Light is revealed. Then one continues with the Zikr of absorption (fanâ’ ) and remaining (baqâ’ ) in God, ascribed to Sheikh Sîdî ‘Abd al-Qâdir. That consists of sitting as described, turning the face towards the right shoulder and saying Ha, turning the face toward to the left, saying Hû, then lower-ing the head and expending the breath while saying Hayy, repeating this without stopping. I have witnessed the same ritual in the Ferghana Valley in Uzbekistan.It is well known that Qadiriyya Zikr in different parts of the world has different rules. So, Shia Sufi orders in Pakistan used to have their own musical performance, ta‘ziyya, with wide use of musical instruments and a well-developed process of Zikr performance. But in Central Asia today one can find only the shadow of previous Qadiri rituals, which are expressed in the rare rites of retired participants.12. ZIKR IN THE FERGHANA VALLEY: MALE SOCIETYThe traces of Qadiri Sufi Zikr in Ferghana Valley are found today in the Namanghan area. In 1992, I was interviewing Hodji Hofiz Niazov (Niazy) (born 1912) who is reputed to be one of the last local Sufi Sheikhs. His Qadiri branch has diminished now and most participants are old men. At that time, they used sometimes to perform Zikr inside the local mosque, named Hamid-Han Qory, near the Zarkent market. As Hodji Hofiz Niazov said, the leader of the entire branch of the Qadiriyya Sufi order of Ferghana Valley, Muhiddin Qory, lived at that time in Andijan. His posi-tion as the head of Tariqati-Qadyri (Tarîqat-i Qadirî) is supposed to have been acquired by right of succession. Hodji Hofiz Niazy himself provides the Zikrs in one of the nearby villages on the outskirts of Namanghan. He recalled that at the beginning of the twentieth century there were about a hundred silsilah of the Qadiriyya order in the whole neighbourhood. A thousand people met together for Zikrs on the bank of the river Syr Darya, singing, whirling, and spinning round under the open night sky. Large clouds of dust would billow up to the sky. Now there are only shad-ows alternating with the echo of the rich incantation, and a small group of old members remaining.Both places – inside or outside the mosque – were acceptable for performing the Qadiri Zikr in this area. But after the Soviets came to Chapter 03.indd 41Chapter 03.indd 411/5/11 11:14 AM1/5/11 11:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"42FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMthese lands it was prohibited. Ironically, by allowing a place for social meetings, a local culture club, the Soviets provided for Zikrs in the heart of the community. Being a place of little importance to the main popu-lation of local dwellers it was safe to provide the Zikrs there hidden from public view.Usually they started the Zikr in the evening after night prayer (khufta), about 9–10 o’clock. They sat in a circle in the main room of the club and for a long time repeated sentences of Shahada: lo ilaha illalloh. After a number of repetitions it slowly became shortened to the main word Allâh. The leader of the meeting (Hodji Hofiz Niyazov) started to repeat it with the rest of the people, as a soloist, and in dialogue with a chorus. It became faster and faster and finally alternated with other words: Huw-Wa (name of God), even singing by chorus. The Sheikh rose up and started to move round in the circle waving white scarves/kerchiefs. All the participants fol-lowed him, continuing to shout Huw-Wa.A hundred repetitions of Huw-Wa are necessary to reach the end of this stage. Qadirî Zikr should include exactly 13 stages devoted to the Prophet and then to the masters of Sufi orders. Each step gradually increases in emo-tional intensity, towards the culmination. After all these stages comes the proper climax. Qadiriyya provides the sort of loud Zikr (jahrî), when each member should sing and shout the names of God (Huw-Wa, Allâh, Hayy) to achieve transcendence. So, forms of Zikr are still provided, taking place in deep secret in male society. Although this was not Zikr in its entirety, even the shortened form is proof that Sufi practice continues its difficult life in Central Asia.107Chapter 03.indd 42Chapter 03.indd 421/5/11 11:14 AM1/5/11 11:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"434Female Sufism13. HISTORICAL OVERVIEWFrom the earliest days, women have played an important role in the development of Islam and Sufism. We have already mentioned above the name of one, who is considered to be one of the founders of Sufism – Rabi’ah al-Adaviyah. She was born between 95 and 99 Hijai (713–18) in Basra, Iraq. Much of her early life is recorded by Khawaja Farid ad-din Attar. She is reported to have been born free in a poor but respected family, and was the fourth daughter of the family and therefore named Rabi’ah (Arabic – fourth). When famine struck, she was kidnapped and sold as slave. However, when she grew up, her master discovered her piety and freed her out of fear for God. She was the one who first to set out the doc-trine of mystical love and is widely considered to be the most important of the early Sufi poets.O, Lord, stars are shining, people close their eyes, kings close their gates. . .Everyone in love is alone with his beloved, and now I am with You.O, Lord, if I love You for the fear of Hell, rescue me there.If I love You for the hope of reaching Paradise, expel me from it.If I serve You for the sake of Yourself, don’t hide Your perfection from me.Much of the poetry attributed to her is, in fact, of unknown origin. She described her attitude towards God as divine love (Mahabba). ‘The aim of her love is reunion with the Lord, association and unification with God.’108In love, nothing exists between breast and Breast.Speech is born out of longing,True description from the real taste.The one who tastes, knows;The one who explains, lies.How can you describe the true form of SomethingIn whose presence you are blotted out?Chapter 04.indd 43Chapter 04.indd 4312/27/10 7:30:02 PM12/27/10 7:30:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"44FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMAnd in whose being you still exist?And who lives as a sign for your journey?109Rabi’ah was the first person to speak of the realities of Sufism in a language that anyone could understand. Though she experienced many difficulties in her early years, her starting point was neither fear of hell nor a desire for paradise, but only love. ‘God is God,’ she said. ‘For this I love God . . . not because of any gifts, but for Itself.’ Her aim was to melt her being into God. According to her, one could find God by turning within oneself. As Muhammad said, ‘He who knows himself knows his Lord.’ Ultimately, it is through love that we are brought into the unity of Being.110One of the many myths that surround around her life is that she was freed from slavery because her master, seeing her surrounded by light while praying, realised that she was a saint and he feared for his life if he contin-ued to keep her as a slave. While she apparently received many marriage offers she remained celibate and died of old age, an ascetic, her only care from the disciples who followed her. She was the first in a long line of female Sufi mystics. One day, she was seen running through the streets of Basra carrying a torch in one hand and a bucket of water in the other. When asked what she was doing, she said, ‘I want to put out the fires of Hell, and burn down the rewards of Paradise. They block the way to God. I do not want to worship from fear of punishment or for the promise of reward, but simply for the love of God.’Ibn Arabi, the great ‘Pole of Knowledge’ (1165–1240 AD), tells of the time he spent with two elderly women mystics who had a profound influence on him: Shams of Marchena, one of the ‘sighing ones’, and Fatimah of Cordova. Of Fatimah, with whom he spent a great deal of time, he says, ‘I served as a disciple of one of the lovers of God, a Gnostic, a lady of Seville called Fatimah bint Ibn al-Muthanna of Cordova.I served her for several years, she being over ninety-five years of age. . . . She used to play on the tambourine and show great pleasure in it. When I spoke to her about it she answered, “I take joy in Him Who has turned to me and made me one of His Friends (Saints), using me for His own purposes. Who am I that He should choose me among mankind? He is jealous of me for, whenever I turn to something other than Him in heed-lessness, He sends me some affliction concerning that thing.”. . . . With my own hands I built for her a hut of reeds as tall as she was, in which she lived until she died. She used to say to me, ‘I am your spiritual mother and the light of your earthly mother.’ When my mother came to visit her, Chapter 04.indd 44Chapter 04.indd 4412/27/10 7:30:02 PM12/27/10 7:30:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"45FEMALE SUFISMFatimah said to her, “O light, this is my son and he is your father, so treat him filially and dislike him not.”’111The wife of the ninth-century Sufi Al-Hakim at-Tirmidhi from Termez (now in Uzbekistan) was a mystic in her own right. She used to dream for her husband as well as for herself. Khidr, the mysterious one, would appear to her in her dreams. One night he told her to tell her husband to guard the purity of his house. Concerned that perhaps Khidr was referring to the occasional lack of cleanliness because of their young children, she ques-tioned him in her dream. He responded by pointing to his tongue: she was to tell her husband to be mindful of the purity of his speech.112Aisha of Damascus was one of the well-known mystics of the fifteenth century. She wrote a commentary of Khwaja ‘Abdo’llah Ansari’s Stations on the Way (Manazel as-sa’erin) entitled ‘Veiled Hints within the Stations of the Saints’ (Al-esharat al-khafiys fi’l-manazel al-auliya). Bibi Hayati Kermani belonged to a family immersed in the Sufi tradition. Her brother was a sheikh of the Nimatullahi order, and she became the wife of the master of the order. After her marriage, she composed a divan (collection of poems) that revealed her integration of both the outer and the inner knowledge of Sufism.113A discussion of the female Sufism would not be complete without citing Professor Annemarie Schimmel, an expert in Muslim culture, in Mystical Dimensions of Islam she notes that ‘Sufism, more than stern orthodoxy, offered women a certain amount of possibilities to participate actively in the religious and social life . . . . A number of Sufi orders had women attached to them as lay members.’114 Moreover she names women known historically to have been attached to Sufi orders. Among them are ‘Shah Jihan’s eldest daughter Jihanara who joined the Qadiriyya and was highly praised by her master Mulla Shah’ and ‘Bibi Jamal Khatun (d. 1639) who was one of the outstanding saints of the Qadiryya order during its formative period in the Punjab.’115 As another scholar pointed out: ‘One may assume that even in our day women are usually more concerned with ritual prayer and fasting than the average man in a Turkish or Pakistani household.’116Among the Bektashis, an order in which women have always been inte-grated with men in ceremonies, many women have continued the tradition of composing sacred songs (illahis). In 1987, a songbook entitled Gul Deste (A Bouquet of Roses) was published in Turkey. It brings together sacred hymns written by women and men of the Bektashi tradition from the nineteenth century to the present.117Mawlevi sheikhs have often guided both women and men. Rumi had many female disciples, and women were also encouraged to participate in Chapter 04.indd 45Chapter 04.indd 4512/27/10 7:30:02 PM12/27/10 7:30:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"46FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMsama’, the musical whirling ceremony of the Mawlevis. (Women usually had their own sama’s, though they sometimes performed together with men.) One of Rumi’s chief disciples was Fakhr an-Nisa, known as ‘the Rabi’a of her age’. One day, seven centuries after her death, it was decided to reconstruct her tomb. Shaikh Suleyman Hayati Dede, who was then the acting spiritual head of the Mawlevi Order, was asked to be present when she was exhumed. He later described that, when her body was uncovered, it was totally intact and the fragrance of roses filled the air.118There is historical evidence of women participating in the development of Sufism in Central Asia too. Investigation of many ancient cemeteries and tomb complexes in Central Asia shows that women had a great influ-ence. For instance, in the Sverdlov district of Bukhara is found the grave of Mastura Khanim, or Agha-yi Buzurg. She was a famous murshid or pupil of the Naqshbandî order who died on 30 July 1523. Agha-yi Buzurg had acquired her status as a murshid from Shaykh Shâd-i Giyati and his wife. She was brought up in the spirit of murshid by her grandfather and father. Among her disciples were both men and women.119 Another leading female Sufi was a well-known head of the Kubraviyya called Bibi Khadicha, who lived near Khiva in the fourteenth century. Her grave is situated in Agahi village in the Khiva district. She had dealings only with women, whom she recruited into her order as teenagers, and with whom she shared her secrets. Another female Sufi, Bibi Zumrat, was known in the surroundings of Bukhara. Nowadays, the local old women come to her tomb to pay trib-ute and say their nightly prayers. It is also well known, for instance, that the Yassaviya Sufi order involved women participating in Zikr.120Female rituals of the Qadiriyya Sufi order had a place in Tashkent at the beginning of the twentieth century. According to A.L. Troitskaya, Ishan-bu (the wife of the local Ishan, who is a descendant of the Prophet), together with her best female religious assistants, Halfa and Otin, wore the traditional white scarves and performed the Jahryia (open) version of Qadiriyya Zikr.121 Each Zikr had a certain structure starting with Qur’an Sura number 1;122 Salavat for the Ghavsuli Agzam.123 The proper Zikr was based on Chor Zarb, which is ‘La ilaha il Allah’.124 The women danced in a circle, which preceded the third part of the Zikr with Sura 112. The poetry of Sufi poets Mashrab and Ahmad Yassavy would usually be recited.125It was mentioned by Troitskaya that Ishan-bu, heading the Zikr, was of Naqshbandi Sufi origin though she performed the Zikr of the Qadiriyya Sufi order. According to Troitskaya, Halfa and Otin were highly privileged religious women who served the Zikr by helping Ishan-bu.

Zikr also marked a celebration of the birth-day of Muhammad, Mavlyud, usually performed four months after the Ashir-Oy. But Zikr could be performed just for its own sake, the author concluded.126We conclude our historic overview of female Sufism with a quote from Shemeem Burney Abbas, the author of The Female Voice in Sufi Ritual, who defines the main areas of female participation in Sufism and its rituals on the basis of her research in the Indian subcontinent:Women as mystics in Sufi practices.• Women as creators of Sufi poetry.• Women who have influenced male Sufis in their roles as mothers, • daughters, nurses, and mentors.Women as ethnographers and patrons of male Sufi mystics, such as • the Mughal princess Jahan Ara, daughter of Shah Jehan.Women as singers/musicians/participants of Sufi songs, sometimes • even called the faqiriani in the Sindhi shrines.Women as preservers and guardians of Sufi discourse or lore, such as • Mai Naimat, a maidservant of Shah Abdul Latif, from whose memory his entire Risalo is said to have been reconstructed.Active female participants at the shrines (• hijras). They have been iden-tified as khawajasara in earlier shrine traditions during the rule of the Muslim kings in India.The aesthetics of the female voice, a poetic device in which the speaker • is the female, even in the narratives of male musicians.

SUFI POETRY IN CENTRAL ASIA: GHAZAL AND FEMALE POETSGhazalBefore we consider the issue of female Sufi poetry in Central Asia, it is necessary to define what Sufi poetry is.128 The dominant form of Sufi poetry in Central Asia is ghazal.So what is ghazal as a poetic form? There are many definitions, the first of which, by Shamsiddin Qays, dates from the beginning of the twelfth century: ‘Ghazal in its initial meaning is affection towards women, and also friendship with them. . .’ The Encyclopedia of Islam defines ghazal as ‘a song, the elegy of love, frequently also an erotic-elegiac genre, the song of man to woman’.129 At the same time, the history of this poetic genre, begin-ning in the ninth century with Arabic poetry, developing and blooming on Persian soil (Attar, Saadi, Hafez)130 and coming to marvellous fruition in the Turkic medieval literature (Nasimi, Navoiy, Fuzuli, Babur), testi-fies not only to the widest area of its propagation, but also the universal poetics of the genre, which in the process of this development outgrew the boundaries of its origin. If we summarise theoretical studies of ghazal as a poetic genre, its formal elements, standardised from the times of Saadi and Hafez, are namely: writing ghazal by bayts (two verses, meaning in Arabic ‘a house’), rhyming bayts according to the formula A-A, B-A, C-A, and so on, the use of Radif (monorhyme), and also Takhallus (reference to the name of the author, usually in the last bayt).Semantically, ghazal is a purely lyric, plotless form, which character-ises, first of all, an internal state, but not external action; therefore, it is to a greater degree a statement about a state rather than a process. The semantics of ghazal are characterised by the presence of two semantic poles: the ‘I’ of the lyric hero and the ‘you’ or ‘he/she’ of his beloved, which are mutually impenetrable. Usually, between these two poles there is a space of separation, a break, unattainability, and so on. This sepa-ration creates the poetic, emotional stress of the ghazal. Furthermore, there are other relationships in the ghazal: ‘I’ – ‘rival’, ‘I’ – ‘supporters’ (e.g. sheikh, wine-waiter, doctor). To be more schematic, it is possible to reduce the functional structure of ghazal to the following universal Chapter 04.indd 48Chapter 04.indd 4812/27/10 7:30:02 PM12/27/10 7:30:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"49FEMALE SUFISM structure: ‘I’ – the subject of a statement; ‘you/he/she’ – the object of the statement; the statement (a field between ‘I’ and ‘you/he/she’); supportive forces (doctor, wine-waiter, wind); and obstructive forces (rival, enemy, etc.).131   Supporters (sheikh, wine-waiter, doctor) I  separation  you/he/she(lyric hero, author) (beloved woman, God)  Obstruction (rival, enemy, wind, unbeliever)Of course, this universality was not assigned in advance, but rather revealed in the process of the development of the ghazal. Sufism played an enormous role in the universalisation of ghazal. The world of ghazal, in many respects, correlates with the world of ideas of the great Sufi theorists Ibn-Arabi and al-Ghazali,132 and also of the most important representatives of Sufism in Central Asia: Nadjm ad-din Kubra, Ahmad Yassavi, and Baha ad-din Naqshbandi, all of whom wrote famous ghazals themselves.For instance, the dichotomy is one of the basic principles of al-Ghazali’s philosophy. In Ihya ulum-ad-din (Revival of Religious Sciences) it is mani-fested at several levels: linguistic (zakhir-batin (external-inner), makhv-isbat (hidden-proved), sabr-shukur (patience-gratitude), etc.), conceptual (action-state, reason-intuition, etc.), categorical, and so on. An important role in his philosophy is played by the three-part construction, which expresses, as a rule, the antinomy of two theses, which are resolved in the third. Accordingly, there is a triad of the functional parts of Sufi Makam (stations): knowledge – action – state. The same isomorphic structure pierces the entire world of al-Ghazali at the levels of text, consciousness, soul of man, structure of knowledge, man of universe.In the Arabic language ghazal was perceived as just the amorous, erotic form of versification, but because there is grammatical gender in neither the Persian nor Turkic languages, there is in the ghazal poetry of both an ambivalence, with the possibility of turning your ghazal statement to refer both to the beloved and to God. Hence, there is a possibility of dual inter-pretation of the content of the ghazal and an interchangeability between ishqi majoziy (symbolical love) and ishqi mutlaq (absolute love).133To see how ishqi mutlaq (absolute love of Sufism) is interchangeable with ishqi majoziy (symbolic love) of amorous poetry let us analyse the Chapter 04.indd 49Chapter 04.indd 4912/27/10 7:30:02 PM12/27/10 7:30:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"50FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMmost famous ghazal of Uzbek classic poetry, which comes from Alisher Navoiy, and which is called Munojat (Appeal to God) by the people:Kecha kelgumdur debon ul sarvi gulru’ kelmadi,Ko’zlarimga kecha tong otquncha uyqu kelmadi.Lahza-lahza chiqtimu, chektim yo’lida intizor,Keldi jon og’zimg’au ul sho’xi badxu kelmadi.Orazidek oydin erkonda gar etti ehtiyot,Ro’zgorimdek ham o’lgonda qorong’u kelmadi.Ul parivash hajridinkim yig’ladim devonavor,Kimsa bormukim anga ko’rganda kulgu kelmadi.Ko’zlaringdin necha suv kelgay deb o’lturmang meniKim bori qon erdi kelgan bu kecha suv kelmadi.Tolibi sodiq topilmas, yo’qsakim qo’ydi qadamYo’lgakim avval qadam ma’shuqqa o’tru kelmadi.Ey, Navoiy, boda birla xurram et ko’nglung uyinNe uchunkim boda kelgan uyga qayg’u kelmadi.My beloved was to come tonightWith his face like a rose and his figure like that of a cypress-treeBut he did not.The whole night, sleep deserted my eyesFull of hope, I would take a few steps on the road towards himMy soul was taking flight,But this fickle betrayer didn’t come.Bereft of his angel-face, I wept and wept like a mad woman.Whoever saw me must have thought that I was a foolIs there is such a thing as a faithful suitor?If there is one, why does not every step lead him to his beloved?Navoiy, rejoice in the house of your heartFor sadness never floods a house where wine flows.First of all, we can see that the model of ghazal is present here almost com-pletely. Here is the semantic field of the lyric ‘I’, as well as the semantic field in which ‘she’ is located. There is an insurmountable field of separation, there are supporters like kimsa (someone) or tolibi sodiq (faithful pupil), to whom the lyric hero turns. The theme has two main components: the image of the amorous experiences of the lyric hero and the image of the beauties of the beloved, which are placed in contrast.As far as a plot is concerned, the first misra (half-verse) of the first bayt: Kecha kelgumdur debon ul sarvi gulru’ kelmadi (My beloved was to come Chapter 04.indd 50Chapter 04.indd 5012/27/10 7:30:03 PM12/27/10 7:30:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"51FEMALE SUFISMtonight/But he did not), exhausting the story, displaces everything else into the sphere of imaginary nature, into conditionality, possibility. In other words, the ghazal begins, paradoxically, from the exhaustion of its own plot.Let us examine how relations of time and space are constructed in this ghazal. As far as the position of the lyric hero is concerned, Navoiy does not place him firmly in any space, except suppositionally, transmitted through the time frame tong otquncha (till dawn). Navoiy constructs space subsequently in the following manner: chiqdimu . . . yo’lida, oidin erkonda, kimsa bormukim anga ko’rganda. In other words, everything occurs seem-ingly in free space. But then occurs the coagulation of space through ko’zlaringdan necha suv kelgay, a conditional step into the void, where there is no beloved: yo’qsa kim qo’ydi qadam, and finally, the last bayt locks and embraces all previous space coordinates by ko’ngul uyi – the ‘house of the heart’. From this space began the initial motion. In other words, the space, assigned as external and expanding phenomenon: road – moonlight – sep-aration, becomes the internal space of the soul, the space into which the beloved did not enter.On the other hand, the space of thought, of imagination, in which the lyric hero and his beloved coexist divided, is gradually personified through the universal kimsa (someone), whose existence is hypothetical, conditional and abstract. Then, this ‘someone’ obtains the status of the collocutor, tolibi sodiq, who also does not exist. But there is a poet in his own alienation, whose alienation is formally described by the takhallus, when he turns to himself: ‘Hey, Navoiy . . .’. In other words, in the nega-tive space of separation the alienated name of the poet remains and by this token the poet leaves for himself the possibility of another, extra- or meta-textual space.134A similar understanding of the role and value of takhallus in this ghazal makes it possible to assume that the intermediating forces (kimsa, tolibi sodiq) are the functions of the lyric ‘I’ of the poet in the sense ‘I’ – ‘not I’, ‘I’ – ‘single’, ‘I’ – ‘special’, ‘I’ – ‘universal’. Thus, it is possible to reveal the duality of the space, which is illustrated through natural details (road, moonlight, etc.), but ends up in the absolute space of the spirit. So the time of the ghazal is dual. The temporary or pseudo-temporary coordi-nates of time in the ghazal, which are consecutively linear, again and again return to the very beginning of the promised meeting, to the beginning of this kelmadi (didn’t come), which rushes about in time, first running forward, then returning to its beginning, which itself is an ending.135Chapter 04.indd 51Chapter 04.indd 5112/27/10 7:30:03 PM12/27/10 7:30:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"52FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMFurthermore, one could say that the opposition ‘I’ and ‘you’, the lyric hero and the beloved in this ghazal, are reflected in all levels. Thus, together with those mentioned, at the meta-linguistic poetic level, for example, the opposition of logic and meta-logic, represented from the very first line ul sarvi gulru’ kelmadi (that rose-faced cypress didn’t come). If we read this statement from the point of view of formal logic, then ul sarvi gulru’ cannot arrive anyway. A mechanical interpretation would explain thus: ‘Trees do not walk.’ And, from this point of view, the suggestion appears to be true. But with the meta-logic reading, when we deliberately allow the ‘untruth’ of this ul sarvi gulru’, we are shaken by its fraud with the same trustfulness: Kecha kelgumdur debon ul sarvi gulru’ kelmadi . . . .If we take the metro-rhythmic level, then the combination of two misra (half bayt) in one bayt with their rhyming according to the pattern: A-A, B-A, C-A, and so forth are the combination of the variable and constant, of deviations and standards, absence of rhyme in the first of misra of a bayt and mono-rhyme in the second. The alliteration of Radif kelmadi (didn’t come) is a combination of a constantly repetitive word with the variable environment. Each time this is the same kelmadi and each time it is differ-ent, revealing new facets. So whichever level or structural element of ghazal we take, all have this duality as a founding unifying principle, which cre-ates a certain cognitive structure that is hierarchic and extremely flexible, correlating with the fundamental basis of human thinking and spiritual activity.136No wonder that the main bulk of Sufi poetry, including the Sufi poetry of Central Asia, is written in the form of ghazal. Another factor which makes ghazal a universal form of Sufi art is the fact that it was, and is, sung. For instance, all the classic repertoire of traditional Uzbek and Tajik music is based on the ghazal form. Ghazal is also widely recited in Sufi communi-ties, both male and female. Historic documents witness poetic gatherings like Yassaviyhonlik (readings of Yassaviy), Bedilhoni (Bedilhonlik) (readings of Bedil137), and Mashrabhonlik (readings of Mashrab).138,139In the long history of Sufism, poetry, either recited or sung, was accepted as the best way to achieve spiritual ecstasy. The tenth-century scholar Al Farabi said that ‘the most perfect is a melody united with verse. This is what can move a man and change his morals.’140 From the beginning of the tenth century, the process of listening to poetry put to music, called Sama’, became a daily habit in the social life of the Sufi brotherhoods. Such innovation created discussion and critical protest among orthodox scholars, where music itself, as opposed to the reading of the Qur’an, was Chapter 04.indd 52Chapter 04.indd 5212/27/10 7:30:03 PM12/27/10 7:30:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"53FEMALE SUFISMquestioned. That discussion took widespread forms. The great Sufi and poet Al Ghazali (1059/1060–1111) in his principal work Ihya ulum ad-din, mentioned above, pointed out:Listening to the Qur’an occurs everywhere in our daily life. However, for social gatherings it is expected that singers are invited and music played, not the Qur’an.There are five reasons for this:1 The Qur’an does not have associations with terrestrial love;2 New songs and tunes could be sung and played but the Qur’an is always the same;3 The voice and the rhythm of music make the heart beat faster;4 The voice becomes stronger with the accompaniment of instruments;5 Music can adjust to the mood, but not the Qur’an.141So, the purpose of Sama’, which was based on the unity of poetry and music, was to create spiritual excitement, and this was supposed to come as a divine grace.Music with poetry readings was performed at meetings of dervishes, Shaikhs’ gatherings, Majlis in closed (Khanaka) and open places – each associated with a certain time and place. Love poetry with symbolic mean-ing was accepted for such purposes, often taking a simple form which originated from folk poetry, like Rubai. The demand for such poetry from the ninth century stimulated the flow of lyrics aiming to create particular emotional states: tolerance and obedience, terrestrial love, hope, and so on. Majlis, as the main form of social gathering, included conversation, dis-cussion, collective prayers and listening to music. Originating from urban culture, this form maintained links with the vital force and beauty, initially of folk poetry and later of Sufi ghazal.Central Asian Female poets: Zebunissa, Nodira-begim, Jahonotin Uvaysiy, and Anbar-otinWomen played a major role, not just in reciting and maintaining this poetry in Central Asia but also in creating it. Children of elite families were generally taught the basics of classic Central Asian poetry in Persian and Turkic languages by their grandmothers, reading their Bayazs (hand-written collection of favourite ghazals by different authors); and according to many memoirs, that way of transmitting initial knowledge of the poetry was quite common.Chapter 04.indd 53Chapter 04.indd 5312/27/10 7:30:03 PM12/27/10 7:30:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"54FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISM The first written collections of female Sufi poetry by Zebunissa came from the courts of great Mughals whose founder, Zaheriddin Muhammad Babur, was born in city of Andijan.Zebunissa was the eldest daughter of the last of the major Mughal rulers of India, Aurangzeb. Her mother, Aurangzeb’s first wife and a descendant of a Persian emperor, would have one other daughter and two sons before her own death in 1657. Zebunissa was born in the Deccan, where Aurangzeb acted as viceroy for his father, Shah Jahan. When she was in her early teens, her family returned to the north and lived first at Agra and then at the new capital in Delhi. As a member of the royal family, she studied not only Persian and Arabic, but also mathematics and astronomy, under the chief scholars of the realm.In 1658, when Zebunissa was 21 years old, Aurangzeb seized the throne from Shah Jahan. For some years, his eldest daughter would have consid-erable influence over the new emperor. Contemporary chroniclers noted that Aurangzeb asked her opinion on palace appointments and that he sometimes accepted her decisions even when he did not agree with them.Zebunissa never married, although some traditions give her an unwanted engagement and various love affairs. She had her own courts at Delhi and at Lahore to which scholars and poets came; at least some of her own poetry in Persian and in Arabic is from this period of her life. She estab-lished a library and had classical Arabic texts translated into Persian under her personal supervision.Aurangzeb was a strict Muslim and, once in power, became increas-ingly strict in his requirements for the observance of Islamic law. However, his eldest sister was a Sufi. Perhaps through the influence of her aunt, Zebunissa eventually also chose that path of devotion. The Sufis held only a marginal place in Mughal society, but were tolerated unless they allied themselves with Aurangzeb’s opponents.In 1681, when Zebunissa was 44 years old, the younger of her two full-brothers, Akbar, rebelled against his father and proclaimed himself emperor. The rebellion lasted only a month; Akbar fled the country but continued to be troublesome. Zebunissa had some communication with her exiled brother and was accused by Aurangzeb of being the rebel’s ally; for this she was imprisoned in a Delhi fortress and disappeared from the official record. We do not know how harsh her imprisonment was, nor if she remained in prison until her death in 1702.Some of her poetry, written under the pen-name Makhfi (the hid-den one) circulated among her contemporaries. Fifty years after her Chapter 04.indd 54Chapter 04.indd 5412/27/10 7:30:03 PM12/27/10 7:30:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"55FEMALE SUFISMdeath, over 400 poems were collected and published in Persian as the Diwan-i-Makhfi. Most of the poems are ghazals. The most famous of her poems is the poem with the Radif in jost (is here), which is sung as a famous Uzbeko-Tajik song Samarqand ushhog’i (Lovers of Samarqand):Come, a beauty with curly hairs and mascara eyes is here,The beauty who kills with a warm look is here.Her coquetry is a knife, her eyelashes are daggers, her sight is a diamond,If you need a martyrdom, the steppe of Kerbala is here.If paradise smiles to you, don’t be deceived,Don’t go outside of the wine-house, because the place is here.From feet to the head – wherever you look,The coquetry breaks the heart, the place is here.I searched the library of the world, turning page after page,I saw your letter and said, my wish is here.If you give a charity of beauty to God,Come here, a begging Zebunissa is here.Just as in the court of Delhi, Sufi poetry flourished at the court of Kokand in the Ferghana Valley, with the works of Nodira, Uvaysiy, and Anbar-otin.Nodira-begim (also known as Komila) was born in the family of Rahmonkulibiy, major of Andijan, in 1792. Her real name was Mohlaroyim. In 1808, she married Amir Umarkhan, who was then Mayor of Margilon; and went to Kokand together with Umarkhan, who had succeeded to the throne in place of his brother Olimkhan. After the tragic death of Umarkhan in 1822 she governed Kokand kingdom together with her son Madalihon. The madrasah, mosque and karavansarays were built at her instruction. She was a leader of the people of science and took care of poor people. She was killed by Amir Nasrulloh, khan of Bukhara in 1842.Nodira wrote poems under the pen-names of Komila and Maknuna, writing in both Persian and Uzbek. Her work consisting of 10,000 bayts is widely known.She used a wide range of genres such as a muhammas, ruboi, fard, but most of all ghazals. As a teacher she learnt Navoiy, Fuzuli, and Bedil.

Unfortunately, she was widowed quite early and went to live with Nodira in Kokand in Khan’s palace. She died in 1845 in Margilon, at the age of 65.Uvaysiy’s poems consist of 15,000 hemistiches. One of her Divans ( collection of ghazals) is kept at the Institute of Academy of Science of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Her ghazals, muhammas, musaddas, murabbas,144 and the poems Shahzoda Hasan and Voqeoti Muhammadalihon are included in that Divan. Her works and her Divans are very popular; and three copies of the her Divan were found in the 1960s.Information about Uvaysiy’s life and creative works can be found in her works and in some tazkiras and biographical books. Attention was given to the her creative work in Majmuatush-shoiron (1824), written by Fazli Namangoniy.Here is an example of Uvaysiy’s Sufi poetry:Today, o friends, I miss my beloved child,It’s not my fault if I’m a beggar,I miss my king of times.I am a stranger, a foreigner, lonely and silent,My body is full of suffering,I miss my remedy.Memory of my tongue, thought of my heart, my good child,Sultan of my state,I miss you, my dear, my only one.Night and day I wait for him, staring at the roadWhere he comes and asks how I am,I miss my visitor.God did not cast his lot if he finds no way out,I miss my future, red blood of my liver,Who says: My mother . . .The world has darkened in my eyes through this separation,I miss my shining moon,Chapter 04.indd 57Chapter 04.indd 5712/27/10 7:30:03 PM12/27/10 7:30:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"58FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMThe light of my eyes and of my heart.I cry endlessly alone by day and night, Uvaysiy,I miss the beauty of my home,The light of my eyes, my khan . . .Another famous Uzbek Sufi female poet is Anbar-otin (1870–1915).145 As her name reveals, she probably was an Otin-Oy, a woman who had a religious upbringing. Anbar-otin was born in Kokand where she was taught to write poetry by Dilshod Barno, the author of Tarihi muhojiron (History of Muhajirun or Exiled). Anbar-otin was a lyric Sufi poet. In her ghazals pure love is glorified. She was a poet who wrote lyric poems about the soul and feelings of woman. She created a Divan with ghazals and other poetic forms. However, it is necessary to point out that Anbar-otin devel-oped social motives in her poetry and criticised very strongly the Sufis’ attitude to life and the Sufi orders Naqshbandiyya and Yassaviya.During Soviet times, the female Sufi poetry of Central Asia went under-ground, though a certain ambiguity makes some of the ghazals of female Uzbek and Tajik poets like Zulfia, Halima Hudoyberdieva, Gulchehra Jo’raeva, Qutlibeka, Halima Ahmedova, Gulruhsor Safieva perfect exam-ples of Sufi poetry.

The poetry of Tajik poet Farzona or Uzbek poets Zebo Muminova and Khosiyat Rustamova show how female Sufi poetry is now developing in Central Asia.This chapter has examined only the written, so-called ‘professional’ female Sufi poetry, but this does not in any way comprise the whole of female Sufi poetry.

This chapter examines a medieval document which reflects on the Ustad–Shogird process of training and rite of initiation. Ahloqul solihiyn (On Ustad [Master] and his conditions) was written in fifteenth-century Herat by Husayn Voiz Koshifiy.147 It explains many different issues related to Ustad–Shogird relationships, from its forms to its content. It is based on the Sufi way to perfection, of absorbing knowledge, and therefore includes certain ceremonial duties and obligations. The manuscript employs a particular terminology related to training systems within professional guilds: ‘on the road’ means during the process of training; ‘fasten the belt’ means initiating the relationship of Ustad–Shogird (master–apprentice); and ‘stations’ means stages in the process of professional and spiritual train-ing related to Sufi tradition. In fact, this treatise is a manual on the master–apprentice (Ustad–Shogird) relationship and its connection with Sufi tradition.The very first paragraphs of treatise emphasise the points that the Ustad–Shogid relationship lies in the very heart of any professional training.Know that no work is done without an Ustad, and every work done without an Ustad is in vain. There is a belief that even though a person might reach a certain degree and carry out a certain amount of work, if he had had no Ustad, or if his Ustad had not been a good one, his work would achieve nothing.Chapter 05.indd 60Chapter 05.indd 601/5/11 11:19 AM1/5/11 11:19 AM"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"61TRANSMISSION OF SACRED KNOWLEDGEIt is said that:Everyone without an Ustad works in vain, On the road to sense nobody is a better friend than an Ustad.Therefore everyone who wants to achieve something with his work first of all needs a perfect Ustad. It is obvious what an Ustad is for; without the lead of an Ustad no work goes well:Everyone who starts his work without an Ustad is doomed in that his work never will gain attention. Keep close to the sleeve of the Ustad and be happy. Serve him for a certain time and become an Ustad yourself.The person who fastens the belt of another person is called Ustad-the tuner, and Shogird (Apprentice), whose belt suppose to be fastened called Halaf.The paragraph below shows what kind of character is needed for an Ustad.‘If they ask what the preconditions of Ustad-the tuner are, say they are six:1) First, a perfect Ustad, who fastened his belt, should keep that belt beyond the hands of others (nobody should doubt his perfection) and he himself shouldn’t touch the belt of his children/apprentices (not be rude to his children as well as to his apprentices).2) Secondly, he must have all the features of a true man.3) Thirdly, he must know small details of Tariqat (Sufi Way) and the sub-tleties of Haqiqat (Sufi Truth), to pass on to his ‘child’ (apprentice). If they ask who is the perfect Ustad, say one who follows the pure way of religion, who knows his own sins, who is a wise and tasteful person, who is not jealous and revengeful and mean.4) Fourthly, Ustad, who fastens the belt, truly knows it, so the steps are taken in the right direction.5) Fifthly, the belt on the child/apprentice should be fastened publicly, in the presence of Sheikh, Naqib and brothers in the Way, but not in a hidden place.6) Sixthly, he must know the state of the child/apprentice, whether he is worthy of it.If an Ustad sees that his Shogird is not worthy, he would not fasten his belt on him, as it’s evil.’Chapter 05.indd 61Chapter 05.indd 611/5/11 11:19 AM1/5/11 11:19 AM"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"62FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMThe paragraphs below are concerned with the process of fastening the belt from the way and conditions of doing it to its consequences.‘If they ask how many stations of fastening the belt, say they are six.1) Firstly, the Ustad knows and describes parts of tuning and types of it.2) Secondly, he orders his apprentice to serve forty days and the latter should bear it.3) Thirdly, he prepares water and salt for the gathering.4) Fourthly, he uses a five-wick lamp.5) Fifthly, he fastens the belt conditionally.6) Sixthly, for this ritual he must cook khalva (sweet).If they ask how many conditions of fastening the belt there are,say – seven.1) to spread out the rug for the prayer;2) to put his left hand onto the head of Shogird;3) to hold him with his right hand;4) to prepare the belt;5) to take the belt with his left hand;6) to recite a relevant verse of the Qur’an;7) to fasten the belt and take it off in seven days.If they ask how many rituals there are in fastening the belt, say – ten.1) to remember Pirs/Masters, who have passed away,2) to introduce the Shogird to the community of Shogirds,3) to recite a prayer, holding his hand,4) to step away three steps from the prayer rug,5) to take the belt in his left hand,6) to recite a relevant verse of the Qur’an,7) to turn the Shogird’s face towards the way (i.e. tell him the truth),8) take some khalva,9) while taking Shogird’s hand to touch by index finger to his same finger,10) to explain the meaning of every step of the rituals.’One can see from the paragraphs above that the meaning of every single step is explained in great detail. For instance, Ustad puts his left hand on Shogird’s head because the left hand is closer to the heart. Or Ustad steps aside for three steps, because one step is meant to suppress the sinful soul, the second – Satan, and the third one – the desire for wealth. Unless he suppresses those, the Shogird cannot achieve his goal.Chapter 05.indd 62Chapter 05.indd 621/5/11 11:19 AM1/5/11 11:19 AM"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"63TRANSMISSION OF SACRED KNOWLEDGEThe next paragraph shows how the role of apprentice is related to religious and mystical study and based on an ascetic lifestyle.On the conditions of being a ShogirdIf they ask what is the basis of being a Shogird, say it is based on will.If they ask what is the will, say sama’/mystical listening and piety.If they ask what sama’ and piety are, say to listen with the ears of the heart to whatever the Ustad is saying and accept it with sincere heart, and to fulfill it with the help of all his members.If they ask what is good for a Shogird, say pure belief, because only faith brings people to their aim.If they ask how a Shogird achieves his aim, say through his service.If they ask what his service is based on, say on refusing pleasure and working hard.The next two paragraphs describe the rules for the apprentice, including his attitude to the study and behaviour.‘If they ask how many stations of Shogirdness there are, say – four.1) to start his venture bravely, because it is much worse to be scared of beginning, or to retreat;2) to serve sincerely;3) to coordinate his tongue with his heart, i.e. talk and act accordingly and truly;4) to listen to advise and remember what his Ustad is saying, and follow it.If they ask how many customs of Shogirdness there are, say – eight.1) whenever he sees his Ustad, to greet him first;2) not to talk much in front of his Ustad;3) to bow his head;4) not to look all around;5) if he wants to ask something, first ask his Ustad’s permission;6) when his Ustad answers, not to talk back while he is explaining;7) not to gossip in front of his Ustad;8) to be polite in all his behaviour’.The last paragraph describes how to tie the belt according to different orders:‘Alif ’ order is the order of ‘maddahs’ or ‘eulogists’ or musicians. ‘ Lam-alif ’ is the order of simple people. ‘Mim’ order is the order of philosophers, Chapter 05.indd 63Chapter 05.indd 631/5/11 11:19 AM1/5/11 11:19 AM"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"64FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISM‘Sayfiy of military people, Salmoniy’ of cleaners, Yusufiy of craft workers and artisans, etc.16. USTAD–SHOGIRD TRADITION TODAYIn discussions about the Ferghana Valley, its rural area and particularly the Andijan district, one should point out that a traditional lifestyle is observed in Uzbek households, within the family, and in the involvement of children in any family work (Photo 4).According to Deniz Kandiyoti, ‘Children, especially daughters from the age 10 and even younger, help mothers with domestic tasks, the care of younger siblings, the care of animals and at cotton harvest when agricul-tural season starts’.148 Children do, indeed, help with the cotton harvest, as in Uzbekistan cotton remains a quasi-state monopoly. But it is worth mentioning that the agricultural season in rural areas of Uzbekistan and in Photo 4: A girl-embroiderer from Ferghana Valley making traditional men’s hat (doppi )Chapter 05.indd 64Chapter 05.indd 641/5/11 11:19 AM1/5/11 11:19 AM"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"65TRANSMISSION OF SACRED KNOWLEDGEsome parts of Tajikistan is a non-stop process taking place almost all year round, except for winter. Children help their parents with many difficult tasks like, for example, rice growing, which requires many long hours spent bending or standing in the water, or tending to silk worms, which are known for their 24-hour non-stop feeding on mulberry leaves, and so on.So, children’s involvement in agricultural work and domestic tasks leads to the development of strong family relationships supported by traditional social networks.It is obvious that social structures and networks in Uzbekistan have been preserved from pre-Soviet times. Despite the Soviet regime, Uzbeks were allowed to carry on with previously established forms of social gath-ering, and therefore to maintain traditional social relationships (Photo 5). Notable among these relationships is Gap-gashtak, a social network where neighbourhood members – Mahallya – and friends assemble together. It can also be a gathering for special occasions such as a reunion for former classmates (Sinfdashlar), an assembly of teacher-colleagues (Uqutuvchilar), Ziyefat – friends’ meeting, Maraka – a meeting on the occasions of mourning, or remembrance days. Women’s Gap-gashtaks, based on eco-nomic, rather than spiritual, issues, sometimes take place on a regular basis among the female population.

The origin of the female Gap is clearly related to male gatherings, as formerly Gap was a ‘male activity consisting of a regular get-together, of about a dozen or so friends primar-ily for the purposes of entertainment and sociability’, but later this began to become a female activity involving also some ‘music and dancing’.149The most interesting fact for this study is that ‘Otin-Oys gatherings are considered to be among the most prestigious and far away from pure social or entertaining purposes’.150 These are the main focus of our atten-tion, revealing how local society preserved centuries-old traditional links in networking and entertaining.From our perspective, of great importance in such a process of preserva-tion is the presence of traditional Mehterlik, professional guilds based on the Ustad–Shogird training system.17. MEHTERLIK OR PROFESSIONAL GUILDSBefore providing examples of the forms of these activities, it would be helpful to offer some clarification on the concept of the Ustad–Shogird.The oral knowledge transmission, from master to apprentice, from teacher to pupil, from professional specialist to beginner, originated in Central Asia in early medieval times. Historically, there were a great many professional guilds in every single part of this area with its strong focus on traditional culture, and also around the courts and palaces, where knowl-edge transmission by the Ustad–Shogird method was considered to be the only way of teaching and learning. Musicians, artists, craft masters, or those who wished to be associ-ated with correct, high-quality performance were all involved in guilds (Mehterliks). Those guilds consisted of ‘clubs’ of merchants or craftspeople formed to give help and advice to their members and to devise regulations and set standards for particular trades. All guilds were independent, and an exchange of knowledge between them was forbidden and prosecuted by law.To belong to such a guild had deep spiritual meaning, and required total devotion, determination to follow the chosen life path and a life-time devoted to improving skills. To be a professional musician meant to be a member of certain Mehterlik (guild), and to receive training in the Ustad–Shogird (master–apprentice) style.Chapter 05.indd 66Chapter 05.indd 661/5/11 11:19 AM1/5/11 11:19 AM"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"67TRANSMISSION OF SACRED KNOWLEDGEIn fact, the whole process and methods of Mehterlik training were related to the Sufi brotherhood system, where every step was related to religious training: 1) the way people worshipped Sheikh/Pir – they had to admire their teachers;2) the whole process of knowledge transmission activity was surrounded by saints as protectors;3) the respect given by the youngest to the oldest when advice was recommended.Historically, each Mehterlik (guild) had a special Risola (book of guidance) for members to follow. This was document consisted of a programme of action adopted by a group of individuals, and at the same time, the set of principles on which it was based. One of these given below is ‘Risola-I Mehterlik’.151 At the end of the Risola is a date, 1327 year of Hijra (i.e. 1909) and the name of the person the Risola paper belonged to: Ustad-Mehter-Kurchi Niyas-Mehter-ogly.The Risola-I Mehterlik rules consist of:1) a prayer;2) a legend about the origin of professions and, related to them, Risola focused on the sacred roots of the named profession;3) questions and answers on the religious significance of profession/skills mentioned (farz, vadjib, sunnat, mystahab) and an account of sacred representatives of that occupation;4) questions and answers on spiritual mentors (Pir) from all stations of Sufism (Shariat, Tariqat, Hakikat), on the heads of four Muslim religious-law schools of Islam (Hanafiya, Hanbaliya, Maliliya, and Shafiiya), on ‘Pirs of consolation/reassurance’ (Mother, Father, Teacher, Master) and protectors of the present guild;5) (The Most important paragraph of the Risola)questions and answers on prayers and sacred statements, which one should repeat during different stages of performance of named skills;6) duties and restrictions for representatives of the above-named occupation;7) policy of the named profession; attitude to the Risola; awards and punishments for breaking rules or guidelines/policy of the Risola.Chapter 05.indd 67Chapter 05.indd 671/5/11 11:19 AM1/5/11 11:19 AM"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"68FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMThe most interesting for us is the second paragraph, which relates the legend of the sacred origin of music and, particularly, of singing:One should know that the occupation Mehterlik comes from the holy man Gavryiil, Peace Be Upon Him. The great Allah said that the soul should enter the shape/body (kylyb) of Adam, PBUH, but the soul was scared to do so. Then the great Allah ordered Mehter Gavryiil to bring a Bird from Paradise to perform her song. From the pleasure and sweetness of singing the soul went into Adam-Safiulla shape/body. That is why Mehterlik comes from Gavryiil, Peace Will Be Upon His Soul. When a human hears music (Nagma) his soul is calmed and his love and joy increase.So, here the divine origin of music is revealed as God’s action. Also, it is closely associated with the fact of God’s creation, mentioned in nearly every sacred book, and Adam became the first man to adopt music as a passion and a way of life. (Incidentally, Adam was also a Pir of butch-ers as well as musicians, because cow hide is used for making percussion instruments like Doira and Nagora.152 So the material used by the guild for musical instruments united different guilds and their Pirs.)Another strong guild association from those documents comes from Sufism and its relationship with Murid-Murshid or silsilah of oral knowl-edge transmission. The hierarchy of God–human, with the saints in between, was the framework for every Mehterlik, as confirmed by the example above.We can observe, then, that every kind of professional training in music was deeply based on the Ustad–Shogird system of knowledge transmission and all authentic forms of Uzbek music are still taught this way even today.18.HOFIZLIK: PROFESSIONAL TRAINING IN MUSICIn discussing Sufi music and Sufi singing one should not forget that its history began with male performers who were at the centre of public atten-tion. What is the Sufi traditional singing style? Who performed Uzbek Sufi songs in the twentieth century?Sufi traditional music in Central Asia was based on a professional style of singing or the Hofiz training system, combining aesthetic perfection with technical excellence and accomplishment. The skill was acquired with Ustad–Shogird (master–apprentice) guidance, which had both practical and spiritual aspects.153 Chapter 05.indd 68Chapter 05.indd 681/5/11 11:19 AM1/5/11 11:19 AM"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"69TRANSMISSION OF SACRED KNOWLEDGEThe term ‘Hofiz’ comes from Arabic, where hifa means a guard. Today, it has a wider meaning extending from the reader/narrator of Sura of Qur’an, documentary writer, writer or poet, epic singer baqshi/Hofiz, reader of classical poetry – Ghazal to simply a singer and musician.154In Hofizlik music training one can see traces of Sufi idea of perfection:Shariat is a corpus of Muslim law, Tariqat is a mystical Way, Haqiqat is Truth. Ishq is passion and love, Shogirdlik is Apprenticeship, Hofizlik is Mastership.The same resemblance comes from technical terms of performance whereSozlanish is tuning, Tayorlanish is preparation, Mukammallik is Perfection. Kirish is entering, Anglash is comprehension, Yettite bosqich o’tish – ascend-ing seven levels, Ijod faoliyat – creative action.Here are main features of Hofiz’s singing style: a) a beautiful, strong voice with a wide range; b) clear pronunciation; c) a capacity for structuring every single sentence of the songs, with the ability to extend them, add-ing well-developed decorations and ornamentations (Hang) ; d) the special long/chain-based breathing system illustrating the ability to perform not just one but two or even three melodic phrases on one breath; e) the abil-ity to perform different instrumental passages, melodic forms that imitate percussion sounds, and so on; freedom in ornamenting rhythm and metre; f ) skills in Awj (long, high culminations) performance; g) aptitude to build inner symmetrical structure with the use of Hang and Shah’d (the way of breaking the pulse or rhythm of the tune without affecting the whole song).155Uzbek culture in the twentieth century was privileged to have three of the most outstanding Hofizes from Ferghana Valley: Sadyrkhon Hofiz (1847–1931); Djurakhon Sultanov (1893–1968); and Rasul Qori Mamadaliev (1928–76). Each of them deserves a special mention. Sadyrkhon Hofiz’s Ustadslar/teachers were Rummon Said Buzrukhon–hoja, and Qori Sangin-domla, from whom the singer learned the Qiroat (Qur’an’s reciting style) with a focus on its poetry and content. Reciting the Qur’an requires the clear pronunciation of words and phrases, with melodically fixed and structurally well-developed delivery. He also played Tanbur.

He was not allowed to attend any entertainment events.156Hofiz Djurahon Sultanov was more popular in performing both classi-cal and folk Katta ashula genres related to outside (open air festivals) music celebrations. He was trained by Boltaboy Hofiz Rajabov (1867–1960) and Mamatbobo Sattarov (1885–1967). He was named a Pir of Katta ashula’s singers (katta a ashullachilarning piri). His interest in folk genres (Kushik, Yalla) has enhanced and enriched his style in Maqam performance (Evvoi Chorgoh, Dugoh Husainyi, Savti Suvora, Sadyrkhon Usshogi).157The blind musician Hofiz Rasul-Qori’s childhood training mostly con-centrated on recitation of the Qur’an. Because of his amazing voice, he was named the Daud’s voice representative (Daudi ovoz sohibi ), the night-ingale. His achievements in singing included: a) ornamented decorations; Hudo (poetry Salohyi), Ghazalhonlik, (poetry Chishtyi), Mehmonsan (poetry Huvaido); b) scale and mode arrangement within the ascending ladder of structure; c) instrumental improvisation, including imitation of percussion sounds; d) incorporation of the new style ‘Ist’ : – when, within the same melodic structure, the tempo slows down to reflect dramatic/dynamic/emotional expressiveness . . . as in Katta ashula or Suvora.158It is clear that Hofizlik methods required a serious training, which cov-ered style of performance, musical structure, frame, and ornamentations including a fine ability for improvisation. Very often, Hofiz performed his own compositions, and developed a distinctive and personal interpretation of the song.

SUFI MASTERS IN MUSIC‘Music is called Ghiza-i-ruh (the food of the soul) by Sufis. Music, being the most divine art, elevates the soul to the higher spirit; music itself being unseen soon reaches the unseen; just as only the diamond can break the diamond, so musical vibrations are used to make the physical and mental vibrations inactive, in order that the Sufi may be elevated to the spiritual spheres,’ wrote Sufi Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan in his book A Sufi Message of Spiritual Liberty.159Chapter 4 quoted the views of Al-Ghazali, as to why music affects Sufis more strongly than reciting the Qur’an, and how it is used for their zikrs. But not all theologians in Islam hold the same views. The practice of music and dance in Sufism is, in fact, rather contentious. It is by no means universally accepted by all Sufis, and some orders frown upon it. Others may rejoice in the recitation of mystical poetry, accompanied by musical instruments and performed as part of their prayers and devotions. Some Sufis consider such music conducive to ‘mystical ecstasy’. These Sufis maintain that music can arouse passion, either sensual or spiritual. It is spiritual passion (longing for God) that is the Sufi’s goal. Hence, musi-cal concerts are a regular feature of some Sufi orders, like Mawlaviyya, Chishtiyya, or Kubraviyya.Music has always been the favourite Sufi means of spiritual develop-ment for those orders. Rumi, the author of the Masnavi, introduced music into his Mawlaviyya order, and enjoyed the memory of his blessed mur-shid ’s association while listening to it. Since that time, music has become the second subject of Sufi practices. They declare that it creates harmony in both worlds and brings eternal peace.The great mystic of India, Khwaja Moin-ad-Din Chishti, introduced music into his Chishtiyya order. Even today, musical entertainments for the elevation of the soul, called Sama’, are held among Sufis.160Chapter 06.indd 71Chapter 06.indd 7112/27/10 7:34:47 PM12/27/10 7:34:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"72FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMSufi music is about union with the Beloved, with God. Music is the vehicle to reach the heart and attain a state of grace or enlightenment, a ‘stateless state’ or Ma’rifat – inner knowledge. Music is an essential part of spiritual life and practice for many Sufis. In that sense, Sufism is not simply about theories or the intellect; the goal is the experience of union with the One. So, Sufi teachers lead their murids towards the One through practical experience in ritual, movement, voice, and music.Sama’ (which means listening in Arabic) is the key concept, which defines usage of both poetry and music among Sufis. The greatest Islamic theologian and Sufi Master Imam Al-Ghazali, in his fundamental work Ihya ulum ad-din (Revival of religious sciences) – considered to be the encyclopaedia of Islam and Sufism – devotes two separate chapters to the nature of Sama’ and practice of poetry and music in it. In his conclu-sion he says: ‘Sama’ could be sometimes haram (disallowed by religion), sometimes mubah (admissible), sometimes makruh (undesirable), some-times mustahab (beneficial). For those who are enslaved by their worldly lust, and for most youngsters, it is disallowed, because Sama’ confuses their souls full of beastly lust. Sama’ is undesirable for those who are routinely using it just for the sake of fun but not turning themselves into beasts. It is admissible for those who are enjoying just the beauty of the sound. Sama’ is beneficial for those who are woken up to the love to Allah and to good deeds because of it.’161Imam Al-Ghazali sets out five principles of Sama’ reflecting on issues of Time, Place and People, Zikr, concentration on Sama’, participants’ behaviour and involvement. He points out that Sama’ has three relevant prerequisites: Time, Place and People. As to Time, Sama’ is useless while eating, fighting, praying or when the heart is not quiet and calm. As to Place, Sama’ is not arranged in the random street, or in a disgusting envi-ronment, where the heart is distracted. As to People, they should not be hypocrites – those for whom Sama’ is disallowed or undesirable. Also, Imam Al-Ghazali argues, the mental state of people at the gathering should be considered. Some people could be happier with Zikr, or helping poor people, but having no union with God in Sama’. As Imam Al-Ghazali sug-gested, participants should not be distracted by what is happening in the gathering, but should concentrate fully on Sama’ and should not simply pretend to achieve ecstasy. They should not jump, dance or cry unless they cannot control the impulse, indicated Imam Al-Ghazali. But at the same time, ‘if someone naturally comes to ecstasy and starts to dance, others should follow him.’162Chapter 06.indd 72Chapter 06.indd 7212/27/10 7:34:47 PM12/27/10 7:34:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"73MUSIC AND FEMALE SUFISImam Al-Ghazali quotes the views of many famous Sufis regarding Sama’. Zunnun al-Misri said: ‘Sama’ comes from God and turns the heart straight to Him.’ Abu-l-Huseyn ad-Dirac said: ‘Sama’ made me dance, gave me the knowledge of Allah as a gift, made me drink from the purest cups and I was elevated to the Gardens of the Heaven.’ Shibli said: ‘The external side of Sama’ is a rebellion, but the inner side is an example. Those who are aware of meaning are allowed to follow the example. Those who are unaware of them might drown in rebellion and end up in confusion.’ He also said: ‘Those who are listening to music in a natural way share the tenderness of music and nature, connect the purity of the mystery in the heart with the purity of music and Sama’.’163Talking about listening and the comprehension of music, Imam Al-Ghazali defines four states (hal), which end with a wonderful symbol of Sufism:1) the state when one enjoys music just as a matter of nature: he/she is not different in that sense to any living organism;2) the state when one enjoys music in a comprehensive manner: this is the state of youngsters and lustful people;3) the state when one separates what he listens from his relation with Allah: this is the state of inexperienced murids (Sufi apprentices);4) the state of those who are absorbed by Allah: these people are like those Egyptian women, who cut their fingers and didn’t feel the pain, while looking at the beauty of Joseph. ‘They are true Sufis,’ states Imam Al-Ghazali, crediting those women in his main religious and Sufi work.164Hazrat Inoyat-khan mentions five aspects of music in the Sufi perspec-tive. He says: ‘Music consists of vibrations which have evolved from the top to the bottom, and if they would only be systematically used, they could be evolved from the bottom to the top. Real music is known only to the most gifted ones. Music has five aspects:1) Ta r a b – music which induces motion of the body (artistic);2) Raga – music which appeals to the intellect (gnostic);3) Qul – music which creates feelings (emotional);4) Nida – music heard in vision (inspirational);5) Sawt – music in the abstract (celestial).’165Chapter 06.indd 73Chapter 06.indd 7312/27/10 7:34:47 PM12/27/10 7:34:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"74FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMKeeping these views of the Sufi masters in mind, we now look at the Sufi music of Central Asia.20. SUFI MUSIC IN CENTRAL ASIA: FROM COURT TO FOLK TRADITIONSThe existence of a cultural division between the nomads and the settled people of Central Asia is reflected in the kind of music they each perform. Historically, the urban population of the cities is made up of Tajiks and Uzbeks and their music is based on the urban classical, or professional, music tradition called Maqam. The very word Maqam, which means in Arabic ‘a station, a degree’, is the key word for Sufism, defining the stage of proximity of a Sufi to God. Therefore, the whole Maqam music is directly rooted in the Sufi tradition of Sama’. This music is discussed in greater detail in this chapter.As for the Kazakhs, Kyrgyzs, and Turkmens, who are of a nomadic origin, their music follows the rural, or folk, traditions of bards such as the Kazakh zhiraus and the Kyrgyz manaschies. This distinction, however, is flexible. Indeed, during the twentieth century many nomadic people took to the set-tled way of life, and it is also worth noting that the Tajiks and Uzbeks have their own rural communities and musicians, the Baqshies and the Otin-Oys. Nonetheless, the deep-rooted traditions of these two kinds of people have survived the progress of time and changes in lifestyle, and the distinction between their music is still discernible as part of their ancestral identity.The Sufi influence is the common thread which, nevertheless, ties these different types of music together and it is rooted most significantly in the poems by, for instance, Saadi (1184–1292), Rumi (1207–73), Hafez (1318/25-unknown), and Navoiy (1441–1501), which form the basis of song. The singing style of these countries is very distinctive, reflecting the singer’s meditation and concentration. The Sufi content is also evident in the structure of classical song, which is analysed later in this chapter, but which represents that of a whole Zikr ceremony with the same sort of introductory, developmental, and climactic sections that, in turn, reflect the broader spiritual stages of the Sufi ‘way’ to divinity.Uzbek and Tajik religious and Sufi music has not yet been classified among the acknowledged musical categories studied by musicologists. The reasons for this are not purely political – when all religious confessions, including Islam, were banned – but are also of a musical nature. Religious and Sufi music was, and still is, performed mainly without instruments.

However, it is said that: ‘The conceptualization of religious music as a chant or recita-tion, rather than music or song, reflects a fundamental Muslim belief in the supremacy of the word as the basis of all religious communication, starting from the revealed word of the Qur’an itself, which constitutes the very foundation of Islam.’166This statement is also true for Central Asian, and particularly Uzbek, religious music. According to one of the existing classifications, Islamic religious music could be roughly divided into: Mosque music (reciting the Qur’an)• Sufi order music• hymns and songs for festivals.• 167Another classification of Islamic music is given in reference to Indo-Muslim religious music considering: a) liturgical music; and b) non-liturgical music, including Sufi music.168Uzbek and Tajik non-liturgical music is distinguished by its particu-lar variety and richness and it differs from one local area to another. For example, the full range of hymns expressing devotion to God (Hamd) or the Prophet (Na’t) combining the celebration of Mavlud (Prophet Muhammad’s birthday) along with the Sufi rituals are still found in the Ferghana Valley.This kind of music is still popular in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan (also southern parts of Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan) and has various distinguish-ing features. One should point out that only a few genres of the Islamic musical tradition (e.g. Azan – the call to prayer) are still performed in male society. But all other genres are seen only in female performances. So far, this issue has not been discussed in the context of Uzbek and Tajik religious music.21. CENTRAL ASIAN SUFI MUSIC AND FEMALE SINGERSMaqam and SufismIn Central Asia, Maqam music has a particular role in religious, cultural, and social life.Chapter 06.indd 75Chapter 06.indd 7512/27/10 7:34:47 PM12/27/10 7:34:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"76FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMThe very word Maqam reveals its Sufi origin. Sufi teachings became extremely widespread as Islam was adopted and reconciled with local traditions and culture. That is one of the explanations why so many Sufi orders were born in Central Asia. These teachings were very often sup-ported by the Central Asian khans and emirs, almost all of whom had their spiritual masters or Pirs, who were true Sufis. We can therefore, thank the rich and robust medieval court culture, strengthened by major develop-ments since the fourteenth century (as four different kingdoms grew up in Samarkand, Bukhara, Khorezm, and Kokand), for maintaining the Sufi tradition, including its music.Originating in the courts of these emirs (emperors) and khans (kings), the music of Maqam tradition developed over a long period, and in different ways, in various regions of the country. Today, the music of Uzbekistan encompasses different forms of Maqam – the classical musi-cal form with a Sufi flavour, including the Maqam from Bukhara – ‘Shashmaqam’, the Maqam from Khorezm, and the Maqam from Ferghana-Tashkent.The Maqam system of Sufi court music was founded on a particular aesthetic and ethical code. Each Maqam had to be played in a hall dec-orated with an appropriate and specific colour, and everyone present at that reception had to wear clothes of the same colour, which reminds us of Najm ad-din Kubra’s Sufi theory of colours and states of the Sufi. In addition, each Maqam had to be performed at a fixed time of day, so, for example, the Maqam ‘Iraq’ should be performed in the early morning dur-ing sunrise. The terrace, hall and musicians’ gowns where that particular Maqam was played should be white. Buzruk (great) was performed accom-panied by red colours, Ushshoq (lovers) and Rost (straight) in dark yellow, and Navo (melody) would have been performed after midnight in black or grey costumes. The evidence is clearly depicted in the miniatures of Kamal ad-Din Behzad, the founder of the Herat school of miniature painting in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.In paintings such as Sa’bai Sayar (Seven Planets) by Alisher Navoiy, and particularly ‘Bahram in the Gold Pavilion’ or ‘Bahram in the Green Pavilion’, the scene is laid out in beautifully decorated pavilions. The emperor is pictured sitting comfortably within the arcades of the palace. Beneath the vaults, the female musicians sit on the floor, and among the warmly glowing candles soft music is performed, played by delicate instru-ments such as the ghidjak, the harp (the predecessor of the chang, or box zither) and the doira, or frame drum.Chapter 06.indd 76Chapter 06.indd 7612/27/10 7:34:47 PM12/27/10 7:34:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"77MUSIC AND FEMALE SUFISShashmaqam is a cycle of six maqams, which was formed towards the eighteenth century. Information about initial maqams is mentioned in trea-tises of the tenth and eleventh centuries (Farabi, Ibn-Sina); and in treatises about music of the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries (Abd al-Qadir Maragi, Abd al-Rakhman Djami, Darvish Ali Changi, and others) they figure as the compilation of twelve maqams.169 The term ‘maqam’ was first used in a musi-cal sense, as the system of modes, by the Persian scholar Qutb ad-din al-Shirazi (d. 1311).170 In the process of development, six maqams remained out of twelve: Buzruk (great), Rost (straight), Navo (melody), Dugoh (two moments), Segoh (three moments), and Iroq (Iraq, far away). Named in accordance with the varieties of similar harmonies, they seemingly assimi-lated the remaining maqams.In one of our articles, written on the similarities between Sufi literature and Sufi music, my husband and I argued that, just as Sufi poets created a cycle of Hamsa (five poems) from the open literary form of Shahnameh, where each of those five poems was devoted to one of the Sufi degrees – Benefit, Grace, Good, Beauty, and Truth171 – the same process has hap-pened in the development of Shashmaqam. Moreover, maqam Iraq is the shortest in the cycle. It is half the length of the other five maqams, which makes it possible to assume its residual value. Possibly for this very reason, in contrast to the first five maqams, which have independent cycles, Iraq is performed extremely rarely as a separate work.So here we can, once again, refer to five Sufi aspects of music as stated by Inayat-khan: artistic, gnostic, emotional, inspirational, and celestial. Indeed, researchers of Shashmaqam assert that each separate Maqam initially cor-responded with five characteristics, which are applicable to Hamsa poems. Thus, maqam Buzruk is characterised by majestic, heroic, courageous, open, glad music. Rost is described as bright, but very restrained like the shining of truth. Maqam Navo characterises the state of bright melancholy, languor, hope, and love. Dugoh is joyfully glad, winged. Maqam Segoh is amorous and tragic, extremely dramatic, which resembles by its endless-ness Mejnun’s love for Leyla. Iraq has a profound philosophical meaning – the meaning of sorrowful meditation.Thus Shashmaqam in its composition follows the stages of the Sufi Way: from the courageous, majestic elevated heroics of Buzruk (great) through the bright but restrained Rost (straight, truth), then the wearisome hope and the grief of Navo (melody), winged Dugoh (two moments), and tragi-cally amorous Segoh (three moments) to the deeply philosophical finale of Maqam Iraq (far away).172Chapter 06.indd 77Chapter 06.indd 7712/27/10 7:34:47 PM12/27/10 7:34:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"78FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMEach of these six Maqams has an instrumental section Mushkilot (com-plication) and a vocal section Nasr (victory, prose). Each suite contains a series of pieces related by melodic resemblance, but set in different metric-rhythmic genres. In general, every single suite relies on an older distinction between a fixed, canonical sequence of pieces and an open-ended sequence that followed it.At the centre of the Maqam tradition is vocal music. Singers have the greatest cachet among performers, and the ability to reach a high tessit-ura pitch in the Awj, or culmination, of a song and sustain it over an entire long breath is much admired by connoisseurs of classical music. Singing Maqam, however, is far more than a display of virtuosity. ‘The lyrical expressiveness of the Maqam is also a means of conveying the beauty and symbolic power of the poetic texts . . . . The text composed in classi-cal forms as Ghazal . . . are redolent with symbols drawn from Sufism, the mystical trend in Islam. The most salient of these symbols is love, which while describing human feelings and activities alludes metaphorically to the love of the divine.’173The similarity to the path of spiritual wisdom in the Sufi Way – Tariqat is quite obvious in the melodic development of each Maqam. Its vocal piece Shu’be (part), which is based on Ghazal poetry, progresses through a series of structural divisions distinguished by tessitura: an introductory section, Daramad (entrance), set in a low tessitura leads to a section called Miyankhona (mid-room), typically set at an interval of a fifth above the introduction. Miyankhona leads to Dunasr (double victory), set an octave above the Daramad. Awj (zenith), the culmination, follows Dunasr, after which the piece gradually descends to the original tessitura in a concluding section called Furaward (exit). The high tessitura Awj is both the musical and the dramatic climax (Figure 2).On the other hand, every single Maqam is identified with development from the wisdom of the first part of the Maqam, Sarahbor (main message) to a quiet Interpretation or the second stage – Talkin; observation of Nasr (third stage), and then the optimistic finale, conclusion, to the fourth stage – Ufar (fragrant).174Most of the historical chronicles give the names of famous male per-formers of Maqam – some, among them, sang in a high-pitched feminine voice. Thus in Ferghana Valley some historic documents name a famous Maqam singer, Hudoyberdi, whose performing nickname was Zebo-pari (Beautiful fairy).175 The Sound Archive of the British Library keeps early recordings of Central Asian traditional Sufi music, made by the company Chapter 06.indd 78Chapter 06.indd 7812/27/10 7:34:47 PM12/27/10 7:34:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"79MUSIC AND FEMALE SUFIS‘Gramophone’ in 1906.

The names of Tamara Hanum, Halima Nasyrova, Nazira Akhmedova, Hadia Yusupova, Fotima Borukhova, Barno Is’hakova, Shohista Mullajonova, Zainab Palvanova, Rakhima Mazokhidova, Mavlyuda Agzamova, Saodat Kabulova, Berta Davydova, Kommuna Ismailova, and many others make up the pride of Uzbek and Tajik Maqam musical and performance arts, and embellish the history of the Uzbeko-Tajik Sufi musical tradition.Berta Davydova (b. 1927 in Margelan, Ferghana Valley, d. 2008 in Tashkent), was one of the leading performers of Maqams. She was born to a rich Bukharian Jewish family, and loved to sing from her early childhood. In 1938 her family moved to Tashkent. After finishing school she gradu-ated from medical college and worked as a nurse in a health centre. Berta liked to sing, and sometimes performed at evening concerts for the local hospital. Once, on a big occasion, famous Uzbek artists came to perform in front of all the wounded soldiers, and one of the young soldiers on crutches Figure 2: Melodic development in Shu’beSHU’BEAwjMiyankhonaDunasrFurawardDaramadChapter 06.indd 79Chapter 06.indd 7912/27/10 7:34:47 PM12/27/10 7:34:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"80FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMsuddenly shouted in the middle of the concert, ‘We also have a singer here!’ People called her and she had to go onto the stage and, feeling embarrassed as she was in her nurse’s white medical gown, she sang a few songs.‘After the concert the Uzbek People’s artist Imamjon Ikramov came to the Hospital’s director and said that I had a special voice and he would like to invite me to work for the Radio. The head of the health centre said that very soon, on reaching eighteen years of age, I would have to go to the front line to fight the Germans in World War 2. To avoid that, it would be better if they took me to sing.My mother didn’t want me to become a singer. So, I asked my col-leagues to help me and Imamjon Ikramov went to talk to my mother to explain to her that it was the only way to avoid me being sent to war. After that my mother didn’t mind me singing for live broadcasts. I remember I sang at that time Munojat, which was the first classical song I learned with Imamjon Ikramov. With this song I became Berta Davydova. Halima Nasyrova was a famous female singer at that time. She was lady in her prime but I was just 17 when I started.After Imamjon Ikramov retired Yunus Rajabi became the head of our ensemble. I learned all the Uzbek Maqams with him during the five years I was working for his Maqam ensemble. In the past only men sang Maqam. I was the first woman who sang Maqam, and I learned it from Imamjon Ikramov who said my voice was appropriate for Maqam-style singing and taught me how to do it. I sang “Bayet 2”, “Bayet 5”, “Talkini Bayet”, “Taronai Bayet”. Then I went to Tajikistan to their Maqam ensemble there and learned “Nasry Bayet”, “Taronai Bayet”, “Talkinnin Baayet”, “Ufori Bayot”, “ Ufar oromijon”, “Orazi Navo”, “Sarahbori Oromijon”, “Kashkarchi Savty”, “Usshok”, altogether about ten Maqams from Shahnozar Sohibov (People’s Artist of Uzbekistan) and Zirkiev, who was a Maqam singer himself from the Bukharo school. I sang Navoiy, Zebunissa, Uvaysiy poetry in Maqam.As head of a Shashmaqam ensemble Yunus Rajabi had set Uzbek poetry to the Shashmaqam and published six volumes of Shashmaqam with only Uzbek poetry in it, leaving the Tajik poetry behind. Six maqams were tran-scribed as six wonders! God bless his soul!’If you sing Maqam in the right way you never get tired! In the 1960s, I often went on holiday to Anjijon, I was sometimes singing up to twelve Maqams at once during the same public concert. On one occasion I was taken by helicopter to Jalalabad (a city 100 km away in Tajikistan) where an instant public concert was arranged for me to perform.

I was singing from early childhood. In 1934 Tamara Hanum and Karimzor Kariev came to Khorezm, and all the time I sang songs from their repertoire. Finally my parents took me to Tamara Hanum, saying, ‘She likes singing so much!’ She blessed me in a way, advising me to carry on, to participate in amateur school groups and performances. At the time when World War 2 began the Soviet army music group came to Urgench under the guidance of Gavhar Rahimova. Once, when I sang for a school performance, artists heard me from outside the window. Artists came to our place and their director asked, ‘Who sang a song just now? Can we see that girl, please?’ After listening to me they asked if I would like to be taken to Tashkent. Later, in the spring of 1943 I was taken as a 16-year-old to perform in Tashkent for the Uzbek front line group.‘My parents didn’t understand I was going to perform for the WW2 front line Ensemble. They thought it was just the Uzbek state ensemble. My Usto at that time was Fahritdin Sadykov. I remember once, for the 1st May celebration, I performed Yakkahon Ashula. I sang two songs very well, receiving long applause. But for the third song I had forgotten the lyrics for the Awj (culmination). I started introducing the Awj ornamen-tation with. . .a-a-a-a-a-a---’ but the words would not come. I tried again and again but with no success. . . . Finally, after a long, loud ‘a-a-a—a’ I had no words to sing and I made up the end with the words ‘BOREY!’ (Get lost!)I ran from the stage and there the Uzbek People’s Artist, the Director of Philharmonic Boborahim Mirzaev, came backstage and pulled my ear. I started to cry but he said, ‘You made a new folk song! Do you hear the applause? Now they want you to come to the stage again!’Chapter 06.indd 81Chapter 06.indd 8112/27/10 7:34:47 PM12/27/10 7:34:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"82FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMWe sang many folk and classical songs like Karokolpokcha, Azerbaijoncha, Gruzincha, Belorassia, Ukrainian, Russian and many others.On 15 August 1943 we were taken to the Front line, the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian front line in 1944, also the Baltian front line. The most memorable was our performance for the second Belorussian front, when on 23 February 1945 we performed for Sabir Rahimov’s (the Uzbek General’s) 37th Uzbek division. In July 1946 I came back to Khorezm to be given the honourable title People’s Artist of Uzbekistan. After that I performed in the Philharmonic ensemble as a soloist, performing in festivals in every decade.In 1959 I was invited to Uzbek Radio where I worked for 30 years. I was involved in 468 recordings, performing songs in Uzbek, Russian, Kyrgyz, Tajik and other languages. I sang forty-three songs by Fahritdin Umarov, eleven by Kamiljon Jabbarov, thirteen by Ganijon Toshmatov, seven by Kamiljon Otaniyasov, five by Muhammajon Mirzaev, songs by Sabir Baboev, Nabi Hassanov, Sultan Haiyt, and other composers.’‘I sang Shashmaqam with Berta Davydova and that was great opportunity for us. Look, now there are no such singers as we were at that time! Together with Berta, I sang all six maqams! And we did it!From 1960 I sang Maqams together with Berta Davydova and with the other most outstanding male singers like Arif Alimaksumov, Karim Mumin, Ortykhoja Imamhojaev, Shokirjon Ergashev, Siroj Aminov. Six of us sang Shashmaqam and also the legendary Jurahon Sultanov from Ferghana and Tolmasov from Samarkand were invited to perform several Awjes (culmina-tions) for our recordings. We learned Maqam ways and performance style from Yunus Rajabi. By 1965 the Shashmaqam recordings were finished. For recordings we used to stay in the studio till midnight and even till 6 o’clock in the morning, before the trams started to run. Then we would go home. We used to ‘cook’ the part of Shashmaqam for ten to fifteen days and then we would record them. Yunus Rajabiy used to listen to our singing and change the notes for the next session, constantly improving it. When we started Buzruk, he fell ill and then Arif Alimaksumov took over. Professor Rajabi wanted to get stereo recordings but it didn’t happen, so we have a mono recording of the whole Shashmaqam, but not in stereo. Our singing was transcribed into notes and put in six volumes books and LP record-ings. Yunus Rajabi used to say, ‘I will leave this world but my Shashmaqam transcriptions and LP recordings will remain.’’‘I have a number of bright and talented students I am very proud of.

The souls and spirits of our teachers will be happy! We have so many outstanding poets and musicians to be remembered.’177Maqam, which used to be performed in long elaborate cycles, is today very often performed as a short extract from the cycle in only one piece of music. However, the significance of its relation to the Sufi dimension is still very high, according to statements by local musicians – that the mys-tical dimension of Islam can be expressed in musical terms. The subject of such music is remembrance of God. One of the most popular exam-ples of this kind is the song related to the Ferghana Maqam style, called Munojat (prayer). This song has become famous, and has been performed by famous female Uzbek and Tajik singers such as Barno Is’hakova, Berta Davydova, or Munojat Yulchieva. Every performance of this song awakens an image of Zikr based on a long developed flow of tension in the form of dynamic waves to culmination and back to the foundation. It is a classical song about spiritual assimilation with God and symbolises the Sufi way to perfection.Female performance of Maqams flourished in the twentieth century. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, the art of Maqam became one of the key elements in nation building, both in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Young Maqam singers like Munojat Yulchieva, Maryam Sattarova, Matluba Dadabaeva, Nasiba Sattarova, Khurriyat Israilova, and Zamira Suyunova have largely determined the way that modern Maqam art is developing.23. MUNOJAT YULCHIEVAThere is not a single fan of Uzbek music abroad who does not know the name of Munojat Yulchieva. In fact, she has outshone the fame of all the Uzbek artists, even those who have ventured abroad. She is unsurpassed in her skill and perfection of vocal technique, and in the beauty of the songs she performs. Nowadays, her name abroad has become a synonym for Uzbek classical music.Munojat Yulchieva is indeed the brightest star among performers of the classical Uzbek music in recent decades. Even her name, Munojat, means ‘ascent to God’, which represents the true meaning of Sufism.

In those terms, Munojat has inherited her musical knowledge from her spiritual and musical murshid (teacher, master) Shavkat Mirzaev, who in his turn inherited this knowledge from his father Muhammajan Mirzaev, to whom the knowledge was passed by the famous musicians Fahriddin Sadykov and Djurahan Sultanov. So the beginning of this chain melts away in the mists of past centuries. Despite Soviet political and cul-tural pressure on the texts that have been transformed over last century, the music continues in the same traditional way.Munojat is not just a singer who follows on the traditions taught by Shavkat Mirzaev, she is a great singer, the only one who managed to absorb the essence of Sufi singing style. Born on 26 November 1960, in Andijan village of Sherman Bulak (Ferghana Valley), Munojat studied music at Tashkent State Conservatoire from 1978 to 1985 under the guidance of Shavkat Mirzaev. She studied hard, and was well trained by her famous teacher, concentrating on the proper repertoire of Uzbek classical music. Following her diligence and devotion to Uzbek music, she has never per-formed at weddings, which is a well-known and well-paid custom for that kind of musician in Uzbekistan. She performs only at concerts and Photo 6: The Uzbek Sufi singer Munojat YulchievaChapter 06.indd 84Chapter 06.indd 8412/27/10 7:34:48 PM12/27/10 7:34:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"85MUSIC AND FEMALE SUFIS different sorts of festivals. After one of these, a remarkable concert on TV (1978), she became an overnight success (Photo 6).She worked at Ensemble ‘Maqam’ at Uzbek State Radio from 1980 until 1982. Since 1982 she has worked with the Uzbek State Philharmonic Ensemble. She received the awards for ‘Honoured Artist of Uzbekistan’ (1991), and ‘People’s Artist of Uzbekistan’ (1994) and was decorated with the order ‘Respect and Order of the People’ (1998).Munojat took part in many regional and International Festivals and Competitions, gaining first prizes (including, in 1997, the ‘Golden Nightingale’ at the Samarkand International Festival Sharq Taronalari). Since 1989, she has toured many countries, including the United States, and European, Asian, and Latin American countries.Her repertoire consists of the best examples of Uzbek Maqam music and music of Bastakors-composers in traditional Uzbek style. Thanks to her unique voice (mezzo-soprano, extending to 2.5 octaves), owing to Shavkat Mirzaev’s training, Munojat not only revived female songs well-known from the history of Uzbek music, but performed for the first time many male songs with really difficult composition and dynamic develop-ment. Her repertoire includes Uzbek Sufi music and the poetry of Alisher Navoiy, Fisuli, Mashrab and Huvaido among others.The most remarkable fact is that Munojat Yulchieva received the same Usto-Shogrid training from her teacher, Professor Shavkat Mirzaev, as other Sufi singers in pre-Soviet times. In spite of the Soviet cultural policy to sideline classical heritage, she was brought up in the traditional way. The basics of that oral tradition was built on long hours of individual ses-sions and a careful selection of Sufi poetry for her singing repertoire, rather than the popular modern Uzbek poetry that flattered Soviet ideology. This method restored the style of the old singing school.Professor Mirzaev took a risk in training the traditional singer Munojat during her long association (nearly 30 years) with her Usto. Building such master–apprentice relations during the Soviet times, when conservatory classes were full of students practising in groups, on a five-year course, was both a challenge and an outstanding achievement.I remember that, as a student, Munojat was a shy young girl who fol-lowed every word of her teacher’s advice. In 1990, at the Barbat Symposium and congress in Dushanbe, Munojat was staying at the same hotel as me, and I often met her at breakfast. One day, I met her in the corridor and noticed that she needed some help. She was looking for somebody to go to local market. But why, I asked her, pointing out that the market was just Chapter 06.indd 85Chapter 06.indd 8512/27/10 7:34:48 PM12/27/10 7:34:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"86FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMaround the corner, two minutes away from the hotel. It turned out her Usto Shavkat Mirzaev had prohibited her from leaving the hotel so as to avoid the crowds of her fans and admirers.Shavkat Mirzaev, coming from musical family, understood very well the advantages and disadvantages of fame, particularly for a female singer. It is so important for a popular artist not to be exposed to the public, or to become a toy in the hands of communist authorities. As a wise teacher and an outstanding Usto Shavkat Mirzaev tried to protect her from every single danger.As a result of his devotion, Munojat and Shavkat have become famous all over the world. Together, they have toured many countries in Europe, America and Asia during the last 20 years, conquering the public and win-ning music lovers’ hearts. In Munojat’s repertoire today there are songs of Sufi poetry and Maqam pieces. This is the most outstanding achievement in Uzbek music, when most of the Maqam pieces have been forgotten. In fact, Munojat has become a symbol of yesterday’s culture, singing classical poetry, using classical idioms and performing the classical music of van-ished palaces. The beauty of court music is revealed today when Munojat performs her songs. Her stunning strong voice and wide range tessitura enable her to include even male songs in her repertoire.When in 1978 Professor Shavkat Mirzaev found a peasant girl from Ferghana Valley crying in the corridor after failing to gain a place in the Uzbek State conservatory, he was attracted by her extremely strong and powerful voice. The timbre of her voice reminded him of the best voices of the Sufi singing tradition. So he decided to help Munojat to become professional singer – but only a Sufi singer. Certainly, Munojat must take the credit for her success as it only came about because of her sincere devo-tion to that kind of singing. How special was his training style? First of all it affected the voice range. To be able to produce a strong Sufi style sound the voice has to be trained in the way of the old Sufi professionals. What was the Sufi style of singing?In order that Munojat’s voice could be trained in the Sufi style Professor Mirzaev invented new techniques, which included both local voice techniques called guligi and biligi and the technique from Italian belcanto singing style based on chest breathing. His training was, therefore, based on the symbiosis of not only local styles combining throat and cupol/head/nose singing, but also on the best singing style of European opera. To learn the latter, Professor Mirzaev went to Moscow State Conservatory to consult with the best representatives of vocal skills training, returning to Chapter 06.indd 86Chapter 06.indd 8612/27/10 7:34:48 PM12/27/10 7:34:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"87MUSIC AND FEMALE SUFISTashkent with a clear view of how to develop vocal techniques and inte-grate their basics within the classical Uzbek singing style.In fact, Shavkat Mirzaev’s training system for the voice and breath devel-opment was based on Sufi tradition but enriched with the best innovations of contemporary European style. As a result, he has created a completely new technique of singing rooted on the use of the nose, head, and throat but with the creation of deep chest sound.Being both an instrumentalist (playing Rubab) and a composer, and a musician with a deep knowledge of Sufi poetry and music, Professor Mirzaev established a completely new vocal technique within Uzbek clas-sical music that was adjusted to the female voice.That is why Munojat’s singing is so moving: because she combines the old-fashioned system with the up-to-date methods of European opera and pop music styles. In her voice, one can find all the elaborate nuances of a highly professional singer from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries: from a deep low voice at the beginning through whispering sounds for the most intimate declarations to the thrilling voice-blow at high dynamic conclusions. Professor Mirzaev has offered Munojat the whole system of training for a professional singer, which includes not only the voice but also certain body movements (hands and head), posture, alternate use of the chest-nose-throat in singing, and distinctive breathing system.From numerous interviews with Shavkat Mirzaev I learned that, as a very responsible teacher carefully extending Munojat’s repertoire, he intro-duced songs from the simple to the ever more difficult, developing her voice from the central to the peripheral, most powerful and strong areas of tessitura. Finally, all famous Sufi songs were included in her collection! Freed from the traditional Sufi training (living in the family, cleaning shoes, doing housekeeping duties, and so on), Munojat’s dream of becoming a star came true, thanks to her extreme good fortune in meeting Professor Shavkat Mirzaev, her own ‘Professor Higgins’.24. SUFI ORIGIN GENRE KATTA ASHULAKatta ashula (big song) is a vocal genre of Sufi origin, which is quite similar to Spanish cante hondo. It could be regarded as remnants of sep-arately performed Maqam, but at the same time it is a distinct genre of Uzbek and Tajik vocal music, which is deeply rooted in Sufi Zikrs and Sama’. Katta ashula is usually performed by two or more unaccompa-nied singers. Other elements of it are: a) reciting parts, b) improvisation, and c) exclamations in the high pitches – all of which are similar to the structure Chapter 06.indd 87Chapter 06.indd 8712/27/10 7:34:48 PM12/27/10 7:34:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"88FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMof the Sufi Zikr. The Russian scholar Alexander Semyonov studied that genre of Uzbek music in the mid-1930s, when he was invited to collaborate with the Scientific Institute of Arts Researches. He mentioned two other genres of Sufi music of the ninth to twelfth centuries like Sama’i and Khanaqa’i (Khanaqa is a place of Sufi gatherings) as the origin of Katta ashula.178Another name for Katta ashula is Yovvoyi Maqom or Wild Maqam. Therefore, the main structure of Maqam’s vocal parts or Shu’be, which corresponds to the Sufi Way Tariqat, is followed here too: an introductory section, Daramad (entrance), set in a low tessitura leads to a section called Miyankhona (mid-room), typically set at the interval of a fifth above the introduction. Miyankhona leads to Dunasr (double victory), set an octave above the Daramad. Awj (zenith), the culmination follows Dunasr, after which the piece gradually descends to the original tessitura in a concluding section called Furaward (exit).179According to Orifhon Hatamov, one of the greatest performers of Katta ashula in Uzbekistan, the Ferghana-Tashkent school of singing is distinguishable in two ways: a) Maqam ways of singing, and b) Zikr Maqams. In the Yassaviya Sufi order Zikr is performed in a loud ( Jahriya) way in which music, and particularly Katta ashula, played an important role. In that order Zikr has the same structure as Katta ashula and follows three stages: a) Hal or entering the relevant state; b) Vajd or giving up your-self and obtaining a state of ecstasy; c) Mukashafot or discovering Allah and finding union with Him.The high-pitched exclamations correspond with the part of the Zikr when the gathering starts to exclaim short names of God: Haqq, Hu, Huw-wa (True, He, and Himself ). From the musical perspective, this part is based on Chorzarb (four beats) usul. The rhythm could be changed to Yakzarb (one beat), Duzarb (two beats), Sezarb (three beats), or Chorzarb (four beats), depending how many times the names of Allah are repeated.180Here is one of the most famous examples of Katta ashula, performed by Munojat Yulchieva, a leading Sufi singer of Uzbekistan.Ey dilbari jononim, hay sen tarki javob etma,Yuz jabru jafo birla holimni harob etma.Mastona ko’zingdan dod, qoshing qilichin tortib,sQo’lingga hino bog’lab bag’rimni kabob etma.Hey, my Beauty, don’t leave me without your answer,Don’t ruin me with hundreds of tortures and suffering.Chapter 06.indd 88Chapter 06.indd 8812/27/10 7:34:48 PM12/27/10 7:34:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"89MUSIC AND FEMALE SUFISI cry because of your intoxicating eyes, don’t use the sabre of your eyebrowsAnd don’t cut my body into blood, painting your hands with henna.Munojat said about this song: ‘When I sing it, I use what I call a Sufi voice. It’s like a prayer. Singing quietly can be much more powerful than singing loudly. When you are praying, you do not bother with other things. When I sing in this way, I concentrate on my inner state. I experience a kind of ecstasy and the music helps me in this.

From my experience of witnessing Shamanic practices in Uzbekistan I remember that they offer different forms of healing.On one visit to Eski Noukat village (Osh district, Kyrgyzstan) in 2002, I saw two women whispering and talking rapidly, using sayings and tongue twisters, pretending they spoke in other people’s voices, bending over a girl who had fallen ill. The two Azaimhans (Shamans) continued in this way until the girl started vomiting and fell asleep. They said the girl had fallen ill because ghosts disturbed her as she went to see ruins of a centuries-old house. They said that they had exorcised the bad spirits and now the girl would recover.On another occasion, in Boisun village, an old lady cured her grand-daughter by chopping off a hen’s head. She then soaked her fingers in the hen’s fresh blood and spread it inside her granddaughter’s throat. ‘It’s the best treatment against sore throat’, she said. In Boisun village the most famous Shaman/Baqshi was a man called Turi Shaman. He practised in a smoky room (the central room in his house) heating a knife over the fire preparing for the culmination of his healing ritual. Shaking his head, vibrating his lips, emitting louder and more forceful eerie sounds, he twirled the knife around the head of his patient who was sitting on the floor. The visibility was obscured by the increasing smoke when finally his patient started to move and, crawling slowly, left the room.Chapter 07.indd 90Chapter 07.indd 901/5/11 11:20 AM1/5/11 11:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"91INTERACTION OF SHAMANISM AND SUFISMLater, Turi Shaman would continue his performance of healing rituals, joining a Boisun group programme and becoming a kind of ‘stage per-former’ showing off his Shamanic skills to an amazed audience.But the most interesting healing rituals in Central Asia of the twenty-first century are certainly those that contain musical elements. Mostly per-formed by women, they reflect numerous features of religions from Shamanism to Islam. Various examples of female music-making forms are examined below.26. FEMALE SHAMANISM IN TURKMENISTANShamanism has always been part of Turkmen culture. The Shamanic idea of the upper, the middle, and the lower worlds (i.e. the main concept of Shamanism) is present in Turkmen arts, primarily in the decorations of rugs, carpets, and kilims. Two main elements of Tengrianism – earth and sky – are depicted by skilful Turkmen female weavers in ornaments that symbolise the Turkmen view of life, as well as their philosophy.A linguistic approach, according to Dr. Yusuf Azemoun, shows that the archaic word for the carpet in old Turkmen and Turkic languages is kowuz or kowur (this word has become kovyor in Russian), derived from the word kopuz. Kopuz is the oldest Turkic musical instrument.182 In the remote past, the kopuz was a long-necked bowed lute, which was widely used in Shamanic practice. It is believed that the sound of kopuz helps to attract good spirits and to repulse demons.The principal design of Turkmen rugs and carpets, which has been used for centuries, is called göl. Literally, this means a lake, symbolising the cult of water, over which birds are flying. But it is also believed that it was originally a reflection of sky on earth, or stars on water on the earth beneath.In Turkmen carpets the world is divided into three: the Upper World (heaven), the Middle World (our world), and the Lower World. Soren Neergard argues that the göl design on Turkmen carpets might represent the Turkmen image of heaven.183 In the old Turkic language, a star (in heaven) has always been used as an important ornamental element of the world. A line in Kutadgu Bilik, a Turkic book of poetry written in the twelfth cen-tury, says: ‘Bu kökteki yulduz bir ança bezek’ (the stars in heaven are such beautiful ornaments).184The springs are perceived as the eyes of Mother Earth where, in connec-tion with the cult of water, people make sacrifices.185 As we notice here, the Shamanistic yir/sub or the cult of water and earth play an important role in the art of carpet-making.Chapter 07.indd 91Chapter 07.indd 911/5/11 11:20 AM1/5/11 11:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"92FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMAmong the people of Central Asia and the Altay mountains, the ram has long been regarded as sacred. Archaeological studies in Central Asia and the Altay mountains have confirmed this fact. In Shamanic tradi-tions the ram is a divine animal, which protects the heavenly spirits from evil spirits. For this reason it is sacrificed. The influence of Shamanism continued among the people of Central Asia, namely the Turkmens, even after they became Muslims. The ram’s horn, which is a Shamanic element in Turkmen art, was, and still is, a popular design used both in carpets and felts. It is even used in the decoration of mosques. We also find Orkhun Runic letters as carpet patterns, each with a Shamanistic and mystic connotation. The letter r, in particular – beside being a beautiful design, represents the flow of water which symbolises the flow of life.In twelfth-century Central Asia, as Sufism began to develop, based on the poetry and teaching of Khodja Ahmad Yassavi, his followers estab-lished the Yassaviya brotherhood. When the area was invaded by Mongols, those Sufi followers fled to Anatolia, where started the new Sufi order, the Mawlaviyya. The poems of Yassavi, widely used in zikr, contain many Shamanistic motifs and elements. Zikr, among the Turkmens, is a recital of Sufi poetry with dance rituals, performed by men as well by women, until they reach a state of ecstasy. The Turkmens were prohibited from carrying out the Zikr by the Soviet Union. However, it was carried out to treat sick or depressed people, or to exorcise an evil spirit from their souls and bodies.Curiously, while Sufism was prohibited in the former Soviet Union for being religious, it was prohibited by the Turkmen mullahs in northern Iran for being anti-Islamic.While singing and dancing, Shamans and the crowd very often produce guttural sounds which correspond to Hu, meaning ‘God’ among the Sufis, with an Islamic connotation. However, it is believed that the ritual and the repetition of a guttural sound similar to the Sufi Hu is related to the leg-end of a spiritual leader who, while preaching vegetarianism, was caught eating meat. As a punishment, he was wrapped in tree bark and cut with a saw. Therefore, the guttural sound in the Sufi ritual is said to be the sound of the saw cutting the bark, which, in time, has turned into the sound of Hu – the repetition of the name of God. The guttural sound is present in Turkmen music even today, bringing a mystical property to the song. It is interesting that it is used in both male and female performance.Chapter 07.indd 92Chapter 07.indd 921/5/11 11:20 AM1/5/11 11:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"93INTERACTION OF SHAMANISM AND SUFISMThe four elements of earth, air, fire, and water play an important part in Sufi mysticism. Makhtumkuli, a Turkmen classical poet of the eighteenth century, says in his poem entitled ‘The Pains of Love’:Ishq o’tina tushtim, parvona bo’ldum emdi,Shavqing ko’zina kuydim, biryona bo’ldim emdi,Jismim kaboba do’ndi, giryona bo’ldim emdi,Ganch isteyinlar gelsin, vayrona bo’ldim emdi,Ayri bo’ldim ag’yorlardin, begona bo’ldim emdi.Love caught fire within my heart, and burned and blazed.Smoke whirling in the wind whipped me like something crazed.Fate caught me, spinning me upon its Wheel.Who came to see me through the eyes of real desire?Separation was a storm and – both flood and fire.186In Sufi doctrine the meaning of separation is very important. A Sufi needs separation to reach spiritual perfection. Separation makes a man burn and turn to ash; in other words, it helps a man to be ‘annihilated’ in God. In the same poem Makhtumkuli says:Mahdumquli, har zamon naylayin o’lmay giryon,Fakrliyna botdim, chiqa bilmasman bir yon,Ko’r, mehrobtin tarab, ko’nglimning uyi vayron,Jon jismdek aqldin ayrilib qoldim hayron,ish geldi bosha dushdi, vayrona bo’ldim emdi.O hopeful slave to the beloved’s charm, wherebyI lost my heart! A songbird of sweet tongues was I –Encaged! But separation scorched my soul.Then yearning burned me up, to ash was turned my mind.And Makhtumkuli’s life was tossed upon the wind.187In Turkmen classical poetry as well as folk literature, the words ‘pain’ and ‘burning’ proliferate, because some Sufis summarise the stages of their lives in three phrases – being raw, becoming mature (by the fire of tribulations) and being burnt (and turning to ashes).In Turkic-speaking world culture, before Islam came to Central Asia, women were highly respected. They were called khan emme or beg emme literally meaning ‘the mother lord’ which, with time, turned into the words khanum and begum that in modern Turkish mean ‘my Lady’.188Chapter 07.indd 93Chapter 07.indd 931/5/11 11:20 AM1/5/11 11:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"94FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMTurkmens had lived in a matriarchal society before they became Muslims, where women sang and even played musical instruments. One can find Shamanistic elements in Turkmen folk songs, which usually are pre-Islamic songs. Women improvise the lyrics for the euloegies in which praise the deceased and define his or her virtues. In the villages and in the countryside, young girls in groups under the moonlight sing ‘Laleh’ in the form of quatrains to express their feelings towards their beloved or to complain about social obstacles which obstruct their meeting with their loved ones.No wonder that in matriarchal society there were female musicians and even female Baqshi. One of them – Heley-Baqshi from the tribe of Yomuts or Chaudyrs which originated from Khiva – was Turkmen Baqshi, the winner of many male musical competitions.Her brothers shunned her because of her habit of constantly sing-ing, which they deemed inappropriate. To find an accompanist for her songs she followed the Amu Darya upstream to the Kerkenskyi district, where she found a man, the Dutar player, who later became her hus-band. Her name became well known and many famous Baqshi sought the chance to meet her in competition. When she was in final months of her pregnancy the legendary Kyer-Kodjali wanted to compete with her. The competition began in the evening and audience was divided, one side supporting Heley-Baqshi and the other Kyer-Kodjali. ‘Let’s see if the mare will win in the horse-race!’ said Kyer-Kodjali, and Heley-Baqshi answered, ‘Let’s see!’Around midnight Heley-Baqshi felt that she was going into labour. She asked her husband whether he would like her to win or to give birth. ‘Win!’ was his answer. She went out, gave birth to her baby, and returning, continued playing until she won the competition. Kyer-Kodjali admitted his failure and fled from that place forever.189Today, in Turkmenistan, a broad range of folk songs are performed, which are related to family, and daily life. If we look at their titles we find a connection with Shamanic or Sufi nature.For example, the popular Syut-Gazan – a song calling for rain; Like many other Central Asian people, Turkmens still practise Islam together with pre-Islamic religious beliefs. The call for rain, for instance, is addressed to Syut-Gazan, protector of animals, who was able to bring rain using magic rain stones Yada. That genre reflects both the ancient agricul-tural, Shamanic cults of Turks-Oghuz and Islamic influences. Nowadays children sing this song as a game.190Chapter 07.indd 94Chapter 07.indd 941/5/11 11:20 AM1/5/11 11:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"95INTERACTION OF SHAMANISM AND SUFISMOther songs known in the area include Yaremezan – festive songs, and Monjukatdy – fortune-telling songs.Zikr (Zyakir, Zykyr in Turkmen) are commonplace at Turkmen wed-dings. Originating from Sufi tradition, mixed up with Shamanic derivation in a form of Jahr (or Jahriya – a loud form of Sufi Zikr) which has devel-oped in two directions: as a healing ritual, and as an entertaining genre for wedding and house-warming ceremonies. Together with wedding songs, with the exclamations Alla, Huv-hu, ‘Eh-ha’, it is based on dancing forms.Zikr for weddings plays an important role as a form of protection for the new family. Its form is based on alternating parts contrasting in rhythm and content: the impulsive Divana and Bir-depim change to quiet Sedratom, the fast Uch-depim contrasts with the peaceful Oturma-Ghazal, while the final Zem-Zemom concludes on the highest range of emotions. The link between the forms of Zikr is based on construction, architec-tonics, rhythm, and common melodic patterns.191 Some songs reveal the influence of Sufi Zikr, and include repetitive body movements like, for example, Ayak-lale (jumping on one leg combined with intense body movement).The female group of songs is quiet wide-ranging, including wedding songs such as Yar-Yar, the lullaby Hundi, and other songs-laments (Agy). Other groups of female songs consist of game songs: Lale – girls’ songs; and the same genre in the form of a game; Daman-lale (accompanied by clapping on the throat producing harsh and grating sounds made in the throat or towards the back of the mouth); Dodek-lale (in which the lower lip is nipped with the fingers); Egin-lale or hymmyl-lale (tong-twisters or brain-teasers songs).27. GALEKE: THE KAZAKH SHAMANIt is well known that music has the power to affect our mood and our health. We listen to music to raise our spirits or, on sad occasions, to give relief from deep sorrow or grief. Music can be used specifically for its healing effects, as in the case of Galeke, an exceptional personality who is famous in Kazakhstan for her unique ability to heal people using song. I had a chance to witness her performance. When her divine, tender, and pure voice starts flowing over the audience, people forget all their troubles. Her voice brings such a memorable joy that people ask her to sing again and again.The image of Galeke is a very special one.Chapter 07.indd 95Chapter 07.indd 951/5/11 11:20 AM1/5/11 11:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"96FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMAt the age of five, Galeke acquired the power of prophetic prediction. She has never received any training in the healing rituals, acting only through intuition. She sings and her voice – unpolished, and untrained – purifies your soul like a stream of water. She senses immediately what problems are affecting your body from the first time she sees you, and during her singing sessions helps people to balance their health. The basis of her repertoire comprises such genres of Kazakh traditional musical culture as kara olen. But she also sings Tatar, Russian, and Kyrgyz folk songs with or without accompaniment. ‘Galiya’s birth was preceded by amazing and memorable events. The wolf is a common ancient totem of the Kazakhs and, more widely, of the Turks. The she-wolf, who leg-endarily reared the Turkic Prince Ashin, is the heroine of many ancient Turkic myths. Well, a large pack of dark blue wolves had overwhelmed the small settlement in the north of Kazakhstan at the time when Galiya Kasymova was born. For days people could not venture out for fear of the wolf pack. The nurse who had to help deliver the child was strong and determined. She took an axe for self-defence and went to Galeke’s parents’ house ignoring the danger of wolves around the village.’ No doubt that was the moment to mark the arrival of, in Basilov’s term, ‘the chosen one of the spirits’.The sound of music in Galeke’s performance impacts on the listeners in a manner similar to a Baqshi’s healing seance. Through the sound of her voice, especially notable for its high vibrations, pure energy enters the mind to purify and cure those who hear it.192In daily life, Galeke is an outstanding personality who combines two different images; she is a Shaman, and at the same time, she is a scholar who tries to understand her own power in her reflections and observations. According to Galeke,Sound is a channel of energy. The effect on your body depends on what the song sounds like. Music reflects the harmony of universe, bringing a stream of information which affects our mind and body. Humans live without identifying the stream of time, like floating in water. When we are listening to music our mind is resting though our body does not rest at all: the heart still pulsing, the breath is inhaled and exhaled, the blood is moving in our vessels etc. so, music is curing our body. I feel immediately the physical problems of every human around. When I per-form a healing ritual, when people are sitting around in the hall and listening to my singing for two or three hours, they feel better after just one performance.Chapter 07.indd 96Chapter 07.indd 961/5/11 11:20 AM1/5/11 11:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"97INTERACTION OF SHAMANISM AND SUFISM‘All folk songs have extreme magic power. Not pop or jazz music but old folk songs. It doesn’t matter what language they are sung in or what ethnicity they represent: Kazakh, Tatar, Kyrgyz, Russian. These folk songs are ener-getically active and are supposed to have healing effects on ill people. The same happens with traditional instruments. Music played on those instru-ments possesses healing power. Abu Ali ibn Sina recommended listening to the music of traditional instruments to take preventative measures to pro-tect your body. I know from my experience that traditional instruments can heal even drug addicts. Classical music is also available for healing. It could be Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov. Some carefully-chosen pieces of music from other composers’ music have a special effect as a means of healing.’‘Prayers, casting spells and chanting are also effective means for the healing process. Not only should my medicine/melody therapy work here but also it requires a personal involvement. The ill person should read prayers himself to clean the body.’‘Not only Sound but also Water is a substance with strong healing power. A molecule of water has the power to heal as was proved by scholars in 1995. Seventy per cent of the human body consists of water. No wonder that water also has a powerful impact on the human body due to mechanical vibrations which form a bio-magnetic field. Music can change the code of water, as water remembers the information and can acquire sacred or heal-ing features. No wonder that there is sacred water, Holy water. If prayers and sayings are said to the water, imbuing it with the spells’ effect, it can be used afterwards for the healing process.’‘I never had teachers for my healing ability. I have healed intuitively from the very beginning using non-contact therapy. In my childhood I could call for rain. I don’t know how it happened, how it occurred to me, the knowl-edge or the way how to do it. I can foresee people’s destinies. They come to me as a picture of colours or a code of digits.’ (from my original interviews: February 2006, July 2007, July 2008)28. FEMALE SHAMANISM IN TAJIKISTANHojent is a city in the Ferghana Valley where the Uzbek and Tajik populations are mixed together. In the Soviet past, Hojent, which used to be called Leninabad, was the most Russianised, industrialised, and densely populated city, counting the regional Communist elite among its 175,000 inhabitants. At the same time, common Tajik-Uzbek traditions maintained close links between these ethnicities for centuries. Many rituals are carried out here in both the Tajik and Uzbek languages. In 1997, when I visited Chapter 07.indd 97Chapter 07.indd 971/5/11 11:20 AM1/5/11 11:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"98FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMHojent, the city was in deep economic crisis with crowds of jobless people all over the places. Depression was in the air.In such an atmosphere, I recorded a healing ritual which involved a huge crowd of people. People gathered in the Central Square around a small house (the former Club of Culture), forming a long queue. Waiting patiently in line to experience the cures of well-known Sitorabanu-Otin, were people who had travelled long distances from different parts of Tajikistan. She turned out to be a magician who helped everyone abso-lutely free of charge. People said she was able to cure not only different kind of illnesses and disease but even some neglected conditions such as alcoholism or the behaviour of bad-tempered husbands.The story of her healing power was moving. Six years ago, one day both of her children disappeared. She desperately looked for them every-where and then, people said, she had a dream where the Hazrat Ali advised her to start helping people, to heal them for twelve years and then her children would safely return. When I met her she looked depressed, but was performing her duty with a devotion to the process of healing that was astonishing. She spent long hours trying to cure people, gaining enormous respect. People consider that Sitorabanu-Otin is an angel who has come to the troubled city to rescue them.Those who joined her sessions were asked to attend ten sessions of twenty minutes each. Every person had to be covered by white headscarf. Nearly everyone had a jar of water front of them. Usually a session started with a prayer followed by a collective prayer, her speech (very much of religious content) and a long musical meditation during which people sat on the floor, sinking into a deep trance, after which the session was over. People said that her cure came from her image, her appearance and her way of praying over their heads. Her style of healing was simple: prayers were recited in her very genuine beautiful voice with dynamically wavy structure, tapes were played in musical sessions, during which she contin-ued slowly walking around. She was just strolling between seated patients, touching each head during the session and making gentle gestures with her arms. Not only the patients themselves but even those people who could not make a journey to see the Sitorabanu-Otin but whose photographs were displayed, got restored to health.Other wonders surrounded the Otin’s presence in the city include the following. A girl who sat next to me later on that evening at the local wedding told me that after attending Sitorabanu-Otin’s session returning home she found a couple of pearls in her tea cup! Many people told me Chapter 07.indd 98Chapter 07.indd 981/5/11 11:20 AM1/5/11 11:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"99INTERACTION OF SHAMANISM AND SUFISMthat they were saved by this inexplicable experience. A teenage boy who was previously unable to walk, but later was miraculously cured by her, was assisting his mentor.All kinds of music were used for these sessions, including local pop music, and local stars’ hits with a traditional flavour. But all the music was heard in the background. Otin-Oy herself said that she had a well-known spiritual teacher in Kokand (a neighbouring city in the Ferghana Valley) from whom she acquired her spiritual power. Her teacher also practised with prayers, and by reciting classical poetry by Navoiy, Fuzuli, Nodira, Uvaysiy, and other Uzbek Sufi poets.29. ELEMENTS OF SHAMANISM AND SUFISM IN UZBEK FOLK MUSICOur journey of examination continues with Uzbek music. Although we have numerous examples of the relationship between religion and music in Uzbek culture, we focus here on the most common form: music of celebration, and in particular, a wedding song performed by local women (Photo 7). This song is heard at every single wedding throughout the nation. How have pre-Islamic beliefs and practices developed in folk music? Have they mixed with Islamic features? To answer these questions, to get an idea of religious symbiosis, let us analyse just one example: the Uzbek wedding song Yor-Yor (beloved, beloved).Hoy-hoy o’lan, jon o’lano, o’lanchi qiz,Yor-yorey o’lanchi qiz,Va’dasida turmagan–o, yolg’onchi qiz,Yor-yorey, yolg’onchi qiz.Tog’da toycha kishnaydiyo ot bo’ldim debYor-yorey bo’ldim deb.Uyda kelin yig’laydiyo yot bo’ldim deb,Yor-yorey yot bo’ldim deb.Yig’lama qiz, yig’lama yo, toy saniki,Yor-yorey, toy sanikiOstonasi tillodano uy saniki,Yor-yorey uy saniki.Osmondagi yulduzniyo sakkiz denglarYor-yorey sakkiz denglar,Sakkiz qizning sardoriyo keldi denglarYor-yorey, keldi denglar.Chapter 07.indd 99Chapter 07.indd 991/5/11 11:20 AM1/5/11 11:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"100FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMSakkiz qizning sardoriyo biz bo’lamiz,Yor-yorey biz bo’lamiz,Sakkiz bog’da ochilgano gul bo’lamiz,Yor-yorey gul bo’lamiz.Hovlimizning o’rtasida bir tup anjir,Yor-yorey bir tup anjir,Bir tup anjir tagidayo tillo sandiq,Yor-yorey tillo sandiq.Tillo sandiq simlariyo uzilmasin,Yor-yorey uzilmasin.Kelin-kuyov taqdiriyo buzilmasin,Yor-yorey buzilmasin.Hello riding woman, horse woman,You didn’t keep your promises you deceiver-woman.A foal is in the meadow and thinks he is already a horseAt home the new bride is crying saying she is a stranger here.Don’t cry girl, don’t cry girl, it’s your weddingThe golden threshold of the house is yours.In the sky there are stars, they say you are the eight starsThe eight star girls have come.Photo 7: Uzbek wedding To yChapter 07.indd 100Chapter 07.indd 1001/5/11 11:20 AM1/5/11 11:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"101INTERACTION OF SHAMANISM AND SUFISMWe will be the head of the eight girlsAs sight in the garden we will be like open flowers.In the middle of the garden there is a fig treeUnder the tree there is a golden chest.Let the hinges of the chest not be brokenLet the bond of the bride and the groom not be broken.At first glance we find no obvious religious references, in the song’s lyrics, either to Islam or Sufism. This song, which has been handed down from ancient times, is sung all over Uzbekistan. The tune and rhythm are simple, easy to remember and to repeat, and is said to have protective meaning.No wonder every family encourages performers to sing and play it again and again! However, in analysing the song’s poetry in the more detailed way one can find that the meaningful symbols of local religions and beliefs are present here in the most dynamic way. What first draws our attention is a record of hidden symbols in lyrics of the song. Why are the words and phrases, ‘threshold’, ‘house’, ‘eight flowers’, ‘eight stars’ so widely used here? What is their origin? What do they mean?To answer those questions we should turn our attention to another phenomenon of Uzbek traditional culture, to the local decorative art and particularly to its special example – Suzane.These large decorative wall-hanging silk embroideries – Suzanis – origi-nated in the nineteenth century and were made exclusively by women. These embroideries were popular only in the Central Asian region, where different Suzane designs developed in different areas. By the mid-nineteenth century the art of Suzane was formed as a standard system of patterns and developed its traditional styles. The composition, colour, and ornamentation based on floral motives and vegetative-style images were the supreme manifestation of the harmony of universe. The semantics of their appearance testify to a long evolution of this art.The tradition is characterized by picturesque and complex coloured patterns, placed against a background. Each Suzane was designed by a professional craftswoman, known as a Kalamkash. These skills were passed down from mother to daughter, or between other female members of the family. The genesis of Suzane embroidery was closely connected to family life. Though these were primarily designed as domestic articles, the ornamentation was intended to give protection from the evil eye. The language of ornamentation was a language of metaphor whose usage and Chapter 07.indd 101Chapter 07.indd 1011/5/11 11:20 AM1/5/11 11:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"102FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISM interpretation were determined by tradition. Behind every conventional sign there was a meaning. It employed a space-related symbolism where each element of ornament goes back to astral motives, whose source was probably in religious belief. Embroideries played the part of protective objects, but in the patterns the women saw a way to express certain ideas and content connected with real life.Some decorative motives of the Suzane, expressed in ornamental details and floral roundels symbolise a house and a threshold, pointing to the hidden meaning of a protected space where no evil eye could reach and affect you. According to Ashirov, ‘a door as a threshold possesses a deep symbolic meaning, bringing the image of the frontier between good and evil, light and dark, new and old, associated with sunrise and sunset. As archaeologists found out in the seventh–eighth centuries in Afrosiabe and Pandjikent areas, sacred rituals occurred on the thresholds of Sogdian shrines’ (Ashirov, p. 30).However, one of the most popular motifs in Uzbek Suzane is certainly the floral roundel in the shape of an eight-cornered star, emerging very often as an eight-petalled flower.Originating in the Shamanic past, the symbol of the eight-cornered star symbolises the cosmos, the power of universe. Eight items is so signifi-cant for that culture that you can often meet the symbol in old folk songs like the one above. However, here in the Suzane those Shamanic symbols are combined with later Islamic decorations: the eight-cornered star, the astral Shamanic symbol, sign of the universe has become the symbol of Sufism.193Today, in the most popular songs like the Uzbek wedding folk song Yor-Yor one can find a close connection between Shamanism and Sufism which is expressed in different signs and symbols of decoration and in ornamental arts.Chapter 07.indd 102Chapter 07.indd 1021/5/11 11:20 AM1/5/11 11:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"1038Musical Instruments and Dance in Female Communities30. MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS: FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMCentral Asian musical instruments are historically associated with extreme power related to Shamanic spirits, for example, the Kazakh instrument, Kobuz; or from Sufi concept of divine power. Some of these are discussed here.In the Kazakh myths and legends the creator of the first musical instrument, Kobuz,194 was Korkut, the first musician and the patron of the Baqshi – Shaman. The first musical instrument of the Baqshi, Kobuz, preserved its archaic features up to the middle of the twentieth century. The form of this musical instrument and the way it is held during the per-formance represents for Kazakhs the trinomial structure of the Universe: the High World, inhabited by gods, divine spirits, and birds, the Middle World, which is the abode of human beings and warm-blooded animals, and the Lower World, where evil spirits live, as well as those that creep and float, such as fishes, snakes, and lizards. The shovel-like head (bas) of the Kobuz is decorated with metal pendants in the form of rams’ horns (the creatures of the High World) and birds’ feathers (inhabitants of the High World). The case of the instrument, in the form of an open ladle from which, it is believed, the spirits rush out after the Baqshi’s appeal, symbol-ises the Middle World. The Lower World is embodied by a mirror placed inside the case. It represents the World Ocean, or as the Kazakhs say, ‘the lower sights’. The sound of Kobuz – dense, rich and with pre-sounds, or harmonics, or overtones,195 – is the signal for the appearance of spirits.Legends, widespread among the Kazakhs, testify to the belief that Kobuz is an animated creature. It participates and wins in baiga – a horse-race,196 and is capable of producing sounds without human input.197 It also has Chapter 08.indd 103Chapter 08.indd 10312/27/10 7:35:49 PM12/27/10 7:35:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"104FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMdeep symbolic protective meaning: Russian philologist V. Zhirmunsky wrote that the Kazakhs hang the Kobuz in the yurt (Kazakh nomad’s tent) to provide relief for a woman during childbirth.198Women in Central Asia have always been involved in music making. Many manuscripts, classic literature and art provide evidence about the place and role of women in Central Asian traditional culture, both in set-tled and nomadic communities. In Navoiy’s epic poem, ‘Seven strangers’ (planets), seven different princesses in their beautiful palaces tell seven sto-ries to the King, like Sheherezade of the Arabian Nights. This is an example of women protecting and preserving the sacred culture. Navoiy’s poems, beautifully illustrated with miniatures and vignettes by Kamaleddin Behzad (1450–1535) documented for later generations a number of female musicians, playing spike fiddle and frame drum (Bahram Yashil Kasrda – Bahram in the Green Palace) or harp and frame drum (Bahram Oltin Kasrda – Bahram in the Golden Palace). We do not know the names of those musicians but their very presence in the medieval book miniature reveals much.Certain musical instruments were widely used in connection to Shamanic or Sufi practice. However, the main Sufi instruments in Central Asia, for example, Nay (flute) and Chang (dulcimer) were played by men. Masnaviy – the greatest Sufi work by Mevlyana Rumi, for instance, starts with the famous words, which became a motto of Sufism:Bishnav as Nay, ki hikoyat mekunad,Az judoiho shikoyat mekunad.Listen to Nay, who has story to tell,Who complains about its separation.Before proceeding with description and classification of musical instruments in Sufi tradition, we direct to the readers’ attention an example of relation-ship between Sufi musical instruments and Uzbek classical poetry.Muhammadniyaz Nishoti (eighteenth century), who was born in Khiva (nowadays Khorezm, Uzbekistan) wrote a famous Sufi poem called Husnu Dil (The Beauty and The Heart), about a King, Mind (Reason) in the kingdom of Body, who has a son, Heart. When the son reaches adult-hood the father presents him with a kingdom and his mother gives him a book. In this book the Heart reads about Obi Hayot, the Water or Source of Life, and then falls ill. His father talks to him and, realising what the Chapter 08.indd 104Chapter 08.indd 10412/27/10 7:35:49 PM12/27/10 7:35:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"105MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND DANCEproblem is, he calls his servant Nazar (the name means Sight) and sends him to find the source of life. In the 15,000 lines of the poem narrating his search, Nazar encounters Pride, Honesty, Shame – in fact, every human attribute, or failing – but nowhere does he find the source of life. Some kind people, like Intuition, tell Nazar that the source he is looking for lies between the lips of Beauty, who is the daughter of another king called Love (Passion). Before the Heart can find Beauty there are battles between the two kings, Mind (Reason) and Love (Passion). Love is victorious. Finally, all the poem’s heroes are united in the Garden of Perfection, and there is a Feast where everyone sings and dances. Heart wins Beauty, and at the same time finds the Source of Life.Part of this Sufi poem tells the story of Daf (a round Drum), Nay (flute), and Chang (Dulcimer), the main musical instruments used in Sufi rituals.Mehr dafin kafga sipehri barinOldi oningdekki guli otashin.Charx ko’rub oni bulub charxzanRaqs ila o’z jismiga berdi shikan.Raqsu samo’ ila bo’lub ko’hsorGulshani davr ichra edi zaravor.Like a flaming flowerDrum of the Sun was taken by Sky.Heavens noticing it started to whirl,Breaking itself into dance.Dance and Sama’ have overtaken mountains,Which were closing their circle.This is an introductory paragraph about Daf, which describes the func-tions of that musical instrument in Sufi music and rituals. Many existing Sufi rituals are still performed with accompaniment of Daf /Doira, and are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 9 devoted to female Sufi rituals, especially those based on dance. Here it is enough to say that, for instance, Barno Is’hakova, one of the leading performers of Maqams, often sang to the accompaniment of Doira.There is a well-researched theory into Doira’s rhythms or Usul (Method) theory, which goes back to the Treatises on Music by Al-Farabi and Ibn-Sina. In my book on the correlation between Usul and the rhythm of melody in Maqams,199 I tried to summarise these theories and to show that, on one hand, Usul sets up a rhythm of the piece, which is a crucial element Chapter 08.indd 105Chapter 08.indd 10512/27/10 7:35:49 PM12/27/10 7:35:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"106FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMof Sufi Maqams. Thus Usul, which is called zarb-ul-qadim (ancient beat) is in fact related to the heartbeat, while other Usuls are related to different modes of breathing, etc. On the other hand, Usuls support the rhythmi-cal structure of Maqams’ Ghazal Sufi poetry, making bigger its affective, suggestive power.31. DUTARAmong the large group of Central Asian musical instruments is one that is famous for its ‘feminine’ image, and widely used in female performance. That is the long-necked plucked, fretted lute, Dutar.Apart from Daf/Doira, the Dutar plays an extremely important role in Central Asian female Sufism. In Uzbekistan, the Uzbek Dutar has interesting historical connections with women’s domestic music, women performers, female poets, and poetic images of femininity, including the Sufi one. In many contexts, it is the only acceptable melodic instrument for use in female performance. Uzbek musicians consider the shape of Dutar, with its light elegant body, long slim, long neck, and round belly, to be similar to a stork’s image. Its tender sounds are associated with sounds of a cooing flying flock.The Dutar is an ancient instrument. Some scholars link it to the Tanbur that existed in Khorasan, a historical cultural area covering Turkmenistan, western Afghanistan, and eastern Iran.200 The name Dutar means ‘two strings’. There are several distinct regional types of Dutar. Of these the Uzbek Dutar is comparatively large, being about 125 cm in length. The Uzbek Dutar has retained its two silk strings, whereas other types of Dutar may have more strings, and use materials such as wire, gut, or nylon.201The Dutar seems to have been one of the main instruments for all entertainment events in the cities and villages of Uzbekistan. It was used by both male and female professional and amateur musicians as a general instrument in all kinds of settings. Because it has silk strings and a soft sound, it was played indoors, and its muted sound made it suitable for the quiet home atmosphere. Its role has been to accompany the voice or other instruments. In the classical Maqam tradition, which has been dominated by male professional specialists, the Dutar has an accompanying role pro-viding background support to other instruments.202It is important to remember that, for centuries, women in Muslim Central Asia, and particularly in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, were largely segregated from men, keeping within secluded parts of the home. Islamic law and local interpretations of Islam meant that many classes of women Chapter 08.indd 106Chapter 08.indd 10612/27/10 7:35:49 PM12/27/10 7:35:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"107MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND DANCEwere traditionally subordinated to male power and authority, although female members of royal and aristocratic families were actively involved in literature and the arts. The chronicles of Uzbek history were written by men, and in musical treatises many men have been identified as great masters of Dutar, but the role of women with regard to Dutar, as well as other music has been largely unrecorded. Nevertheless, drawing on a variety of sources, including literature, painting, and the oral tradi-tion, we can trace evidence of women’s historical involvement with this instrument.Other types of long-necked lute, similar to the Dutar are depicted in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century miniature paintings, which portray musi-cal entertainments inside palaces. The evidence suggests that during that period, women played various instruments, including long-necked lutes, in indoor court music. It is likely that they were both aristocratic women and professional entertainers.Central Asian poets have traditionally recited their poetry aloud, and in Ferghana the Dutar may well have had a role in performances by female poets. In past and present Uzbekistan, it has been quite common to see romantic miniature-style images of beautiful women playing the Dutar, and a recent edition of Nodira’s work contains an illustration of her com-posing poetry with a female companion playing the Dutar.203 Given that so many outstanding women poets lived in Ferghana, it is not surprising that female Dutar traditions in Sufi music have been particularly strong in that region.Girls and women created music at their own private gatherings (gap). A gap is any convivial gathering for men or women, either with or with-out music, very often bearing the traces of Sufi gatherings. The Dutar’s softness made it suitable for female gatherings at any time of the day or night, while its percussive quality (from the fingers plucking the strings) gives sufficient rhythmic support for dancing and singing in small indoor spaces.Late nineteenth-century photographers have captured images of young women holding Dutars. One such photograph was taken, not later than 1896, by the Russian traveller, Voljinski, in Khiva, the capital city of Khorezm.204 Sitting in an opulent setting, a group of five elaborately dressed young girls pose holding a Dutar, a frame drum (Doira), a book for singing poetry, and flowers. From their clothing and demeanour I conclude that these were professional entertainers. It is very likely that they played the Dutar in connection with marriage ceremonies or female Sufi events.Chapter 08.indd 107Chapter 08.indd 10712/27/10 7:35:49 PM12/27/10 7:35:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"108FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMWe find descriptions of amateur female Dutar playing in early twentieth-century novels. The novel O’tkan kunlar (Days Gone By) by the eminent author Abdulla Qadiry (1893–1938) has a scene set in nineteenth-century Margilan, a town in the Ferghana Valley. This depicts the beginning of a wedding ceremony with a female party in the women’s area of the house known as ichkari. In an amateur capacity, and in the context of celebra-tion, Qadiry’s female characters – Zebi, Qumri, and others – play songs and dances accompanying themselves on the Dutar.205 Another descrip-tion occurs in a novel by the eminent Uzbek writer Abdulhamid Cholpan (1895–1938), Kecha va Kunduz (Night and day). His heroine Zebihon and her female companions play music to make the journey to another village exciting and lively; they play the Dutar and sing songs as they travel in a private enclosed ox-drawn carriage.206The Dutar remained especially prominent in Ferghana’s female profes-sional traditions. The British National Sound Archive houses recordings by Tajiniso, a famous female Sufi performer, whose semi-classical and folk pieces on the Dutar were recorded in 1906 by the British company, Gramophone.For some time, female actresses played the Dutar on stage in the Theatre of Musical Drama in Andijan (Ferghana Valley’s largest city), which was established in 1920. By 1997, the theatre had become moribund, but one old retired actress, Sharopat Ahmedova (b. 1907) still maintains her skill as a Dutar player. During my research on female Dutar players in 1996, she told me that all actresses were required to be Dutar players. The dramas were heavily interspersed with musical interludes, and some sections were purely musical, so the actresses sang and played the Dutar on stage.Various female professional performers from Ferghana became promi-nent. Muhtaram Azizova (1930–95) and Kimsanhan Ahmedova (b. 1942–2004) sang in the demanding improvisational style of Katta ashula or Jo’ranavoz, a classical genre from the Ferghana-Kokand court tradition (Photo 8). Jo’ranovoz, which is also a remnant of Sufi Zikr, is usually per-formed by two highly-skilled musicians singing alternate verses.The world of Uzbek music rests on many multifaceted ideas, myths, and legends, some of which hint at interesting connections between the Dutar and women or the female role. Uzbek musicians admit that the two long-necked-fretted lutes form the main basis of traditional music: the Tanbur,207 which has three strings and is played with a brass plectrum, and the Dutar. Their musical relationship is unequal, with the Tanbur as a dominant and leading instrument and the Dutar in an accompanying Chapter 08.indd 108Chapter 08.indd 10812/27/10 7:35:49 PM12/27/10 7:35:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"109MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND DANCErole. In the Uzbek system, the Dutar is the shadow of the Tanbur, and its follower and accompanist. It is equated with the female role, which entails being secluded and occupying a position in the background. The Dutar’s silk strings and soft whispering tone give it a gentle sound cor-responding with idealised expectations of female behaviour, whereas the Tanbur has a lower, louder, and brighter sound which equates with male dominance and authority.To a certain extent, the Tanbur and Dutar represent two prototypes of the same instrument. According to an Uzbek legend, the inventor of the Dutar was the Greek philosopher Aristotle, whose name, as Arastu, is well known in Uzbekistan. (He was the tutor of Alexander the Great, who conquered the lands of Central Asia in 330–27 BCE.) Ryhzhon Hojahanov, a well-known Tashkent Dutar-maker, recounted the legend to me.208The story says that Aristotle’s teacher Plato invented the Tanbur, which he often played for his own pleasure. He kept his invention secret, jeal-ously hiding it from the world, and he would play it for hours in the privacy of his terrace. However, the Tanbur’s wondrous sounds attracted the attention and curiosity of his pupil Aristotle, who approached the house in search of a clue about the instrument’s identity. There he saw a vivid shadow of the performer and instrument. With the imprint of this image in his mind, Aristotle attempted to reproduce the instrument – with Photo 8: Famous Dutar performer Kimsanhan AhmedovaChapter 08.indd 109Chapter 08.indd 10912/27/10 7:35:50 PM12/27/10 7:35:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"110FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMa pear-shaped body and long neck along, on which were stretched the strings. However, this resulted in a totally new instrument: the Dutar, with its slightly larger body and softer voice.This myth of origin alludes to the master–pupil role209 and the idealised submissiveness and respect of the pupil for his master. We may detect an implied equation between the Dutar and the female role, which respects male authority. The relationship between the Tanbur and Dutar corre-sponds with idealised notions about masculinity and femininity, according to which men lead and women follow.The evidence for the mystical origin of the Dutar is reflected in other local myths and legends, such as the following.210 Once upon a time, Hazrat-Ali (a cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad) noticed that his favourite horse Dyul-Dyul was gradually getting sicker and sicker, and he became increasingly worried. One day, entering the stables he noticed that his groom Baba Kambar was playing a strange instrument – a long-necked lute. Seeing that he had been caught in action, Baba-Kambar was so fright-ened that he wanted to break the instrument into pieces, but Hazrat-Ali stopped him and asked what kind of instrument it was. Baba-Kambar told him that he had made the Dutar out of the mulberry tree but that the instrument was voiceless. Then Baba-Kambar called for devil’s help who given the Dutar this beautiful voice. After that, the Dutar acquired the intriguing/evoking/haunting voice that had made the horse sick.211 In dif-ferent sources, Baba-Kambar appears also as the inventor of Dutar or even as a female saint (Kambar-Ana).212According to another legend, Plato wanted to invent the instrument with sounds like a peacock wings. He investigated the nature of that sacred bird’s wings and then made the Dutar, which sounded amazingly mysteri-ous, similar to the sounds of her wings.213An example from female repertoire of the Ferghana Valley area is the tune called Chertmak, played in 2/4 rhythm. Chertmak is a general name for plucked lutes in Central Asia. In southern regions of Kyrgyzstan, the lute, Komuz, is also called Chertmak. In translation, chert means to flick or to snap, producing a sharp cracking sound. Chertmak is a piece where the main beat (Usul ) provides the colour, tempo, and energy of that particular character of music. The melody gives you a sense of direction, the flow of energy distributed through each stage: beginning, development, culmination, and recapitulation. Usul’s energetic beats echo the energy of a dance, which could be associated with Shamanic performance.Chapter 08.indd 110Chapter 08.indd 11012/27/10 7:35:50 PM12/27/10 7:35:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"111MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND DANCEThe repetitive melody ascending in fourths, with short phrases leading with dynamic development towards the culmination. Suddenly, in the middle of the flow of music, the soloist strikes the wood of the Dutar’s belly with a lightning effect. It sounds as if drums are interrupting the lute’s performance. Such alternation of string sounds and percussion sounds, performed on the same instrument, brings extreme power to this piece of music. So, as we see from this analysis, even the Dutar, with its gentle and tender sound, can at times become emotionally dynamic and expressive.We also find associations between the Dutar and the female role in poetry. The early nineteenth-century Sufi woman poet, Uvaysiy, evokes this relationship in a ghazal about the sorrow of separation. In the first and principal line of the poem (which is constantly repeated in performance), she refers to the traditional pairing of the Dutar with the Tanbur:Manga chertgan dutor chogiChalib tanbur qachon kelgaiTo me, who plays the Dutar,when will he who plays the tanbur come? 214The passivity of the female role is expressed in the idea of the woman wait-ing for her loved one. The romantic notion of the appropriate pairing of musical instruments (that will play together) is also implied.The early twentieth-century author Abdulhamid Cholpan (whose novel is mentioned above) was also a poet. He makes an analogy between the fate of an Uzbek woman, imprisoned within the four walls of her house, and the sorrowful sounds of the Dutar, whose music itself is limited within the range of two strings.Men dutor gberlan tug’ungan, kuhna bir devonamanUl tug’ushgonim bilan utda doim yenamanDallarida g’am tula bechoralarga yermanVaqti hush g’amkurmaganlardan tamon bezormanI [a woman] was born to be like a Dutar, with restlessness inside meWe burn with the same flickering flameI try to find a place to hide my sorrowBut my pain is endless: every note I play reflects it.215The Dutar underwent significant changes in image and musical role dur-ing the early Soviet period of the 1930s. Instead of playing traditional Sufi Chapter 08.indd 111Chapter 08.indd 11112/27/10 7:35:50 PM12/27/10 7:35:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"112FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMmusic, musicians were expected to adopt an optimistic style, playing new pieces that expressed Soviet values, which ran counter to the melancholic and spiritual ethos of Uzbek classical music.Sovietisation brought revolutionary changes to Uzbek musical and social life, and the authority in Central Asia has always emphasised the emancipa-tion of women as an extension of the aspirations of the October Revolution. In Uzbekistan, there was a dramatic rise in female education and women were incorporated into the paid workforce. A positive outcome for women was the fact that female professional musicians felt encouraged to become poets. In Ferghana, several women musicians – Lutfihonim Sarymsakova, Mehro Abdullaeva, and Bashorat Hojaeva – sang the poetry of Mukimy, accompanying themselves on their Dutars. Another musician, Mavluda Agzamova, sang pieces by the female poets Toshmapulat and Furkat.216 But at the same time Mavluda Agzamova was a singer who maintained the Sufi tradition of playing Dutar and singing Sufi songs throughout the whole Soviet period. Archives of the Uzbek State Radio house her recordings of Sufi songs such as Topmadim (Couldn’t find), Munojot (Ascend to God), among many others.The new Soviet cultural policy favoured popular art on a large scale. According to the Communist slogan, art should be ‘taken out of narrow national confines and opened to boundless internationalism’. The gov-ernment encouraged female music-making, and female Dutar ensembles were created. However, these new ensembles were quite out of charac-ter with Dutar traditions. The Dutar’s silk strings were replaced by nylon ones, which were stronger and gave a louder, brighter sound, but the silk-stringed Dutar’s spirit and distinctive sound was lost.Male musicians appointed by Communist authorities implemented the new Soviet policy. They recruited inexperienced girls to project an image of female emancipation, regardless of their musical talent. These girls were taught to play the Dutar in a class, playing in unison and reading from sheet music. This had never been done before, and these innovations eliminated the traditional improvisational style. Sometimes, when official performances were prepared at short notice, the musical director might give the girls a simple Russian melody such as an easy Svetit Mesyats for balalaika to play within these ensembles, sightreading from the sheet music.217For local audiences, the results were musically unsatisfactory. As men-tioned in Chapter 1, commenting on the first Uzbek women’s Dutar ensemble, formed in 1939, the leading Uzbek musicologist Ilyas Akbarov Chapter 08.indd 112Chapter 08.indd 11212/27/10 7:35:50 PM12/27/10 7:35:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"113MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND DANCEremarked: ‘Most of the girls had [only] a very vague idea of their instru-mental technique.’218 In fact, the technique was that of the balalaika, not the Dutar. Suddenly, the Dutar was expected to be loud and artificially lively, and its soft and lyrical nature was completely destroyed.Across the Soviet Union, similar innovations were taking place, with the development of massed instrumental ensembles and the recruitment of female performers to create an image of emancipation. Later, in the 1950s, the Dutar underwent further reconstruction and innovation. In line with the expectations of his Soviet masters, the professor of Tashkent State Conservatory of Music, Ashot Petrosyants, tried to adapt Uzbek tra-ditional musical instruments for use in Western-style symphony orches-tras. A family of four different-sized Dutars was created, paralleling the orchestral string family of violin, viola, cello, and double bass, but this experiment did not gain popularity.The situation changed for the better in 1972, when the Tashkent State Conservatory established its department of Oriental Music, whose aim was to revive Uzbek traditional styles, free from outside influences. The eminent Uzbek musician, performer, composer, and teacher, Fahriddin Sadykov, who was brought up in a Sufi musical tradition (his name means Pride of Faith), was appointed to teach the Maqam repertoire on the Dutar. For the first time, girls were accepted as students of the Maqam, learning classical Uzbek Sufi music and performing on authentic instruments (rather than the new ones with their different sizes and nylon strings).One of these students from the Ferghana area, Malika Ziyeyeva (b. 1955), became a celebrated performer, teacher, and innovator of Dutar traditions in her own right.219 Malika Ziyeyeva has made many recordings as a soloist, both with the State Radio of Uzbekistan and with the Moscow Recording Company, Melodia, who awarded her a Golden Recording Disk (Photo 9). Her recordings include pieces from the Sufi Maqam repertoire, which she learnt from Professor Sadykov, and many of her own arrangements of folk tunes.In 1991, she began teaching at the Tashkent State Conservatory, and there she founded the only existing female Dutar ensemble not only in Uzbekistan but in the whole of Central Asia. This ensemble has much more in common with the traditional image and repertoire of the Dutar. Ziyeyeva has revived the old traditional repertoire enriched with soft and delicate ornamentations and decorations of the Ferghana performance style. Her ensemble is not commercial and it does not really perform in public.

Sometimes you can hear the music of the universe throughout its tender harmonics. Also as your colleagues-musicians claim you can keep it playing while you sleep! They swear they heard me snoring and playing at the same time! The most spiritual piece of Dutar music related to the old Sufi tradition is certainly Tanovar where the weeping sound set on regular rhythm is reminiscent of the inhale/outhale breathing nature of Sufi Zikr.’220The image of the Dutar is very important not only because it signifies a female presence in local music culture but also because the instrument is of the highest importance in the local cultural identity. As the most popu-lar Uzbek musician in Afghanistan, Usto Gafar Qamolitdin (1908–2008), had claimed ‘Nothing in Uzbek culture could be done without a Teacher! My Usto [teacher] was Sadreddin, Shogird [pupil] of legendary musician Sadyrhon from the court of the Emir of Bukhara. I received my Nohun [a Tanbur plectrum made of silver and iron] from my Usto, who in turn Photo 9: Shavkat Mirzaev’s ensemble with Malika Ziyeyeva (Dutar)Chapter 08.indd 114Chapter 08.indd 11412/27/10 7:35:51 PM12/27/10 7:35:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"115MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND DANCEreceived his Nohun from Usto Sadyrhon. I was so happy to get it! Today I have none to pass it on.’ During my interview with him in October 2006, he said: ‘What kind of Uzbek are you if you don’t play Dutar ?’It has become apparent that the very image of the Uzbek was always associated with music-making skills and the ability to play the classical traditional instruments like Dutar. The Dutar performance was con-sidered the genuine proof of ‘Uzbekness’. Certainly, music for Afghani Uzbeks was, and is, much more important than for Uzbeks from the motherland, when, owing to political changes, music was an oasis, or an intangible cultural heritage that kept the national identity alive. However, one should not underestimate the fact that even in mainland Uzbekistan, the Dutar’s presence helps to maintain that culture, and continues to be played by both men and women. Women in particular helped to preserve the national identity!32. DANCES IN CENTRAL ASIAN CULTUREAnother important function of Daf and Doira instruments playing Usul comes out in Sufi Zikrs and dances based on Sufi Zikr.

Sufi rituals had compulsory closing danc-ing sessions, with the length of the dancing session being dependent on the brotherhood. But many Central Asian Sufi rituals have been built up on extensive ecstatic dances to close the ceremony (Qadiriyya, Yassaviya, Naqshbandiyya).221 Although there were no sophisticated elements of dancing involved, massive crowds of whirling people (up to 10,000 in Turkestan, even at the beginning of the twentieth century) arranged in circles, became a prominent feature of religious dancing.One should say that alongside the Sufi or religious dances there also existed other forms, like dances in the women’s gatherings, as well as the so-called bacha (boy) dances. Descriptions of these are recorded in the works by Jadid writers at the beginning of twentieth century. In his novel Kecha va Kunduz (Day and Night) Abdulhamid Cholpan describes a young ladies’ gathering where the heroine Zebi plays the Dutar while other girls are dancing. Another famous Uzbek writer and philosopher Fitrat in his novel The Indian Traveller depicts a dancing performance of a bacha, who was a subject of paedophilia – a phenomenon which still exists in Northern Afghanistan. The dance of the bacha is also mentioned much earlier in Ba’daul Voqea’ by Zayniddin Vasifi (sixteenth century).When the Soviets invaded Central Asia, dance as a meaningful form of music was used to express the joy of new social system. New groups were quickly built up, even where there was no precedent in the previous history of these republics. One should point out that the majority of dances in modern-day Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are performed by women. ‘Today national dances of Uzbekistan are almost always female’ noticed Mary Masayo Doi, emphasising that for traditional Muslim society it is not at all common. In that case, ‘why and how did unveiled female dancers become a beloved national icon during the Soviet period?.’222 Well-known and later world-famous, Bahor, a female dance group from Uzbekistan, became an icon of the new happy life, though, historically, public female dancing was not established in this culture.Female ensemble Bahor (spring season) was the most famous dancing institution in the history of Uzbekistan and Central Asia. Created in 1957 by choreographer Mukaram Turgunbaeva in response to a request from Moscow, Bahor became the first female dance group in the history of the area. This art was characterised by an emotional sense of joie de vivre, reflecting the main spirit of the socialist age: the inspiration of collectivisa-tion, the admiration of mass art, the beauty of the youth, and dynamic Chapter 08.indd 116Chapter 08.indd 11612/27/10 7:35:52 PM12/27/10 7:35:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"117MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND DANCEenergy. Its repertoire was created by highly professional choreographers and bastaqor (composer), Muhammedjan Mirzaev using styles and tunes deeply rooted in local ancient traditions. As a result, an outstanding success followed the group from its very inception. Later, despite the ‘iron curtain’, Bahor became the only musical group from that area to tour abroad.In the style of Bahor’s dances one can, today, detect the connection with traditional Sufi dances and whirling experience.Since Central Asian republics gained Independence the Sufi tradition of dances has been reborn both in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Folk dance ensembles, like Boysun or Falak are now performing Zikrs on the stage. Some Sufi female dances like Larzon (trembling), Ufori Qalabandi (fra-grance imprisoned in the castle), Orom (meditation), Ufori chillyaki (fra-grance of ascetic 40 days), and Ey dilbari jononim (O, my beauty) have been restored, all of them accompanied by Daf/Doira. Only the names of some movements reveal the link with previous Sufi dancing traditions. So, for example, tiny decorative movements from Ferghana dances called Mukomlar, consist of: Qarsaklar (clapping), Barmoq qirsillatish (finger snapping), Quldasta Titrama (hands trembling), Quldasta ailanish (wrists turning), Qyig’ir bo’yin (neck movements), Iyak h’arakati (chin move-ments), Elka qoqish (shoulder movements), Elka titrama (shoulder shak-ing), Gavda tibranishi (body movements), and so on. So, the shadow of Sufism has affected present culture in its rich use of dancing forms in daily life and celebrations.Chapter 08.indd 117Chapter 08.indd 11712/27/10 7:35:52 PM12/27/10 7:35:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"1189Female Folk Sufism33. FEMALE RELIGIOUS PRACTICESThere is a well-known metaphor to the effect that, in all things, a woman is the keeper of the home fire. One can assume that the roots of this saying lie in the far distant past, when men would leave the camp to hunt and women stayed behind to keep the precious embers of the hearth alive. But, of course, the metaphor is meant to indicate the role played by women in many aspects of society – family tradition, rituals, and ceremonies con-nected with the major rites of passage. The question is: to what extent has this behavioural archetype changed in today’s world, with respect to culture and ritual?Human history gives us many examples of ‘staying behind’, that is, of those occasions at different times and in different places when women have provided help and support for the community while remaining exclud-ing from the historical records. Women’s names are rarely mentioned in the great historical enterprises, ranging from the discovery of America to the conquest of the Poles, or outer space, and precious few women’s names are represented in the annals of any sensational scientific revelation. No wonder that the role of women in maintaining cultural tradition is still so poorly documented in relation to the history of art and music.Our research until now has shown the same trends in the Sufi history of Central Asia and particularly in its most Muslim areas – Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. With regard to female Sufi rituals, I shall concentrate initially on Uzbekistan, and then show similarities in other Muslim areas of Central Asia separately.We begin by looking at the lives of women in the most traditional and densely-populated part of Uzbekistan, the Ferghana Valley, which is situated south-east of Tashkent, the capital city. It covers some 80,000 square kilometres where the three newly independent states of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan meet. Between 9 and 10 million people live Chapter 09.indd 118Chapter 09.indd 11812/27/10 7:36:18 PM12/27/10 7:36:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"119FEMALE FOLK SUFISMthere, and families are extremely large, as a rule. The Ferghana Valley has always had the highest birthrate, not just in Uzbekistan, but of the former Soviet Union. (The increase in population in rural areas there in 1991, for example, was about 34 people for every 1,000.) Almost the entire popula-tion is Muslim.Figure 3 gives some information about the daily life in rural areas and particularly in the Ferghana Valley. It compares the positions of men and women in different aspects of human activity.As one can see, the position of women in Uzbekistan as a whole is much more restricted and dependent than that of men. It is a tradition, in rural areas, that when a girl graduates from her school she is expected to get mar-ried almost immediately. The wave of weddings in the villages starts mainly in summer – straight after the end of spring term.

In these circumstances, when the educational level of the rural population is rather low (only 80 out of every 1,000 village residents are known to have received higher education), these views are quite common.The same attitude is shown with regard to paid employment. What is the point in having a job if you are going to be the slave of your husband?223 This view is widely held among the women in the Ferghana Valley as well as in other places in Uzbekistan. So women are deprived of the opportu-nity (or even lack the will) to work and to be independent.This sense of dependence becomes stronger when we turn to the domain of religion. The mosques of Central Asia have no place for women – the presence of women in the mosques is still prohibited. Female worship can only take place at home. So, men and women are segregated even at the time of religious rites. One might say that Uzbek men and women follow different paths in both daily and spiritual life.The general attitude to women in Uzbekistan differs strongly from that in the West. In pre-Revolution society it was prescribed that outside the home a woman should keep her face and figure hidden under some sort of cover. Through the whole of Central Asia women wore a kind of cloak called parandja, covering their faces with netting.224 Nowadays the situa-tion has changed a little. But, generally, women play a subordinate role and are still viewed as less important, and less respected than men.225Although the policy of the Uzbek government involves placing women as deputies to the governors at each level, the position of women in ordinary Uzbek families, particularly in rural areas, is unenviable. On the surface everything is calm but underneath discrimination is rife. Medieval attitudes within society stimulate patriarchal relationships within the family. There are some regions where, when a woman gets mar-ried and starts living with her husband’s family, she is not even permitted to speak aloud to any of her in-laws. She is doomed to be like a dumb person, merely indicating by signs or nods of the head if she agrees or disagrees. So, even though she lives with her husband’s family, and may meet members of a usually numerous community every day, she should give no sign of having a voice! Obviously, she is not allowed to express her opinion or her wishes at any important decision-making gathering in the family.226The only place where Uzbek women have a right of presence or can join men is at a wedding party or feast, called To y. Here they all participate, but, Chapter 09.indd 120Chapter 09.indd 12012/27/10 7:36:18 PM12/27/10 7:36:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"121FEMALE FOLK SUFISMnonetheless, they have to sit in separate places. Sometimes To y takes place at two different houses: the bride’s house and the house of her neighbours. Then women fill one house and men another. They seem to be together, but in reality they are separate.Another occasion where women are able to go and to be on their own is gap (talking) – gatherings for close friends and members of community. Usually these take place on special occasion, like returning from Hajj (reli-gious pilgrimage) and so on. In that case, women meet together in the house of the hostess of the festivities and celebrate the occasion by sitting around the dastarkhan (a tablecloth on the floor), having a meal and chat-ting. But, of course, women here are usually separated from men, who have their own gap.These detailed explanations about different social positions are neces-sary in order for Western readers to appreciate the essence of being an Uzbek woman. This division is the basis of many special religious rites and part of the conditions of being a woman in the Ferghana Valley. One should point out that the Ferghana Valley is not an exclusive place, where women are treated as second-class creatures. Women’s lifestyle in many parts of the world involves absolute isolation from the outside world and complete focus on husband, children, and family duties. This, according to psychologists, results in a need to find an emotional release, and con-sequently engagement in escapist activities. Common forms of so-called escape include the assumption of roles in domestic amateur drama, and listening to tales about those who have passed away, thus transferring the listener into the world of myths and fairytales, legends and miracles. The escape to another, fictional dimension is vital for mental relaxation, allow-ing women to avoid the stresses of daily life. But can this reason be the only one for the continuing involvement of women in ritual; mythical, imaginative worlds conjured up by performance?Another, according to scientific opinion, is that women’s emotional domain is greater than that of men, and, being more developed and sensi-tive, it requires constant maintenance, which involves a considerable effort of regeneration. Performance is one of the ways to act out accumulated concerns and problems – to act out another life for a short while. Thus, it represents one of the ways of replenishing one’s emotional resources and achieving psychological balance.This explains the psychological inclination of women to perform in artistic genres – singing, drama, and mystical forms of reading and spells, various kinds of stage display – thus strengthening the connection between Chapter 09.indd 121Chapter 09.indd 12112/27/10 7:36:18 PM12/27/10 7:36:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"122FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMtheir daily life and the spiritual world. One could say that, indeed, women have carried on playing the role of guardians of cultural heritage owing to their biologically-predetermined capacity as child-bearers and nest-defenders, and their historical experience. It is well known from history that women always followed their men. In exploring the world and in the conquest of new geographical spaces men were the pioneers, and the first to arrive, with the women following on bringing the children and domes-tic possessions. Thus did the ‘tradition’ itself trail behind the conquerors, carried by those cultural pack-horses, the women of the society, who had in the storage bags of their imaginations the necessary lifestyles, customs, habits, and rituals of daily life.The traditional Muslim household in Uzbekistan is divided into two separate parts: tashqari, the outer, male part and ichkari, the inner, female one. Historically, a woman’s life in a Muslim family was spent in this sepa-rate part of the house. Ichkari is off-limits to strangers, with entry strictly limited to family members, relatives, and children. Males from outside the family are never allowed to enter the ichkari. It is a separate world with its own rules, traditions, and life. This isolation of the female part of the household has played a crucial role in preserving and maintaining religious traditions, which have been mostly lost in the more exposed male part of the society. During my fieldwork I have met women who have never ven-tured beyond their ichkari, who have spent all their lives behind the high clay walls, bringing up their children. Usually, the ichkaris of one house-hold are interconnected with those of the neighbours, and so the female part of the society lives a hidden life, moving from one house to the whole village. This spatial phenomenon reflects an ancient order of gender segre-gation. Scholars have associated it with the old arrangement in palaces, where the harems were always situated at the back of the buildings, hid-den from strangers and guests. The harems of the Akhemenid rulers’ pal-aces ( seventh to thirteenth centuries) provided the template for the later establishment of separate male and female quarters within Islamic palaces. The female area was where many women developed their performance and poetic skills.227This same structural division survives today in Uzbek and Tajik house-holds, even through the times of different rulers and ideologies. Every household in Uzbekistan, particularly in rural areas, still follows the Tashkari/Ichkari division, with the Ichkari remaining as an inner sanctum that is at the very heart of the house (Figure 4).Chapter 09.indd 122Chapter 09.indd 12212/27/10 7:36:18 PM12/27/10 7:36:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"123FEMALE FOLK SUFISMIchkari was off-limits to strangers. Entry was strictly confined to the family members only, as well as relatives and children. In this fashion, women lived in an enclosed environment, subject to few outside influences.So, under Soviet influence, the numerous prohibitions resulted in the creation of a very refined and highly hierarchical cultural environ-ment, where the present and the past were tightly interwoven, by pro-viding points of contact for the levers of protest. And maybe for this reason, the flow of modern life still continues in the manner of past times. Every step taken today is taken cautiously, with a backward look, as if today’s world were only an approximation of the truths and lessons learnt yesterday.Alongside the metaphorical substitution of religion for everyday cul-ture, reflecting also on the female environment, the culture of Islam was, nevertheless, being not only preserved and maintained, but also passed down to the children, in the relatively undisturbed environment behind the walls of Ichkari.The life of women developed in this enclosed environment, subject to few outside influences.

If we remind ourselves that even nowadays, in regions such as Khorezm in the South–West of Uzbekistan, in a perfectly urban environment, a daughter-in-law has no right to voice her concerns and even if asked something is only allowed to indicate her consent by nodding, little remains to be said about the place of women in the past.One can only appreciate the scope of the culture of the women’s world in the traditional society of Central Asia by looking at it from the outside. They possess their own school of life, passed down from grandmothers to children and grandchildren; their own school of religion, practised purely in the confines of their homes, similarly passed down from old to young; their own perceptions of the history and development of the world; and their own specific music and song. So, on one hand, there is the influence exerted on these rites by the Muslim tradition (some containing reflected Sufi forms), while on the other, their integration into domestic life provides convincing historical proof that they have emerged as exam-ples of practices related to the rites of passage (Gennep 1960), which have incorporated the old, traditional rites as their major components.Women played a crucial role in maintaining the Sufi tradition through-out the Soviet period. The Bolsheviks were determined to create an atheistic world; therefore, Islam was seen by them as the most reaction-ary ideology and Muslims were persecuted, under various slogans such as fighting Basmachis and later as Enemies of the People. As a result, almost all Mullahs, Ishans, Sufis, and any clerics or religiously-learned people were either killed or sent to the camps of the Gulag. Some managed to flee the country. Women were less exposed and vulnerable towards this Bolshevisation, so they kept the religious traditions of their families, pass-ing the sacred knowledge to their children. It was a kind of ‘reflected’ Islam, ‘ref lected’ Sufism; and music played a very important role in main-taining the religious rituals and traditions. The most interesting fact is that, even today, the whole of traditional culture finds itself largely in the hands of women. The reason for this is not only because of Islam, with its division of the world into the categories of all things male and female, but also to some extent the original turn of history involving numerous prohibitionist regulations and persecutions enforced by the politics of the Soviet regime. So, for instance, it was one was simply not allowed to speak one’s native language in public places, to believe in God or even in spirits generally, to carry out prayers, or in any Chapter 09.indd 124Chapter 09.indd 12412/27/10 7:36:18 PM12/27/10 7:36:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"125FEMALE FOLK SUFISMway to identify your world outlook as different from the one prescribed by the Soviet regime.However, since the Bolshevist politics of the Soviet Union could only offer brash slogans of the kind ‘All the Power to Soviets!’, ‘Communism is Our Bright Future’, or ‘Let Us Proudly Fulfil the Five-Year Plan!’, as a substitute, and since these slogans were unrepresentative of reality and far removed from the essence of people’s everyday lives, they actually assisted in pushing the boundaries of common reality towards a surreal existence. As a result, it seemed as if the world was turned into a realm of subtext and underlying meanings. Under Soviet influence, the common pronunciation of Allah’s name was replaced with a mental remembrance of His name.Thus, in spite of the changes in social structure and disruption of social life on a vast scale in Central Asia, it is apparent that the foundations and influence of the old culture and the traditions were stronger and more solid than those innovations of new socialist growth.History has recorded numerous occasions when secluded societies of any kind – religious, economically undeveloped as well as those in need of political intervention, or experiencing crisis situations – became hosts to spontaneously formed groups of psychological supporters among their members. As a rule, a hierarchical network arises within these groups, with the power ending up in the hands of the strongest. In female societ-ies a similar trend can be observed in many different parts of the world, where an aged woman is usually chosen as head of the group on account of her experience and knowledge of all things mystical and religious – knowledge which, in conditions of a state ban on religion, is equivalent to mysticism. The dissemination of this knowledge takes place, as a rule, on domestic occasions, in the semi-public sphere, in the form of collective singing, representation of scenes from religious and histori-cal heritage and appeals to the spirits of ancestors. Where bans exist on religious and spiritual rites, in some secluded societies, these are often transformed into artistic phenomena, marking the birth of rituals. In Uzbekistan, these women who lead the Way (even in Sufi terms), are called Otin-Oys.34. OTIN-OY AS FEMALE SUFI PIR228The etymology of the word Otin-Oy is unclear. The term may have origi-nated from the Chagatay word Hotin (khâtin) meaning ‘schoolteacher’ but a more descriptive explanation would be desirable, as Chagatay and Chapter 09.indd 125Chapter 09.indd 12512/27/10 7:36:18 PM12/27/10 7:36:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"126FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMUzbek languages are almost identical. However, in Uzbek, Hotin means only ‘woman’ or ‘wife’. Hence, one can assume that this term represents an amalgamation of two different words, for example, Ohun(c) Hotin or Ota-Ona-Hotin. Here Ohun means ‘the educated’, whereas Ota means ‘father’ or, at the same time, ‘holy person’. The second part of term, Hotin stands for ‘woman’ or ‘wife’. So, presumably, Otin-Oy could signify the particular woman who is spiritual leader of community, sometimes, Otin-buwy (Otin – ‘granny’ in Uzbek) or Otincha (pet-name). In modern translation this means ‘religiously educated woman’, a kind of female Mullah.Normally they are descendants of mullâ and qârî, people who were trained in religious schools and who have studied the Qur’an in a thor-ough manner. These women are held in great esteem in times of both trouble and peace. On weekdays or on holidays, the Otin-Oys are wel-comed in each family and in every house. They give help, support, or advice to anyone who needs it. They perform ancient rituals in a music and poetic form, which ‘comment’ on the occasion that is to take place. Generally, Otin-Oys are invited at each important stage in life (birth, marriage, and death) or to numerous dates celebrated in the Muslim calendar. They sanctify each event by performing spiritual songs and incantations.Who, then, are the Otin-Oys in Uzbekistan? Very often they are secu-larly uneducated women. Nevertheless, from the point of view of social life, they are the upholders of a spiritual and religious knowledge, which is accessible only to chosen people, the descendants of a spiritual social stratum. Though suppressed by the Communists, they remained under-ground for almost 70 years, but continued to be held in great esteem by the local population.229Where do they come from? As mentioned above, female activity in Central Asia and Uzbekistan, particularly, was rigidly separated from that of the male. However, there is historical evidence of women participating in the development of Sufism in these lands. Many female Sufis are named in written sources of the Middle Ages. For instance, some were mentioned by Abd al-Rahman Djami (fifteenth century) in his book of biographies of famous Sufis.230According to some historical sources, the tradition of storytelling, and educational narrative, were widely performed during the time of Tamerlane the Great. For example, kissakhons (narrators) were highly ranked in his Palaces with sayids (scholars), historians, astronomers, and doctors. Also Chapter 09.indd 126Chapter 09.indd 12612/27/10 7:36:18 PM12/27/10 7:36:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"127FEMALE FOLK SUFISMfavourably estimated were readers of Qur’an (Khofizs), preachers (Voiz) and interpreters of the Prophet’s sayings (Muhaddis). He also respected poetry (Sherkhonlik). The best of them he maintained in his Palaces.231 One might conclude that, today, many genres in Otin-Oy’s repertoire are related to the former court tradition of storytelling, educational narratives, and entertainment.As a rule, Otin-Oys are middle-aged or older women of unstained repu-tation, who are valiant mothers and wives. In country life, Otin-Oys are without exception participants at all major events and happenings in family life and in village life as a whole. However, their activity is strictly restricted to the women’s sphere. As a rule, they are invited only into Ichkari – the women’s half of the house. The appearance and lifestyle of Otin-Oy is, in other respects, the same as that of everyone else. It is not easy to distinguish an Otin-Oy in a crowd. The only distinguishing feature is the traditional item of clothing called Oq Rumol, a large white head scarf which is to be worn during ritual per-formance. Obviously, the question arises – is any Uzbek girl or young woman able to become an Otin-Oy, and what are the requirements? Also, how do they earn the right to become an Otin-Oy ? In order to become an Otin-Oy one must fulfil the following conditions: 1) to have come from a religious family of a Mullah, or to have experi-enced a difficult destiny, for example, being widowed early in life, or having a handicapped child;2) to possess the required religious knowledge, such as knowledge of the Qur’an, and to be religiously observant – keeping all Muslim holidays and following laws and prohibitions dictated by Islam;3) to have musical and performing/acting talents such as the ability to express emotions well, a good voice and a good ear for music, including good communication skills and cheerfulness, which are also important qualities;4) to possess poetic skills – sometimes this allows for creative work, such as composing poems for particular occasions;5) to have a pleasant appearance or good looks, and woman’s natu-ral charm – often Otin-Oys are physically strong and naturally healthy;Chapter 09.indd 127Chapter 09.indd 12712/27/10 7:36:18 PM12/27/10 7:36:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"128FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISM6) to have received a specified level of training from an older Otin-Oy. This is considered to be the main requirement which must be fulfilled in order to gain the right to become an independent Otin-Oy. Here we can see the traces of Sufi concept of silsilah or spiritual chain.A further stage of mastering the requirements of the Otin-Oy involves learning in the ‘school of life’, from one’s own married life and mother-hood, which is so necessary to gain the prestige and status of a respected woman in Uzbek society.Lastly, the final stage in obtaining the status of Otin-Oy is actually the start of this new independence – ‘going out into the world’, the begin-ning of practice. Often this happens after the Otin-Oy’s own children have grown up, thus releasing her from her parental duties and allowing some free time for her activity. At this point, there is at last, the opportunity to put knowledge into practice and improve her skill on a regular basis. As a rule, at this stage the newcomer Otin-Oy receives a blessing, Fatiha, from her spiritual teacher. Nowadays, along with other changing circumstances in Uzbekistan, the status of Otin-Oy has become somewhat fashionable. Many young women and girls in various parts of the country gained the right to receive religious education and become Otin-Oy. However, to become true Otin-Oy they will need to gain experience in the tough school of life, which will certainly take time. Otin-Oys, being the organisers and conductors of ritual ceremonies, are represented by members of the most aristocratic social circles in the per-ception of the villagers, namely individuals held in high esteem by the rest, holders of important posts and significant roles in the community. Their leadership and orchestration of the process thus projects the hierarchical composition of the ritual’s content onto the mass of participants in these gatherings, mirroring the structure of the ritual.The participants are divided into active members, with Otin-Oy as the focus of attention (where there is more than one present, the oldest and most respected occupies the central place), and passive observers, with the size of the audience depending on the time and nature of the event. How do they perform these rites? They sit down on the floor around the dastarkhan (a tablecloth on the floor set with traditional food and drinks). At first glance they appear to sit at random, but in fact they sit according Chapter 09.indd 128Chapter 09.indd 12812/27/10 7:36:18 PM12/27/10 7:36:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"129FEMALE FOLK SUFISMto a strictly observed order: the eldest woman sits opposite the door, in the centre of the circle. The women seated nearest to her are of similar age. After them come the younger women, with the last one – usually a young girl – sitting near the door. She brings the tea and some food for the Otin-Oy during the gathering. Naturally, that last place is the lowliest. One can see that this order illustrates the entire hierarchy of Uzbek women’s society. The same order exists for singing. The right to begin the singing belongs to the most respected woman, the main Otin-Oy. She starts and others follow.The chain of regularity of rituals characteristic of Sufi assemblies, taking place for instance every Thursday, was broken by Otin-Oy practices. This can be easily attributed to the restrictions experienced during Soviet times. On the other hand, the involvement of the Otin-Oy became an indispens-able accompaniment to every single significant occasion, no matter how big or small (the prom night, enrolment into the army); that is, it moved away from religion and drew closer to everyday life.The question which now arises is: what occasions do Otin-Oys mark with their chanting?232 In fact, every stage in life is supposed to be signified by the Otin-Oy’s performance, from the birth of a child, the beginning or end of every stage of child-rearing (teeth or hair growing/cutting, first sitting/walking, beginning of nursery or school attendance); the ritual of initiation for boys (Sunnat-Toy); meeting classmates after graduating; applying for, obtaining or leaving a job; betrothal, wedding, divorce; hospitalisation/discharge from hospital; death and mourning rituals; days of remembrance or commemoration. So, one can see that Otin-Oy appears at nearly every single situation in life.The role of the Otin-Oy in a female community consists of: 1) priestly function, when she performs all religious activity among women: however, in Central Asia in the absence of female mosques or opportunity for women to join communal prayers, the Otin-Oy’s responsibilities are not a complete substitute for the Imam in male congregation;2) master of ceremonies, whatever its nature (religious, rites of passage, calendar);3) teacher and role-model for young generations;4) the social authority, the leader in female community.Chapter 09.indd 129Chapter 09.indd 12912/27/10 7:36:18 PM12/27/10 7:36:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"130FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMOne can compare Otin-Oys in contemporary village life with psychoana-lysts. When someone is in trouble they are responsible for problem-solving, ‘negotiating’ with the Almighty, trying to support and to comfort their people. At the same time, Otin-Oys are remarkable public figures heading the social hierarchy, representing the upper level of society.35. HOW TO BECOME AN OTIN-OY: MALIKA ASQAROVA’S CASEDuring Soviet times the activity of Otin-Oys was considered illegal. For example, Otin-Oy Malika Asqarova (b. 1955) from Dudur village tells how, as a schoolgirl, she went to see an old Ruzi-Otincha, at night-time in order to learn the skills of O’qish (reading, i.e. performance). Nobody knew about these lessons except her parents. The lessons consisted of a set programme of learning, progressing from simple to more difficult reper-toire. The piece first learned was Salavat Assalomu, the prayer glorifying of the Prophet, and after that Haftiyak, 1/7 part of the text of Qur’an. Malika tells the story of her studies: ‘There were 32 of us pupils and we always sat in two lines. Ruzi-Otincha was more than eighty years old. We did not understand how old she was. We were very demanding pupils. . . She completely devoted herself to teaching. She gave us all her knowledge, certainly, free of charge. Sometimes we would sit at her home till 2 or 3 o’clock in the morning and would finish our lessons only when our angry parents came to pick us up. Every day we spent our free time at her home. She never told that she was sick and tired of us, she was a real saint. We continued to learn reading of Arabic texts, little by little we shifted to Haftiyak [see above], then we started to read Qur’an and then we went on to the Chahor kitob [Fourth book] and Ishan Bobo [Comprehensive religious books by Sufi Allahyar] (Photo 11). We learned pieces mostly by heart. Then I finished my studies, because I had to get married. In a few years’ time my mother-in-law asked me to continue my regular studies. . . I came back to Ruzi-Otincha, but she was very old at that time and having listened to my reading she said that I can practise now on my own. She told me: ‘Read regularly and when you are ready come here to see me to bless you and for initiation. And then you will become an independent Otin-Oy.’ Eventually I was blessed by Ruzi-Otincha. And now I read. Sky is the limit as they say.’233Later, Malika Asqarova herself started to teach others. Initially her neighbours asked her to teach their daughter, and then others brought their Chapter 09.indd 130Chapter 09.indd 13012/27/10 7:36:18 PM12/27/10 7:36:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"131FEMALE FOLK SUFISMchildren. So she put together a group of ten pupils. Some of them were from the families of Otin-Oys, others were just very eager to learn. Now she has plenty of religiously-educated pupils in the area. Malika’s grand-mother could read as well and Malika remembers many pieces like Dediyo and others from her childhood. Nevertheless, the ultimate polishing of her knowledge she definitely received from Ruzi-Otincha. So we can see that among the Otin-Oys there are two types: those who have great knowledge of religion and rich practice in rituals, and who perform on a regular basis, and those who practise but who also pass this knowledge to their pupils. Their role has its equivalent in the Murshids in Sufi orders. Apart from for their knowledge, they are respected for their pure and almost holy way of life (Photo 12).Otin-Oys occasionally include reading and practising outside the sphere of ‘sacred’ knowledge. That is why, for example, Malika Asqarova went to Ruzi-Otincha to study, rather than to her own grandmother, who was also able to read the Qur’an. One important aspect should be pointed out: apparently there is a kind of silsilah between teacher and pupil in the Otin-Oy’s practice similar to the chain between Murshid and Murid in the Sufi order, which is said to pass mystical knowledge from person to person. Despite the political and ideological changes during successive periods, in Photo 11: Classical poetry in Arabic script from Otin-Oys notebooksChapter 09.indd 131Chapter 09.indd 13112/27/10 7:36:18 PM12/27/10 7:36:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"132FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMmodern Uzbekistan the Otin-Oy’s chain has maintained sacred religious knowledge among the women of Uzbekistan. As we showed above, some-times this knowledge has been received from Sufi persons, either women or men.Once in Dudur village, it was suggested that I should meet the young girl Nodira who was learning how to become an Otin-Oy. She had a really beautiful voice. She recited a few examples which she had learned from her teacher. I noted their musical simplicity. They sounded like the skeleton of future incantations with a simple tune developed on the basis of three or four notes. In fact, her example seemed more of a recitation than a musical piece from the professional Otin-Oy repertoire with their long- and well-developed patterns.However, training in the professional skills of the Otin-Oy depends not only on purely musical or vocal gifts but also on devotion to the chosen Photo 12: Otin-Oy Malika AsqarovaChapter 09.indd 132Chapter 09.indd 13212/27/10 7:36:19 PM12/27/10 7:36:19 PM"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"133FEMALE FOLK SUFISMprofessional path. Not everyone could devote oneself to an Otin-Oy’s life. Recently, I was invited to meet a young Otin, Halida, living in Tashkent. I had heard she was about 17 years old and had a strong and beautiful voice. Under the pressure of her parents in early life she had been trained as an Otin-Oy. Her teacher was a famous Qory (Qur’an expert) from Ferghana, to whom she went regularly for lessons. The teacher and his student were of different ages and social positions. Moreover, they were not relatives. By Uzbek tradition they were not allowed to see each other’s faces, so they conducted the lessons separated by a curtain, with the teacher on one side and the student on the other. When I visited her, she started to sing assiduously, performing the stanzas one after another. Her voice was really impressive. But gradually I began to feel that she did not seem to be a really convincing Otin-Oy. Why? I tried to understand what was happening. I noticed that she became irritable and tense. She often looked at her watch. I understood she was in a hurry. ‘What is happening?’ I asked her mother, who sat next to me. ‘Sorry, she is in a hurry, because she is going to the swimming pool!’ Can you imagine an Otin-Oy, an eternally mysterious religious female image, with the modern look of a half-dressed woman’s body in a glamorous swimming pool? Later, I heard that she did not become an Otin-Oy. It turned out her destiny took another path. Recently, visiting the tiny city of Denau (South Eastern part of Uzbekistan), I found that the area’s lifestyle, city architecture, local traditions, social network, all reminded me of the Ferghana Valley (Photo 13). Carefully painted houses with tidy gardens were a distinctive feature, proving the presence of a settled population. In fact the difference between the close neighbouring townships of Boisun and Denau is quite remarkable: Boisun is an area of nomads whereas Denau is an agricultural area with a settled population. The Otin-Oy I was shortly introduced to, Mukkaram Halilova, was stunningly beautiful and looked so young that at first I doubted whether she ever had any appropriate training at all (Photo 14). However, it turned out she had. Her pure voice, emotional performance and her ability to perform rituals in a highly professional manner were very impressive. When I asked how old she was she explained that her training had been traditional and intensive. Mukkaram Halilova learned her professional skills from local Otin-Oy. Having four children, a husband and a number of family duties kept her very busy. The only excuse for her to go out was the obligations of the Otin-Oy. She helps people and people love her in return.

The purpose of that particular family ritual, with the popular Otin-Oy in attendance, was to mark the husband’s recent pro-motion (he had become the head of the local railway station). Otin-Oy Mukkaram was surrounded by a circle of friends and neighbours. She practised for a couple of hours, performing a large range of Suras and Ghazals, with rare taste and confidence, accordingly to her own prefer-ence and choice. Repetitions of rhythmical patterns, dynamic waves, and clear tone development were typical features of her style. After the session finished, I was invited to her place to continue my interview. Her unique voice, entire devotion and bright personality made this meeting with Otin-Oy Mukkaram Halilova unforgettable. So indeed there are no limits to the appearance of new, distinguished Otin-Oys in Uzbekistan.36. SUFI RITUALS LED BY OTIN-OYThe Ferghana Valley is today the most strictly Muslim area of Uzbekistan. Some of the rituals women perform there are songs and incantations prais-ing different historical figures. The very broad repertoire of the Otin-Oy includes some incantations devoted to the founders of different Sufi orders such as Qadiriyya, Naqshbandiyya, Yassaviya.234When you ask Otin-Oys about Tasavvuf (Sufism), some are very articu-late and can elaborate on it at length, others can barely understand this word. On examining their rituals, in some places, the essential elements of loud Zikr can definitely be found, and further investigation almost always reveals that one of their predecessors was from a family of Ishân (Sufi Sheikh), who followed and performed loud Zikr, reading the Hikmat of Ahmad Yassavî. However, modern Otin-Oys, particularly the most promi-nent stream from the Ferghana Valley, do not belong to any particular Tariqat, but hail from a mixture of various Sufi branches. There is prob-ably a simple explanation for this: as the wives of Ishâns from different Tariqats no particular one became dominant, but they just retained the principal manner of devotion to God, by gathering together to recite the Holy Qur’an. It is worth mentioning that today this huge number of incantations is performed as the proper stuff of performance without following the rules of a particular Sufi order. One can assume that there are several reasons for this. It is likely that modern female rites are mostly viewed as a broad collection of items for rituals consisting of different incantations and poetical works, in the style of Qur’anic qira’at (singing/reading) Chapter 09.indd 135Chapter 09.indd 13512/27/10 7:36:21 PM12/27/10 7:36:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"136FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMor tilâwat (singing/declamation). They were probably collected for different reasons, for example, their poetical and melodic beauty. In those lands where many Sufi orders have been found, from medieval times, female rites nowadays include a mixture of different parts of Sufi Zikrs, quite unlike the Zikr from centuries ago. One can say that Zikr might be a part of each special female meeting for certain religious or family events.Zikr was set as a part of devotional gathering. It could be a part of a funeral event, as I saw in Boisun – a series of prayers of increasing emotional intensity, culminating with weeping, alternating with the performance of ancient poetry. Otin-Oy Mutaborak-hola from the village of Butaqora (Andijan district) had performed the song, which is actually properly applied to the history of the Qadiriyya, Tawba tazarru (repentance). This was a glorification of the founder of the Hanafi Sunni mazhab – Ghavsul Aghzam (Ghawth al-A‘zam or Imâm ‘Abd al Hanîfa).

Bearing in mind that the number 11 was a holy number for Chapter 09.indd 136Chapter 09.indd 13612/27/10 7:36:21 PM12/27/10 7:36:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"137FEMALE FOLK SUFISMcertain Sufi orders, the use of 11 syllables was probably intentional.236 Even considering 11 as the common number of emphasised or accent syllables in Barmak – the folk system of poetry based on particular number of syl-lables – the question as to why that number of syllables was used could not be answered easily. All other songs from the Otin-Oy repertoire are addressed to other Sufi principals like Hasan, Hussein, Naqshband, and others have a totally different number of syllables. 37. ZIKRNowadays, Zikr in Central Asia are a mere residue of the old style of worship, and the passing of time has led to the transformation of ritu-als. They change not just in their inner development but also through external pressures, as in Uzbekistan. Today, they are only a shadow of the past, an enigmatic but a very essential shadow, melting in the vacillating image of time. They are a shadow not just in terms of their lost inten-sity, but also in the way they have been reflected by women who, dur-ing the Soviet suppression, were the only stratum of society that could maintain the Sufi tradition in the forms of rituals. Therefore, I call this form of female Sufism ‘reflective Sufism’.237 Innovations in the policy of modern independent Uzbekistan could lead to the revival and revision of Sufi tradition or, on the contrary, to its disappearance. But as we have seen, that tradition has the inner resources to survive, despite external pressures. Zikr is originally a Qur’anic word, commanding ‘remembrance of God’, and an act of devotion during and after a prayer. As Nikolay Lykoshin wit-nessed, in Tashkent in the beginning of the twentieth century, male Sufi Zikrs were carried out in two ways: Dashgariya Jahriya (aloud), and Hufiya (in silence).238 This act can be observed during the sessions of Otin-Oy. In 1992, I was an eyewitness at a gathering of several Otin-Oys in the very heart of the Ferghana Valley in Uzbekistan, in the village of Dudur in Andijan province. The reason for that gathering was very solemn – namely, the end of Ramadan. The very process of this gathering was full of ritual: the Otin-Oys arrived slowly and ceremoniously at the house of Otin-Oy Mutabarak-hola, a respected woman, the widow of the former chairman of the local kolkhoz (collective farm). All of them wore white shawls, which covered them fully, and were slow and graceful in their movements and in their speech as they sat around the dastarkhan. A short introductory conversation while drinking tea helped them to get into the mood of the O’qish, or ‘reading’. Otin-Oys chanted from the small Chapter 09.indd 137Chapter 09.indd 13712/27/10 7:36:21 PM12/27/10 7:36:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"138FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMbooks called Bayaz or Kulliyat (collection of religious or semi- religious texts with some Suras of the Qur’an, Islamic myths, and Sufi poems). A wide range of very different poetry was performed on that day: from Ahmad Yassavi (twelfth century), Mashrab (seventeenth century), Sufi Allahyar (seventeenth century), and some female poets, such as Nodira and Uvaysiy (both from the nineteenth century). Sometimes, Otin-Oys read their own poetry. The general name for these gatherings is O’qish (readings), although the texts are sung. The musical features of this rite are obvious. Developing slowly and monotonously it starts as a recitation but gradually develops into song. One song after another is performed until the climax, which is actually the pure Zikr, is reached. The performance of Zikr was set on the well-known Shahada of Ahmad Yassavi. This tune is better known by its ubiquitous first line La ilaha il Allah (There Is no Other God but Allah!), widespread through the whole Islamic world (Figure 5).AntalhoBismillahi-r-rahmoni-r-rahim!Antalho dey antalhaqq, laysallahu illahu,Asli rabbim Jallolloh, mohi qalbim xayrulloh,Nuri Muhammad salllaloh, La ilaha il Allah (6 marta)Har kim maysa o’rguncha, La ilaha il Allah,Go’ri bo’lar dunyocha, La ilaha il Allah,Ochar bihishtdin darcha, La ilaha il Allah,O’lib o’g’lon kelodir, La ilaha il Allah,Doim xizmat qilodir, La ilaha il Allah,Go’ri bo’lar qon asta, La ilaha il Allah,Yotar qushdek qafasda, La ilaha il Allah,Mehnat qilar payvasta, La ilaha il Allah,Tahlil degan ushbu nom, La ilaha il Allah,Figure 5: Music Line AntalhoChapter 09.indd 138Chapter 09.indd 13812/27/10 7:36:21 PM12/27/10 7:36:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"139FEMALE FOLK SUFISMTinmay ayting subhu shom, La ilaha il Allah,Hamroh bo’lgay imoning, La ilaha il Allah,Qorong’u go’r charog’ing, La ilaha il Allah,Imon islom a’losi, La ilaha il Allah. . .I celebrate you, GodI celebrate you, Almighty,There is no God but the DeityIndeed You are my LordMy Lord who created the universe.I sacrifice my heart to you, God.Resplendent Muhammad is the messenger of God.There is no God but AllahThere is no God but AllahThere is no God but AllahWhile everyone is cutting grassThere is no God but AllahHis grave will be the whole worldThere is no God but AllahHe will open the window of paradiseThere is no God but AllahA dead son is comingThere is no God but AllahHe will constantly serve GodThere is no God but AllahHis grave will slowly be filled with bloodThere is no God but AllahHe will lie like a bird in a cageThere is no God but AllahSuffering will come and will bind himThere is no God but AllahThis is cleansingThere is no God but AllahYou talk continuously from morning to nightThere is no God but AllahYour faith will be your companionThere is no God but AllahIn the dark grave there will be lightThere is no God but Allah!This Zikr is performed as a chorus, when the right mood is achieved at the very culmination of the gathering.

Musically, it seems quite ominous. They start off in a very slow rhythm and with quiet voices. Then the tempo accel-erates and voices rise, finally reaching the pure repetition of the unique phrase La ilaha il Allah.One of the most remarkable events I witnessed was the Zikr in the vil-lage of Gushtyemas in the Andijan district, in October 1999. The women were gathering together for a special purpose. A well-respected, elderly lady called Chinny-hola – a friend to many of them – had not been feeling well for the past month after recovering from pneumonia. As women came to visit her, sitting, and drinking tea, later having dinner, they called for the closest neighbours. Gathering together a dozen of them, sharing the lat-est worries and news, they finally became more and more excited about the state of Chinny-hola’s health. Finally, trying to comfort and support her, they fell into the ritual with prayers, Fatiha (Sura n1 of Qur’an), Sufi poetry of Mashrab, Uvaysiy, turning later into the dance form. One of the Otin-Oy, Sabokat-hola, took the Doira (frame drum) and started playing. The evening became joyful and dynamic, lifting the spirits of all those pres-ent. Next morning, all the neighbours who could not come expressed real regret that they had been unable to participate in such a remarkable event.There is a tendency towards special features in Zikr performance within women’s circles. Here I am talking of the recreation of ‘quiet’ Zikr, when tears come to the eyes of the participants and hearts fill with sadness. In this sense, Sama’ of such kind suggests a particular form of transcendence, reflecting the qualities of women’s nature, the tendency to gentleness and emotional sensitivity. In contrast to the harsher forms of men’s Zikr, where the ecstatic state is displayed as a total loss of perception of reality, the culmination of women’s Zikr can be discerned as a tradition of immersion into quiet trance, thereby recreating the sensation of reunion with God. Sometimes, as we see, the congregation meets not from Sufi motivations but for very different reasons, such as life events, calendar events, or purely religious events. Most often, various forms of Zikr stages can be observed. The consistency in performance of Qur’an texts and Sufi poetry, ascending in emotional intensity from simple to complex, increasing in emotional expression by the end of the gathering – Sama’ – could be expressed with reference to the classical musical tradition of Central Asia. This gradual ascent from quiet to excited stage, typical of mystical forms of Sufism, is very similar to genres of classical music called Maqam or Hal. So Zikr has in those cases a strong musical connection.239Chapter 09.indd 140Chapter 09.indd 14012/27/10 7:36:22 PM12/27/10 7:36:22 PM"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"141FEMALE FOLK SUFISMThe peculiar importance of using Qur’anic words and verses to remem-ber Allah is derived from numerous Qur’anic injunctions, for example, ‘So remember me and I will remember you.’ Each Sufi order had a Zikr of its own, constructed by its founder. The women’s Zikr in the Ferghana Valley is mostly based on the Yassaviya version, the so-called ‘loud’ Zikr Jahriya. After the climax, the Otin-Oys fall into silence. Everything else –daily life, problems and difficulties – seems to diminish and disappear, as if Eternity itself had come to this session. Emotionally, it is an extremely powerful and expressive ritual.The Murshid is the one who selects the Zikrs for this spiritual stage. It is also believed that Zikr done without the guide’s permission is practically useless.240 The same happens among Otin-Oys. At the session described above the order and the method of performing the rites was dictated by the leader of the assembly, by Otin-Oy Mutabarak-hola. She was the person to whom everyone turned and she was the person to follow.As mentioned, there are two types of Zikr : Zikr-i-jali or Dashgariya (loud recitation) and Zikr-i-khafi or Hufiya (performed with either low voice or silently). If in Naqshbandiyya the second type is used, in Yassaviya, as we showed, Otin-Oys follow the loud way. But the silence after the loud Zikr with Otin-Oys is remarkable. Some of the women were in a trance; others were weeping and repeating the name of Allah. The value and power of the Zikr is dependent upon the right level of concentration in body and mind. Only when these are achieved can the believer become identified with the Zikr, that is, the object and the subject are the heart illuminated by the divine light. It should be men-tioned that the Zikr does not allow unity with God. It simply represents the means of purifying the heart.Concerning the forms of mixed Zikr, where both men and women play an equivalent role, we should emphasise that in this region the practice of mixed Zikr has existed for centuries back in the history. The same can be seen in other Eastern countries such as Turkey.An article by Troitskaya provides a very interesting piece of evidence about the existence of Otin-Oys in Tashkent at the beginning of the twentieth century. The description of the rite defines the most significant characteristics of this kind of women and of the kind of rituals they performed. For example, Troitskaya interprets the role of Otin-Oys as lying in directing Zikr with regard to the organisation of the interrelation between the dance rhythm and the rhythm of general cries and weeping. Chapter 09.indd 141Chapter 09.indd 14112/27/10 7:36:22 PM12/27/10 7:36:22 PM"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"142FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMHowever, nowadays this interrelation no longer exists in Otin-Oy activity. The Otin-Oys of today are content with singing and recital.As it was mentioned above, each Otin-Oy, according to Troitskaya241 had her very own style. Each performed in a different way. However, my own investigation reveals that a rather distinct similarity in the musical intonation of songs and tunes typical of various Otin-Oys can be distin-guished within each region. For example, in the settlement of Gushtyemas in the south of Andijan district and in Butakora and Dudur in the north of Andijan region, the same songs based on texts by Mashrab and Uvaysiy are performed in a very similar manner. And lastly, as Troitskaya points out, Otin-Oys covered their mouths with their hands and even with the holy books of Qur’an, trying thereby to decrease the resonance of their voice, relating it to the fact of general whirling in the dance.242There are no analogous examples among modern Otin-Oys. At the same time, other new ways have developed. For example, Otin-Oy Sabohad from the village Gushtyemas carry out Zikr in a sitting position. However, the technique of her body movements is reminiscent of the previous danc-ing forms of Zikr. Otin-Oy Sabohad rocks her body smoothly from side to side, from the right to the left. She also uses circular rotational movements Photo 15: Otin-Oys gathering in Gushtyemas villageChapter 09.indd 142Chapter 09.indd 14212/27/10 7:36:22 PM12/27/10 7:36:22 PM"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"143FEMALE FOLK SUFISMof the hands in time for each line, distinctively matching the singing to the character of the hand movements. Many Otin-Oys, indeed, put the holy books to their mouths, but only in an outburst of feelings, in a kiss. An outburst of religious feeling is the more likely explanation for this action, rather than the acoustical moment of the sound regulation. A number of questions arise when examining this unique phenomenon in the Uzbek culture, the most significant of which appear to be about the particular Sufi orders to which various Otin-Oys, and the various rituals carried out by them, belong. Note that in the present day it is quite common for either Otin-Oys or their followers to be unable to tell to which Sufi school or order they belong because they don’t know the truth. Although this can be determined by the repertoire they use, it can be difficult to distinguish between the followers of tariqah of Ahmad Yassaviy, as for example in the Ferghana Valley, and the Naqshbandi followers who dedicate the songs to his name. However, many Otin-Oys use parts from both types of repertoire, therefore it is fairly impossible to determine their ritual forms as belonging to one distinct Tariqah. An interesting fact is that similar forms of women’s zikr are used in Islamic countries in wider Central Asia. So, for example, in Azerbaijan, the women of this kind are called Marsiya. Their repertoire depends in many ways on Shiism, to which they belong. Many rituals are dedi-cated to the image of Hussein, a tragic figure in Muslim history. With regard to the technical aspect of the Zikr as performed by them, the line of rhythm is strongly accented. Having positioned themselves by the walls and remaining still, the Marsiya clap the rhythm line with their right hand on the knee, simultaneously with all participants in the ritual. This method has not been observed in use among the Otin-Oys of Uzbekistan. Similar forms of women’s Zikr rituals are also practised in Turkey in dif-ferent Sufi orders. For example, the Sufi rituals of the Djafari order, which I had an opportunity to observe in Istanbul in 1997, differ substantially from the women’s ritual forms in Uzbekistan mentioned above. First of all, women of Sufi orders of Djafari take part in men’s rituals too, although separately from men, on the top floor of a mosque. These rituals are carried out in the same building and at the same time, with both men and women simultaneously following the same order for each stage, directed by the Sheikh. Among the Djafari, however, the women do not spin in the dance, as men do. But the prayers are the same.

Here, women were totally isolated from men’s religious practice in the last century, and fully concentrated on female forms of worshipping creating their ‘own’ space, and style. 38. CURRENT SITUATION: FEMALE RELIGIOUS SCHOOL IN BUKHARAThe situation with regard to the state female religious education in Uzbekistan has changed. Whereas during Soviet times female students were not allowed to enter Madrasah, these days they are welcomed. In 2006, I visited the only Madrasah for girls’ Islamic study in Bukhara. The Madrasah was an impres-sive building with a number of rooms where girls receive a high standard of education, not only in reading the Qur’an but also in sewing and computer skills. This is a new trend in the traditional form of religious education. Most of these girls obtained a scholarship to study a vocational subject. Girls there are obedient and friendly. They are lucky to have a chance to obtain a diploma at a prestigious academy. Most of them do not plan to take up Qu’ran reading as a future profession but just enjoy the years of study before they get married. However, these first steps in official policy made towards Muslim education in Uzbekistan seems to be very successful.After talking to the girls and staff from an official branch of Muslim education I met the most famous Bukharian Otin-Mullo (Bukhara’s name for Otin-Oy), a remarkable lady called Rabiya Shukurova (b. 1932). She graduated from the Pedagogical Institution (1953), studied Persian and Arabic, and later even began to study for a PhD, but for some reason did not complete it and later gave it up. She used to be a member of the Communist party, and at one time held a position as a director of the House of Knowledge in Bukhara. In 1976, she retired as a ‘personal pensioner’ (a privileged form of retirement established in Soviet times). Her father was the famous Ota Mullo, who went to Mecca at the age of only fifteen years. Between 1992 and 2002 she went to the Hajj eight times and claimed that it was only possible to achieve this thanks to President Islam Karimov and Uzbek independence. She performed Suras from the Qur’an, Na’ts, Mavludes, Marhabo, and Munojats in the Uzbek language. She recited the local Sufi poetry but in the same narrative way common in the Ferghana Valley.Outside state control, religious knowledge is still based on the Sufi repertoire. Therefore, as we can see, even today in Uzbekistan it is still widespread – a sign of its continuity.Chapter 09.indd 144Chapter 09.indd 14412/27/10 7:36:22 PM12/27/10 7:36:22 PM"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"14510Female Rituals39. OTHER RITUALS LED BY OTIN-OYAt first sight, it would seem that Uzbek daily life follows standard Muslim forms of practice. For example, one can find that female religious rituals in Uzbekistan are based on well-established canons, echoing the rest of the Muslim world. So, for instance, in the morning prayers, Uzbeks begin with the sacred formula Shahada, expressing belief in a uniform God, Allah (La-illaha-illa-Allah va Muhammadu-Rassulu-Allah). Like all other Muslims, Uzbeks undertake Namaz, the practice of five daily prayers. On Friday, a special collective prayer known as Djuma-Namaz takes place in the mosque, accompanied by a sermon, Hutba. Following the attain-ment of independence by Uzbekistan and other neighbouring republics of Central Asia, it became popular once again to keep Uraza, a religious fast lasting thirty days, also known as Ramadan, the holy month, occur-ring every ninth month of the lunar calendar. Also, despite financial dif-ficulties, many people have recently taken part in Zull-Hajj, the sacred pilgrimage to Mecca, which takes place in the first ten days of the twelfth lunar month. The end of Hajj marks the arrival of Kurban-Bairam-Hait, the main Muslim celebration and the equivalent of the European New Year. Likewise, the tradition of charitable acts made for the benefit of the community is highly regarded in Uzbek society. So, one could maintain that these common forms of religious practice correspond to the equiva-lent practice prevailing in the other countries of the Muslim East. However, following the difficulties of survival underground during the Soviet era, the phenomenon in question gradually changed, developed, and acquired new features. Since rituals occupy an important place in the tra-ditional life of the residents of rural areas of the region, they have become a daily occurrence among the agricultural population, which engages in a variety of ceremonies accompanying most of life’s events. In urban envi-ronments, ritual is less noticeable, since the notion of collective and family Chapter 10.indd 145Chapter 10.indd 1451/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"146FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMbonds has always been less dominant compared with the communal and strictly hierarchical familial life in the village environment.Nowadays, two predominant types of ceremony can be found:1) Ceremonies to mark ‘Rites of Passage’243 in the transitional events of life such as birth, initiation into Islam, marriage, death.2) Ceremonies tailored to the context of the occasion, whatever the con-tent, but retaining some standard generalised form.Thus the repertoire of ceremonies that Otin-Oy perform within the female community can be divided into three main categories: 1) Religious, quasi-Sufi rituals, built around religious events.2) ‘Rites of Passage’ : birth, circumcision, marriage, mourning.3) Calendar events: pre-Islamic New Year Celebration, Navruz.Before looking at religious, quasi-Sufi rituals, built around religious events, let us examine the background to all the rituals led by Otin-Oy. It is remarkable that such a system of rituals, typical of the inhabitants of the given region, fully reflects the world outlook of the Uzbek Muslims. For them, rituals have always represented a vital part of the school of life, along with the cosmological system and models of social hierarchies established by the word of Allah.During Soviet times, however, since religion was seen as ‘the opium of the people’ its practice was banned by the Soviet state. In this context, the elaborate system of ritual practice essentially remained the exclusive medium, a cultural oasis in a way, which provided the strongest bonds between the present and the past by allowing people from different gen-erations to interact and to pass historical knowledge down the family line. The true significance of this phenomenon and its impact is assessed in the socio-historical key below.On the whole, each individual ritual represents a compound construction where obligatory pieces are alternated with derived variations. The common feature of all rituals performed by Otin-Oy is defined by a number of independent pieces strung like beads onto the thread of a particular subject relevant to the occasion. The similarity of content is maintained within the frame of the same cosmological idea of progression from characters inhabiting the Heavens to people on Earth (from Allah and the Prophet to Sufis, and Chapter 10.indd 146Chapter 10.indd 1461/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"147FEMALE RITUALSfurther to heroes and accounts of exceptional human destinies) and then ascending back to the God. Thus, in essence, this performance structure projects all the complexity of the universe in a compressed form, focusing on its relevance to the persons concerned by involving them in this circle from God to Man to God, reflecting the hierarchy of values of Muslim culture.Each individual composite piece is framed with Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Rahim, thus emphasising the link between the poetic and musical aspects from the beginning. This link encourages the transference of observers or participants from the reality of life’s daily chores to the dimension of the spiritual world.All kinds of eulogy are performed according to a predetermined order, following the established hierarchical structure. The opening reference to Allah gradually proceeds to praising the Prophet, then moving on to the sacred spirits, and so on. Finally, the subject of the event is addressed. The link between the subject, whatever it may be, and the main story line is made using an allegory, or simply by acknowledging the fact around which the event occurs via direct statements, such as ‘Yes, let the newly-wed couple be happy! May their life be prosperous!’ in the case of a wedding, or, in the event of death: ‘Allah is great! There must be a reason He takes away the best people, close people.’Use of standardised verbal expressions in these rituals is very common. The more skilled the Otin-Oy, the greater the ease with which she manipu-lates her repertoire, and the more natural is the transition between the past and the present event. Whatever the subject of the assembly, whether it is a religious holiday or secular event, the religious part of the ritual often reaches sizeable proportions and involves considerable complexity.Essentially, religious fragments are followed by examples of high poetic skill and refined classical culture, rich in terms of philosophical heritage, followed by tales from the lives of the famous and then succeeded by edu-cational stories from everyday life. Mythical text is very often used in the course of these rituals. For religion, there is a superabundance of material (hymns, prayers, myths, prescriptions for rituals) and virtually every kind of text has its religious elements, such as blessings invoked on the recipi-ents of letters. For love, the quantity is much less, and much of the literary material is in fact concerned with religion: religious love poetry.244The length of the ritual is determined by the significance of the event taking place, the time of the day and the number of guests involved. The above factors can be accommodated by the flexible nature of the ritual. However, the shortest variant of a performance lasts approximately one Chapter 10.indd 147Chapter 10.indd 1471/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"148FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMhour, while the longest rituals I have observed have continued for about twelve hours.40. CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIOUS RITUALSLED BY OTIN-OYThese rituals can be classified in two ways according to:1) religious events around which they are built;2) genres which are performed within them.Religious EventsReligious events are common for the whole Muslim world, though some of them have specific local importance. They are: Mavlyudi Sharif (Holy Birth) The birthday of the Prophet Muhammad, which is celebrated with constant prayer and religious singing.Ramadan (or Uraza) This is the sacred month in Muslim history when the Qur’an was revealed. This is a month of fasting in the Muslim tradition. During this holiday, Otin-Oys are very welcome in every family, because they bless these families during the holy month. They pay particular attention to the oldest members of the neighbourhood, the sick, the disabled, orphans, and the less fortunate. Sometimes they set up Zikr rituals to commemorate this sacred month.Laylatul Qadr (the Night of Destiny) The twenty-seventh night of Holy Ramadan, when the Qur’an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.Iyd-ul Ramadan (Ramazon hayit) End of Ramadan celebrations, when Muslims go to the mosque for the final prayers of Ramadan, and visit their relatives, the sick, and people in need.Qurban-Haiyt The celebration of Sacrifice devoted to the story of Abraham, who was asked by God to sacrifice his son but was then given a ram by Allah to sacrifice instead. In this celebration at the end of Hajj, people slaughter lambs as an offering, while praying and singing religious songs.Chapter 10.indd 148Chapter 10.indd 1481/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"149FEMALE RITUALSAshir-Oy (Commemoration of the Imams’ death) Imams are the descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, and Ali, his son-in-law. The sons of Ali, Imams Hasan and Hussein, were killed in the fight between different factions. Their death is considered a holy death and is commemorated especially by Shia Muslims.Miradzh A holy day, devoted to the ascension of the Prophet Muhammad to God’s presence.Hudoyi This normally takes place to mark three, seven, and forty days, six months and one year of mourning. In modern Uzbekistan it is also the most common event for expression of any kind of gratitude to God. It takes place on a range of very different occasions indeed: a recovery after a long illness; a happy return from a long journey; return of a son from the military service; a child’s enrolment at university, and so on. There are many such happenings both in the rural and in the urban areas. It is performed within female gatherings where the Otin-Oy conducts the event with prayer and recitations of the ancient poetry of Ahmad Yassavi, Mashrab, Alisher Navoiy, Nodira, Uvaysiy, or others to make the occasion as sacred, and to thank God.Mushkul Kushod (Sorting out complications) This female ritual can be performed at any time when a problem or a complication arises in someone’s life. It could be to do with religious or daily life, but generally it is considered that the ritual itself is performed in an Islamic way, which resolves the problem by the grace of Allah.Thus it can be seen that the system of rituals represents not a casual range of performances, but a harmonic space of songs and sounds, targeting every Muslim in the community, underpinning any important life event.So Uzbek society, in keeping the tradition through the long years of different cataclysmic events, kept for itself the right to its own sounds and songs rooted in the past. They are still widely performed within the villages and various districts. Today one can ‘book’ a professional Otin-Oy for any family occasion even in Tashkent.Genres The Otin-Oy’s range of ritual performance in the second dimension of our classification is very broad. It comprises different genres, but all of them commence with the same introduction Chapter 10.indd 149Chapter 10.indd 1491/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"150FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMBismilla-Ir-rahmanim-rahim and end with the formula Allahu akbar. This prayer-like frame is obligatory for any of the compulsory parts of ritual. According to my extensive field observations, many ritual sessions begin with Fatiha which are the opening Sura from the Qur’an.Al-Hamdu Lillahi Rabbil Aalamin. Arrahmanir Raheem. Maliki yawmiddeen. Iyyaka naabudu wa iyyaka nastaiin. Ihdinassiratal mustaqueem. Siratal latheena anaamta aleihem gheiril maghdoobi aleihem walad dalleen. Ameen. It means ‘Praise be to Allah the Lord of the worlds. Most Gracious. Most Merciful. Master of the Day of Judgement. Thee do we worship and thine aid we seek. Show us the straight way. The way of those on whom Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace. Those whose (portion) is not wrath. And who do not stray.’Then they swiftly move to different stories from Islamic history and then to Sufi or mystic poetry. In general, the order of these chantings runs through from slow to more vivid and dynamic sections, ending up with short concluding chant. I would suggest that all rituals could be classi-fied under different groups according to their poetic content and forms in following way:1) Classic poetic forms: Ghazals, Murabba, Muhammas, and all the complex Sufi poetry of Ahmad Yassaviy, Mashrab, Uvaysiy (1779–1845), Nodira (1792–1842), and other poets. These forms sometimes include extracts from famous Ghazals by other poets like Hazini or Sufi Allahyor;2) Elegies: Arwah-noma, Musa-noma, Qiyomat-noma, Hikmats, or wis-dom from Ahmad Yassaviy ;3) Epic parables: A kind of rhythmic prose describing holy people or events, such as Ser malyak, There lived a man in Bagdad , Dediyo, includ-ing Hazrat Imam (a didactic story about the death of Imam Hussein);4) Original songs created by the most remarkable Otin-Oys themselves. For instance, the song below, which could be called ‘The lament of an infertile woman’. This song by Malika Asqarova comprises the features of all genres mentioned above, plus the private biography of her neigh-bour and friend, who is a barren woman.Oh God, why did you createSuch a vagabond and stranger as I?I am a gardener in the gardenChapter 10.indd 150Chapter 10.indd 1501/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"151FEMALE RITUALSWho has not taken into accountThe number of pomegranatesI am the seedless one . . .However, the main classification of those rituals I would suggest is based on the order of different Islamic chanting and hymns. In fact, there is no fixed set patterns for ritual development but a free style is used. It depends on the area of performance (so, in Ferghana Valley rituals are mostly based on local Sufi poems), the Otin-Oy’s preference (the older the Otin-Oy, the wider the collection of Ghazals performed) or the reason for the ritual performance (for mourning, for example, the rituals are longer than for weddings and there are more genres involved). However, in gen-eral, rituals in my observations can be listed as follows: 1) Songs or recitals of glorification, an elaborate system of praise which includes all kinds of important characters in Muslim history at differ-ent levels and which renders to each holy person his due. These can be subdivided into separate subjects of praise or glorification:a) Hamd, praising Allah, which is the most important type of glorification. For example: Qul hu allah subhan allah wird aylasam -a hu, biry borim diydoringni ko’rarmanmu?! (Say he is Allah, holy Allah, if I meditate, can I see your face?), also introduced below Antalho, Qulho Alloh, etc.b) Na’t, praises to the Prophet Muhammad and other Prophets such as Musa, Adam, Ibrahim. For example: Bugun na’tingni aytarman . . . (Today I shall glorify you, O our Prophet . . .), see below (Assalavotu Vassalam, buguin ba’ttingni aytayin, Assalotun-Assalom), etc.c) Madh, praises:for the followers and companions of Muhammad (Halifas Abu-Bekr, Umar, Usman, Ali);for Hussein, the grandson of Muhammad, who was tragically killed (see below: Dediyor, Ashur oy kissalari; Ser Malak);for the founders of the Mazhabs or commandments of Islam famous in Central Asia, for example, Ghavsul Aghzam Hanafi (see below ‘Ghavsul Aghzam Hanafi’);Chapter 10.indd 151Chapter 10.indd 1511/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"152FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMfor the leaders of the Sufi tariqats (orders) well known in Central Asia, people like Ahmad Yassavi, Naqshbandi, and so on (see Hojam Bahovaddindur);for religious Sufi poets popular in that area, such as Mashrab (1657–1711), Sufi Allahyar (seventeenth century), and other poet-mystics, who wrote in Turkic (Chagatai) or in Persian languages.Some of these chantings could be seen as songs or recitals of repentance and sorrow: Tawba tazarru (songs of repentance), Arwahnamas (pacification of spirit), Qiyomat-noma (description of the Day of Judgement), Musa-noma (adventures of Prophet Moses), and so on.All these types of chanting and praises at such gathering, and singing, fall under the general term O’qish, and are ultimately dedicated to Allah.41. O’QISH (READING) AS A RITUAL SESSIONAll genres of religious rituals in Central Asia can be covered by this term. Since Islam is a religion based on the Word (the two most important sources of Islam are based on the Word – Qur’an is the Word of Allah, and Hadiths are Words of the Prophet Muhammad), so religious reading of these words is the main sacred function. First of all these texts, Suras from Qur’an and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, are read to bless any kind of event. However, performance can take another form with poetry reading, such as a range of Sufi ghazals, murabba’ or muhammas.The main authors of these are Ahmad Yassavi (thirteenth century), Sufi Allahyor (eighteenth century), Mashrab (eighteenth century), Sadoyi (nine-teenth century), Haziniy (nineteenth century), Uvaysiy (nineteenth cen-tury), and others. Each recitation is enclosed within the traditional frame called Dua – Bismillah-i-rahman-i-rahim and concludes with the formula Allahu akbar. This framing suggests the special religious purpose of the per-formed texts, devoting them to the ear and the name of the Almighty.Here are some examples of the poems, read by Otin-Oy on different religious occasions. The Hamd, which I recorded in 1999 is Murabba’ of the great Sufi saint and poet Ahmad Yassaviy which was also performed as the climax of a female Sufi Zikr.Bismillohi rahmoni rahim!Qul hu Alloh, subhon Alloh, vird aylasam, a hu!Biri borim diydoringni ko ‘rarmanmu?Chapter 10.indd 152Chapter 10.indd 1521/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"153FEMALE RITUALSEllik yoshda cho ‘llar kezib giyoh o ‘rdim,Tonglar chiqib toat qilib ko ‘zim o ‘ydim,Diydoringni ko ‘rarman deb, jondin to ‘ydim,Biri borim diydoringni ko ‘rarmanmu?Boshdin ayoq hasratingda vird aylasam,Ellik ikki yoshda kechdim xonumondin,Tark ayladim xonumon ne, balki jondin,Biri borim diydoringni ko ‘rarmanmu?Ellik uchda vaqt topmayin ro ‘za qildim,Gumroh edim, yo ‘ldin ozdim, yo ‘lga solding,Alloh dedim, labbay debon qo ‘lim olding,Biri borim diydoringni ko ‘rarmanmu?If I acknowledge in meditation, saying ‘God is unique, God is holy’Will I ever see your face, oh, the Almighty?At fifty years of age I roamed the steppes, collecting grasses,Praying at sunrise, tearing my eyes out,Wishing to see your beauty, I felt satiated with life,Will I ever see your face, oh, the Almighty?If from head to toe I am struck with suffering in my wish to see you,At fifty-two, having disowned myself,Having let go of all my wealth,And even leaving my life behind,Will I ever see your face, oh, the Almighty?At fifty-three I have devoted myself to the fast,Despite the time I was lost, He showed me the right way.I said ‘Allah!’ He replied ‘I am here!’ and took me by the hand,Will I ever see your face, oh, the Almighty?Will I ever see your face, oh, the Almighty?Hamd or Praise of Martyrs, Saints, Sufi MastersHamd devoted to Hasan and Hussein are usually read during the month of Ashura, when they were martyred. The repertoire of the Otin-Oy is very rich in long poems devoted to that tragic event. For instance, the genre Dediyo (He said . . .) is in Uzbek a synonym for something infinitely long and monoto-nous. Here are some fragments, which I recorded in the Ferghana Valley.DediyoUl xuvorishlar imomni tiyra boron qildilar,Otni uzra o’zin tutolmay qonsirab yiqildilar,Yiqilib maydonda qoldi, o’rnidin turolmadi,Zulfiqori ilkidin bir pecha yerga tushdi,Chapter 10.indd 153Chapter 10.indd 1531/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"154FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMHoli yo’q borib qilichin qo’liga olgan imom,Mehribonini ko’rdi, Duldurdin imom ayrildiyo,Na’ra aylab yuz ila ko’zin bo’yab, faryod urub,Vo Husseino, vo g’aribo, vo shahido dediyo,Bu huvorishlar beki Abdul Umar sayid dedi:Bu nechuk nola undir, na fig’on bu dediyo . . .These huvorishes were subjected to an avalanche of stones,He (Imam Hussein), failing to hold on to his horse, fell, covered in blood.There, in the square, he remained motionless, unable to get up,His locks touching bare earthIn his weakness, he lifted himself up and having taken his sword in his arms, oh, Imam,Recalling the face of his loved one Mehribon,He let the stallion Duldur go with his powerless hand . . .And at this moment she wailed, full of tears:‘Oh, Hussein, oh wanderer, oh martyr, who died for his Faith!’Below is a famous lament for the memory of martyred Hussein to be read in the month of Ashura to raise awareness of the facts of Islamic history.Ashur oy kissalari (Anthems of the month of Ashura)Bismillahi-r-rahmoni-r-rahiim!Ketdi olamdin netay, ul vasli poki Mustafo,Tomib bo’ldi bu jahondin nuri poki murtazo,Hazrati Fotimaning, do’stlar, jigarbandi qani?Kimga aytay bu alamni, naylayin, vo xasrato!Bu ko’zim ko’r bo’lgani yaxshi edi, ey do’stlar,Ko’rmagay erdim koshki bu holda, ey saido!Yuragim afgor bo’ldi, vo Husseino, vo Husseino!Naylayin, qismat, bu tanglikka bo’lubman mubtalo,Dod etarman ul kuni yazidlar qo’lida yavmi jazo,Hazrati Qahhorni oldida ul mahshar aro,Vo imomo, vo Husseino, yoru jonim qaydasan,Tashlabon ketding meni, ey shahidi Karbalo!Bismillahi-r-rahmoni-r-rahiim!He has left this world, the noble Hussein,His clear light has left this world,Where, my friends, is the flesh and blood born of Fatima’s flesh and blood?Whom can I tell of my unhappiness?What can I do in this suffering?Chapter 10.indd 154Chapter 10.indd 1541/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"155FEMALE RITUALSI would rather go blind, my friends,Oh, how I wish I could see him!My heart is broken, Hussein, oh, Hussein,What can I do, I am destined to live this fate,I cry on this day when he suffered from the hands of his yazids.245On the Judgement Day you will rise and stand next to your stern Lord.Oh, Imam, oh Hussein, where are you, my soul?You left here me and departed, oh victim of Karbala.246The legend of Ser Malak (Seven Angels)This is a popular story about the sacred dish Ser-malak which was served in the whole of Central Asia for the pre-Islamic New Year celebration Navruz.Hasan and Hussein were once left hungry,And Fatima-Zuhra put into the pot a bunch of grasses and pebbles.Around the pot gathered angels:And this is why The Prophet called this dish Ser-malakOh, the Prophet of both worlds and his khalifs,I will devote my soul to God, to Prophetsand their faithful followersand two princes Hasan and Hussein,sons of Fatima and favourites of Muhammad.Oh, the Prophet of both worldsMuhammad and his khalif Ali threw a wedding feast for his childrenand all the friends gathered roundEveryone stood with hands respectfully folded, bowing.The prophet named this dish Ser-malakIt is made of a bunch of grasses and stonesall the birds that land on these grasses and stones turn into nightingales.Oh, the Prophet of both worlds and his khalifs,Whoever cooks Ser-malak is kind,and whoever takes part in making it will go to heaven.Hamd devoted to other saints and Sufi masters are read on different occa-sions, but mostly either during spiritual Sufi gatherings (Gap), or as an introductory part of Sufi Zikr, or during other religious rituals like Hudoyi (Remembrance), Mushkul Kushod (Sorting out complications), in order to ask for help and protection from those saints and Sufi masters.

He brought the light of Islam into this world and his umma should celebrate Mavlyud because of that. After the explanation of Mavlyud ’s meaning and importance Otin-Oys give an example of Salavat or hymn to praise the Prophet:Bismillohu rahmonir rahimAssalavotu vassalam alayka yo rasulullah,Chapter 10.indd 156Chapter 10.indd 1561/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"157FEMALE RITUALSAssalavotu vassalam alayka yo nabiullah;Assalavotu vassalam alayka yo habibullah,Assalavotu vassalam alayka yo shafi’ullahAssalavotu vassalam alayka yo hayru halqullah.Praise and peace upon you, O messenger of AllahPraise and peace upon you, O prophet of AllahPraise and peace upon you, O beloved of AllahPraise and peace upon you, O closest of AllahPraise and peace upon you, O blessing of people of AllahThen Otin-Oy reads an Arabic prayer, which is followed once again by another anthem Salavat.Bugun na’tingni aytayin yo rasulu saidi barno,Tufaylidin bino bo’ldi zaminu osmon barpo.Mani hamdu na’ti sifoti mustafo qilmoq,Xudo lutfi karam birla zabonim ayladi go’yo.Anoning qornidin tushgan zamon yig’lab dedi ul mard:Tamomi ummatimni mag’firat qil xudovando.Tamomi anbiyo kelib ul kun salom qildi,Kelib xizmatida turdilar Odam bilan Havvo.Maloik birla g’ilmonlar saf-saf bo’lib turdi,Etti qat osmonda hech maloik qolmadi aslo.Yetib kelib Jabroil ham ayladi xizmat,Bu olamni yaratti nuri poki ul habibulloh.Today I will praise you, O Prophet,From something you created Earth and Heavens.Whereas me, o Prophet, in order to praise your virtues,God has blessed me with a Tongue and Word.As soon as he emerged from his mother’s womb,He said: guide my community to the true way,O God, all the spirits of Prophets came that day to bow to him,Adam and Eve stood ready to serve him.All Angels and Archangels stood in rows and columns before him,Not one angel remained in the Heavens.Even Archangel Gabriel came to serve him,And this day was lit up with a bright light.Then the following hymn is usually sung by all participants in the gather-ing.

Funeral rituals vary greatly in different areas of Central Asia and in Uzbekistan, but there are some elements which can be seen throughout the region. When a person dies, he or she should be washed by women, who weep while they do this, reciting poems. According to Muslim rules, the body must be bur-ied as soon as possible before the sunset. Before burial, men take the body to the mosque, where Janaza or the Prayer for the Dead is recited and then the body is buried.All this time, women in the house do not just weep but, led by Otin-Oy, read prayers for the dead, perform Zikr and sing songs of repentance, usu-ally for three days and three nights.

PRE-ISLAMIC PRACTICES: MUSHKUL KUSHODThe Boisun settlements still follow traditional mode of life revealed in oral poetry, epics, folk handicrafts, national dress, games, and music, as well as in ancient style rituals. In 2001, UNESCO awarded the district of Boisun with a title of ‘Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity’. While conducting regular fieldwork there, I gathered significant material on the local traditional customs of pre-Islamic practices led by women.There in Boisun, I met a remarkable Uzbek woman Ruhsatoi Agzamova (b. 1930), who had spent her entire life in the same village, with its popu-lation of around 80,000 people (Photo 16, p. 166). Married to the local government representative (the local Secretary of the Communist Party) and having brought up eleven children, Ruhsatoi-opa is a typical local woman. Her primary concerns were to raise her children and support her husband in each of his actions. After he passed away, her interests turned towards raising and educating her grandchildren. Her sharp mind, elo-quence, and wit, enriched with idiomatic languages (Uzbek and Tajik, typical for the area), give her the ability to create epic style parables for every life situation she faces. Her wisdom and generosity are the reasons why people are so attracted to her. She is familiar with many local tradi-tions and customs and is able to set up any ritual at home on her own. For her family, her grandchildren, she is able to perform rituals of Beshik-Toy (Photo 17) and Mushkul Kushod at home.On one occasion, when I was visiting Boisun (Photo 17), Ruhsatoi-opa performed the Beshik-Toy ritual. Surrounded by a handful of family mem-bers, neighbours, and friends she opened the ritual with a prayer.

This was accompanied by collective prayers and protective sayings. The baby was solemnly put into the Beshik (cradle), and the baby’s sisters sang lullabies over the cradle, while the mother breastfed the baby.The main accessories of the Beshik-Toy ritual on the tablecloth were items from the recent harvest: qovun (melon), fruits from her garden, non (bread) freshly baked in Tandyr (clay oven in the yard), and kok chai (green tea). Cutting the melon precisely, arranging it piece by piece on the tablecloth, she invited the guests to share it. It all had a special meaning, and every participant shared her concern to protect her grandson from evil eyes. The guests joined in with prayers, songs, and protective sayings. Everyone was pleased and satisfied.Indeed, in Boisun, if there is need, and the will, any woman can per-form rituals like Ruhsatoi-opa Agzamova. It reminds us of the Shamanic saying that everyone can Shamanise!Photo 16: Lady of Boisun Ruhsatoi AgzamovaChapter 10.indd 166Chapter 10.indd 1661/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"167FEMALE RITUALSThe ritual of Mushkul KushodThe structure of the ritual Mushkul Kushod, which I recorded on my visit to Boisun in April 2004, consists of many parts. The event devel-oped step by step, built up from the initial preparation, through the introduction, beginning, the ritual itself (with solo and chorus singing), climax, to the conclusion, ending with conversation, tea drinking, eat-ing, then parting.All the women gathered together as usual on a Tuesday for this day of ceremony. The purpose of that occasion was simple: the ritual-holder Nasiba Azimova’s son had obtained a job as a policeman. Such success! Twenty-six ladies, neighbours and relatives from Boisun village, came to celebrate with the family and (as happens at such events) to ask for the assistance of the Goddess to help with other matters (the daughter-in-law of one of these ladies had not given birth for a long time and was mentioned as a person for consideration). The ritual took about two- and three-quarter hours.In preparation for the ritual, the women, one by one, gathered together in the biggest room of the household. They sat comfortably around the dastarkhan on the floor, greeting each other as usual with polite questions like, ‘How are you? Are you in a good health? How is Photo 17: Ritual Beshik-Toy (first putting Baby in the Cradle)Chapter 10.indd 167Chapter 10.indd 1671/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"168FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMyour family, children, mother-in-law, father-in-law, your husband? How are your parents? How is your job (if there is any!)’, asking questions, exchanging news. They all spoke in low voices awaiting the arrival of the local Otin-Oy. Her voice was subdued but anticipated the mood of the occasion. All conversations stopped. The Otin-Oy prepared forty candles (by wrapping cotton wool on wooden sticks) to set alight later. Everyone had brought food for a meal, and laid it on the Dastarhan. Everything was ready for the ritual to commence.The Otin-Oy began reading the first Sura from the Qur’an (Fatiha). Then she progressed to the proper story of Bibi-Seshanba (a pre-Islamic Goddess, whose traces as a helper still exist within the Islamic frame-work), alternating with religious and educational stories. The women all kept their heads bowed during the reading, collectively adding the end-ings Allahu-Akbar. Everyone appealed to the Goddess Bibi-Seshanba who is believed to be the protector of women all over the world. The story of her miracles, her good will and good deeds was told. She was praised and asked for help. The Otin-Oy put out the candles, and the room grew smoggy and dark.All worries were shared as those assembled appealed to the goddess for intercession and support in collective prayer, made in low whispering voices. There was silence at the culmination of the ritual. Everyone was in a deep trance for almost an hour and a half.At the conclusion, the women slowly started moving and talking. They were offered tea and a meal. They felt relaxed and refreshed. They looked happy and encouraged. They chatted, then some of them left.On different occasions when I witnessed the same ritual, some other ele-ments were observed. The primary purpose of this ritual is to help people to cope with problems. These could be associated with some misfortune in the family, but there could also include some other worrying circum-stances. In such cases, the Otin-Oy leading the ritual will start the session with a prayer. After this, the process of ‘healing’ begins, highlighting its significance, calling the attention of the saints to the place where the ritual is taking place, asking for their help and, finally, expressing a hope for a change of circumstances. All of this is accomplished in conditions which are not usually typical of Muslim rites. Seven items are required, the avail-ability of which is crucial to performing the ritual:• Water or tea• BreadChapter 10.indd 168Chapter 10.indd 1681/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"169FEMALE RITUALS• Sweets: honey, sugar, bonbons, or all of these• Flour• Oil (liquid)• A mirror• FireThe ritual assigns specific significance to each item, the symbolism of which originates from Zoroastrian rites rather than Muslim ones. Hence, fire is the symbol of faith in Zoroastrianism, the mirror is the symbol of contained and open space, flour is the symbol of purity owing to its white colour, honey is the symbol of intended sweet bliss, bread stands for fertility, water is the symbol of the flow of time, and oil is a substance of energy. Furthermore, special food called Bibi-Mushkulkushod is prepared for this ritual. As a rule it consists of seven kinds of dishes, which include:Shir Guruch – rice soup,Palov – pilau rice,Umach – corn soup,Khalvaytar – sherbet,Bogursak – pastry balls,Kulcha – little breads.This collection of dishes plays an especially important role in the organi-sation and performance of the ritual. In such a case, it is performed on a Tuesday, as it is supposed to be addressed to Bibi-Seshanba, that is, Lady Tuesday. The very name of the ritual means an appeal to Mother-Mushkul Kushod, ‘the lady who solves problems’. The ritual Mushkul Kushod com-prises a distinct succession of stages. First, the Otin-Oy herself lays all the necessary things on the table-cloth, blessing all her preparations. She carefully divides them into portions for everyone present, so each will, in a way, share part of the responsibility for the bad luck of her subject. Otin-Oy then appeals to the authority, asking them to help, attracting their attention by lighting the fire.The main part of the ritual includes a predetermined sequence of songs and texts chosen by the Otin-Oy. She is the one who performs the holy texts. The Otin-Oy in the Boisun area was Muhtaram Nazarova, who was at this time 85 years of age, together with an Otin-Oy called Chapter 10.indd 169Chapter 10.indd 1691/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"170FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMMukarram-bi who assisted her. These holy texts are sung with long pauses between each part. The sequence of transition from one text to another rises in pitch before the culmination and after that eventually falls into silence.Finally, the sacred meal is eaten and tea is drunk, while the women chat and share the latest news.Thus, it can be seen that the system of rituals represents not a casual range of performances, but a harmonic space of songs and sounds, target-ing each and every member of the community. Being part of the basic code of Muslim life, these rituals involve a system of religious recitations which have religious meaning. This local tradition underpins any impor-tant event in life.So, one can suggest that this ritual form is based on a similar idea and structure, that of a ‘long journey’ or the Way – Tariqat. In open-form rituals, repetitive patterns of performance combine recitation from the Qur’an, Sufi poetry and singing and dancing with short conversations, drinking tea and eating. The most important part is the climax, a culmi-nation with singing, which can be repeated several times depending the purpose of the event.43. FEMALE RITES OF PASSAGERituals in their general forms, irrespective of where they are performed, resemble chains of patterns containing predetermined basic elements joined in combinations of contrasting or similar types of building block. According to our observations, female rituals in Uzbekistan typically tend to involve a fusion of changing and static parameters such as: Space: this is often an unchanging dimension characteristic of the ritual, defined in Uzbekistan by the boundaries of the sitting room in the house.Time: the ever-changing feature, also defining the underlying event.Event: the nature of which determines the ritual and the time of its performance.This was shown in the case of Sufi and quasi-Sufi rituals. The same features apply to life-cycle rituals.247 In comparison to Sufi and quasi-Sufi rituals these rituals are widely performed today. The leaders in these ceremonies are always Otin-Oys (in most parts of Uzbekistan) or Halpa (in the Khorezm area) – those who possess special ability and knowledge and experience to organise such ceremonies.Chapter 10.indd 170Chapter 10.indd 1701/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"171FEMALE RITUALSLife-Cycle Rituals• Birth (cradle) rituals – Beshik-Toy• Circumcision – Sunnat-Toy• Wedding rituals – To y• Mourning rituals – Aza, Motam, HudoyiBeshik-Toy (Birth ritual)This is a small festival for a woman who has recently given birth. For the first forty days after the baby is born the mother is not allowed to go out, or to introduce her baby to outsiders, whether they are neighbours, friends, or relatives. On the fortieth day after the birth she announces the Day of Official Laying of the Baby in the Cradle (in Uzbek, Beshik). She invites many women who celebrate the appearance of a new member of the Uzbek community. Actually, Otin-Oy here is the main person. She starts to introduce the baby to the visitors by singing a joke song. She asks the people present:‘Shall I put this Baby across the cradle?’‘No!’ they answer.‘Shall I put a baby under the cradle?’ –‘No!’ they reply.‘Shall I put this sweet baby into the Cradle?’ –‘Oh, yes!’ shout the women merrily, and so on.Though it would be far-fetched to connect this ritual with Sufism, in some religious families the whole atmosphere of the birth, of the first lul-labies sung, are full of hints towards the long Way, which lies ahead of the newcomer to this world, and many of these lullabies could be read as Sufi-related poetry.Alla aytay jonim bolamUhlab qolgin – alla,Bahtimga sen katta bo’lgilShakar qo’zim, allaAsalmisan, qandmisan,Ghazal muhabbatmisanMen qarigan chogimda, bolam,Belimga Quvvatmisan, allaOyni olib beraymu,Gullar terib kelaymu, allaChapter 10.indd 171Chapter 10.indd 1711/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"172FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMAtrofingdan ailanib, bolamShamol bulib, yig’laimu?Bugun tun ham osudaHammalaryo uiquda, allaMehrim tog’day ketti, bolam,Alla aytkim kelar juda.Onang kabi sho’rlik bulma,O’ynab o’skin, allaAlla aytay, alla . . .I ’ll sing a lullaby,Sleep my sweet child.Grow up for my sake and happiness,My sweet lamb, alla.Are you honey or sugar,Are you ghazal of love?When I get oldAre you strength of my stature, alla?Shall I give you the moon,Or shall I pick up flowers for you?Or wandering around youShall I blow as a wind, alla.Today the night is quiet,Everything is sleeping,My love is like a mountain, which is broken,I want to cry very much, alla.Don ’t be helpless like your mother,Grow up joyfully and playfully, alla.Sunnat-Toy (Ritual of circumcision)This celebration, the initiation of a boy (usually when the boy is 3, 5, or 7 years old) into the Islamic community, demands the invitation of a huge number of people and can sometimes be as large as a wedding party. It is very expensive and because of that it demands long preparation. The event takes place in two different locations: one, attended by the men, where child has the operation, and the other for the women who gather together to join the child ’s mother. Otin-Oy here is the person who has to support the weeping mother and a whole community of sympathetic women. She says a prayer as the mother of the child begins to cry because the operation has started. She reads poetry, examples of which have been given above.

Hamid Ismailov in the final chapter of his novel The Railway describes the whole ritual of circumcision from the boy’s perspective.248To y (Wedding reception)To y is the name for the main kind of celebration in Uzbekistan, of which there are many different kinds. These events take place at the most important points in Uzbek life, as above. Sometimes other events could be counted as To y as well, like the end of the holy month of Ramadan (Ramazon Hayit), or a small To y could be arranged for a close friend as a thanksgiving to God after overcoming some particular difficulties (Hudoiy). But the principal To y, meaning wedding celebration, merits a special explanation. To y as a Sufi phenomenon is described below in section 44.Aza (Mourning ritual)This series of rituals has been analysed above in the section devoted to Song and Poems of Sorrow and Repentance. As stated, the Otin-Oy is the key person who is really able to support the relatives of the deceased. She sings endlessly and recites stories, which are supposed to console people. She sits near the widow, or the mother of the deceased and encourages the women to cry, because it gives them relief. If women cry, it means things are getting easier for them. Reaction to the tragic event passes through stages, from inconsolable grief to more and more expressive despair and, after that, resignation and humility. Here the Otin-Oy plays the main role.

As the Uzbek saying runs Toy bo’lsin (May celebration happen in your life!) expressing the highest value of such an occasion for a human being. Nothing is more important for Uzbeks as a To y!This is a grandiose performance involving hundreds of people. Once I was invited to a wedding in Samarkand, which was attended by about five Photo 18: Mourning ritual in BoisunChapter 10.indd 174Chapter 10.indd 1741/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"175FEMALE RITUALShundred people, but people agreed that was not the biggest wedding in the modern history of the city. The To y concentrates all features of social life such as the hierarchy of different social levels, which demand different forms of respect, different styles of permitted or accepted behaviour, and so on.One can say that the essence of Uzbek society is present here. Men and women sit separately. The most respected people sit at the best places –quiet and comfortable, far away from the entrance, near the bride and groom. They are the first to whom the food is offered. They are the first to give congratulations to the bride, groom, and parents at the climax of the wedding. Among them are the Otin-Oy, who is involved in, and has a very important role in the wedding itself. For example, the Otin-Oy has to introduce the bride to the groom, at the so-called ‘first sight’ (as is nec-essary following traditional custom). They sing a song of benediction in order to make this moment sacred. The Sufi poem Husn va Dil (Beauty and Heart) by Muhammadniyaz Nishoti, mentioned earlier, ends with the scene of a great feast, where all characters, which personify human features and capacities, meet and com-bine. Here is the piece:This passionate Bazm (ball) developed,There the sky and the earth were indistinguishable,After forgetting their name,They found themselves spectatorsOn the scene of a mysterious showAnd the sun descended with them.Mouths were opened like gates,To the favour of coming kings and paupers:Above them the night shone as dawn,Or the dawn of eclipse requestedDisappearance of the word ‘‘force’,So everywhere just beauty would remain,Where Night with her sister DawnWere matched in excellence in the sky,Radiant, clean, glad and passionateWere those two, unnamed royalsThanks to God were forever connected.God’s grace is to connect the thread of two fates.So, should we pray,To give Beauty to the suffering Heart, as I did?Thus, the ball flowed, like wine over the brim,And the two unnamed royals were drinkingChapter 10.indd 175Chapter 10.indd 1751/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"176FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMThe source of life from the very mouth,As I drank my sorrow and melancholy,Breaking the calculation of those who served cups.And Beauty, a queen, moon-like,Floated in celestial clothes,And servants swam after her, as the blood swims into the Heart.And the Heart opened wide the doorInto that place where friends united:Hope with Kindness, Mind with Occasion,Sight with Bliss, Doubt with Tenderness.There Joyfulness awaited Patience among all,And here Fate gave a desired Embrace to Waste.Everything desired was given to everyone,And the only curse to me: to know who is worthy of whom,Like a general who knows which soldier is worthy of battle,Of heroism and, also, possibly, of death . . .And God . . . .That is the image of the To y in Uzbek culture: a symbol of merging, unifica-tion, togetherness. For Otin-Oys the wedding is their world: the scene, the audience and even the source of their livelihood. In Soviet times, weddings were neglected by official policy, which considered such events to be relics of the old feudal system, but the To y was, and still is, the most important element in life in Uzbekistan and Central Asia. It reflects the traditional concept of life and keeps many ancient customs and rituals alive.The wedding celebration has a certain fixed structure involving the whole community in a networking process, from meetings with future family members to farewells to friends and relations. The parties can differ from place to place, but these common elements can be found:1) Sovchi solish/Unashish, the process of matching;2) Non ushatish (dividing bread), the engagement, when the relatives of the bride and groom divide a small loaf into two parts3) The wedding To y itself, which has its own structure:• Ertalabgi osh – morning pilav (the main Uzbek meal);• Qiz chaqiriq – meeting of women with the bride;• O’g’il chaqiriq – meeting of men with the groom;• Nikoh – registration by the Mullah and the authorities;• Bazm – the culmination, climax; the musical party;Chapter 10.indd 176Chapter 10.indd 1761/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"177FEMALE RITUALS4) Events for the second day of the wedding, popular in some areas of Uzbekistan, are:• Kelin salom – (welcoming the bride), performing songs and dances for the bride’s relatives• Chorllar – a meeting for old people.The conduct of wedding celebrations assumes separate spheres of activity for the men and women. This means that the Otin-Oy represents the main participant and is the ritual leader within the female half of the celebrations. Her singing of good wishes, which is a religious element, accompanies every important stage of the wedding: the arrival of the bride, the arrival of the groom, the ‘first glance’ of the bride by the groom (according to old Asian tradition, the groom must not have seen the bride chosen by his par-ents before the wedding; although this may no longer be applicable in all cases, this stage of the celebrations remains), and so on. Hymns Assalomu, Sufi poetry of philosophical nature as well as other folk genres are com-monly used in this repertoire.Music plays an exceptionally important role at the To y. It serves as a mirror of the social and political situation, a symbol of happiness; a means to pay tribute to the social system, as the young couple enter society in a traditional, joyful way; a means to respect the religious system; and a way to please the ancestors, as did the previous generation. It is a mixture of many different aspects of culture – court culture, market art, mosque ritua ls, pop music – and it is a uniting instrument, which maintains feel-ings and provides a sense of wholeness to the event.This is reflected in the huge variety of types of music performed at the To y: solo and ensemble songs; instrumental music (e.g. as an interlude between different acts); prayers and praise for the parents, advice to the young, religious poems (performed by Otin-Oy), and songs as dialogue in form of questions and answers (Otin-Oy and all guests).To y performances include various combinations of instruments like Tanbur, Dutar, Rubab, Ghidjak, Tar, Saz along with a vocalist. The choice of instruments depends on the area involved. In the Ferghana Valley, To y used to have Karnay (a long trumpet) as the main instrument for the announce-ment of a feast. In the areas of Khorezm, Samarkand, and Bukhara, the same function is performed by Surnay (a short wooden trumpet). In the Khorezm region, the main To y is Qurly-Toy, which can involve between two and five thousand people. These To y s have been served by fighters/wrestlers, comedians, artists, and musicians (both men and women) and Chapter 10.indd 177Chapter 10.indd 1771/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"178FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMSurnay players. Sometimes, in the Ferghana Valley, musicians used to play the violin in folk style instead of Ghidjak. In the Khorezm area, influenced by Azery culture, it could be Ta r or even Saz instead of Rubab.Each To y represents the most important cultural and ethnic features common to a certain area. But some characteristics are the same for To y in different parts of Uzbekistan. In rural areas, musical performance is divided into two parts: that for daily life and that for family celebrations (To y). In daily life, amateurs used to play delicate instruments like Nay (wooden flute), Chang-Qobus (timbales). Sometimes, the long and sad sounds of Nay were heard in the early morning meaning that someone had died. Very often even each community meeting is accompanied by songs and Doira.To y s differ in size and local origin. In areas like Surkhandarya and Qashkadarya where there is a strong nomadic influence, the main musi-cal performance of To y is given to Baqshis – hereditary bards – for the male community and Otin-Oy for the female. Baqshis perform epic genres (Alpamysh and Kyor-Ogly) and Te r m a (short songs, improvisations), which are a kind of wedding blessing and dedication. Only Baqshi can introduce the bride to the great number of guests by carefully lifting her white veil with the head (peg box) of the Dombra.In the Khorezm area, Baqshi performs the epic genre Dastan with an ensemble of Dutar, Bulaman, Ghidjak, and Doira. But for the main part of To y performance, people invite small teams of instrumentalists (Ghidjak, Nay, Doira) who play folk music together with a singer. So, the range of instruments in urban and rural To y s is almost the same, but the repertoire is different: a wider one, with essential parts of classical music, in urban To y, and a narrower one, moving on to simple folk tunes, songs, and dances, in rural To y. Doira is the typical main instrument of entertainment, with groups like Mavrigikhon, a male ensemble with five or six Doiras plus sing-ers in Bukhara, or Sozanda, a female ensemble with two or three Doiras, but who sometimes add Zang (bells) or Qayroq (castanets).The wedding music differs according to the place and time of the per-formance. The music in the bride’s house is mostly religious, whereas in the restaurant pop music or folk music with a modern interpretation is commonly played. The order of performance is pre-determined. One sec-tion at the bride house is sacred in type and function, another one at the restaurant is ordinary, secular. In the first stage the music includes joy-ful, inspiring songs, as well as the ‘protective’ ones. Only performance at the restaurant includes popular songs and music with dance rhythms, but without special lyrical content.Chapter 10.indd 178Chapter 10.indd 1781/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"179FEMALE RITUALSDifferent parts of the wedding are celebrated at the houses of the bride and the groom. For example, in 1992, I attended a wedding that took place partly in Samarqand (the ritual part of the wedding) and partly (the secular party) in Tashkent. The music followed the progression of the event itself, from the groom’s house, to the bride’s house, to a restaurant. It involved very different genres, from the mystical poetry of medieval Sufi poets like Navoiy, Mashrab, and Djami, to local pop hits. All those genres are appropriate for particular stages of the wedding. For example, the song-signals Yor-yor (Beloved, beloved) and Toylar muborak (Congratulations on the wedding) are performed at the beginning of the event to proclaim the wedding. The whole event can take from two to ten hours. The wedding I attended in 1992 in Samarqand was twelve hours long with more than 500 guests and visitors.The female part of the To y was called Ru binon (Open your face). It was the celebration of the first appearance of the bride to the female commu-nity. This celebration witnessed the moment of the acceptance of the bride as an equal member of the society. After having been concealed behind the curtain, the bride came into the view of the assembled women. Queuing one after another, they kissed the bride, giving her presents and praising her beauty. During this process, two Otin-Oys sang the Ghazal by Mashrab, blessing the bride. Alternating between the lines of poetry, the audience sang the phrase Hasoraalei (One thousand times) which meant that they wished all blessings to materialise one thousand times. It should be men-tioned that the Ghazal was sung in Uzbek, while the salutations and wishes of well-being were exclaimed in the Tajik language. This is explained by the historically bilingual nature of the Samarkand area. The rest of the ritual was carried out quietly and towards the end became rather monotonous.Generally, in the countries of Central Asia, apart from the phenom-enon of the Otin-Oys and their leadership, there exists the so-called ‘Grandmothers’ school of life’, an outlook on life which is passed particu-larly strongly down the female side of the family from the older genera-tion to the younger. So, should an important event involving numerous guests, such as a wedding, be celebrated publicly without the implemen-tation of ancestral ways, the participation of older generations and the deployment of things generally connected to the past, it is considered to be doomed to attract the attention of evil spirits and the evil eye. For this reason, the role of head of the event is usually given to a representa-tive of the older generation. This also explains the ostentatious display of household and personal items, like clothes, jewellery, and dishes, which, Chapter 10.indd 179Chapter 10.indd 1791/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"180FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMalthough subsequently mostly unused, illustrate accordance and peace with the world of the ancestors’ spirits, and ensure a problem-free future. Maintaining this balance between the two worlds is very important. This way of things is firmly established in the mentality of the modern-day local population, be it rural or urban, carrying forward the weight of the tradi-tions accumulated through centuries.Around 90 per cent of the urban population follow traditional approaches, since their family roots often lie in the rural areas. Even though they may not wish to keep to the traditional ways of ‘grandmothers’ schooling’, they are obliged to do so, in order to keep the peace with their relatives and maintain favourable public opinion. Large families, with strong links between their members and the societal communal mental-ity of Central Asian peoples, are thus partially responsible for this strong propensity to follow tradition. These include following the wedding rules regarding ancestors and elders mentioned above, in order to protect the bride and groom from the evil eye, as well as playing ancient traditional music alongside modern pop. Occasionally, these popular modern tunes played at weddings even boast inserts of ancient religious songs of Islamic essence, sung by local grandmothers along with Otin-Oy.Who are the heroes of this performance? Certainly the groom and his bride. But their role in the Uzbek wedding is passive. The relatives and guests from both sides are more active. They are the producers of this performance. They are involved in all its stages. However, a compulsory feature of the wedding is segregation by gender. Thus, women have to represent the environment of the bride and men that of the groom. They even separate themselves physically. The bride’s visitors are seated in one place and those of the groom in another. They join together only at the end when the Bazm starts.Each ritual has a ‘beginning, middle, and an end’ (Aristotle). It is a piece of drama that proceeds through various stages. The To y has gradu-ally developing parts with the most important and dynamic section, called Bazm (Festivity), at the culmination. The Bazm is the climax of the performance and it is here that the professional musicians arrive on stage and all participants (bridegroom, bride, performers, and audience) mix and unite in the process of performance.We have much evidence of Bazms in medieval times at the courts of the Timurids. In Alisher Navoiy’s fifteenth-century series of epic poems Hamsa (Five poems) or in the book Babur-name (Diary of Babur) of Zahiriddin Babur (sixteenth century) one can find accounts of lavish festivities with Chapter 10.indd 180Chapter 10.indd 1801/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"181FEMALE RITUALSmusic. Closer to our times, a great Uzbek writer Cho’lpon, in his novel Kecha va Kunduz (Night and Day) gives a picture of a Bazm at the start of the twentieth century:When two women entered the door, with faces shining like stars, Zebi’s song “My black hair” was sweetly tickling the ears . . . That was the night when a drop turned into a sea. All girls of the kishlak [village] and young ladies were gathered here. Even the grannies of neighbouring houses came to join them. Two other dutar players apart from Zebi, and several dancers, caused all of the guests not to look at all at the table, but to be busy with Bazm, forgetting themselves. Everyone turned into children. When a trio of girls was supported by the voices of others and the song flew into the sky, even the lads of the village started to gather at places beyond the reach of the lamplight. They were sitting breathlessly in the darkness.249I also remember a Komsomol, or young communists’ wedding, from my childhood, when our most traditional Uzbek neighbours invited our family to the nearest canteen, where the brass band was playing marches of Dmitryi Dunayevski (a well-known Soviet composer), celebrating the marriage of two Komsomols. But stronger still are memories of numerous Bazms with Sherali Juraev as the main singer of the event. In a way, the very word Bazm is for me intertwined with the name of Sherali.So, what can we conclude from the wedding as a musical performance? Such a performance consists of many parts characterised by developing continuity. The participants play different roles. The main function of the performance is to celebrate the process that unifies people through the joining of bride and groom, which represents a sacred ritual. The structure of the wedding reflects more generally the universal structure of a Sufi ritual. As in a Sufi rite, Zikr is a mystical way for a person to unify with God, so the structure and the stations or stages of the wedding develop as a process of the joining of two separate parts into one, of two separate lives merged into another single new life. Just as the culmination of Sufi Zikr is Sama’ or ecstasy, when all participants fall into a trance, at a wedding, the celebrations lead to the climax of the Bazm.An Uzbek singer at a wedding has an archetypal role. There are hun-dreds of myths, anecdotes, and stories associated with who said what, or sang what, at this or that wedding, and these stories are passed from generation to generation. I would like to relate here a story told about the death of Mamurdjan Uzakov.Chapter 10.indd 181Chapter 10.indd 1811/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"182FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMIn the summer of 1966, several friends came to the wedding party of Mamurdjan’s neighbour. The day after the Bazm, when some of them were struggling with hangovers, Mamurdjan invited them to the choxona (tea house) of the city park. There, by a pond with a number of white swans, he told his friends of his dream the previous night. ‘I dreamt of swans, who took my soul to heaven,’ he said sadly, and started to sing. As the song reached its climax, the birds in the pond started to show signs of impatience. They were noisy as never before, and suddenly took off into the sky. At the same moment, Mamurdjan’s head dropped onto his chest. His friends thought for a moment that he was teasing them, but then they discovered that he was dead.Such myths, containing a strong Sufi, mystical element, are typically associated with the great Central Asian musicians of the past. How strik-ing, and how indicative of the continuities underlying the change, to find the same type of myth told of a Soviet-era singer whose songs praised the comrade collective farmers. These myths fly on the wings of those swans across the generations.Like Mamurdjan Uzakov, many Otin-Oys and singers love to end the To y as a Sufi feast with the famous Ghazal of the great female Sufi poet Uvaysiy. I have decided to include this poem here. As Uzbeks say, ‘If I spoke out, my tongue would burn: if I didn’t speak, it would burn my soul.’If I ask for the symbol of the meeting (vasl) from the people who love, they kill me,If I don’t ask I dieIf I build a shop of love for the suffering people, they kill meIf I don’t build I die.Don’t put me to torments of jealousy, O death, if my beloved is sitting with another,If I bark unceasing like a dog at his door he kills me,If I don’t bark I die.There is no other way but to be patient if I want him till the dawn of dayIf I wander like a vagabond hither and thither, he kills me,If I don’t wander I die.If I was absent while I was far away, it was because my beloved said, forbear:If I go today to see the flower of his face, he kills me,If I don’t go I die.Chapter 10.indd 182Chapter 10.indd 1821/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"183FEMALE RITUALSHe avoids me, intimidates me, my soul leaves this ephemeral world,If I stay with this wan face, strange Uvaysiy, he kills me,If I don’t stay I die.45. CALENDAR RITUALS LED BY OTIN-OYAlong with Sufi, Sufi-related and life-cycle rituals there is a class of Calendar rituals, which are also led by Otin-Oys. Here also their role as leaders of the ritual is paramount. Readiness to perform alone or with friends (not necessarily in public, but in front of members of their peers), the ability to act, and an acute mental focus combined with a relaxed state of mind represent the essential factors for the task of ritual performance by Otin-Oy. The artistic capacity to sing, read melodically, memorise large amounts of text, and the ability to involve the audience in the process of performance and capture their attention are also vital for this task. The skill of creating a spiralling upwards in the emotional development, with one repetition following another, bringing the performance to a climax, provides evidence that all their ritualistic performances have their roots in Sufism.Indoor celebrations: Navruz (New Year Celebration: a relic from pre-Islamic times)This festival takes place on 22 March. It is one of Central Asia’s most favourite holidays, associated with the renewal of nature and the arrival of the warm days of spring. Navruz is associated with the magical impor-tance of the cult of Nature and the Earth. Its history goes back to ancient Mesopotamia and Babylon, giving rise to many traditions rich in rites, amusements, and performances.Outdoor celebrations: Suz Hotin (Call for rain)This ritual involves a procession of women who climb a hill nearest to the village and appeal to the Goddess Suz Hotin with incantations. According to local traditional belief, the performance of these songs brings forth clouds and heavy rain.Sail – Lola Sail (Tulip-trip) This involves a group of people going to the steppes to gather tulips. They enjoy themselves, cooking, eating, singing, dancing, and offering thanks to God for the spring, which is seen as a symbol of returning life.Chapter 10.indd 183Chapter 10.indd 1831/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"184FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMQovun (Melon-trip) This outdoor celebration with a feast of ripe melons is a summer festival with singing and dancing.Hosil Bairami (Harvest celebration) This celebration, usually associated with the end of the cotton-gathering season, fell victim to state ideology and was forcibly transformed into public events for celebrating the ‘strength of public will in collecting the harvest and exceeding quotas’ and celebrated with concerts, fairs, and food markets.Qor Yog ‘di (Snow celebration) This occurs on sighting the first snow, when the person seeing the snow puts a letter announcing it (Qor hat, a letter of snow) into the pocket of a friend or relative, who is then obliged to throw a party. Jokes, dialogues, and songs are involved in organisation.46. OTIN-OY IN UZBEK POP CULTURESpeaking of traditional culture represented by females – very often an elderly population – one might ask: What about the youth culture in that country? How important is ‘granny’s school’ for Uzbekistan? In fact for Uzbekistan, the country where more than half of the population is under 25 years old, this is a very important question. Uzbek pop music in the twenty-first century is remarkable for the rich variety of genres, languages, symbols, and styles where female cos-mology is present. There are a number of interesting examples but I would like to give particular attention to the group D J Pilgrim, founded by Ilhom Yulchiev and Dmitryi Levin. Established in 1998, this group depicts in their multilingual songs the experience of the former Soviet Union’s blend of ‘Estrada culture’ which is ‘a staged performance built from a variety of entertaining genres’ (Akbarov 1987: 416; Keldysh 1990: 659). The band’s music was described as ‘a new genre of Uzbek-style Europop from upstarts’ (New York Times; 18 October 2000). In the video clip of the song on i ona (He and She), the plot of unrequited love is shown in two alternating images. In one, the boy is in love and the girl does not share his feelings, driving the boy to commit suicide. In the other, a local old lady, appears as symbol of the universe or as goddess who comforts all broken hearts. The boy (performed by Ilhom Yulchiev) tells his story; the old lady recites a medieval Sufi poem that has deep symbolic meaning.Chapter 10.indd 184Chapter 10.indd 1841/5/11 11:23 AM1/5/11 11:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"185FEMALE RITUALSBoy’s storyОн её любит а она его нет,Он ей пишет а ей даже дела нет!Oн её ищет но нигде её нет,Она красива но глупа,А он любовью слеп!He loves her, She does not love him at all He writes her letters – She ignores them!He is longing to see her – But cannot find her anywhere!

To your eyebrows and eyes, I became a friend to you, I can’t say it to your, Let God grant you fairnessHere, the distinctive language of the text is reinforced by the difference in music style. Though both songs have a similar melodic framework the Russian lyrics come in brief phrases with simple rhythm, emotionally explicit sentences in the style of rap music. In contrast, the Uzbek song is character-ised by long phrases, ornaments on vowels and a melancholy melody.Spiritual depth and an eternal subject turn the clip into a picture with a dual vision of earthly and cosmic love. Here we see an elderly woman who has become a symbol of Eternal Wisdom trying to protect an unhappy boy, to keep him away from the tragedy. However, her image is heavily transformed: with her clouded eye, hoarse voice, and rotten teeth, she looks like a beggar. The common image of the well-respected ‘granny’ is being mocked here in response to the teasing/defiant nature of the pop music style. Pop music comes together with the old ritualistic singing style of the female Otin-Oy repertoire. Two different languages – Russian and Uzbek – represent two levels of narrative: Russian is used to describe the love story, and Uzbek, deeply rooted in old poetical Sufi symbolism with its mystical Ghazal poetry, is used to add a philosophical stance.

For this reason, the ritual recreates the image of Chaos, from the composite parts of which the conductor of the ritual orchestrates the integration of a highly ordered cosmos, according to a set of stringent rules.’253Thanks to the rituals, all the main stages of the life cycle are maintained within the framework of a higher order, relating the events to the cosmic/universal perspective. In order to be fully recorded and perceived in reality, the event is trans-posed into other dimensions, emphasising its significance in this world by measuring it against the historical and mythical realms, where the event’s multiple meanings are synchronically combined. It is as if all the possible forms of existence, ranging from everyday life to the cosmic scale of events, are combined in a focused projection into the current time frame, and represented in a ritual.The phenomenon of ritual among Turkic people is known for its power to stabilise charge and harmonise the psychological environment shared by a group of people.254 For instance, talking about celebrations as a wide-spread form of ritual, one would note that Medieval celebrations always possessed a deep significance and philosophical content.255 ‘The catego-ries of laughter and tears in the world perception of Turks . . . is broader Chapter 11.indd 188Chapter 11.indd 1881/5/11 11:25 AM1/5/11 11:25 AM"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"189SIMILAR FEMALE RITUALS IN THE TURKIC-SPEAKING WORLDthan the existing modern perception of what is comical and tragic . . . Apart from celebration ceremonies, researchers have noted the fact that the burial ceremonies of the Turks in Central Asia, as well as South Siberia were noto-rious for the remarkably dramatic expression of the tragedy of the event.’256 It is not without reason that local tradition maintains that a singer (Haidji) should be invited to attend to the family for the whole time prior to the funeral, which takes place before the sunrise. It is believed that the singer ‘helps alleviate the pain of loss experienced by the relatives, which becomes worse by night, giving the chance to the people present at the house during the night to overcome sleepiness and remain alert, to attend to the funeral at the right time’.257 The repertoire itself (the epic, the singing), performed within the usual frame of the burial ritual, represented a cleansing plea, substituting for a sacrifice, made for the sake of the departing soul. The poet played the role of the medium in this case. Singing at the funeral was equivalent to the actions of Sayano-Altai Shamans.258As V.N. Toporov recalls, ‘this state of things is maintained predomi-nantly in cultures where the language retains its ritualistic function,’ and ‘where each saying carrying a ritualistic function is essentially aimed at per-formance’.259 Therefore, reality was created through the word, which car-ried the deeper meanings of the objects and subjects brought to life by the higher thoughts of, the ritual performers. In describing the possibilities of the world in prayers and poetical improvisations, the Shamans and story-tellers recreated the world for their audience using the power of words and imagination. Often, the beginnings of the image drawn by the words would hark back to the very beginning of this world, thus relating the cur-rent event to that starting point.260The Shamans and storytellers were the protagonists of this ritualistic performance, since ‘they possessed the experience of the preceding gen-erations; they were the carriers of the history of culture. The histori-cal happenings were preserved not in books, but in tales, legends and fairytales, where every new event leads to birth of a new story. Just as the book is illustrated, given a new lateral meaning, enveloped in a different artistic form, so does he decorate his tales of life with the pearls of his fantasy: responsible for the emergence the fluidity and malleability of a myth.’261Not only the words, but also the song, serve as a means of communica-tion between the two worlds. Turkic peoples have always been renowned for their love of song and music. According to folk tradition, a person’s Chapter 11.indd 189Chapter 11.indd 1891/5/11 11:25 AM1/5/11 11:25 AM"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"190FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMgift or ability to poeticise and sing has been received through divination, through an encounter with an ancestor spirit or through a blessing from a deceased folk hero. This source of inspiration is expressed in a person’s ability to make music. The Tatars believe that the power of words and wis-dom are stronger that the power of a steel sword, as the heroes of their tales depart to faraway lands seeking wisdom and good advice, and more often than not the strong protagonists are defeated by the wise word of a weak woman. It is noteworthy that, according to Tatar beliefs, a song represents the highest expression of wisdom, and that there is no creature in the world able to resist it.262 The image of the universe, brought to the public through the performer’s effort, relates to the act of creation. The singer himself takes on the role of creator. The music and poetry here form a bridge linking reality to the mythical world. Reflection of the links with the mythological image of the world in the performance enables the idea of the beginning of creation to be realised through rhythm, music, and song in a dramatic-symbolical form. Strings and percussion, instruments closest to the human voice and the rhythmic heartbeat, are commonly used as an accompaniment, espe-cially in Shamanistic practice.263So, the Turkic culture has remained for centuries the main means of preservation and propagation of a rare historical heritage and knowledge. Some other considerations regarding the nature of Central Asian ritu-als are mentioned by the German scholar Karl Reichl, who suggests that ‘Although in some traditions (notably in India) oral epics are performed as part of a religious ritual, there is no overt ritual function of the epic in most oral traditions known today. However, even in a purely secular and seemingly non-ritual context, the performance of oral epics can have ritual dimensions. This is discussed with reference to the oral epic poetry of the Turkic peoples of Central Asia. It is argued that the performance of oral epics is a particular type of communicative event, of which the compara-tively rigid act sequence can be seen as being on a par with the patterning of ritual. A second important aspect linking epic performance to ritual is that both events are meaningful in a similar way. It can be shown that in the performance of heroic epics tribal and cultural origins are explored and that hence the primary function of epic is not entertainment but the search for ethnic and cultural identity.’264This background helps us to understand how Islamic beliefs, brought to Central Asia by Arabs, merged with the local Shamanic beliefs to created Sufism.

Here is a brief account of what I found in my field research. Afghanistan: female music making in Uzbek diasporaA comparison between mainland Uzbeks and Afghani Uzbeks is highly important as historically those people were closely connected. There is a strong notion of tribal identity and a sense of some things being ‘essentially Uzbeki’ in aspect or attitude. However, my research has uncovered the way in which a sense of authentic identity was constructed within the societ-ies themselves. The first is based on what people think of as their original culture, before it became overlaid with nationalism, Soviet influence, the restrictions of the Taliban, and so on. Of course, this appeal to an original, clearly defined and apparently homogeneous past is itself something of a fantasy particularly since there must have been a rather different Uzbeki culture before the arrival of Islam in the seventh century, for example – but it is one strongly held by many older members of the population. This is particularly interesting in relation to the position of women in the Afghan Uzbeki communities where the recent Taliban traditions may have masked or obliterated certain female roles as compared with traditional activities in Uzbekistan itself.Today the population of Afghanistan is estimated at more than 31 million, up to 5 million of whom are considered to be Uzbeks, who for centuries have lived in the northern part of Afghanistan, just across the river, Amu Darya. My documentation is based on fieldwork conducted in the northern part of Afghanistan, making recordings with Uzbek musi-cians in Mazar-i-Sharif, Shobergan, and Akcha.265 I went to Afghanistan in October 2006 at the time of Ramadan, dur-ing the very last days of that celebration which is so important in Muslim life. Female communities were bustling with many social activities. People paid visits to family members, relatives, friends, and neighbours, bringing presents and sweets, cooking the most fabulous dishes, visiting on their way to holy and famous places. As in Uzbekistan, I saw large groups of women with their children gathering together for celebrations around the table-cloth in the sitting room. They were dressed in brightly coloured clothes. Songs, jokes, teasing, and songs were in the air. This festive mood was Chapter 11.indd 191Chapter 11.indd 1911/5/11 11:25 AM1/5/11 11:25 AM"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"192FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMshared by everyone. Music sounded from the streets, from radio and TV. Staying in Shobergan, on the first day of Eid (Hayit), I attended a female gathering celebrating the end of Ramadan. I was invited to join the family in the living room where about forty women with children were enjoying the celebration. The gathering lasted for more than three hours. Different styles of music, teasing and religious songs were performed during the festivities. Sitting on the floor, women accompanied themselves playing on daf (frame drum) and chang-qobuz (Jews’ harp). This performance took place in a relaxed, free atmosphere and excitement was in the air. The joke song Noi-Noi alternated with comic sung couplets Taralalai, later followed by the purely religious Qambar and Marhabo. Special attention was paid to the Salavat (hymn) Hush keldingiz (You are welcome!). A middle-aged lady Hanipha Mullomuhammad Niaz covered by a white scarf (identical to that worn by the Uzbek Otin-Oy) and girls were singing glory to the Prophet.

Today Sabzy-Gul (Red hair flower), local icon and local myth, is the only living professional female wedding singer, and is very popular in the Northern part of Afghanistan. Sabzy-Gul turned out to be a tiny, simply dressed, shy-looking woman, with the most casual appearance I ever expected to find. I caught up with her at home in Akcha, in the early hours. ‘I have just returned from General Dustum’s [the local military ruler’s] party last night. He doesn’t hold any parties without my performance,’ she boasted. ‘I go there regularly.’ During our interview she constantly cracked jokes and made ironic com-ments. During the day we spent together she sang one song after another, first on her own and then together with her husband, the Nay player. Lyrical and joyful, they were all love songs. What was even more inter-esting (and I could not believe my eyes!), sometimes in the middle of a song she whistled dashingly – she was playful and mischievous, like any star. Sabzy-Gul still performs in the Northern part of the country where Uzbeks have lived for centuries: in Andhoi, Shobergan, Maimana, and Kabul, a 14-hour drive away. Like any professional musician, Sabzy-gul had a famous Usto-teacher, Marjun-Hola from Bukhara, who was famous for her Halpa (female wedding performers in Uzbekistan) skills and activ-ity. So, this demonstrates the continuation of silsilah practice – the trans-mission of oral knowledge – which is widespread among professional musicians from Central Asia.During my fieldwork in female communities in both Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, I witnessed gatherings of female artists – weavers of Suzani – weaving pattern after pattern, each seemingly unrelated to the other. Those patterns are usually associated with the sun and with the moon, the sky, stars, birds, flowers, and many other objects reflecting age-old myths and beliefs. When the work was finally complete, those seemingly unrelated patterns would suddenly come together into a coherent picture. So, now, will this book. It is now time to draw the threads together into a conclusion that will make of this work a picture that ultimately makes sense.Chapter 11.indd 193Chapter 11.indd 1931/5/11 11:25 AM1/5/11 11:25 AM"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"194FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMFemale communities both in Uzbekistan and Afghanistan maintain deeply-rooted traditional cultural beliefs, which combine Islamic faith with elements of the pre-Islamic mythological beliefs of a Zoroastrian, Manichean, or Shamanic nature. Rituals at their gatherings are mostly musical and their structure follows the elements of cosmological concepts, developed over the centuries. The main elements of this cosmology is based on a dualistic understanding of divinity where, despite a predomi-nantly ‘male’ understanding of Islam, a strong image of pre-Islamic female goddesses is offered, along with mystical features of Sufism, where the macrocosm (universe) equals the microcosm (human soul).There are significant differences between the practices of female gatherings and rituals in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. If in Afghanistan the Islamic tradi-tion has never been broken over the last two to three centuries, in Uzbekistan ‘the land was ploughed’ by the Socialist revolution and by 70 years of Russian rule. Therefore, female rituals of the mainland Uzbek population worked out a complex ‘hidden underground art’, with a wealth of different elements, including Islamic and pre-Islamic celebrations like Bibi-Seshanba, while Afghani Uzbek female communities formed predominantly Islamic rituals with Quranic reading as the main functional element in those gatherings.AzerbaijanFemale religious activity is widely spread in Azerbaijan. Religious festivities are performed by women Marsyia. I had a chance to witness a rare but typical Shiite ritual called Ashir-Oy. Held every year, this event commemorates the Prophet’s grandson Hussein who was killed in Karbala. Gathering at home together with relatives, neighbours, and friends, the women sit around the room singing and rhythmically clapping hands. In between, they drink tea and eat sweets. Their performance is very emotional. As it reaches its climax they are in tears, singing expressive chants about the dramatic history of Islam more and more rhythmically and dynamically. Women and girls, of all ages, are involved in those rituals, whereas men are not allowed to participate.Open your eyes, Mother FatimaTell me what is your pain?Open your eyes, look at me,Tell me, what do you suffer from?My wounded Mother, what is your pain?My lovely Mother, tell me what is hurting you?Chapter 11.indd 194Chapter 11.indd 1941/5/11 11:25 AM1/5/11 11:25 AM"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"195SIMILAR FEMALE RITUALS IN THE TURKIC-SPEAKING WORLDLady Fatima opened her eyes,She kissed her daughter Zeyneb,And said: ‘Have patience, my daughter,I have broken my ribs very badly.I have a lot of misfortunesMy wounds hurt’.My hurt Mother, what is your pain?My mother, tell me what is hurting you?....‘Look at your Hassan as he is pale,Look at your heart Hussein as he sobs.He said dear mother what hurts?My hurt mother, what do you suffer from?’.....‘My mother, you’re only eighteen years old,Do not leave me Mother,Don’t abandon your daughter,Tell me, what do you suffer from, My wounded Mother, what is your pain?My lovely Mother, tell me what hurts you?’....‘You sleep so peacefully,You should be tired,You’re alive, you’re not dead.You sleep forever in the arms of your daughter.My Mother, you’re alive, you’re not dead.Lai, lai, lai my mother, lai’.Tu r k e yEvery time I visit Istanbul it seems to be wintertime.

Her high-pitched voice seemed unusual, in my experience, but her pure chanting with its sincere devotional strength was very convincing.

She asked my mother’s name and recited a hymn in her honour.Allahdan zikr edelim ve fenaVojib oldu har bir ishde har kunoAllahdan har kim aylar har ishiOson etar Alloh har ishni ango.Allaha har bir nefes dem-dem etem,Allaha deyinda olur har ish tamom.Let’s remember Allah and Hereafter,It’s necessary to do so everyday.Who acts with the name of Allah,Allah makes easy his acts and actions.I take my breath with the name of Allah,When you say Allah, every act is fulfilled.She was singing and I thought once again how musical these rituals with their flexible structure are. The chanting style of performing devotional poems incorporates increasing and diminishing waves of dynamics, repet-itive, monotone, and pulsed rhythms, an alternation between improvised and planned sections, with the tempo increasing towards the end of the rituals. This style is common to female performers in all these countries. This music fulfils not just an aesthetic but also a social and religious function, reflecting the female role in preserving the folk culture.Female leaders among Tatars in RussiaThere is an Uzbek saying: ‘Studying the world I found myself.’ In researching female rituals and religious music I discovered that my Tatar Granny Fatima-obi, who lived all her life in Orenburg on the banks of the Ural River in Russia, was herself an Abystai, or what the Uzbeks call Otin-Oy. I remember once, when I was a child, hearing women crying outside our house in Andijan and being told that our next-door neigh-bours had lost their father. I was frightened by the thrilling sound made Chapter 11.indd 198Chapter 11.indd 1981/5/11 11:25 AM1/5/11 11:25 AM"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"199SIMILAR FEMALE RITUALS IN THE TURKIC-SPEAKING WORLDday and night by the chorus of weeping women. ‘Why are they doing it?’ I asked my mother. ‘They lost their Daddy, the head of their family. They are grieving,’ she said. ‘Only simple uneducated women weep this way,’ she, the best Maths teacher in the best city school, observed, adding, ‘Your Granny is like that.’In summertime, we used to go to see my granny in far-away Orenburg. I remember her whiter-than-white tablecloths, her unbelievably tidy house. She was very strict. She wanted us to speak only the Tatar language at her house (coming from Uzbekistan we easily switched to Uzbek or Russian to talk to each other when she was not around). As children, we were scared by her rather strict and formal character though, at the same time, we were charmed by her extreme beauty and image.She used to read old books. Neighbours would come and invite her to gatherings which our parents would not allow us to attend. But, following the death of my Orenburg Granny, several of her books and notebooks were recently passed on to me, carefully wrapped in white tissue. Here is an example of what I found:Urol Bo’yi – Tatar to’yiUral shores – Tatar wedding(Poetry of Shakir Muhamedov)Bizning Ural buylariSemiz buladir quylari,Biygrak zur bula tuylari,Nadir onday uylari.Yilqini kup suyalar,Qimizni mechkalab quyalarOshob ichib tuyalarBizning Ural buylari.On our Ural shoresFat are our sheep,But even bigger and greater are the festivities,Why is it so?They slaughter many horses,Qumys is prepared in sacks,They eat and drink till they are fullOn our Ural shores.This is a didactic book about weddings, which, it asserts, should not hap-pen in an atmosphere of complete luxury and splendour, but should be Chapter 11.indd 199Chapter 11.indd 1991/7/11 3:16 PM1/7/11 3:16 PM"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"200FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMmodest.

After the chanting by the leading person has finished, the gathering ends with the final prayer, which is also read initially in Tatar but which concludes with Arabic verses.48. HOW MUSICAL ARE FEMALE RITUALS?During the course of 20 years, studying female rituals, I often asked myself the following questions: What is the nature of this phenomenon? Is it music or reciting poetry? Is it song or a speech phenomenon? Are rituals a part of a musical liturgy? Can we apply to their study some methods of ethnomusicol-ogy, which is a study of music as a cultural process, a social act, and as a sonic structure?Poetry, historically, was very often connected with music because ‘texts when sung or chanted have more power to impress the listener’.266 It has a very special meaning to the Eastern, and particularly to Central Asian, culture. The tenth-century Central Asian scholar Al-Farabi said that ‘the most perfect is a melody united with verse. This is what can move a man and change his morals.’267Chapter 11.indd 201Chapter 11.indd 2011/7/11 3:16 PM1/7/11 3:16 PM"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"202FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMCentral Asian classical poetry from early times used to be chanted in a ‘singing’ way. One reason for that could be because the metrical system of classical poetry, based on an alternation of well-developed long and short syllable combinations lends itself to this treatment (Aruz). It produces a fundamental rhythmical design making the pronunciation of every poetry line sound like a musical performance.Indeed, female rituals are all built on a combination of music, poetry, and words, interspersed with silence. Rituals may be distinguished by their different genres, ways of performance, and of the poetic forms from which they originated, but all of them are chanted. Representing a mix of poetry: folk (narratives and legends) and classical (Ghazal-related genres) these rituals, based on a variety of poetics metres, took shape as chanting rites. It is difficult today to understand how this has developed through the centuries, how it was taught and transmitted, but everywhere these rituals have been performed as a singing poetry. It was my aim to document, that is, to prove the current practice of these phenomena. It is worth mention-ing that these female religious leaders themselves – by whatever name they are known by – Otin-Oys, Marsyias, Abystays – called the process of perfor-mance O’qish (reading) meaning ‘reciting’.Music plays a very important role, portraying along with dramatic acts the essence of the ritual, through the use of historical parables, poetic metaphor, and so on, transferring the audience into a surreal dimension. The music of those rituals is not borrowed from other genres and being a composite part of the rite, is fully realised only in the process and context of its performance.Music helps to sustain the participant’s attention over extended periods of time aiding the ritual representation of the encounter between divine and terrestrial. The power of a ritual lies in the reach of its appeal and grip on the audience. Usually it happens in the community gathering, where all distinctions and boundaries between the two groups – the audience and the performers – are lost in the process, with everyone becoming an active participant. A true ritual spans a vast common ground, filling it with shared feelings and emotions.

Here the microcosm and macrocosm are united and the famous formula of the great Sufi Master Mansur Al Halladj (c. 858–922) – ‘God is me!’ – comes to life, bringing to mind a famous saying that ‘it is women . . . who reproduce nations, – biologically, culturally, symbolically.’268Chapter 11.indd 202Chapter 11.indd 2021/10/11 8:33 PM1/10/11 8:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"203ConclusionFemale involvement in the religions and culture of Central Asia is evident in the facts emerging from this book, which is based on nearly twenty years’ fieldwork and examination. Music is the thread which led to this discovery: singing voices heard exclusively within closed female communities helped me to recognise that, despite the winds of political change and turbulent historical transformations, female life continues to follow the full compass of various religious practices and beliefs.Being a female researcher was an extra advantage for me as it opened a door to life ‘behind the walls’, behind bans and political restrictions, prov-ing that real life is richer that any scholarly theories and assumptions.I am happy to share with my readers what I was privileged to witness: how the sacred knowledge of a thousand years is transmitted orally from older to younger females, confirming the fact that the world belongs to women.Conclusion.indd 203Conclusion.indd 2031/7/11 3:21 PM1/7/11 3:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"204APPENDIX: FEMALE POETRYGHAZAL MASHRABDame bu dunyodin o’tti jam’I beku sultonlar,Qaro yerga fano bo’ldi hamma kokil parishonlar,Na mardonlar fano bo’ldi bu dunyoda, musulmonlar,Qaro yer ostiga kirdi hamma xon birla hoqonlar,G’animatdur, birodarlar, ki bizga ushbu davronlar.Ajalning bodai g’arqi umrlarni hazon qildi,Ko’ngulning bulbuli ushbu alamlardin fig’on qildi,Jami’ ahli alamni ko’rung bag’rini qon qildi,Ne odamlarni, ne mardlarni ul bexonumon qildi,Ajalning dastidan hech kim qutulmas, ey musulmonlar.In one instant have passed all the lords and kings,All dishevelled beauties gone into the black earthOh Muslims, people who have left for the eternal world,Into the black earth went all the khans and sultans,Temporary has their time been, my brothers, and so is ours.The drowning wine of death has turned into autumn leaves of life,The nightingale of the heart began to cry from this suffering,Look at the inhabitants of this world, their hearts are awash in blood,Those people, this death has made weak,No one can avoid their death, oh, Muslims!GHAZAL SADOIIYoronlar, Qosim shahzoda o’sa yig’lamasmanmu?Bu g’urbat dashtida qoni to’kulsa yig’lamasmanmu?Tilida “al” tashlab tashna ketsa yig’lamasmanmu?Aziz jismi xassiz zahmlansa yig’lamasmanmu?Ki dushman tig’ida bo’g’zi kesilsa yig’lamasmanmu?Aning ahvoliga bag’rim ezilsa yig’lamasmanmu?My friends, would I not cry, if Prince Qasim dies?If in this steppe of suffering spills his blood, would I not cry?Would I not cry, if having said “All...” he leaves thirstyAppendix 01.indd 204Appendix 01.indd 2041/5/11 4:17 PM1/5/11 4:17 PM"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"205APPENDIX: FEMALE POETRYWould I not cry if his precious body turns to dust?Or if the blade of the enemy’s sword cuts his throat?Would I not cry?If my heart was filled with his suffering, would I not cry?GHAZAL HAZINIIKimki Haqqa bandadur, paymonidin ayrilmasun,Kecha kunduz toati subhonidin ayrilmasun,Barcha umrin rahmati rahmonidin ayrilmasun,Piri rahmat shafoat konidin ayrilmasun,Jahonda dur gavhari imonidin ayrilmasun.Hafta adoida do’stni chun sahar bedorini,Va’da qildi onalarga jannat bilan diydorini,Haftiyak qilsa sahobat banda harna borini,Rahmatidin benasib etgan chu dilozorini,Tanga rohat istagan ehsonidin ayrilmasun.Let the believer not lose their love for their Lord,Let him never part from the object of his worship,Let him never part with the Merciful through his short life,Let him never part with the spring of kindness and mercy,Let him never part with his faith, which is the pearls and diamonds of his life.Like to a friend, sleepless in his vigil during the holy weekHe promised to mothers the gardens of heaven and his image.If a person sacrifices everything they have,He (Allah) will not make him hapless,So one, who seeks comfort for himself,Never does part with his own kindness.GHAZAL HUVAIDOQayu ishga qadam qo’ydim manga andin ziyon bo’ldi,Manga ey betole’ dostlar anda ko’p imtixon bo’ldi,Qo’lim sho’ru, yo’lim qattiq, erurman turfa betole’,Hammaga mehribon bo’lsam, manga nomehribon bo’ldi,Suyub jonu dilimdan kimga qildim oshnoliq,Uzib ul oshnoliq oqibat manga yomon bo’ldi,Hamma el baxtidin elga olsa xoki zar bo;ldi,Maning ilkimdagi zar shul zamon tuproqsimon bo’ldi,Gulistonlar aro kirdim, ilik sundim olay deb,Hah, ko’ringki betole’im, xorlar manga nishi chayon bo’ldi,Appendix 01.indd 205Appendix 01.indd 2051/5/11 4:17 PM1/5/11 4:17 PM"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"206FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISMHuvaydo aytadur zolim falakning dastidin sad dod,Manga yetkanda ul zolimning charhi ravon bo’ldi.Whatever business I pursue, I end up only with losses,I have experienced many of life’s trials, my friends,The hand of Destiny, sour;

The Zend – Avesta is the sacred scripture of the faith. The theology of this religion is dualistic, Ahura Mazda or Ormuzd (the good God) being perpetually in conflict with Ahriman (the evil God), but the former is assured of eventual victory. There are theories that Zoroaster lived in Khorezm (modern Uzbekistan). 2 Tengrianism is a common faith of ancient Eurasian people. Originating in the most ancient land of the world – Sumeria – about 6,000 years ago, Tengrianism is considered to be the basis for all other religions of the world: Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. But only in the Turkic-speaking world do people today still believe in Tengrianism. 3 Manichaeism is a dualistic religion which originated in Iran at the time of the Sasanids (third century). Manichaeism fast developed within the vast area from the North of Africa to India and China, absorbing features of different local cultures. From the very beginning, Manichaeism was considered to be universal, absorbing transformed elements of such religions as Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Buddhism. According to Manichaeism, there are two independent, opposed and conflicting foundations/substances, Light and Dark, associated with Good and Evil and divided by empty space. The Kingdom of Light possesses a har-mony, peace, wisdom, grace, truth, and justice. It is spiritual. In the Dark king-dom are disharmony, chaos, arguments, evil, malice, madness, disgust, death, and so on. It is material. The highest deity is Light, which is, at the same time, the Great Father whose representatives are shining deities. Dark brought over in the image of Matter, which creates numerous evil demons to fight Light (Religovedenie. Enziklopedicheskyi slovar’ (Theology, Encyclopaedic dictionary), Eds: A.P. Zabiyako A.N. Krasnikova, E.S. Elbakyan, Akademicheskyi Proekt, Moskva, 2006, p. 609.) 4 Zhainadarov, 2006, p. 245. 5 According to the secret history of Mongols, written in 1240, Chingiz Khan used to say: Tengry (God) opened the gates and handed us the reins indicating that Chingiz regarded only himself ruling by divine order. (Paksoy H., Sun is also fire: Central Asian Monuments, Istanbul, Isis Press, 1992, p. 3). 6 Schurman (1962, 249, n. 51) reports that the term Tanggri still appears in the phrase Tanggri ta’ ala’, used in the present Ghorat region of Afghanistan to describe the omnipotent God of Islam.Notes.indd 207Notes.indd 2071/5/11 4:18 PM1/5/11 4:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"208FROM SHAMANISM TO SUFISM 7 Snesarev, 1969, p. 78. 8 There are many publications in Central Asian and Western historiography devoted to this question, which demonstrate various approaches and views. In general, in the Soviet Central Asian works, this period is considered as aggressive and very negative for local cultures. At the same time, scholars mark dual conse-quences of the conquest in the further historical development of the region. 9 There are several important studies devoted to the influences of Muslim music and science on European theory and practice. See, for instance, the well-known classical works of Henry George Farmer. 10 The same text, with some differences, is found in the work of another historian of this time – Hafiz-I Abru.

The friction between the bow and strings involuntarily produces partial tones – overtones and adjoining tones. 196 The task of Kobuz’s participation in baiga is complicated by the fact that this instrument is tied to the mighty oak. Nevertheless, Kobuz pulls out the oak from the ground and brings it together to the finish. 197 Аlektorov writes about Bakshi Suimenbai to whom genies declared that they chose him as their master, that is, Bakshi. ‘At that time, the father’s Kobuz started to play by itself and approached me from the wall near which it lay’.

Gods and goddesses who revealed doctrine through dance are met everywhere. In the Gnostic gos-pel Acts of John, even Jesus danced and said to his disciples, ‘To the Universe belongs the dancer. He who does not dance does not know what happens. Now if you follow my dance see yourself in Me’. (The Woman’s Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects. Barbara G Walker. Pandora, 1988, p. 176.) 222 Mary Masayo Doi, 2002, Gesture, Gender, Nation: Dance and Social Change in Uzbekistan, Greenwood publishing group.9 FEMALE FOLK SUFISM 223 As the Sura of Qur’an says, ‘Men are the protectors and maintainers of women because Allah has given the one more (strength)’, Sura Al-Nisa (IY), 34. 224 Seclusion in general terms did not permit women to go out of the house, to move freely in the streets or to visit relatives without men’s permission. Thus, all that was connected to the outside world became the responsibility of men. Restricted to the four walls of their homes, seclusion condemned women to degradation, led to stagnation of their mental potential, suppressed their individuality, low-ered their self-esteem and social value, led to physical exploitation and to them being treated like child-bearing machines. Nevertheless, women brought up in the Muslim tradition largely accepted this without question, restricting their lives to the realm of home and family.’ M. Tokhtakhodjaeva, p. 38. 225 Ursula Reinhardt, The Veils are Lifted. Music of Turkish Women.: Intercultural music studies, in which she describes many common situations of Turkish women. 226 This discrimination against women leads to awful consequences like the self-immolation of Uzbek women. As Marfua Tokhtakhodjaeva mentioned: ‘in 1970–1980 a trend of suicides among women developed; in despair, denied even the possibility of complaining about their situation, and not finding protection among their parents and their nearest, they took this extreme step’ (p. 93). It is still ominously popular among Uzbek women. About 300 Uzbek women die almost every year from self-immolation. 227 Dodkhudoeva, Larisa Cultural leadership in Central Asia: Ancient and medieval epoch.: The Institute of History, Archaeology, Ethnography after A.

He made comments on different genres of worship performed by male performers: ‘Even the cantillation of the Qur’an was called “reading” rather than singing although both melody and vocal ornamentation are beautifully presented there and to a lesser extend in the Azzan or call to Prayer.’ Among genres performed by religious performers were Yakka-honlik – solo singing; genre dedicated to Allah – Hamd; to the Prophet – Na’t; to his fellows – Ilhon; rulers and warriors – Mad’ya’ 1. As one can see, female religious chanting were not introduced to the academic reader. (Uspenskyi Viktor, 1980, Nauchnoe nasledie, vospominaniya sovremennikov, dokumanty, pis’ma. Tashkent, Gafur Gulyam.) 233 Similar situation with the rite of initiation occurred within the circles of Bukharan Sozanda (female entertainers).

Even 40 days’ fasting, vagrancy, begging, public Sama’ with music, songs, dances, and also loud Zikr-Jahriya have been regarded as actions distracting from pure Muslim wisdom. 240 Alexander Djumaev, ‘Turkestanskyi Starets’ Hodja Ahmad Yassavi i musulmanskye duhovnye pesnopenia’.
