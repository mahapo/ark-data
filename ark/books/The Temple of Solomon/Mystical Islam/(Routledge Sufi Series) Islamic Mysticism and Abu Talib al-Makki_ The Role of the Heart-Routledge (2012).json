[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Islamic Mysticism and AbūṬālib al-MakkīBoth in everyday language and in religious metaphor, the heart often embodies thetrue self and is considered to be the seat of emotion in many cultures. Many Muslimthinkers have attempted to clarify the nature of Sufism using its metaphoricalimage, particularly in the tenth and eleventh centuries.This book examines the work of AbūṬālib al-Makkīand his wider significancewithin the Sufitradition, with a focus on the role of the heart. Analysing his mostsignificant work,Qūt al-qulūb(‘The Nourishment of Hearts’), the author goesbeyond an examination of the themes of the book to explore its influence not only inthe writing of Sufis, but also ofḤanbalīand Jewish scholars.Providing a comprehensive overview of the world of al-Makkīand presentingextracts from his book on religious characteristics of the heart with selectedpassages in translation for thefirst time in English, this book will give readers abetter understanding not only of the essential features of Sufism, but also the natureof mysticism and its relation to monotheistic faiths.Saeko Yazaki(PhD, Edin.) is Lord Kelvin Adam Smith Fellow in ReligiousStudies at the University of Glasgow, and Research Associate at the Centre ofIslamic Studies, University of Cambridge. Her research focuses on mysticism andepistemology of religion, the Judaeo-Islamic tradition, and their continuing rele-vance to the present.

Since thenI have received further inspiration and support from a number of people. From mylife in both Japan and the UK, there are far too many people to list here who havegenerously offered me their help. Their goodwill, without which my book wouldhave never appeared, has often caught me by surprise in a most delightful way.First and foremost, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to ProfessorCarole Hillenbrand who was unfailing in her care. I would have to compose anotherbook to describe the generosity and abundant support which she and my friendsoffered me especially when my study was interrupted during my PhD. I have neverforgotten their encouragement, which was unconditionally given when needed.My grateful thanks are also due to Professor Yasir Suleiman and Paul Anderson fortheir constant support, patience and understanding in allowing me time for myresearch. My time at the Centre of Islamic Studies has been a priceless learningexperience not only for my study but also for life in general.My doctoral study in Edinburgh was such a wonderful time. I would like toexpress my great debt of gratitude to all the members of staff and friends in theIslamic and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Edinburgh. I canfind nowords to express my deep appreciation for having given me a sense of belonging,when my home country is on the other side of the globe. Reliable support,comradeship and friendship were offered by a number of people at 19 GeorgeSquare, including Jokha Alharthi, Marilyn Booth, Stephen Burge, Tony Gorman,Margaret Graves, Rhona Hajcman (née Cullen), Christian Lange, Alex Mallett,Andrew Marsham, Songül Mecit, Golnaz Nanbakhsh, Guy Puzey, KamranRastegar, Ayman Shihadeh, Clarissa Sweet, Richard Todd and Ben White. Theyhave greatly enriched my PhD life and beyond.My special thanks go to various people at the School of Literatures, Languagesand Cultures, especially Heather Elliott, Kate Marshall and Sebnem Susam-Sarajeva, and Jim Mooney and other staff at the Office of Lifelong Learning, andmembers of the Centre for the Advanced Study of the Arab World, Professor RobertHillenbrand and Jonathan Featherstone above all. It was delightful to be acquaintedwith them and it is my sincere hope that our paths will cross again. I would also liketo extend my gratitude to my examiners, Professor Ian Richard Netton and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Dr Andrew Newman, for reading my long thesis and offering me helpful feedback.I am grateful to Professor Netton in particular for his encouragement to submit aproposal to the publisher.Outside Edinburgh University, it is impossible for me not to thank Ben Young,whose feedback on my thesis was enormously helpful, and Peter Evans, whosefriendship I simply treasure. Being acquainted with the members and staff of theTaichi Society, the Japan Society of Scotland and the Consulate-General of Japanin Edinburgh has also been a source of inspiration directly and indirectly. InDamascus and afterwards, encouragement and support were willingly given byal-Ustadh al-Misri and Fadi al-Fatayri. The time I spent with them was somethingspecial, and all myfingers are crossed for their safety. Teaching at the University ofSt Andrews offered me the opportunity to look at my thesis from a different angle. Iam particularly indebted to Catherine Cobham–without her support I could nothave managed.Since I moved to England in summer 2010, I have received another source ofinspiration from a number of staff and members of the Centre of Islamic Studies, theFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, the Main Library, the Taylor-SchechterGenizah Research Unit and the Sanskrit Manuscripts Project at the University ofCambridge, the Woolf Institute, the Islamic Manuscript Association, the GulfResearch Centre-Cambridge, the Cambridge Arab Media Project and the KaetsuCentre. What I have learned from them on various occasions has been a source ofmotivation and strength. Among them, I would like to thank especially MohammedAbdul-Aziz, Abdullah Baabood, Tony Brinkman, Edward Cheese, Jill Cooper, YuvalEvri, Steve Fagg, Ahmad Azem Hamad, Jeremy and Tania Henzell-Thomas, MaryHowe, Khaled Hroub, Dilwar Hussain, Yoni Mendel, Molly O’Reilly, Tash Sabbah,Ghazala Sadiq, Anas Al-Shaikh-Ali, Françoise Simmons, Omer Totonji, VincenzoVergiani and Susie White, who have always shown their care despite their undoubtedlyhectic life. My special gratitude also goes to Harith Bin Ramli for stimulating discus-sion and useful information, sharing a common interest in al-Makkī. My dear friendsand colleagues in the UK, France, Sarajevo, the Middle East, North Africa, Ukraine,China, Canada and the United States have always been more willing than I could haveexpected to provide me with their expertise and helping hands. Just remembering themis enough to warm the deepest part of my heart. It has been a sheer joy to get to know somany inspiring people that I do not even know where to stop.All the inadequacies and insufficiencies that still remain in this book are, needlessto say, mine. In this regard, al-Makkīleft us a sensible remark: perfection does notbelong to humans. While emphasising the importance of improvement, he claimedthat we shouldnottry to be perfect in order to avoid devilish arrogance and non-repentance, which inevitably accompany the false feeling of achieving perfection.Greatly encouraged by this piece of wisdom, I offer you thefindings of my intellec-tual exercise. This is my hope that the readers, whose numbers may not be large butwhose enthusiasm must have been great to have picked up this book, will also enjoyemploying their interpretative muscles and will offer me the fruits of their exercise.Lastly, but not least by any means, grateful thanks are due to my family, relativesand friends in Japan for their acceptance of my stubbornness in leaving them for soxPreface"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"long and for their safeguarding a place for me that I can call one of my homes.

Sufithought is often described as‘moderate’and‘tolerant’, in starkcontrast, for example, to‘extreme’Salafis who attack‘peace-loving’Sufis.1Inaddition to this liberal image, the religious status of Sufism in Islam seems to beequivalent to Yoga in Hinduism and Zen in Buddhism, especially in popularculture; while Islamic (or Hindu or Buddhist) aspects are not entirely neglected,they are not central. The spiritual teachings of Sufism (and Yoga and Zen) are oftenregarded in the West as an alternative to conventional religious institutions and notincompatible with other belief systems. Many Sufism-related organisations inEurope and the United States have contributed to this image by focusing onhumanity, peace, love and the universality of mysticism.2(One of the primeexamples would be the doctrine of Inayat Khan (d. 1927)–the Sufiand musicianfrom India who tried to spread the idea of universal Sufism in the UK, Holland,France and the USA.3)Alongside this appreciation of Sufism that appeals to the popular spiritual move-ment, Islamic mysticism has also attracted significant scholarly attention in theWest. The modern study of Sufism began in the colonial period when the image ofSufis was influenced partially by political interests and partially by Europeantravellers’narratives of exotic dervishes in the Orient.4From the early twentieth1 Ibrahim,‘Salafiintolerance threatens Sufis’,Guardian10 May 2010, online, available HTTP: <http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/may/10/islam-sufi-salafi-egypt-religion> (accessed8 March 2012).

The topics range from general surveys of the doctrineof Sufism and translation of Sufiwritings, to more specific studies of a certainfigure, order or period in the history of Islamic mysticism.5This book seeks to contribute to this growing body of literature, focusing onthe tenth-century Muslim writer on piety, AbūṬālib al-Makkī(d. 386/996), whosemajor workQūt al-qulūb(‘The Nourishment of Hearts’) appeared in differentfields of study, including Sufism, asceticism,Ḥadīth, social sciences,Ḥanbalismand, beyond Islam, Jewish spirituality. TheQūtwas written in a period which isgenerally accepted as a time of systematisation of the Sufitradition (the fourth/tenthandfifth/eleventh centuries). These two centuries produced various treatiseswhich became important mystical guidebooks for later Sufis, and al-Makkīisoften regarded as one of the earliest writers to have composed a‘Sufimanual’.6In theQūt, al-Makkīdiscussed the role of the heart as the mediator between thisworld and the hereafter, governing human mind and body as king. He urged thereader to maximise the quality of the heart in order to be a pious believer carryingout God’s will.TheQūthas been read widely as a guide on ethics and exerted a great influenceon later Muslim scholars. For instance, the famous Islamic thinker AbūḤāmidal-Ghazālī(d. 505/1111) lists theQūtfirst as a work on Sufism which he read forhis study,7and his heavy reliance on theQūtin the writing of hismagnum opus,Iḥyāʾʿulūm al-dīn(‘The Revivification of the Religious Sciences’), has beendiscussed by a number of scholars on Sufism. Among prominent medieval Sufiauthors, al-Makkīis highly esteemed, for instance, in the writings of al-Suhrawardī(d. 632/1234), Ibn al-ʿArabī(d. 638/1240) and Rūmī(d. 672/1273), where al-Makkīis praised as the author of a significant book on Islamic devotion, theQūt.Compared to the straightforward respect al-Makkīenjoys from Sufithinkers,Ḥanbalīliterature reveals a more complex estimation in the writings of, forinstance, Ibn al-Jawzī(d. 597/1200) and Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328), whichdemonstrate a more ambivalent attitude towards al-Makkīand his thought.The teachings of theQūtmay even have crossed faith borders, as some scholarsin Jewish studies have pointed out al-Makkī’sinfluence on the Andalusian Jewishthinker Ibn Bāqūdā(d. after 1080), who composed a moral guidebook,al-Hidāyailāfarāʾiḍal-qulūb(‘The Right Guidance to the Religious Duties of Hearts’),in Judaeo-Arabic. The name of al-Makkīthus frequently appears in medievalliterature in biographical dictionaries,Ḥadīth, SufiandḤanbalīwriting, and hisrelevance to scholarship lies beyond the study of Sufism, and even Islamic studies.Despite this, few studies have carried out a critical analysis of al-Makkīand hiswork, and no single monograph has yet been published on the subject. In 1992–5,5 For a list of major general surveys on Sufism, see e.g.Mysticism, pp. 2–3 (Knysh’s book itself is ageneral survey, intended to complement the predecessors).6 Ibid., p. 121.7Munqidh, p. 64.2Introduction"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Gramlich published a complete translation of theQūtin German,Die Nahrung derHerzen. (See below for translations of theQūt.) There exist several PhD theses onal-Makkī: Shukri in 1976 investigates the life and works of al-Makkīand hisspiritual doctrines in theQūt; Amin in 1991 examines al-Makkī’s contribution toSufism and provides a translation of an extract from theQūtto analyse its influenceon a chapter of theIḥyāʾby al-Ghazālī; Bin Ramli in 2011 focuses on the devel-opment of scholarship in the history of early Sufism through analysis of knowledgeand theology of theQūt. Specific scholarship on al-Makkīalso includes an articleon al-MakkīinEI3, where Ohlander in 2010 greatly expands the previous articleson al-MakkīinEI1andEI2by Massignon, shows an extensive use of Gramlich’sintroduction to the translation and Amin’s article in 1999, which is an extract fromhis thesis. In 2011 Khalil published an article where he tries to situate al-Makkīinthe history of early Sufism.8Based on this scholarship and my own PhD thesis on al-Makkīsubmitted in2010, the present study attempts to provide a fresh examination of the world ofal-Makkīand his work,Qūt al-qulūb. This book differs from the above-mentionedworks in the following points. Firstly, the study is carried out through an explora-tion of the religious role of the heart, on which al-Makkī’s teachings are based. Theheart is a unique organ–not only for its physical function as the sole organpumping blood to the body but for its supposed spiritual capacity. Both in everydaylanguage and in religious metaphor, the heart often embodies the true self and isconsidered to be the seat of emotion. In common with other cultures and religioustraditions, Islam shares this central concern with the heart, as can be clearly seen inthe title of al-Makkī’s major work,The Nourishment of Hearts–one of the primeextant examples of such early work. Focusing on the universal symbolism of theheart helps crystallise the nature of his thought in comparison with teachings ofother Muslim thinkers, as well as Islamic spirituality in comparison with doctrinesof other religions.Secondly, I will examine the characteristics of theQūtwithin and beyond thecontext of Sufism, where theQūtis conventionally regarded as a paradigm of theearly mystical guidebook in Islam, together with two contemporary treatises:Kitāblumaʿfi’l-taṣawwuf(‘The Book of Sparkling Lights in Sufism’) by al-Sarrāj(d. 378/988), andKitāb al-taʿarruf li-madhhab ahl al-taṣawwuf(‘The Book ofAcquaintance with the Path of Sufis’) by al-Kalābādhī(d. ca. 385/995).9Ratherthan dealing exclusively with mysticism as we can see in the latter two works,al-Makkīfills his book with warnings and moral guidelines for believers based onan Islamic ethos. This view depends on the way in which we interpret al-Makkī’sunderstanding oftaṣawwuf,Sufism, which raises a further question of how weexamine Islamic mysticism.8 For detailed discussion of modern scholarship on al-Makkī, both centrally and partially, before 2010,see Chs 1 and 2 of my PhD thesis (Yazaki, pp. 10–52).9 E.g.Dimensions, p. 85; Khalil, p. 8.Introduction3"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The definition of the term‘Sufism’is beyond the scope of the present work;however, part of the title of Schimmel’s famous work,Mystical Dimensions ofIslam, would encapsulate the basic meaning of what I seek to convey by the terms‘Sufism’or‘Islamic mysticism’in this book. A mystical perspective is a way ofinterpretation of how the world works. Sufis may appear to pursue personalexperience with the Divine through internalisation of faith oblivious to the happen-ings in the external world. However, the personalissocial. A Sufiway of livinginevitably has an effect on every aspect of individual and communal life. As thestudy indicates, this understanding of mysticism accords with the teachings ofal-Makkī, which do not distinguish between the devotional manner of living ofaSufiand a Sufilifestyle. An examination of the nature of theQūtwithoutpigeonholing it as a Sufiwork, should problematise the way in which we studySufism and mysticism in general.Thirdly, through an exploration of the influence of al-Makkī, this book addressesthe complexity of Sufi–Ḥanbalīand Muslim–Jewish relations, which has oftenbeen obscured especially by the current political discourses. The tradition of anti-SufiḤanbalism receives some support from certainḤanbalīliterature and its imagehas been further strengthened by puritanical Saudi-Wahhābīpolicy, whose princi-ples are influenced by the prominentḤanbalīscholar Ibn Taymiyya. This, however,conflicts with the fact that the earliest extant Sufiorder was founded by a famousḤanbalīmystic,ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī(d. 561/1166).The long and rich history of the Judaeo-Islamic tradition has often been regardedas one of hostility, largely owing to the contemporary political conflict surroundingIsrael and Palestine. This, again, clashes with the idea of the‘Golden Age’in theJewish history, which is applied to the time in al-Andalus during the Islamicperiod.10The relationship between Sufism andḤanbalism on the one hand, andbetween Muslims and Jews on the other hand, thus shares a particular feature: theircomplexity and ambiguity are greatly affected by current political and ideologicaldiscourses. Through an examination of al-Makkī’sinfluence onḤanbalīscholarsand an Andalusian Jewish judge, this book seeks to shed a different light on thesepolarised views and give historical reference to them.Considering these three issues, I have divided the focus of the present study intonine chapters. Thefirst two chapters set the scene. Chapter 1 introduces al-Makkī’slife and works through an examination of a number of medieval biographicaldictionaries and modern studies. Chapter 2 introduces theQūtand situates it inits wider context through an exploration of the symbolism of the heart in variousreligious traditions, with special reference to Judaism, Christianity and the earlyhistory of Sufism. I then provide a detailed outline of the wholeQūtand discussal-Makkī’s manner of citation of the religious authorities.Chapters3 and 4 examine the role of the heart in the belief of al-Makkīthroughannotation and selective and paraphrastic translation of an extract from theQūt.Section 30 of the book is the only part where al-Makkīexplains the different10 E.g. Mannet al. (eds),Convivencia, New York: Jewish Museum, 1992, p. xi.4Introduction"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"functions which he attaches to the heart. The selection of this part of theQūtis notonly because it can sum up his spiritual teachings, but also because the symbolismof the heart plays a pivotal role in the theory of Sufism as well as in other culturesand religious traditions. The copy of theQūtused in this study is the 2001 editionby al-Raḍwānī.11Although not well known to researchers on Sufism, this appearsto be the only version to include descriptions of the manuscripts used in the editingprocess.12(See a list of modern editions of theQūtat the end of this section.) Thesummarised translation of the extract from theQūtprovided here will be thefirstEnglish translation based on this edition. At the end of Chapter 4, I compareal-Makkī’s religious teaching on the heart with those of several other Muslimthinkers.Based on a close examination of al-Makkī’s work and its intellectual context,Chapter 5 compares theQūtwith two tenth-century contemporary treatises, theLumaʿby al-Sarrāj andal-Taʿarrufby al-Kalābādhī. Modern-day studies ofSufism often glue these three works as the earliest encyclopaedic Sufitreatises.This chapter, however, will highlight the differences between them. It will chal-lenge the simplified estimation of theQūtas a Sufiwork only, through a discussionof the essential components of Islam as presented by al-Sarrāj and al-Kalābādhī.Thefirst part of this study lays emphasis on the nature of theQūtas a moral guideof Islamic devotion, relying heavily on theḤadīth rather than Sufisayings.However, the following two chapters examine the way in which he was knownchiefly among his fellow believers in pre-modern times as a writer on Sufism. Thediverse views on al-Makkīand his work will underline different interpretationsof the Sufiway among medieval Islamic scholars. Chapter 6first examines howal-Makkīis treated in notable medieval works on Sufism by scholars, such asal-Suhrawardī, Ibn al-ʿArabī,Rūmī, al-Rundī(d. 792/1390) and Jāmī(d. 898/1492).Despite their great debt to theQūt, however, well-known medieval Sufihagiogra-phies make no reference to al-Makkī. This chapter will then examine the way inwhich major biographical dictionaries andḤadīth literary works discuss al-Makkīover the period of around six centuries.Chapter 7 focuses on the influence of al-MakkīonḤanbalīscholars, which willchallenge the general picture ofḤanbalism as hostile towards Sufism due to itsheretical views of the Divine and its religious practices. I will analyse the evaluationof al-Makkīby four notableḤanbalīscholars from the eleventh to the fourteenthcentury who left literary works in thefields of Kalām, Sufism, historiography, lawand polemics. Thefirst is Ibn al-Farrāʾ(d. 458/1066), whose work on Kalāmappears to be the earliest extant source which mentions al-Makkī, and showsthe author’s heavy reliance on him. The second scholar is the well-knownḤanbalīmysticʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī, whose influential Sufiwork reveals his11 My sincere thanks go to al-Ustadh Irfan al-Misri of L’Institut français du Proche-Orient at Damascus,who made me aware of this edition, and Fadi al-Fatayri, who obtained this volume for me.12Qūt, vol. 1, pp. 19–23. The manuscripts that form the basis of this edition differ from those whichGramlich used in his complete German translation.Introduction5"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"great debt to al-Makkī’s teachings. The last twoḤanbalīscholars show morecomplicated attitudes towards al-Makkī. Ibn al-Jawzī, the author of a famousḤanbalīpolemic, demonstrates both criticism and acceptance of al-Makkīin hisworks. The same tendency can be seen in the renownedḤanbalīthinker IbnTaymiyya, who influenced the anti-SufiWahhābīmovement. Given the extensivefocus on Islamic piety in al-Makkī’s writing, it is not surprising to see his nameappearing in a wide range offields. The examination of the treatment of al-Makkīby these fourḤanbalīscholars reveals the complexity of the Sufi–Ḥanbalīrelation-ship, raising questions of the fundamental meaning of Sufism in the history of Islamand the way in which we study it.In order to situate al-Makkī’s moral teachings in a wider context beyond Sufism,and indeed even Islam, the focus of the last part of the book shifts from Islam toJudaism. Throughout the vast area of the Islamic empire, Arabic served as thelingua franca. This encouraged continuous interaction beyond faith borders and inmany places the Jewish adoption of Arabic as the vernacular and written language.In what Goitein famously called the‘Jewish–Arab symbiosis’,13there was adynamic interaction between Jewish and Islamic and/or Arabic writings, particu-larly in al-Andalus. In this study, I compare the works of al-Makkīand Ibn Bāqūdā,who wrote a Jewish moral guide which shows the great influence of Muslimliterature, and I will address the issue of his possible debt to al-Makkī’sQūt.Chapter 8first introduces Ibn Bāqūdāand his major work,al-Hidāya. ThisJudaeo-Arabic work became popular among Jews soon after its completion as thefirst systematic treatise on ethics. Due to its title, contents and terminology, severalscholars in Jewish studies have mentioned al-Makkī’sinfluence on this work;however, a systematic comparison has not yet been carried out. Chapter 9 thereforeanalyses the works of al-Makkīand Ibn Bāqūdāthrough an evaluation of their aims,structures and approaches, and then their religious views of the heart, whichunderpin both authors’thought. In concluding, I examine more closely this possiblelink between al-Makkīand Ibn Bāqūdāthrough the linguistic differences betweenArabic and Judaeo-Arabic, and the shared heritage between Judaism and Islam inthe context of intellectual and religious enquiry.Mysticism is generally considered to be universal; however, it expresses itself in alanguage within a specific cultural context. With different social locations anddimensions, Islamic mysticism has allowed its forms to be constantly changing.Regardless of the question of whether al-Makkīconsidered himself to be a Sufi,he employed certain terms often used by Sufis, and he argued within the frameworkof Islam. It is questionable whether theQūtshould be classified simply as a mysticalwriting; however, it is clear that the intended readership of al-Makkīwas his fellowMuslims. Despite this, his thought can be seen as transferable into intellectualand religious traditions beyond Islam. This might be partly because of the nature ofmysticism and monotheistic traditions.13 Goitein,Jews and Arabs, New York: Schocken Books, 1955, p. 131.6Introduction"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Throughout this book, an attempt is made to present al-Makkīin a multi-dimensional way, without pigeonholing him as a Sufior aḤadīth specialist, and toexamine how he has been viewed later, despite–or because of–the way he projectshimself in his writing. Through an exploration of the work and influence of al-Makkī,I hope this book will provide an opportunity to give further thought to the study ofSufism, the nature of mysticism and its relation to monotheistic faiths.Editions and translations of theQūtEditions of theQūtThere are nine modern editions of theQūt.

Although theeditor’s name does not appear in the 1997 version, the contents of the introductions are almost the samein the two copies, and it may be assumed that the editor of theQūt(1997) is also al-Kayyālī,whomadecorrections in spelling and added two extra pages to the original introduction in the 2005 edition.15 It appears that this edition is a reprint of the 1892–3 Cairo edition, as both have exactly the samepagination, font and design.Introduction7"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"al-Shushtarī(d. 1019/1610), a Shīʿīqāḍīin Lahore.16It is not obvious from thecontents of the book whether the author is Shīʿīor not.17As for the second work inthe margin, Shukri states that Muḥammad b. al-Asnāwīal-Shāfiʿī(d. 764/1363)produced a work entitledḤayāt al-qulūbfīkayfiyyat al-wuṣūl ila’l-maḥbūbinthe margin of theQūt, which was published in Cairo in 1310/1892–3.18Accordingto Brockelmann,Ḥayāt al-qulūbwas written by al-AsnawīʿImād al-Dīn (d. 764/1363) and published in the margin of theQūtin 1310/1892–3 in Cairo.19Thesecond title in the margin of the Damascus and Cairo editions seems to be the workthat both Shukri and Brockelmann mention.Differences among the modern editions are mainly in punctuation, auxiliarysigns, such asshaddaandhamza, the numbering of Qurʾanic verses and paragraphstructure. In the contents of theQūt, slight discrepancies can be seen in terminologyand numbering of sections. (Many copies incorporate the content of Section 34 intoSection 33 and skip the number 34. For Sections 1 to 32 and from Section 35 till theend, the same numbering system seems to be applied in all the editions.) There arealso variations in words and expressions throughout the main body of theQūt.Among the nine modern editions of theQūt, the 2001 edition of al-Raḍwānī(no. vi in the above list) is the only version which provides a description of themanuscripts and the modern edition used in editing.20This edition is the mostreliable and used throughout this book. Al-Raḍwānīusesfive manuscripts: twofrom Dār al-Kutub in Cairo and three from Turkey.21Among these, only onemanuscript–from Cairo–is complete.

At the beginning ofVolume 1, Gramlich provides a succinct introduction. It has to be pointed out that itis unexpectedly short compared to the massive work of Gramlich’s translation (onlythirteen pages long, including three pages in which he discusses the six manuscriptsand three modern editions used in his volumes).37After this rather unsatisfyingstart, Gramlich provides a translation of the wholeQūtin three volumes. In theprocess of translation, states Gramlich, an effort was made to keep as close tothe original text as possible. Unfortunately, this does not produce afluent Germanstyle and makes the translation difficult to read, as Gramlich himself admits.38As he also clearly points out, commentaries on the text are rarely added in histranslation.39TheNahrungmight be faithful to al-Makkī’s work, but it leavesdifficult words and unusual expressions, which need to be explained, unexplained.No identification is made either of the people who are cited in theQūt, althoughtheir death year in general appears in the index of theNahrung. These pointssometimes make theNahrungeven more difficult to understand, in addition toGramlich’s literal translation style.It is also regrettable that Gramlich omits all the doxologies and eulogies to God,the Prophet Muḥammad and deceased pious worshippers in hisNahrung. This isbecause of the significant variations among the manuscripts he used for histranslation, including regarding the use of eulogy.40Doxology, however, is partof the source text and should not be disregarded in the process of translation,especially when a translator tries to stay as close to the text as possible. The way inwhich doxology is used can also be a useful tool of analysis for scholars and it isdoubtful whether it is a translator’s choice to include it or not.Leaving aside these critical observations, it is undoubtedly useful that Gramlichprovides us with the sources ofḤadīth and sayings cited in theQūtthroughout theNahrung. He also often refers to al-Ghazālī’sIḥyāʾand al-Suhrawardī’sʿAwārifincomparison with theQūt. These references are meticulously carried out andsucceed in offering us plentiful sources for further research. In addition, he providesa well-selected bibliography and a helpful index in the last volume of theNahrung.41(It would have been more convenient if Gramlich had provided a listof Arabic terminologies in transliteration and separately from an index of propernames. They are mixed in the existing index, which is more than 200 pages long,and a trial-and-error process is required tofind Gramlich’s German rendering for agiven Arabic term.

Although al-Makkīappears in many biographical dictionaries, these reports are in general highlyrepetitive, and the weight of numbers does not count for a great deal in buildingup a picture of al-Makkī’s personal life. This section attempts to collate informationwhich is currently scattered across modern research on al-Makkī1and variousṭabaqātworks.The earliest extant book which mentions a personal account about al-Makkīseems to beTaʾrīkh Baghdād(‘The History of Baghdad’) by al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī(d. 463/1071).2This famous work contains a short but valuable sketch ofal-Makkī’s life, which is frequently quoted by later authors. Among other earlyaccounts, al-Makkīis also mentioned inal-Ansāb al-muttafiqa(‘HomonymousLineages’) by Ibn al-Qaysarānī(d. 507/1113),3al-Ansāb(‘Lineages’)byal-Samʿānī(d. 562/1166),4al-Muntaẓam fītaʾrīkh al-duwal wa’l-umam(‘Systematic Arrangement in the History of States and Communities’) by Ibnal-Jawzī(d. 597/1200)5and theWafayāt al-aʿyān(‘Obituaries of FamousPeople’) by Ibn Khallikān (d. 681/1282).6TheTaʾrīkh,al-Muntaẓamand theWafayātcan be said to be the key early sources for the life of al-Makkī, and theiraccounts are often cited in later literature.

This famouspreacher andḤadīth scholar writes in an account of al-Makkī:7Muḥammad b.ʿAlīb.ʿAṭiyya AbūṬālib is generally known as al-Makkī.Hecompiled a book entitledThe Nourishment of Heartsin Sufilanguage, whereinhe talked of objectionable and dishonourable (munkara wa mustashnaʿ)matters concerning the attributes [of God].

AbūṬāhirMuḥammad b.ʿAlīb. al-ʿAllāf related to me that AbūṬālib al-Makkīwas oneof the people of Jabal, brought up in Mecca, entered Basra after the death ofAbu’l-Ḥasan Ibn Sālim and became associated with his doctrine. He came toBaghdad and people gathered together [to hear] him preach, but then hebecame confused in his words. It was recorded of him that he said: Nothingis more harmful to the created beings than the Creator. People accused him ofheretical innovation and left him. Al-Makkīstopped preaching in JumādāII386.8Al-ʿAtīqīsaid that he was a virtuous man and diligent in worship.He produced literary works ontawḥīd.9Taʾrīkh Baghdādis often considered as one of thefirst general biographicaldictionaries, although al-Khaṭīb compiled theTaʾrīkhas a reference book forḤadīth scholars by providing numerousḤadīth transmitters. It may be deducedfrom the explanation of theQūtand the report of al-Makkī’s‘confused’statementthat he is probably not in favour with al-Khaṭīb. It should be mentioned here thatthere seems to have been open hostility between al-Khaṭīb and theḤanbalīs,10while al-Makkīshows great respect for Aḥmad IbnḤanbal (d. 241/855) and quotes7Taʾrīkh, vol. 3, p. 89.8 June/July 996 CE.9Tawḥīdis a key notion of Islam, which designates pure monotheistic belief, namely,‘an absolutedenial of anything being associated with God’(Theology, p. 67); cf.EI2, s.v.‘tawḥīd’(D. Gimaret).In Sufitradition, the active part of this concept, being the verbal nounwaḥḥada, is also emphasised,i.e.‘unification’and‘making into one’, as well as the declaration of Divine unity. A well-knowndefinition is given by al-Junayd who states thattawḥīdconsists in‘the separation of the Eternal fromthat which was originated in time’(Sufism (A), p. 57). He is also reported by Ibn Taymiyya to havesaid thattawḥīdis a‘saying of the heart’, whiletawakkul(total reliance on God) is a‘doing of theheart’(Theology, p. 173). Hujwīrīexplains three sorts oftawḥīd:‘God’s unification of God’,‘God’sunification of His creatures’and‘men’s unification of God’(Kashf, p. 278; see the whole chapter ontawḥīd, pp. 278–85). Since I cannotfind any English term which embraces all the implications oftawḥīd, the Arabic word is used throughout this book in order to avoid giving a misleading idea of therole of this essential notion in Sufism and Islam.10 Despite originally beingḤanbalī, al-Khaṭīb became associated himself with the Shāfiʿīschool, whichseems to have aroused the hatred of theḤanbalīs.

Sellheim).AbūṬālib al-Makkī13"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"him approximately a hundred times in theQūt.11This might have attracted toal-Makkīthe disfavour of al-Khaṭīb. Nonetheless, al-Khaṭīb selected al-MakkīinhisḤadīth reference work. This might suggest al-Makkī’s deep commitment toḤadīth, which has to be acknowledged in theTaʾrīkheven though the author doesnot appear to approve al-Makkī’s writing.Another important account of al-Makkīcan be seen in theMuntaẓam, written bythe famousḤanbalīscholar Ibn al-Jawzī. This history book contains obituaries atthe end of each year, which offer a useful source of biographical information. At theend of the year 386/996, Ibn al-Jawzīlists six grandees (akābir) who died in thisyear, including al-Makkī, whose account is the longest among them:12Muḥammad b.ʿAlīb.ʿAṭiyya AbūṬālib al-MakkīlearnedḤadīth fromʿAlīb.Aḥmad al-Maṣīṣī,AbūBakr al-Mufīd and others.ʿAbd al-ʿAzīzb.ʿAlīal-Ajzīand others reported on his authority. He was among the pious ascetics, andal-ʿAtīqīsaid: He was a virtuous and diligent man, and composed a book[which] he entitledThe Nourishment of Hearts. In it he quotedḤadīth [which]have no origin. He used to preach the people in the Friday mosque in Baghdad.ʿAlīb.ʿAbīd Allāh related to us from AbūMuḥammad al-Tamīmī[who] said:ʿAbd al-Ṣamad came to see AbūṬālib al-Makkīand blamed him for heterodoxsamāʿpractice. AbūṬālib then recited:O Night, how delightful you are!O Morning, if only you did not approach!ʿAbd al-Ṣamad left in anger....13I heard our Shaykh Abu’l-Qāsim Ismāʿīlb.Aḥmad al-Samarqandīsaying:I heard our Shaykh AbūʿAlīMuḥammad b.

I said: How do Ifind out [whether God has given you agood end]?

AbūṬālib died in JumādāII of thisyear.This account includes valuable anecdotes about al-Makkī. His response to thereproach for thesamāʿpractice and his deathbed story could be said to accordwith the typical image of Sufimasters.16The reader therefore may assume thathe was a SufiShaykh, although Ibn al-Jawzīdoes not use the term‘Sufi’in thedescription of al-Makkī. From thefirst paragraph of this narrative, however, theQūtcould be considered as a book ofḤadīth, or at least Ibn al-Jawzīgives theimpression that this is a Tradition-based work. In theQūt, al-Makkīquotes IbnḤanbal and agrees with his approach toḤadīth that the contents of the report aremore important than having accurate phrasing or accurate information of its chainof authorities.17Although beingḤanbalīhimself, al-Makkī’s attitude towardsTradition does not seem to match that of Ibn al-Jawzī, whose criticism againstal-Makkī’s use of weakḤadīth appears in his other work.18(This issue is treatedlater in Chapter 7.)Another key source of al-Makkī’s life can be found in the famous comprehensiveṭabaqātwork, theWafayāt, compiled by the chief judge of Syria Ibn Khallikān.This Shāfiʿīscholar collects reports of numerous Muslims for this voluminousbiographical dictionary. In a narrative of al-Makkī, Ibn Khallikān relates:19AbūṬālib Muḥammad b.ʿAlīb.ʿAṭiyya, al-Ḥārithīal-Wāʿiẓal-Makkīis theauthor of the book,The Nourishment of Hearts. He was a pious man anddiligent in worship. He used to speak in the Friday mosque and he has literaryworks ontawḥīd. He was not one of the people of Mecca. He was one of thepeople of Jabal but lived in Mecca, and he was called [al-Makkī] after it. Heused to perform devotionalpractices20to a large extent. In the end, it was saidthat he abandoned food for a while and restricted himself to eating permittedherbs; then his skin became green from taking a large portion of them.He met a group of masters of theḤadīth and knowledge of the Way,21and helearned from them. He entered Basra after the death of Abu’l-Ḥasan Ibn Sālim15 Or: when his bier was taken out.16 Ibn Kathīr reports a very similar account concerning thesamāʿpractice and the deathbed (al-Bidāyawa’l-nihāya, Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyya, 1988, vol. 11, p. 341). Al-Dhahabīalso tells an almostsame story about al-Makkī’s death (Taʾrīkh (381), pp. 127–8).17Qūt, vol. 1, pp. 486–8.18Talbīs, pp. 164–5.

It should be mentioned that althoughIbn Khallikān cites from a report in Ibn al-Qaysarānī’sAnsābregarding al-Makkī’sproblematic saying, he does not include al-Khaṭīb’s disapproving comments on theQūt, which can be seen in theAnsāb. He gives a more detailed description about thedeath date of al-Makkī, hisnisbaand his grave. Apart from al-Makkī’s statementabout the Creator, on which none of those compilers makes any comment, IbnKhallikān’s report seems to be generally approving from the way of his describingal-Makkī.Based on these narratives of al-Makkī, let us reconstruct his life story. AbūṬālibMuḥammad b.ʿAlīb.ʿAṭiyya al-Ḥārithīal-Wāʿiẓal-Makkīwas born in Jabal. Theexact birthplace and date are unknown. Jabal, or Jibāl, is a large area between Iraq andKhurasan and is also calledʿIrāqal-ʿajam,orʿIrāqʿajamī, i.e., Persian or non-ArabIraq.26Apart from al-Ḥārithīand al-Wāʿiẓ, he has anothernisba,al-ʿAjamī,27which is22 Ibn Khallikān here quotes from an account of al-Makkīinal-Ansāb al-muttafiqa. This is aboutal-Makkī’s apparent problematic saying, which Ibn al-Qaysarānīcites from theTaʾrīkh.23 27 June 996 CE.24 According to de Slane, it is the eastern side of the Tigris (vol. 3, p. 21).25 Khalil argues a great influence of Sahl al-Tustarīon al-Makkī’s diet exercise (Khalil, pp. 13–15). Thisstory is also somewhat similar to a description in a letter of al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrīto the caliphʿUmar b.ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz:‘the skin of [Moses’] belly shewed as green as grass because of it all’(cited inSufism(A), p. 34).26 This region has a number of large cities, such as Hamadhan, Isfahan and so on; Yāqūt,Kitābmuʿjamal-buldān, Leipzig: F.A.

Al-Makkīis commonly known by this lastnisba,orhiskunya,AbūṬālib.Many sources indicate that al-Makkīgrew up in Mecca, where he received hisearly education. He then left for Basra, one of the greatest intellectual and com-mercial centres at that time. None of the biographical dictionaries suggests thepossible date when he departed from Mecca. According to al-Khaṭīb, Ibn al-Jawzīand Ibn Khallikān, al-Makkīentered Basra after the death of Abu’l-Ḥasan AḥmadIbn Sālim (d. ca. 356/967), a leader of the Sālimiyya school.28This report, however,contradicts other biographical accounts,29as well as the testimony of al-Makkīhimself, who mentions his personal meetings with Ibn Sālim.30Although it is notclear whether al-Makkīentered before or after the death of Ibn Sālim,31or they metwhen al-Makkīwas in Mecca,32it seems certain that al-Makkīaffiliated himselfwith the Sālimites.Al-Sālimiyya is a mystico-theological school at Basra. Its doctrine is based onthe teachings of Sahl al-Tustarī(d. 283/896), and its name is drawn from hisdisciples, AbūʿAbd AllāhMuḥammad Ibn Sālim (d. 297/909) and his sonAḥmad Ibn Sālim. No writing of the father or the son is known and this schoolhas been mainly represented by their opponents’views. The most famous exampleis theḤanbalīscholar Ibn al-Farrāʾ, who lists eighteen propositions againstal-Sālimiyya.33As Massignon argues, the Sālimīteachings may be sought inal-Makkī’s writing, as theQūtisfilled with the sayings of Sahl al-Tustarī, who isoften referred to with an honorific title.34Although al-Makkī’s relationship withthis school seems to be close, the extent of representation of the Sālimīteachingsin theQūtremains unclear.35His role in the group is not clear either. Al-Makkīmight have been the head of the school.36In medieval sources, the famous Shāfiʿī28Taʾrīkh, vol. 3, p. 89;Muntaẓam, vol. 7, p. 189;Talbīs, p. 165;Wafayāt, vol. 4, p. 303.29ʿIbar, vol. 2, p. 320; al-Yāfiʿī,Mirʾāt al-janān wa-ʿibrat al-yaqẓān, Hyderabad: Maṭbaʿat al-Maʿārif,1918–19, vol. 2, p. 430.30Qūt, vol. 3, pp. 1202, 1318.31 This issue is mentioned by Gramlich (Nahrung, vol. 1, p. 11) and Böwering (Vision, p. 26).

In addition to his commitment tothe group, al-Makkī’s wider activities in Basra are not known to us.Al-Makkī, then, went to Baghdad, which was under Shīʿite Buwayhid control atthe time. The year of his move cannot befixed with precision. He started to preachthere and is reported to have said something apparently so heretical that people lefthim. His exact words are recorded as follows:‘Nothing is more harmful to thecreated beings than the Creator.’38De Slane, commenting on this, suggeststhe possibility that al-Makkīmeant‘the world (khalq)’but mispronounced it as‘the Creator (khāliq)’.39Gramlich argues that if this is really a saying of al-Makkī, he was probablyreferring to God’s omnipotence, i.e., that God alone is the Doer and that ultimatelyno created beings can carry out any action which has an actual effect or causesdamage. According to Gramlich, al-Makkīignored the basic rule that one must notspeak truth in front of the masses.40ʿAṭā, the editor of al-Makkī’s alleged workʿIlmal-qulūb(‘The Knowledge of Hearts’), seems to agree with al-Makkī’s saying,though slightly stretches its meaning to the effect that it is the lack of morals inthe knowledge of the Creator that is most harmful to the created beings.41Al-Raḍwānīalso makes a comment on this statement and stresses that ignoranceabout Divine knowledge has serious consequences for the believer.42Thisapparently problematic saying seems to have been originally reported byal-Khaṭīb, who was not entirely in favour of al-Makkī.43Later authors simplyrepeat this account without adding any comments. None of these biographersprovides the context of this statement and it appears to be impossible to examinethis issue further.After his‘confused’utterance, it is reported that al-Makkīstopped preaching anddied in 386/996.44His deathbed story is similar to an anecdote in theQūt.45Al-Makkī’s body was interred in the Mālikīcemetery in Baghdad, and Ibn Kathīr(d. 774/1373) reports that his tomb was outside Jāmiʿal-Ruṣāfa.46According to LeStrange, the secondʿAbbāsid caliph, al-Manṣūr (r. 136–58/754–75), built a quarteron the eastern bank of the Tigris, opposite the Round City, in 151/768, which37ʿIbar, vol. 3, p. 34.38قلاخلانمرضأنيقولخملاىلعسيل;Taʾrīkh, vol. 3, p. 89 (and others).39 De Slane, vol. 3, p. 21.40Nahrung, vol. 1, p. 12.

These are AbūSaʿīd Ibn al-Aʿrābī(d. 341/952),52AbūʿAlīKirmānī53and Muẓaffar b. Sahl,54each of whomal-Makkīcalls Shaykh. The latter twofigures are not well known,55while Ibnal-Aʿrābīis a renownedḤadīth scholar, jurist and mystic in tenth-century Mecca.During his stay in Baghdad, Ibn al-Aʿrābībecame affiliated with prominent Sufis,including al-Junayd (d. 298/910) andʿAmr al-Makkī(d. 291/903 or 297/909).Originally from Basra, Ibn al-Aʿrābībecame one of the most influential teachers inMecca and left many books and disciples.56Al-Makkīmentions Ibn al-Aʿrābī’sbook,Kitābṭabaqāt al-nussāk, in theQūt, and quotes his praise for al-Junayd.57Itis not certain whether al-Makkīreceived guidance from the above-listedfigures47 Le Strange,Baghdad during the Abbasid Caliphate, London: OUP, 1924, pp. 187–9.48 The Khayzurān became thefirst Muslim cemetery in the eastern city, which housed the tombs of AbūḤanīfa and the laterʿAbbāsid Caliphs.

As Amin argues, thisfigure seems to be AbūZayd al-Marwazī(d. 371/982), who was a Shāfiʿīscholar and taught Tradition,especially al-Bukhārī’sṢaḥīḥcollection, in Baghdad and Mecca.58Al-Dhahabīalso mentions him in an account of al-Makkī(see below a section on works of al-Makkī).59IbnḤajar and al-Khaṭībreportthatal-MakkīnarratedḤadīth with thepermission ofʿAbd Allāhb.Jaʿfar Ibn Fāris (d. 346/957),ʿAlīb.

No historical sources indicate al-Makkī’s possible school of law. One of histeachers, AbūZayd al-Marwazī,isaShāfiʿīscholar, while another teacher, al-Mufīd,is reported to have dictatedal-Muwaṭṭāʾof Mālik b.

Amin also claims thatal-Makkīmentions in theQūtthat he learned from AbūBakr al-Marwazī(d. 298/910), who was,according to Amin, a disciple of IbnḤanbal (Amin, p. 3). Al-Makkīrefers to thisfigure several timesin connection with IbnḤanbal; however, al-Marwazīseems to have died in 275/888 (not 298/910)and al-Makkīdoes not seem to call him Shaykh (Nahrung, vol. 4, p. 62 [index]). It is not certainwhether this al-Marwazīwas really a teacher of al-Makkī. Considering the fact that IbnḤanbal diedin 241/855, 275/888 might be more plausible for the death year of al-Marwazī.59Taʾrīkh (381), p. 128.60 IbnḤajar al-ʿAsqalānī,Lisān al-mīzān, Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyya, 1996, vol. 5, p. 298;Taʾrīkh, vol. 3, p. 89.61Nahrung, vol. 4 [index].62Taʾrīkh (381), p. 128.63Qūt, vol. 1, p. 6 (the editor does not mention the source of this information).

This seems to support Amin’s argument. However, al-Dhahabī,who adhered to the Shāfiʿīschool, consulted al-Makkī’sḤadīth collection, andthis might indicate the possiblemadhhabof al-Makkīas Shāfiʿī. Bin Ramli arguesthat al-Makkīcan be considered to have been‘somewhere between’the ShāfiʿīandḤanbalīschools, as one of the leading jurists with whom al-Makkīhada contact in Mecca, AbūBakr Muḥammad b.Ḥusayn al-Ājurrī(d. 360–970), isclaimed by both schools.70Massignon argues, on the other hand, that the Sālimīsare followers of Mālikīthought in matters of jurisprudence.71On the whole, it is notcertain which school of law al-Makkīfollows. It is not clear either to what extentallegiance to amadhhabwas important to al-Makkī, since in the history of Islamicjurisprudence, the fourth/tenth century is generally considered as the beginning ofthe development of legal schools.72(See the end ofChapter2 for furtherdiscussion.)As Ibn Khallikān reports,73al-Makkīprobably also learned the mystical way oflife while he was in Mecca and Basra from, directly or indirectly, Ibn al-Aʿrābīand Ibn Sālim, the son. Thus, it may be deduced that al-Makkīstudied theBaghdadi tradition of Sufism, represented by al-Junayd, and the teachings of Sahlal-Tustarī.Melchert argues that most of the early Sufis are also transmitters ofḤadīth andrecognised as such until around the end of the second–third/ninth century whenSufism andḤadīth started to separate from each other, and fewer and fewer Sufiswere remembered asḤadīth transmitters afterwards.74However, al-Makkī, whodied in 386/996, still appears inḤadīth literature. In line with what has been set outin this section, it should be pointed out that although he is generally regarded as aSufiwriter, attention ought also to be paid to his expertise onḤadīth.

Renard translates the wholesentence as‘you sought a clarification of a question posed for you by the book ofAbūṬālib, that healing treatise’.88Renard takesal-bayān al-shāfīas apposition tokitābAbīṬālibas Derenbourg does but with the latter meaning theQūt, not anotherbook of al-Makkī. This interpretation seems to make the most sense, consideringthe grammar, the contents of the letter and the fact that al-Rundīvalues theQūtso much that he would describe it as healing. (Although different wording,al-Rundī, for example, states that theQūtremoves‘maladies (ʿilal)’and‘healsillness (yubriʾmaraḍ)’.)89Noṭabaqātliterature seems to mention this allegedwork, and until further evidence appears, it would not be so absurd to concludenow thatal-Bayān al-shāfīdoes not exist.A collection of fortyḤadīthWith regard to the second possible writing, a collection ofḤadīth, al-Dhahabīstatesin an account of al-MakkīinTaʾrīkh al-Islām(‘The History of Islam’) as follows:90I have seen [a collection of] fortyḤadīth by AbūṬālib in his hand writing.

It alsostresses the importance of having right intention (niyya) and provides detailedexamples on this matter. As can be seen in theQūt, theʿIlmcovers both internaland external aspects of religion, and discusses several essential concepts of theQurʾān, such astawḥīdand purification of faith (ikhlāṣ), but its coverage is not asextensive as theQūt.The treatment of theʿIlmvaries according to scholars. Brockelmann and Sezginenumerate the manuscripts of both theQūtand theʿIlmunder the name of al-Makkī92and some scholars follow their view,93while others argue that theʿIlmis not a workof al-Makkī.94Some scholars mention only theQūtas al-Makkī’s work and do notrefer to theʿIlmat all.95This is probably because theʿIlmis not as well known a workas theQūtis, and also a modern edition of theʿIlmwas not available until 1964. (Thefirst modern edition of theQūtwas published in 1892–3. It should also be mentionedthat only two manuscripts of theʿIlmhave been found so far, while around fortymanuscripts are available for theQūt.)TheʿIlmhas not been explored extensively and its authenticity has beensometimes questioned. Although the definite evidence cannot be provided due toa paucity of sources, it appears that theʿIlmwas not originally written byal-Makkī’s own pen, judging from the different pattern in citation of religiousauthorities and writing style between theQūtand theʿIlm. Considering the con-tents, theʿIlmseems to have been complete by a few decades after al-Makkī’sdeath. The work greatly reflects al-Makkī’s thought and other religious authoritiesuntil the time of writing, and it still offers interesting materials in the study ofIslamic spirituality in the fourth/tenth andfifth/eleventh centuries.9691 Al-Raḍwānīmentions a collection of fortyḤadīth in his list of al-Makkī’s work, with reference toal-Dhahabī.

This book includes biographical accounts of the Prophetand the Shīʿite Imāms with an additional chapter on the twelve Imāms by thetranslator.101Shukri does not explain the reason for his refutation of Storey’sstatement; however, given the fact that al-Makkīdoes not specifically refer toShīʿite Imāms in theQūt, it seems unlikely that he compiled a book on ShīʿiteImāms.102Apart from Storey and Shukri, nobody (includingṭabaqātcompilers)appears to discuss this alleged work of al-Makkī.Qūt al-qulūbIt is safe to say that al-Makkī’s fame lies solely in this sixth work, theQūt.

Theemphasis is placed on God-fearing ways of thinking, which ought to be the basis ofexternal conduct, and the importance of the internal aspects of religion (i.e. piousactivities in the heart), not only bodily outward actions. Al-Makkī’s main (andpossibly only) concern in his writing seems to be the ways in which a Muslimbecomes a better believer. This involves various levels of human life, since atrue believer requires a proper disposition both inwardly and outwardly. As thetitle suggests, theQūtis written for novices and arranged accordingly. TheQūtmaybe described as a spiritual manual for a code of behaviour based onḤadīth andcanonisation, as Renard puts it, of the way of pious ancestors as the model forbelievers.107(For the contents of theQūt, see Chapter 2.)Tafsīr(interpretation) of the QurʾānWith regard to the seventh work of al-Makkī, thetafsīr, Shihāb al-Dīn al-Khafājī(d. 1069/1659)108apparently mentions al-Makkī’s thorough knowledge of theQurʾān and his voluminous work ontafsīr.109According to a footnote of the103GAL, vol. 1, p. 217.104GAS, vol. 1, p. 667.105 Al-Qāsimī,al-Waʿḍal-maṭlūb min Qūt al-qulūb, Beirut: Dār al-Bashāʾir al-Islāmiyya, 2000.106 According to Weismann, for instance, a root of Salafism lies in‘the revivalist Sufitradition of theprevious centuries’(‘The politics of popular religion: Sufis, Salafis, and Muslim Brothers in20th-century Hamah’,International Journal of Middle East Studies37, no. 1, Feb. 2005, p. 39).107Knowledge, p. 112; Renard states that al-Makkī‘prominently canonises’the way of past masters,but‘consistently argues for aflexibility and vitality in that traditionalist paradigm that will surprisemany twenty-first century readers’.108 Amin explains that al-Khafājīis one of the‘first historians to mention al-Makkī’, as he believes thatal-Khafājīdied in 451/1059, and claims that al-Khafājī’s work (see below) is no longer extant (Amin,p. 21); however, this is a wrong statement.

It is especially unfortunate because this seems to be the only work whichmentions al-Makkī’s allegedtafsīr.Apart from this, and Shukri and Amin, who discuss it on the basis of this footnote,no other scholars orṭabaqātcompilers seem to have mentioned al-Makkī’s possiblewriting of a Qurʾanic interpretation.111As a supporting argument for the existence ofthis work, Amin refers to the famousḤadīth scholar and Qurʾanic exegete Jalālal-Dīnal-Suyūṭī(d. 911/1505), who uses al-Makkī’s argument onijtihādin hiswork.112Amin does not state, however, whether al-Suyūṭīmentions al-Makkī’salleged work ontafsīr, and it cannot be assumed from this argument that this writingexists.

Consequently, it does not seem to be entirely convincing to categorisetheʿIlmas a book ontawḥīd, regardless of whether this is al-Makkī’s writing or not.All the other above-mentioned possible works of al-Makkīdo not appear to discusstawḥīdin an extensive way, and, as there is no other material to examine on thismatter, we have to wait for the appearance of further evidence to expand on it.On the whole, among the eight writings attributed to al-Makkī, a book onḥajj, thetafsīr, theḤadīth collection and some works ontawḥīdseem to have been lost to us.110Qūt (1932), vol. 1, p. 3 n. 1.111 Shukri, pp. 49–50; Amin, p. 35.112 Al-Suyūṭī,Taqrīr al-istinādfītafsīr al-ijtihād, introduction and annotation by FuʾādʿAbdal-Munʿim Aḥmad, Alexandria, 1983, pp. 36–37 (cited in Amin, p. 52 n. 128).113Taʾrīkh, vol. 3, p. 89.

The authenticity of theʿIlmis highly questionable, although it stillreflects al-Makkī’s teachings. This makes theQūtthe only major book which canbe the subject of the study of al-Makkītoday. Apart from a Shīʿite compilation, theNuzul, the topics which have been associated with al-Makkīare religious matters(especiallytawḥīd) and rituals. The list of his works also shows his (possible) greatknowledge of the Qurʾān andḤadīth. This would help understand the directions inwhich his intellectual curiosity took him, or at least indicate the kind of imagewhich has been projected on him by later authors.Having set the scene for the present study, I would like to emphasise two pointswhich underlie this book. Firstly, the study of al-Makkīand his relation withSufis and with IbnḤanbal andḤanbalīscholars would illuminate the change ofintellectual currents in the early history of Islam. It is quite possible that the basiccomponents of Islam were perceived differently at the time of al-Makkīfrom whatwe would expect nowadays, particularly regarding such matters as the four Sunnimadhhabs, Sunni–Shīʿa relations and the Sufiorders, which had not yet beenrigidly established in the fourth/tenth century. Before the classification of religioussciences and the formalisation of mystical paths, leading an austere lifestyle and thenarration ofḤadīth may have been enough for the sign of a pious believer.However, the idea of‘piety’seems to have kept changing in the course of history.Al-Makkī’s core idea (Chapters3–4), the characteristics of theQūtin comparisonwith two contemporary Sufitreatises (Chapter 5) and the treatment of his writingin various later works (Chapters6–7) will demonstrate diverse opinions ondevoutness in Islam among leading Muslim thinkers.Secondly–what did Sufism mean to al-Makkī? Whatever the author’s intentionwas, theQūthas been widely read among Sufis. Mystics may sound like those whocompletely dismiss worldly affairs in their role as seekers after the Truth. However,this does not seem to be the case in relation to mystics in Islam, or in theQūtat least.Religion is multi-dimensional. Islam exists not only in the mind of the believer orin the texts, but also in the social environment. Only believing is not enough infaith. It has to come with doing. TheQūtteaches how a believer ought to live, as thisworld is a test from God and believers cannot and should not disregard it. Thisobservance of religion as a way of life is certainly a general concern beyond Sufism,and beyond Islam. This issue will be explored in the last two chapters.28AbūṬālib al-Makkī"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"2Qūt al-qulūb: its religious context,contents and sourcesThe heart is frequently featured as a salient spiritual symbol in various cultures.InQūt al-qulūb, al-Makkīemploys the heart as a moral judge and the linkagebetween the human and the Divine. In order to situate this work in its wider context,this chapterfirst discusses the symbolism of the heart in various religious traditions,especially in Judaism and Christianity. It goes on to analyse the mystical idea of theheart in the early history of Sufism. After exploring the religious and historicalcontext of theQūt, this chapter provides a detailed outline of the whole work anddiscusses the pattern of the citation of the religious authorities in theQūtin order toanalyse its characteristics with its strong moral focus.The heart as a metaphysical entityMany cultures attach at least twofold roles to the heart: a physiological entityas the sole organ pumping blood around the body and a metaphorical capacity asthe seat of emotion. Even after modern science proved the potency of the brain,the symbolic values attached to the heart remain deeply rooted in our everydaylanguage. In English it is the heart, not the brain, which can be cold or warm, lostand broken. The heart can be made of gold or stone, and it even has a string whichcan be touched. The heart is still usually considered to be representative of one’strue character, despite thousands of cardiac transplantations performed each year.Until the introduction of the idea of brain death, and probably even after this, theheartbeat has been the decisive measure of life. Social and cultural roles of a bodilymember often correspond to the understanding of its corporeal function. The heartis sometimes considered to be a bridge between this world and the hereafter, and thephysical realm and the spiritual sphere, with a wide range of emotional, intellectual,ethical, religious and mystical meanings.For example, as the source of life, the heart was famously sacrificed by the Aztecand the Maya. The ancient Egyptians believed that the heart had to be kept in themummified corpse, so that the goddess Maat could weigh it against the feather oftruth to make a judgement on the suitability of afterlife of the dead. The justified and"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"purified heart would then be united with a god, as in Books of Breathing:‘Yourheart is the heart of Re’.1The importance of the heart can also be found in Daoism and Buddhism,whose central teachings do not include the idea of the divine being a completelydifferent entity from the human. According to Daoism, the heart of the human,rénxīn, and the heart of Dao,dàoxīn, can be rejoined after achieving internaland external harmony. The heart, as the centre of a human and the master of thebody, is to be emptied byfinding Real Emptiness in every existence in order toharmonise with the body and the surroundings.2Buddhist texts also emphasisestrong connection between the inward and outward states. The heart is treatedas both the physical organ and the mental basis of consciousness and thought. Itis also the seat of emotion which should be controlled. Purifying the heart islike untying knots in the heart which are made by unrestrained emotions.The genuine purity of external actions is the result of this internal purificationprocess.3Hinduism, too, treats the heart as not only representative of various aspects ofhuman life, but also the link with the divine. According toŚvetāśvatara Upaniṣad,Supreme Soul, who always abides in the heart, is revealed only by the heart,discernment and meditation.4The heart is the place of all beings, hence, as inChāndogya Upaniṣad, those who know the heart, have the true knowledge (satya),which can see the real through the veil of the illusory.5The heart is thus consideredto be the path from the unreal to the real, the present to the future, and, according toBṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, the mortal to the immortal. This unification happenswhen all desires in the heart have been emptied, and all differences have beenvanished. Within the heart, lives the soul. Through ascetic practices, the soulilluminates the heart, which is the site of faith and truth.6Despite this variety of metaphorical images of the heart in theUpaniṣads,7theheart is also treated as a corporeal entity in Hinduism. It is in nowhere other than thebody. As the tongue is the organ of taste, the heart is the organ of knowledge. Beingcorporeal, the heart is needed to be nourished to feed the material soul from whichthe higher soul can be nourished. The heart in Hinduism is like a mirror. By keepingit shining, it can reflect True Being which is already in the heart.

In the Bible, theword‘heart (Heb.lev,Gkkardia)’appears approximately a thousand times.9Among them, according toŠpidlík, only around ten times is it used as a corporealorgan.10It appears to be, however, difficult to have precise numbers, since insome cases what is implied in the English term‘heart’is different from whatlevdesignates in the Bible. For example, as a physiological sense,levin BiblicalHebrew can also mean breast, throat, and something inside the body in modernEnglish.11In a metaphorical sense in the Hebrew Bible, emotions and thoughthappen in the interior of the body–most often inlev, but also in the kidneys and thebowels.12Considering these semantic varieties,levcannot be always translatedas the‘heart’straightforwardly. However, in thefigurative meaning at least, the‘heart’andlevboth imply the principal seat of emotion and intellect in the HebrewBible. Both are regarded as the centre of religious and moral life.In the New Testament, the Greek termkardiareplaceslev.Kardia(orstēthosandthumos) in the ancient Greek world is the place of feelings and knowledge. Whetherintelligence (nous) belongs to the heart depends on philosophers; for instance, theEpicureans and Stoics think it does, while Aristotle inThe Nicomachean Ethicsthinks not.13In the New Testament writings, the termkardiatakes on the Semiticmeaning oflev, designating the inner self.Kardiais now responsible for what ishappening both spiritually and intellectually.14Being the seat of will and religious life, the heart in the Bible can be hardened asthe result of disobedience to God. As in Psalms‘Harden not your heart, as in theprovocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness’(95:8; cf. Heb 3:8),humans are responsible for resistance to obeying God’s will (e.g. 2 Chr 36:13; Prv28:14).15Jesus disapproves of his disciples who fail to‘perceive’or‘understand’8Upaniṣads, vol. 2, see esp.

It is the heart where God poured loveinto (Rom 5:5) and it is the place where believers should seek to see the Divinequality (Ps 27:8).JudaismIn the Talmud, the heart often appears in ethical teachings. Following the Biblicalview, the rabbis regard the heart as the seat of all emotions, including good and bad.God created both good impulse (or inclination,yezer) and evil impulse inhumans.18Both are God’s creation. Accordingly the verse‘thou shalt love theLord thy God with all thine heart’(Dt 6:5) is interpreted as with both good and evilimpulses. The heart is often used as a synonym ofyezer, which has the power towill. In the Bible, humans are composite of body and soul, and both are equallybreathed into by the spirit of God. The rabbis do not take a position that one of themis sinfully earthy and the other is purely celestial. When humans commit sin, it is ajoint responsibility, since both have to be controlled and improved. The nature ofthe heart should be also understood as a whole.19The great philosopher Saʿadya Gaon (d. 942) regards the heart as the core of boththe spiritual and corporeal nature of the human.20The heart is where wisdom islocated, although it can be distracted by too much sexual intercourse.21In hisfamousDalālat al-ḥāʾirīn(‘The Guide of the Perplexed’), Maimonides (d. 1204)explains the heart,lev, as the basis which also signifies thought (fikra), conception(raʾy), will (irāda) and reason (ʿaql).22All physical and mental powers originatefrom the heart and it is crucial for worshippers to aim at God as the sole objective ofboth internal and external conduct.23The Kabbalists also believe that the heart hasto be contemplating God all the time whatever actions the body engages. Mysticalcleaving to God,devekut(cf. Dt 13:4), can be achieved through uniting theindividual will with the Divine will in the purified heart.

Ex 28:3)’and‘those whoknow,ha-yodeʾim’.24The heart in Judaism is thus the meeting point of the Divine and the human, thespiritual and the corporeal, and a microcosm of the whole personality which hasboth wicked and righteous sides. In order to serve God right with‘all your heart’(Dt 11:13), prayer is referred to as the service of the heart (Berakoth, TalmudJerusalemi 4:1). Believers are to improve the quality of their faith by controllingbody and mind. In doing so, having proper intention (kavvanah) is crucial, since areligious obligation can be fulfilled when the heart is directed appropriately(Berakoth 2:1). Ibn Bāqūdā’s choice of the title,The Right Guidance to theReligious Duties of Hearts, cannotfit better in this context.ChristianityFollowing Hebrew Biblical teachings, Christianity also regards the heart as the centreof one’s whole being and the core of faith. Sayings of the Desert Fathers in fourth-century Egypt reflect this image. For example Abba Poemen said,‘Teach your mouthto say what is in your heart’and‘Do not give your heart to that which does not satisfyyour heart.’25The attention of the heart should be always towards God. Referring toSatan’s challenges to Job’s integrity, John the Dwarf (d. ca. 339) explained the sourceof his strength coming from the heart which has what is‘of God’.26Abba Pambo(d. ca. 373) further confirms it by saying,‘If you have a heart, you can be saved.’27Various methods emerged to improve the quality of the heart, most notably,among the Desert Fathers, prayer. Methods of prayer developed between thefifthand eighth centuries deeply influenced Eastern Christianity. The central concern ofprayer is the achievement of stillness (hēsuchia) in the heart by putting away allthoughts, so that the intellect becomes free from shackles of form and division, andthe difference between the object of thought and the subject will be transcended.28‘Pray without ceasing’is a command which St Paul gave to the Thessalonians(1 Th 5:17). Prayer here is not usually interpreted as vocal prayer.29It is not onlybecause it is physically impossible to pursue. In Orthodox Christianity, prayer isusually understood to have three stages: of the lips, of the mind and of the heart.30Jesus prayer is a means to achieve the inner tranquillity of the heart. This unbrokenhēsuchiais unceasing worship of God who must be remembered even while asleep.24EJ,s.v.‘kabbalah’(M. Idel).25The Sayings of the Desert Fathers, Oxford: A.R.

When the heart is cleared from all thoughts and reaches the state ofcomplete quiet, Jesusfills the heart with light as the inner mirror reflects Divinequality.32Syriac Christians are also known to have used the image of the polishedmirror of the heart as clearly reflecting God’s beauty. They lay stress on Divine lightand love, and practise fasting and recollection of the Divine name.33In Christianity, the heart is not only the central concern of moral life for believers,but became also the target of their devotion. The Sacred Heart of Jesus started to bevenerated in the early medieval time especially in Catholicism. (This devotion canalso be found in Celtic Christianity.) The object of this devotion isfirst of all thecorporeal heart of Jesus during his mortal life. This heart offlesh is also stronglylinked to the eternal love of crucified God. It seems to be Anselm (d. 1109) whofirstclaimed to have seen the pierced heart of Jesus as proof of His suffering and love.34Jesus’heart has been shown to various worshippers whose wish gradually formedinto a passionate and mystical desire of losing themselves into His heart. Forinstance, the famous nun of the Visitandine order, St Margaret Mary Alacoque(d. 1690), states her experience during thefirst of the four great apparitions of Jesus:‘He disclosed to me the marvels of His love and the unutterable secrets of HisSacred Heart...He demanded my heart...He took it from my breast and plunged itinto His own adorable Heart.’35Later on, devotions to the Sacred Heart of Mary(Immaculate Heart of Mary) came to be observed as the model of love for God.Concerning the potential connection with God, Blaise Pascal (d. 1662) alsofamously declares that it is the heart which‘feels God’, not reason.36Reason isuseful until a certain point but in the end, according to Pascal, it is God who makesthe heart feel Him and inclines it to believe, as in Psalms,‘Incline my heart unto thytestimonies’(119:36).37The heart is thus to be looked after, as a recipient of Divinegrace and a representative of one’s true character. As can be seen in other traditions,the heart in Christianity is treated as a sensible, physical part of the body and yet ahighly spiritual entity. It seems to be the only part which can be truly pure to receivethe boundless love of God.As a corporeal organ, the heart is a sole entity. Its symbolic meaning, however, ismultifarious. While different shades of emphasis exist, a number of commonfeatures can be seen in the metaphorical images of the heart in various traditions;31 Idem,‘Jesus prayer’, p. 183.32 Ibid., pp. 182–3; idem,‘“Pray without ceasing”’, pp. 258–9.

The heart is considered to be the path from the mortal to the immortal, andthe unreal to the real. As the core of a whole existence, the heart is generally used asopposed to physicality (e.g. bodily conduct, earthly desires, mortality); however,not completely opposed to divinity. Divine vision is reflected only in the mirror ofthe heart, which can be polished through various practices, such as prayer andself-renunciation.Smith points out that the teaching of purification of the heart in Islam has its tracein the New Testament.38Religious movements, as social phenomena, have influ-enced each other in the course of history as any human activities do. It would not betherefore surprising if al-Makkīwas inspired by believers of other faiths in writingof theQūt. However, many other religious traditions also use strikingly similarimages of the heart. This sense of commonality deepened when I saw a series ofthree etchings by Anton Wierix (d. 1624) who depicted the heart of a believer as aplace where God dwells after personal improvement by Divine grace.39As we willsee, this is the core teaching of al-Makkī, and Wierix, most likely unknown to him,beautifully drew it for Christian followers. This does not necessarily prove thatal-Makkīwas heavily influenced by Christianity, or Wierix was inspired by theQūt.It may mean, however, that spiritual images of the heart exist beyond the border of aparticular creed.While religion seems to add authority to the spiritual importance of the heart, itsessence may have stemmed simply from our ordinary experience of the connectionbetween psychological activity and physical reaction in the heart. For instance,when we become nervous, we can feel the heart beating very fast and hear itpounding so loudly that we are afraid others also might hear it. In addition tothe physiological importance of the heart, this sort of everyday experience shouldmake us readily accept its spiritual images in different cultures. The metaphoricalfunctions attached to the heart do not require a leap of imagination even thoughwe are not familiar with a certain culture in question. When we hear the titleThe Nourishment of Hearts, we may assume that the book concerns spiritualdimensions of life, even though it could be a book on anatomy. The heart hasthus such a strong image of spiritual capacity.The mystical idea of the heart in the early historyof SufismSufis, therefore, are not the only people who attach a spiritual role to the heart. Withthis in mind, this section offers an overview of the image of the heart in the early38 Smith,Studies in Early Mysticism in the Near and Middle East, London: Sheldon Press, 1931,pp. 150–2.39 E.J.

Al-Makkī’sQūtgained great popularity in Suficirclesand the extract in the following chapters is often used by later prominent mystics.40The significance of this excerpt is not just that it summarises the core idea of theQūt, upon which al-Makkī’s argument is based; it is also that it reflects the spiritualimages of the heart in Islam, which al-Makkīillustrates in detail with numerouscitations from the Qurʾān,Ḥadīth and the sayings of pious ancestors.Images of the heart in the early history of SufismIn the Qurʾān, the termqalb(heart) and its pluralqulūbappear approximately 130times.41Its root,qalaba, signifies‘to alter, turn, invert’, and an expression from itsderivative,muqallib al-qulūb(the turner of hearts), designates God.42AmongSufis, the heart is also treated as the only organ that can reflect Divine light. Ascan be seen in the so-called Light verse (24:35), God is often illustrated as lightwhich beams down into the heart of the believer who has reached the stage ofabsolute religious certainty (yaqīn). The light of certainty is a beam from God, castby God Himself by Divine grace. By this light the heart sees God.43The heart istherefore to be polished as a mirror and kept cleansed from sin.The famous ascetic in the Umayyad period, al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī(d. 110/728), isreported to have said:‘Cleanse ye these hearts (by meditation and remembrance ofGod), for they are quick to rust.’44Whether al-Ḥasan considered himself a mystic isunknown. It is certain, however, that he is frequently referred to by later Sufis. Oneof the reasons for this may lie in his emphasis on works (aʿmāl), both internally andexternally. Al-Ḥasan views each action as being based on the work of the heart,which should contemplate nothing else but the Hereafter. The believer’s task in thisworld is to cultivate such a heart in a God-fearing (taqwā) state.45Rābiʿa al-ʿAdawiyya (d. 185/801), the famous female mystic, presents a moreallegorical image of the heart.46According to AbūBakr al-Shiblī(d. 334/945), shestresses that it is not only her heart that is directed towards God, but that all herlimbs are hearts which are also aiming at Him.47This idea of the heart as an essential esoteric organ is frequently repeated bylater Sufis who stress the importance of having a close link with the Truth. Among40 E.g.ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī, al-Suhrawardī; see Chs. 6 and 7 for detail.41Mawsūʿa, p. 918.42 Lane, vol. 2, pp. 2552–5. This expression does not appear in the Qurʾān.43 Without God’s light, it is impossible to see Him. Nicholson quotes a saying which explains this well:‘’Tis the sun’s self that lets the sun be seen’(The Mystics of Islam, Bloomington, IN: World Wisdom,2002, p. 37).44 Idem,‘A historical enquiry concerning the origin and development of Sufism’,JRAS, part 2, 1996,p. 305.

It is the heart, according toal-Muḥāsibī, that God‘wants from His servants’, and‘their members are tofollow their hearts’.50The heart can hear both the voice of God and the whisperingsof Satan. It is therefore the heart that has power to decide between the two voices.The actions of the members (aʿmāl al-jawāriḥ) are external conduct, while theactions of the heart (aʿmāl al-qalb) are the origins of the external actions ofthe body.51The heart also has sight.‘The Hidden is not seen by the eye’, writes al-Muḥāsibī,‘He is seen by the heart through the true states of religious certainty (ḥaqāʾiqal-yaqīn).’52If knowledge of the heart and its actions is righteous, this will lead thebeliever to God. On the other hand, if the heart of a believer becomes defiled,external actions will be sullied: the believer will then not attain salvation butexperience perdition, as God has let the heart know fear (khawf).53Al-Muḥāsibīemphasises the importance of following the Qurʾān, Sunna and themoral examples of venerable ancestors,54and recommends the readers not toadhere to reason (ʿaql), but‘make knowledge (ʿilm) a guide’.55Knowledgeis light, and gnosis (maʿrifa) is the greatest gift from God, that which makesbelievers come close to Him. Gnosis can be achieved by their pious activities andGod’s mercy. Only with His grace can the heart of the believers come near to Him.56This is why it is important, insists al-Muḥāsibī, to keep the heart pure andcapable so that God leads it to Him if He wills.57Al-Muḥāsibīstates that if abeliever‘gives preference to God’other than anything else,‘God will be fondof him.’58Apart from al-Muḥāsibī, among the Baghdadi Sufis Abu’l-Ḥusayn al-Nūrī(d. 295/907–8) should not be forgotten. He wrote a treatise entitledMaqāmātal-qulūb(‘The Religious Stations of Hearts’), where he states,‘Know that GodMost High created a house inside the believer, [which is] called the heart’; He then48Mysticism, p. 43.49 E.g. al-Muḥāsibī,Kitāb al-ʿilm, Tunis: al-Dār al-Tūnisiyya, 1975, p. 83.50Riʿāya, p. 243.51Gedankenwelt, p. 36;Early Mystic, p. 87.

This spiritual idea of the heart was not taught only inBaghdad, where al-Muḥāsibīand al-Nūrīestablished the Baghdadi Sufitradition,nor only in Basra, where al-Ḥasan and Rābiʿa were active. These symbolic imagesare, as underlined by al-Muḥāsibī, supported by the Qurʾān,Ḥadīth and pioussayings, and were also used by various personalities outside these two intellectualcentres.Karamustafa, for example, points out the common elements, including the role ofthe image of the heart, in the teachings of the Baghdadi Sufis and those of Sahlal-Tustarī(d. 283/896) who was from south-west Iraq.60In a completely separatecommunity from Iraq, present-day Uzbekistan, al-Ḥākim al-Tirmidhī(d. ca. 300/912)also states that the heart is the place which can receive gnosis, after carnal desireshave disappeared.61The importance of the heart can also be seen in the discourse ofthe so-called‘intoxicated’type of mystics, not only in the argumentation of thespiritually‘sober’Sufis, like al-Muḥāsibī.Al-Ḥasan b. Manṣūr al-Ḥallāj (d. 309/922), for example, points out that the heartis‘the essential part of man’62and states that‘every heart [which] abandons [all]but God sees the Invisible and His hidden meanings’.63According to the Qurʿān,writes al-Ḥallāj, the heart is‘the seat of knowledge and of consciousness’and‘theplace of sacramental union between the body and the soul’.64Some personalities in this section influenced al-Makkīmore deeply than theothers. In theQūt, al-Makkīrefers to al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrīnearly 200 times, Rābiʿafourteen times, al-Muḥāsibīseven times, al-Nūrītwice, Sahl al-Tustarīaround200 times, al-Ḥallāj only once.65Looking at the metaphorical use of the heart invarious cultures, despite the difference in supporting documents, there are clearresemblances between the image of the heart in other religious traditions and that ofearly Sufis. These teachings are well reflected in theQūt, and the value of this worklies in the systematisation of the spiritual importance of the heart in early Islam,rather than introduction to a completely new set of ideas.Qūt al-qulūb: righteous conduct in this world and truebelief in GodTheQūtdoes not contain an introduction by the author himself.

Two main aims can be seen here.One is to provide an account of the way in which believers should nurture the heartin dealing with God. The other is a guide for novices to attain the station oftawḥīd.From the title, then, the main target audiences of this book can be assumed to bebelievers who attempt to learn proper behaviour towards God, and novices who areembarking on a path leading totawḥīd.TheQūtis divided into forty-eight sections (fuṣūl, sing.faṣl). The length of eachsection varies considerably, from one page to more than one thousand pages inal-Raḍwānī’s edition. TheQūtis full of Qurʾanic verses,Ḥadīth quotations andsayings of Sufis and pious ancestors. They are selected according to themes andmany sections start either with Qurʾanic verses or words of the ProphetMuḥammad, which are followed by various other pious sayings to expand thetheme. Alternatively, al-Makkīstarts a section with a brief explanation of a topicwhich is immediately followed by citations from the Qurʾān andḤadīth for support.As can also be seen in the books of his contemporaries, al-Sarrāj and al-Kalābādhī,the arguments advanced by al-Makkīare not always necessarily stated in his ownwords. It is therefore important to examine the structure and contents of the book inorder to grasp al-Makkī’s objectives and intentions,68as well as to locate thethirtieth section, a summarised translation of which will be provided shortly,within the whole picture.Al-Makkīstarts theQūtwith a section concerning right deeds in this world(vol. 1, p. 9 [henceforth 1, 9]). This section consists of thirteen Qurʾanic verses,beginning with a verse from Sūra 17 regarding the hereafter:«And whoso desireth the Hereafter and striveth for it with the effortnecessary, being a believer; for such, their effortfindeth favour (with theirLord)» (17:19).The following verses concern various ways to enter Paradise; for instance, strivingfor God and good deeds in this world.69They emphasise that true belief in God and66Qūt, vol. 1, p. 8 n. 1.67 See e.g. Escorial ms. árabe 729, 2v and Chester Beatty ms. 3698, 1v.68 Cf.

Al-Makkīcloses thefirst section with a verseaccentuating the significance and consequences of conduct:«For them is the abode of peace with their Lord. He will be their ProtectingFriend because of what they used to do» (6:127).The second section of theQūt(1, 10) also consists of Qurʾanic verses only. Thetwenty-one quoted verses concern the benefit of private worship day and night.70They underline the importance of the remembrance of God and praise for Himthroughout the day, and also concern the importance of knowledge and awarenessof the hereafter, and God’s reward for good conduct.In the sections from 3 to 16 (1, 11–156), al-Makkīexplains for novices the virtueof voluntary prayers (adʿiyat mukhtāra) with support from the Qurʾān,Ḥadīth andthe sayings of past masters. This practice is described in detail; for instance,al-Makkīmentions once again the virtue of private worship during the daytimeand at night,71as well as emphasising the virtue of prayer from Monday to Sunday,the merit of congregational prayer, the recommendation of particular Qurʾanicverses for prayer anddhikr, a proper manner of prayer and recitation and theright attitude towards sleep and night prayer.In the sections from 17 to 21 (1, 157–217), al-Makkīclarifies the differencebetween those who have knowledge and those who do not, and objects to the latter.The sections offer interpretations of various difficult Qurʾanic verses, as well aselucidation of what is expressed openly in the Qurʾān and what is concealed.Al-Makkīalso gives an account of the virtue of voluntary worship, especially thesignificance of Friday and recommended practices on that day for novices. Thesections from 1 to 21 account for approximately a sixth of theQūtin total. Theyconcern mainly external deeds and demonstrate the ways in which believers canimprove themselves. So far theQūtfocuses on ethics rather than an elucidation ofmystical doctrines.More spiritual practices start to be dealt with from Section 22. The sections from22 to 26 (1, 218–72) again mention the merit of private worship, but this time in theform of a comparison between novices and those possessing gnosis. Al-Makkīalsoprovides clarification of abstinence (ṣiyām) and the way in which it would bespecial for those possessing religious certainty.Ṣawmandṣiyāmare generallyinterpreted as‘fast’or‘fasting’; however, here al-Makkīfocuses on its spiritualside rather than the control of one’s diet. At the beginning of Section 22, he quotes aQurʾanic verse, «Seek help in patience(ṣabr)and prayer» (2:45), and explainesṣabrasṣawm. He also states that the Prophet called‘Ramaḍān the month ofṣabr,70 25:62, 73:7–8, 76:25–6, 50:39–40, 52:48–9, 73:6, 20:130, 39:9, 32:16, 25:64, 51:17–18, 17:78–9,11:114, 30:17–18.71Wird, pl.awlād; see Nakamura,‘Makkīand Ghazālī’, p. 85.40 Qūt al-qulūb"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"becauseṣabrwithholds the self from longing [for this world]’.72In addition to aspiritual description ofṣawm, al-Makkīgives an account of the self and describesits different qualities for those possessing gnosis. The characteristics of thosewho examine themselves are also detailed. These sections seem to serve as anintroduction to a discussion of internal exercise after exploring external aspects ofreligious observance for novices who are trying to step up the ladder of theirspiritual journey.In Section 27 (1, 273–86), al-Makkīprovides novices with the groundwork.Seven qualities are to be followed: sincere will, obedience, knowledge of thecondition of the self, true repentance, attendance at gatherings, taking only lawfulfood and having good companions.73ManyḤadīth and sayings are quoted, andal-Makkīexpounds the nature of the heart of a true believer, and the importance andchallenges of achieving the religious certainty which is the basis of all righteousdeeds. This section appears to be an introduction to the rest of theQūt.Sections 28 and 29 (1, 287–320) discuss the stations (maqāmāt, sing.maqām)of those possessing religious certainty. Al-Makkīseparates heedless peoplewho have been moved away from God from those brought close to Him.Section 30 (1, 321–62) treats the thoughts of Sufis, whom al-Makkīdescribesas the‘people of hearts (ahl al-qulūb)’.74The characteristics of the heart areelucidated here and al-Makkīexplains its meaning and significance for believersin several different ways. This section is the only place where the mystical image ofthe heart is clarified. As can be seen from its title,The Nourishment of Hearts(Qūtal-qulūb), the heart is the key term of this book. Although the word‘the heart(qalb)’appears throughout theQūt, Section 30 is the only section which focuses onthe heart exclusively.Section 31 (1, 363–490) concerns knowledge. It begins with the elucidationof a famousḤadīth,<Seek for knowledge even [as far as] China, as the questfor knowledge is indeed a religious duty upon every Muslim>.75Al-Makkīillustrates various types of knowledge; for instance, the superiority of theknowledge of gnosis and religious certainty over other sorts of knowledge,the superiority of internal knowledge over external knowledge, the differencebetween those possessing knowledge of this world and that of the hereafter.He also advises caution against erroneous understanding of the knowledgeof belief and certainty. The sections from 1 to 31 account for approximatelyone-third of the wholeQūt.Section 32 (vol. 2), the longest in theQūt, accounts for a third of the book itself.This section deals with the stations of religious certainty and the conditions of those72Qūt, vol. 1, p. 218. Izutsu also explains a close connection betweenṣabr(patience, self-control orendurance) andislām, as well asṣabrandtaqwā(God-fearingness) in the Qurʾān(Concepts,pp. 101–4, cf. p. 109).73Qūt, vol. 1, p. 273.74 Ibid., vol. 1, p. 321.75 Ibid., vol. 1, p. 363.Qūt al-qulūb41"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"possessing certainty. At the outset, al-Makkīstates that the roots (uṣūl) of thestations of certainty can be divided into nine subdivisions: repentance (tawba),patience (ṣabr), gratitude (shukr), hope (rajāʾ), fear (khawf), renunciation (zuhd),trust (tawakkul), contentment (riḍāʿ) and love (maḥabba).76He explains that thislove is a special love,‘love of the Beloved’.77This section clarifies these stationsin detail, quoting Qurʾanic verses,Ḥadīth and many sayings, as in other parts ofthe work.Al-Makkīstarts to explore spiritual aspects of belief mainly from Section 22. Thesections until 26 can be considered to be the preliminary sections, where he makes acontrast between those who have improved their inward status and those who havenot. Al-Makkīgoes on to underline important inner features until Section 32,following the introductory statement in Section 27. The sections from 22 to 32constitute the main part of theQūtin which spiritual doctrines are expounded.Al-Makkī, however, does not use the term‘Sufi’often.The sections from 33 till the end of theQūtconcern both explicit and concealedaspects of belief. Section 33 (3, 1171–268) deals with the Five Pillars of Islam,following al-Makkī’s own statement in Section 31 that seeking for the knowledgeof the Five Pillars is a religious obligation.78It starts with the elucidation of thefirstpillar: the testimony (shahāda)oftawḥīd, which al-Makkīexplains as the‘firmbelief (iʿtiqād) of the heart’in the oneness of God, and the testimony ofthe Messenger.79It continues to the second pillar, prayer (ṣalāt), on which hespends nearly half of this section.80Al-Makkībegins with an explanation of theduties of cleanness and purity, and the virtues of ablution, followed by details ofvirtues and the duty of the prayer. Together with the sections from 3 to 16 on virtueof voluntary prayers, it is clear that al-Makkīattaches great importance to prayer inbelievers’lives. Section 33 also clarifies the virtues and duties of the third pillar,almsgiving (zakāt), the fourth pillar, abstinence (ṣiyām,ṣawm), and thefifth pillar,pilgrimage (ḥajj).81Sections 34 and 35 (3, 1269–305) concern the principal elements of Islam andbelief. Al-Makkīalso discusses the conduct of the heart and external knowledge.Sections 36 to 38 (3, 1306–72) illustrate Sunna, Sharīʿa, heretical innovation andpious ancestors, and emphasise the significance of intention.

Section 47 contains an account of IbnḤanbalregarding proper behaviour.83The last section concerns what is allowed, what isforbidden, and what is dubious in between these. Al-Makkīprovides clarification ofwhat is lawful and unlawful among these vague matters, andfinishes his bookwithout any concluding remarks.TheQūtis a detailed exposition of the manners and duties of Muslims, withguidance on outward conduct, spiritual doctrines, and visible and hidden aspects ofbelief. Concerning theoretical features of religion, al-Makkīgenerally uses termssuch as‘inner (bāṭin)’,‘hidden (ghaib)’or‘of the heart (al-qalb)’, rather than theterm‘Sufi(ṣūfī)’. This is a significant difference from his contemporaries’writings,theLumaʿby al-Sarrāj andal-Taʿarrufby al-Kalābādhī, as discussed inChapter 5.The religious authorities cited in theQūtIn theQūt, al-Makkīmentions numerousfigures. He also cites many sayingsanonymously. This sectionfirst looks at the twelve authorities whose namesappear most frequently in the book, and then attempts to discuss al-Makkī’schoice of quotations.84Threefigures are mentioned most frequently in theQūt, appearing approximately200 times.85These are, chronologically,ʿAlīb. AbīṬālib (d. 40/661), al-Ḥasanal-Baṣrī(d. 110/728) and Sahl al-Tustarī(d. 283/896).ʿAlīis undoubtedly one ofthe most significant personalities in Islam, and the latter two are also influential,especially within the ascetic and mystical dimensions of Islam.ʿAlīand al-Ḥasanconstantly appear throughout theQūt, while al-Makkīrefers to al-Tustarīmainly inSection 32, on the stations of religious certainty.The second most cited authorities in theQūtareʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb (d. 23/644),ʿAbd Allāh Ibn (al-)ʿAbbās (d. 68/687) and Sufyān al-Thawrī(d. 161/778),mentioned around 150–170 times.ʿUmar, the second caliph in Sunnism, andal-Thawrī, a legal scholar, are mentioned throughout theQūton various topics.IbnʿAbbās, the father of Qurʾanic exegesis, also appears throughout the book, butparticularly on the matter of Qurʾanic interpretation.82 Böwering mentions that in Sections 39 and 40, al-Makkīquotes largely from Ibn Qutayba’sʿUyūnal-akhbār(Böwering (vols 3 & 4), p. 146), a famous work onadab. Gramlich mentions this workfrom time to time in Sec. 40 (e.g.Nahrung, vol. 3, pp. 349–50, 352–5). According to the index of theNahrung, neither the name of Ibn Qutayba nor the title of his book appears in theQūt.83Qūt, vol. 3, pp. 1695–6. According to Gramlich, most quotations from IbnḤanbal in Sec. 47 are fromKitāb al-waraʿ(Nahrung, esp. vol. 3, pp. 654–75). Al-Makkīdoes not mention the title of this workin theQūt(ibid., vol. 4 [index]).84 Cf.

Mālik AbūḤamza (d. 91–3/709–11),AbūNaṣr Bishr al-Ḥāfī(d. 227/841) and Aḥmad IbnḤanbal (d. 241/855).Throughout theQūt, al-Makkīcites Ibn Masʿūd, a famous Companion of theProphet,ʿĀʾisha, the beloved wife of the Prophet, IbnʿUmar, a moral exemplarof thefirst generation of Muslims, and Anas b. Mālik, a prolific traditionalist. Onthe other hand, Bishr, a known Sufi, and IbnḤanbal, a prominent scholar in Islam,hardly appear in thefirst twenty sections of theQūtwhere al-Makkīdiscussesexternal behaviour.These twelve most frequently cited authorities in theQūtclearly indicate that thisbook is based on Tradition, the Qurʾān and moral anecdotes of pious ancestors.It should be mentioned that al-Thawrī,a‘ḥadīth-oriented’law scholar,differentiates himself from those who are in favour of personal opinion (raʾy) andspeculative judgement, such as AbūḤanīfa (d. 150/767).86Inclination towardsTradition and aversion toraʾymatch al-Makkī’s views of the use ofḤadīth in theQūt. Al-Makkīquotes IbnḤanbal and agrees that even if a certain Tradition is notsupported by a perfectisnād, it is still better than personal opinion or reasoning(qiyās), if its contents are in accordance with the Qurʾān, Sunna and the consensus(ijmāʿ) of theumma.87It is interesting to note that among these religiousfigures, Bishr is said to haveturned his back onḤadīth studies. He was disgusted by the hypocrisy ofḤadīthscholars and emphasised the importance of actual deeds rather than mere intellec-tual knowledge in the pursuit of a pious way of life.88Presumably, this latter pointalso suits al-Makkīwho, although he never turns away from Traditions, lays greatstress on conduct. More than half of al-Makkī’s book concerns actual practices.Inner aspects of belief are dealt with in the middle of the work, includingSection 32, where al-Makkīquotes al-Tustarīthroughout.Apart from al-Tustarīand Bishr, al-Makkīalso refers to many mystics. Notablefigures, who one would expect to be cited in Sufiwriting, includeʿAbd al-Wāḥid b.Zayd (d. ca. 150/767) and Rābiʿaal-ʿAdawiyya (d. 185/801), who appear in theQūtfourteen times each; AbūSulaymānal-Dārānī(d. ca. 215/830), eighty times;al-Muḥāsibī(d. 243/857), seven times; Dhu’l-Nūnal-Miṣrī(d. 245/860), twenty-onetimes; AbūYazīdal-Bisṭāmī(d. ca. 261/875), twenty-six times; AbūSaʿīdal-Kharrāz(d. 277/890), ten times; Abu’l-Ḥusayn al-Nūrī(d. 295/907–8), three times; al-Junaydal-Baghdādī(d. 297/910),fifty-eight times; al-Ḥakīmal-Tirmidhī(d. ca. 300/912)86EI2,s.v.‘Sufyān al-Thawrī’(H.P.

Meier); Melchert,‘Early renunciants’, p. 414; Massignon,Essai,pp. 230–1. Bishr’s relation with IbnḤanbal is not clear. Meier states that Bishr was‘greatlyrespected’by IbnḤanbal, while Massignon argues that the former‘entered into conflict’with thelatter (ibid., p. 231). Cooperson says that they are often compared as‘rival’heroes by scholars andmystics (‘IbnḤanbal and Bishr al-Ḥāfī: a case study in biographical traditions’,Studia Islamica2,no. 86, août 1997, p. 73).

He is rather an adherent tozuhd,89and lays emphasison fear of God and humility, and the importance of examining the actions of theheart and the body members.90Al-Junayd, famous for his sobriety, appears fromtime to time in theQūt, and on the whole it seems that al-Makkī’s inclination incitation is towardszāhidand sober sayings. He keeps highlighting the significanceof righteous deeds based on righteous conduct of the heart. It is highly possible thatal-Makkīfavours moderate behaviour in society which is in accordance with theSharīʿa.91Concerning al-Makkī’s relationship with the Sālimiyya school, while al-Tustarīisreferred to throughout Section 32, his disciple Muḥammad Ibn Sālim (d. 297/909)appears only once in theQūtand his son Aḥmad Ibn Sālim (d. ca. 356/967) thirteentimes. These numbers seem to be quite small, given the link with al-Sālimiyya.Lastly, regarding the founders of the Sunni law schools, AbūḤanīfa (d. 150/767)appears only four times in theQūt,92although Ibn Sālim, the son, seems to havefollowed theḤanafīschool;93Mālik b. Anas (d. 179/795) twenty-eight times andal-Shāfiʿī(d. 204/820) twenty-six times. Since IbnḤanbal is cited approximately ahundred times, it seems that al-Makkītakes aḤanbalīposition in jurisprudence.(IbnḤanbal appears mainly in Section 31, which elucidates the nature ofknowledge, and Section 47, which has a segment on him.) Melchert discusses thecloseness between the earlyḤanbalīs and al-Tustarī, and points out the mysticalelements in the personal life of IbnḤanbal.94TheQūtis not a juridical work andit is not easy to know the extent of importance themadhhabdivision had onal-Makkī.Al-Makkī’s pattern of citations of the religious authorities in theQūtindicate hisinclination toḤadīth scholars and past masters, not necessarily Sufimasters. Itappears that the sources of his inspiration in writing theQūtare the Qurʾān, Sunnaand sayings of pious ancestors, including the Companions of the Prophet, legalscholars, ascetics and Sufis. Faith has both revealed and hidden sides. Al-Makkīseems to try to cover all aspects of believers’religious duties, through explanationof the spiritual path to the stage oftawḥīdas indicated in the full title. TheQūtis abook on devotion to God.89 Kinberg argues thatzuhdshould be understood as ethics for all Muslims, rather than‘asceticism’or‘abstinence’, supporting his argument with theQūt(‘What is meant byzuhd’,Studia Islamica61,1985,passim).90Mysticism, pp. 37–8.

Using the critical edition of theQūt, the main part of thissection will be summarised by paragraph with an extensive amount of translatedpassages which aim to explain al-Makkī’s ideas clearly. In this way these chapterswill allow researchers tofind easily relevant places in the text which they canexplore in more detail if they wish. At the end of Chapter 4, I will sum upal-Makkī’s spiritual teachings as set out in Section 30 and compare his religiousviews on the heart with those of several other Muslim thinkers.Al-Makkī’s processes of argument work rather ponderously, since he feels obliged,as was the practice, to cite both extensive Qurʾanic quotations and extensive extractsfrom theḤadīth literature in support of his argument. For instance, he often quotesseveralḤadīth with a slight difference in wording in order to explain a certainQurʾanic verse. As Gramlich painstakingly identifiesḤadīth cited in theQūtandcompares it with theIḥyāʾ(and some famous writings on Sufism) in his completeGerman translation, I have decided to be selective in translation with a focus on theannotation of difficult terms and the identification of religious authorities. (The majordifferences between his interpretation and mine are pointed out in the footnotes.)In theQūt, the sections from 30 to 32 treat exclusively of theoretical matters. Atranslation of the whole of Section 31, on knowledge, has been published byRenard and a segment on repentance from Section 32 has been translated byAmin in his thesis. These translations, together with the complete German versionby Gramlich,1are making the study of al-Makkīmore accessible, and it is hopedthat my analytical abstracts will make a further contribution to this process.NotesThis paraphrastic translation is based on al-Raḍwānī’s edition of theQūt.

Al-Kalābādhīsummarisesthe nature of thekhawāṭirand divides them into four kinds: thekhāṭirfrom God, which is‘a warning’,thekhāṭirfrom the angel, which‘prompts obedience’,thekhāṭirfrom the self, which‘asks for desire’,andthekhāṭirfrom the enemy, which is‘the costume of disobedience’(Taʿarruf,p.90).Al-Qushayrīalsopresents a similar argument (Risāla, pp. 83–5), while al-Sarrāj’sdefinition is rather short (Lumaʿ,p.342[Arabic]), a pattern which is followed by Hujwīrī(Kashf, p. 387). Renard renders this term as‘spiritualdiscernment’(Knowledge, p. 36); however, discernment seems to come after thekhāṭiroccurs in theheart. Awn translates it as‘impulse’(Satan, p. 66; but mainly he uses the Arabic term in transliteration),Sells‘inclination’(Islamic Mysticism, p. 142), Aïnî‘suggestion’(Un grand saint de l’Islam,Paris:P.

[The Devil] asked: Are you becoming a Muslim andleaving behind your faith and the faith of your ancestors? But he resisted [theDevil] and became a Muslim.

In Sufism, the lower self (nafs) is often described asshayṭān, against which Sufis struggle.Cf.EI2, s.v.‘shayṭān, 2’(A. Rippin);EQ, s.v.‘devil’(idem). Al-Makkīoften uses the term‘enemy(ʿadū)’interchangeably withshayṭān, as the adversary of God, in contrast to the angel (e.g. [7] in thissection) and as a description of the devil’s close relation to the lower self (e.g. [24]). In theQūt, theshayṭānsometimes has a proper name (e.g. Khinzab in [4]) and does not seem to be treated as apersonal name, namely Satan, in a Biblical sense. Accordingly, this term is translated as‘devil’ingeneral, rather than Satan or Iblīs. (See also [6]–[7] and their footnotes.) For a detailed explanation ofal-shayṭān, seeSatan, esp. Ch. 1 (pp. 18–56).9 Al-Makkīquotes Q. 5:30 which refers to the famous Biblical story of Cain and Abel (cf.

Cf.‘Einsprechungen’(Nahrung, vol. 1, p. 376). It is not entirely clear what al-Makkīmeans bylumma;however, the underlying idea might come from a story of the Day of Judgement in the Qurʾān(50:21–7; although this term does not appear as it is in the Qurʾān) about a comrade (qarīn), who is asecond witness of man in contrast with his guardian angel. Fahd explains theqarīnas an‘inseparablecompanion’, who, according to the ancient Arab traditions, conditions man’s activity, as can be seenin theḤadīth,‘There is not one of you who does not have aḳarīnderived from thedjinn’and‘Thereis no descendant of Adam who does not have ashayṭānattached to him’(EI2, s.v.‘shayṭān1’(T. Fahd)). Neither al-Sarrāj, al-Kalābādhī, al-Qushayrīor Hujwīrīseems to explain this term. SeeBin Ramli, p. 87 n. 255, where he interprets this word as‘visitation’.18ʿAbd Allāh Ibn Masʿūd (d. 32/653): a famous Companion of the Prophet and one of the earliest convertsto Islam.

Thefirst step to remembrance is God-fearingness. Al-Makkīunderstands pious fear of God as the gate to the hereafter,while desire (hawā)39as the gate to this world.[17]Two more Qurʾanic verses arecited concerning this subject.40It is stressed that those who believe in God and actin accordance with His revealed law are made inaccessible to the Devil.Al-Makkīrefers to four Qurʾanic verses.41(p. 324)He differentiates the body, theexternal tool, from the heart, the internal tool.[18]According to the author, Godcreated everything in pairs to have better understanding of the other. Three pairinginstruments are introduced. Thefirst pair is the self (nafs)andthesoul(rūḥ). Theseare places to encounter the enemy and the angel, immorality and God-fearingness.Thesecondisreason(ʿaql) and desire (hawā). They act as assistance42and tempta-tion in accordance with the will of God. The third is knowledge (ʿilm) and belief(īmān), which are apportioned by Divine mercy. These are the instruments of theheart and its hidden commended qualities.43God created humans with His wisdom.37Taqwā;ittaqā: to guard oneself from sin, to be pious, careful of one’s religious duties (ibid., vol. 2,p. 3059). Pickthall translatestaqwāin various ways in his translation of the Qurʾān, such as‘to wardoff evil’(2:197),‘restraint from evil’(7:26),‘duty to God’(9:108), andmuttaqūnas‘the Godfearing’(2:177),‘those who keep their duty to God’(8:34; 13:35; 47:15) and so on. In the above-quoted Qurʾanic verse, he rendersalladhīna ittaquas‘those who ward off (evil)’, while Jones has‘those who protect themselves’. Cf.‘Gottesfürchtigkeit’(Nahrung, vol. 1, p. 378).Taqwāis one ofthe key notions in the Qurʾān and could be rendered as simply‘piety’. However, because of its strongeschatological connotation, which is shared in the Hebrew Bible, and in order to differentiate thisterm fromwaraʿorbirr,taqwāis translated here as‘pious fear of God’or‘God-fearingness’ingeneral. For a detailed, semantic discussion on this concept, seeGod and Man, pp. 233–9; cf.Ohlander,‘Fear of God (taqwā) in the Qurʾān: some notes on semantic shift and thematic context’,Journal of Semitic Studies50, no. 1, Spring 2005, pp. 137–52.38 4:122 (al-Raḍwānīdoes not indicate this as a Qurʾanic verse), 7:201.39Hawā: another key concept in the Qurʾān, which immediately causes the believers to go astray. Izutsuexplains its rough meaning as‘the natural inclination of the human soul, born of lusts and animalappetites’. He argues that in the Qurʾān, the opposite ofhawāisʿilm,‘the revealed knowledge of theTruth’, and later, in Kalām, the‘people ofahwā’designates heretics (Concepts, pp. 139–41; citationsfrom pp. 140 and 141 respectively). Hujwīrīpresents a similar argument and elucidates the closeconnection betweenhawāand the lower self (Kashf, pp. 196–200, 207–8). Nicholson translateshawāas‘passion’(ibid.), Pickthall‘desire’(e.g. 45:23), Arberry‘caprice’(the same verse), Jones‘lust’(the same), Gramlich‘Lustverlangen’(Nahrung, vol. 1, p. 378). Knysh explains the termas‘urges and drives of one’s lower soul (nafs)’(Epistle, p. 419). Here it is rendered as‘desire’.40 2:63/7:171, 2:187.41 82:6–7, 95:4, 51:49.42Tawfīq: assistance, concours que Dieu accorde à l’homme (Kazimirski, vol. 2, p. 1578); divineguidance, the completion of one’s wishes (Steingass, p. 336). Hujwīrīrefers to this idea, whereNicholson translates it as‘Divine aid’(Kashf, pp. 6, 288). See alsoTheology, p. 210, where Izutsurenders the term as‘God’s assistance’.

Praise to God.[20]The close relation between the heart and God isemphasised.The Turner [of the heart]44laid down thefine sensations45of yearning andfear46on it, wherein He shines with the lights of majesty and omnipotence.[This is] what He wished for the people of the highest companions47and of thelowest kingdom.48It is stressed that the six impulses are the instruments which God created in order totest all humans.[21]Thefirst group of the six is the impulse of the self (nafs) and the impulseof the enemy (ʿadū). These are to be blamed. They appear by desire and ignorance.[22]The next group is the impulse of the soul (rūḥ) and the impulse of the angel(malak). These are to be praised. They appear by truth and knowledge.[23]Thefifth is the impulse of reason (ʿaql). This is a double-edged sword. It canbe used for both thefirst two blameworthy impulses and the latter two praiseworthyimpulses. Al-Makkīhighlights the significance of the proper use of reason andintellect. According to him, desire arises through lust (shahwa),49(p. 325)when44Muqallib: the converter of hearts (God) (Steingass, p. 1295);muqallib al-qulūb: the turner of hearts(an epithet applied to God) (Lane, vol. 2, p. 2555).45Laṭāʾif: bon mot, mot spirituel ou piquant, expression élégante,finesse (du language ou d’unescience), bienfait, faveur, tout ce qui estfin et exquis (Kazimirski, vol. 2, p. 997).

In order to employ reason correctly, humans musthave right intention in the heart. Reason can then serve as‘a witness (shāhid)50ofthe angel and a supporter of the impulse of the soul’. It is emphasised that there is nocompulsion on humans to use reason in either a good or a bad way.[24]Al-Makkīillustrates the similarity between reason and body. According tohim, both lead humans to either good or evil, as reason and body are‘at times withthe self and the enemy, and at other times with the soul and the angel’. Theimportance of discernment is emphasised. The way in which reason is used leadshumans to either reward or punishment.[25]Al-Makkīgoes on to describe howhumans have choice. It is stressed that reason is not hidden. Humans ignore it andthen lust arises. This is a test from God and its consequence is either‘the joy ofhappiness or the pain of grief’.[26]The significance of intention in the heart is highlighted as a criterion ofthe Supreme Authority51on the Last Day. The double-edged quality of reason isrepeated. Al-Makkīlays stress on the close link between reason and judgement, andthe close relationship between the self, lust and desire. Each concept has its ownshare from God.[27]Three Qurʾanic verses are quoted52to support this argument.All Divine principles are stated in the Qurʾān. It is emphasised that His guidanceleads humans to His right way and leads them astray.[28]The sixth impulse is the impulse of religious certainty (yaqīn).53This is‘the essence of belief and the highest knowledge’.(p. 326)This impulse is specialand appears only by truth. It arrives at the heart when humans reach the stage wherethey are completely content with God’s choice.54The signs of religious certaintyare subtle. However, this impulse is not hidden, emphasises al-Makkī, when it isaimed and intended. It is therefore important to remember God. According to theauthor, those possessing religious certainty are those whom God praised for theirremembrance of Him.Descriptions of characteristics of the heart. A Qurʾanic verse is quoted.55Al-Makkīcites aḤadīth of the Prophet:<Anything which becomes ingrained in your mind,5650Shāhid: al-Qushayrīexplains the essential meaning of this term as‘presence (ḥāḍir)’, i.e. somethingpresent in the heart. If, for instance, a person’s mind is preoccupied with a certain thing, this thing iscalled his/her witness, because this is constantly present in the heart (Risāla, p. 86). Cf. Knysh, whotranslates the term as‘a sign of divine grace or presence’(Epistle, p. 423).51Al-amr wa’l-nahy: ordre et défense, c-à-d. commandement, autorité (Kazimirski, vol. 2, p. 1360).

Sin is the pain57of hearts>. Another saying of the Prophet regarding piety andsin:<Consult your heart even thoughmuftīs have given you a legal opinion>.According to al-Makkī, this quotation shows thatmuftīs58know how to interpretrevealed knowledge, but not concealed knowledge. It is stressed that believers shouldseek internal knowledge.[29]The author makes a comparison between the people possessing externalknowledge (ahl al-ʿilm al-ẓāhir) and the people possessing internal knowledge (ahlal-ʿilm al-bāṭin). The former group understand the revealed principle of Godaccording to their knowledge of external language. The hidden principle of God,however, can be understood only through internal knowledge of the heart.Al-Makkīcalls special attention to the fact that the heart is afaqīh, lighted bybelief.[30]It is emphasised that knowledge of the heart is‘the greatest knowledge’.The Prophet describes the heart as aqāḍī, greater thanmuftīs in terms of judgement.Al-Makkīdisapproves of those who follow scholars’opinion blindly (taqlīd), notthe heart. AḤadīth is quoted:<Piety is that by which the heart feels secure and by which the self feelsassured, even though [muftīs] furnish you with legal information and give youlegal opinion>.[31]The author highlights the significance of remembrance (dhikr) of Godand control of the self, both of which lead to the utmost peace of reassurance59and piety in the heart. Two Qurʾanic verses are quoted60regarding characteristicsof the heart.(p. 327) [32]Al-Makkīquotes two Qurʾanic verses61concerningGod’s‘hidden enemies’and praises His close associates (awliyāʾ)62as they‘listen to Him, manifest His reminder and observe His unseen’.[33]The authorgives an explanation of two opposite groups: those who go astray from thestraight path and those who are rightly guided. Four Qurʾanic verses are quotedconcerning this.63[34]Al-Makkīquotes aḤadīth which summarises the quality of the heart. TheProphet said:<Pious fear of God is here>, and pointed out the heart. The authorgoes on to discuss characteristics of the heart. Three Qurʾanic verses are quoted.6457Ḥazzāz: pain in the heart, arising from wrath, in Tradition: Sin is that which makes an impressionupon thy heart (الإثمماحزفىقلبك), causing thee to waver lest it be an act of disobedience because of thynot being easy respecting it (Lane, vol. 1, p. 558).58 Read asal-muftīninstead ofal-muttaqīn. According to Gramlich, who also reads it as‘Gutachter’,the former term appears in some manuscripts (Nahrung, vol. 1, p. 381).59Sakīna: tranquillité, quiétude (de corps, d’esprit),surtoutcet état de quiétude intérieure qui disposel’homme à recevoir les révélations divines (Kazimirski, vol. 1, p. 1116).60 13:28, 48:4.61 18:101, 53:35.62Awliyāʾ;walīy Allāh: the friend of God, the constant obeyer of God, a saint (Lane, vol. 2, p. 3060).63 11:24, 11:20, 50:37, 11:34.64 7:100, 5:108, 2:282.Summary of Section 30 of theQūt, part 155"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"It is stressed that the heart becomes closed by sins, but God-fearingness can undothe seal. Al-Makkīrefers to a Tradition:<As God wished a servant well, God madea restrainer65such as his self, and a preacher such as his heart>. Another Tradition isquoted. The importance of following the heart is emphasised. If humans listen to theheart, God will protect them.[35]Two Qurʾanic verses are cited.66The close relationship between theheart and God is emphasised.[36] (p. 328)Al-Makkīquotes two Qurʾanicverses67and highlights the importance of repentance (tawba) from desire.[37]The author gives special importance to the danger of blindness of the heart: «Forindeed it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts, which are withinthe bosoms, that grow blind» (22:46). Al-Makkīdescribes true believers as‘thepeople of hearts’, who can‘take a warning without a warning from the createdbeings and restrict [themselves] without a restriction of the external’. It is impor-tant for all believers, according to the author, to be aware of the aforementionedsix impulses and to follow internal knowledge of the heart.[38]Almightinessof God is emphasised. God delights the heart and depresses it according toHis will.[39]Al-Makkīillustrates the heart and impulse of religious certainty, using ametaphor of three qualities which affect the level of certainty.One of them is belief; its position in religious certainty is a place offire stone.The second is knowledge; its place is a position of afire steel. The third isreason and it is the seat offlame. When these causes come together, impulse ofcertainty is lighted in the heart.[40]Another analogy of the heart with a lamp. Reason is likened to its light;knowledge is the oil; and belief is the wick. In accordance with these three qualities,the level of brightness of religious certainty which shines in the heart changes. Thisis similar to belief, whose strength accords with piety and fear.Al-Makkīmoves on to discuss the importance of the knowledge oftawḥīdwhich appears through the loss of desire. Two Qurʾanic verses are quotedconcerning knowledge of God.68[41]Al-Makkīreiterates the significance ofthe knowledge oftawḥīdand renunciation from this world, since this increasesbelief in the heart.(p. 329)Knowledge is important, because believers should65Zājir: voix intérieure, lumière intérieure, conscience établie par Dieu dans le coeur de l’hommequi l’éloigne des mauvaises actions et l’invite au bien (Kazimirski, vol. 1, p. 974); a diviner;because, when he sees that which he thinks to be of evil omen, he cries out with a high...voice,forbidding to undertake the thing in question (Lane, vol. 1, pp. 1216–17).

He then confirms what he believes frombehind a veil, since what he has taken possession of is the attachment to[worldly] connections.70He listens to words from behind a covering, sincehe cannot increase his piety immediately.71Corresponding to this, his beliefbecomes weak. He imagines his vision and [becomes] incapable of verifyingthe truth.[42]Al-Makkīstarts discussing different levels of knowledge, giving fourexamples. First, the author emphasises a great difference between those whoconfirm the knowledge of God‘in close proximity without covering’and thosewho confirm it‘from a distance with a veil’.Although both of them are [called] believers together, [what is] between theirbelief, in proximity, greatness, growth and deficiency, is like [what is] betweenten and a hundred thousand. The belief of the heart of the Muslim is onehundredth (miʿshār) of one hundredth of one tenth [as small as] the belief of theheart of the one with religious certainty.[43]The second example is about various ways in which a piece of information isreceived and accepted. Al-Makkīhighlights the danger of reasoning and shows astark contrast between second-hand knowledge andfirst-hand knowledge. Theimportance of verification is emphasised.[44]The author insists that no compar-ison can be made between the belief of ordinary believers and that of thosepossessing gnosis (ʿārifūn). The belief of the former is based on knowledge ofinformation, which should be rejected unless it is confirmed.(p. 330)The belief ofthe latter, on the other hand, is based on direct information which has been verifiedby themselves. Gnosis (maʿrifa) and religious certainty appear only when theinformation of knowledge is properly confirmed and every doubt is banished.69 Al-Sarrāj has a section on the state ofmushāhadaand explains it as witnessing God through the heart(Lumaʿ, p. 68 [Arabic]). Hujwīrīalso has a section on this term and states thatmushāhadais‘spiritualvision of God in public and private’(Kashf, pp. 329–30; Nicholson renders the term as‘contempla-tion’). Al-Qushayrīexplains thatmushāhadacomes after unveiling (mukāshafa), which follows thepresence (muḥāḍara) of the heart with God (Risāla, p. 75). Renard renders the term as‘witnessing/vision’(Knowledge, p. 36); Böwering as‘contemplative witnessing’(Vision,passim); Knyshexplains it as‘direct witnessing of God and/or the true realities of existence’(Epistle, p. 422).Cf.‘Schauen’(Nahrung, vol. 1, p. 383).70Asbāb: a connexion, or tie, of relationship by marriage (Lane, vol. 1, p. 1285).

The second one knew through what hehad heard and inferred without having seen with his own eyes, and then heasserted [it] positively. The third one is the one who examined with his owneyes, and then affirmed [it].Al-Makkīrefers to two similarḤadīth of the Prophet regarding this:<Information(khabar) is not the same as examination with one’s own eyes (muʿāyana)>;<The one who is informed is not the same as the one who examines with hisown eyes>.[46]In the third example, al-Makkīcompares visual perception in thedaytime and that at night. The danger of inference, expectation and assumption isemphasised.It is likened to seeing a thing in the moonlight. It insinuates73and suggestsdifficulties. On the other hand, seeing in the sunlight indeed reveals thematter as it [really] is. This is similar to the light of religious certainty [and]the light of belief.[47]In the fourth example, the author differentiates superficial conduct fromactual conduct in its full sense. When, for instance, a quadruple prayer, whichconsists of fourrakʿas, is performed, there is a difference in terms of the benefitbetween the one who performs the prayer from the beginning, and the one whojoins the prayer late and performs only from the lastrakʿa. It is stated that both arecalled believers and both receive benefit from performingrakʿa,asaḤadīth ofthe Prophet says:<One [who] performedrakʿain the prayer, indeed, performedthe prayer>.However,(p. 331)al-Makkīstresses that those worshippers are not equal in thesense of completion of the prayer and its real sense. Hence, they receive differentamounts of benefit from performing the prayer in a group.[48]Likewise, the believers are not equal in terms of the completion of beliefand its realities, even though they are equal in name and sense. Their difference[will appear] in the hereafter.72 Literally: the designation of belief befalls all of them.73Sanaḥa: insinuer (Kazimirski, vol. 1, p. 1149); to mention indirectly (Lane, vol. 1, p. 1441).

It is explained that even though aperson has the‘weight of adīnārof belief’in the heart, it is possible for him to go toHell, depending on the gravity of sins which he committed. If the amount of beliefincreases in his heart, he might not abide in the‘House of Shame’forever.However, al-Makkīstresses that:[If] a person’s belief decreases from [the weight of] a speck, he would not leaveHell, even though his appellation and his name are superficially among thebelievers. It is because he is, in the knowledge of God, one of the hypocritesand the wicked. God Most High indeed narrated their characteristic: «And lo!the wicked verily will be in hell» (82:14), then He said: «And will not be absentthence» (82:16).75As in the case of Hell, a grade of Heaven accords with the amount of belief in theheart. It is emphasised that even those in Heaven should make a constant effort tostrengthen their belief, as al-Makkīsays:The increase of belief in weight happens to those in the uppermostplaces in the seventh Heaven.76Those [whose] grades are higher77thanthose in the seventh Heaven ascend [like] the stars twinkling on the horizonof the sky.Different grades of Heaven are underlined and aḤadīth of the Prophet is quoted inthis regard.74 This analogy and a story in [49] are similar to a saying ofḤudayfa b. al-Yamān, who is recorded ashaving said that‘what was most excellent was that which was best understood, combined with theweight of a grain of faith in the heart’(Early Mystic, p. 64).75 Cf. 82:15 «They will burn therein on the Day of Judgment».76ʿIllīyūn: a place in the seventh heaven, to which ascend the souls of the believers (Lane, vol. 2,p. 2147).

A saying of AbūMuḥammad Sahl:‘The similitude of the heart andthe chest is as the throne and the seat [of God]’.[60]AḤadīth of the Prophet is citedon the authority of IbnʿUmar:94<He was asked: O, the Messenger of God, where isGod on the earth?

The heart of My servant, the believer, is wide enough forme>. Another Tradition is referred to concerning this.[61]Al-Makkīgoes on to discuss the qualities of the heart of true believers.According to a Tradition:<The most excellent dress [in which] the servant clothes[himself] is submission in reassurance (sakīna)>. It is stated that those possessingreligious certainty and gnosis take the‘colour of God’95for their dress.96AnotherḤadīth:<He was asked: O, the Messenger of God, who is the best among the people?He replied: Every believer [who has] the determined97heart>. Then theMessenger of God–may God bless him and grant him salvation–explainedit and said:<This is God-fearing devotion which has no disloyalty in it, norinjustice, nor hatred, nor envy>.91 In the Qurʾān, this verse concerns «those who disbelieve(الذينكفروا)» (24:39).

According to another interpretation,‘pure’here means‘pure from unbelief (shirk)98and hypocrisy (nifāq)’.[63]Al-Makkīexpands these two blameworthy concepts and quotes twoḤadīthof the Prophet:<Unbelief in myummais more hidden than a creeping ant>;<The majority of hypocrites99in myummaare its [Qurʾān] reciters>. The authoremphasises that all worshippers have unbelief and hypocrisy apart from thosepossessing gnosis.[64]Al-Makkīmoves on to discuss the impulse of religious certainty. It isemphasised that certainty does not appear only through the understanding of thesuperficial meaning of what is revealed. The author stresses the importance ofthe understanding of hidden meaning and a constant effort to deepen internalknowledge of the heart.The Messenger of God–may God bless him and grant him salvation–said toIbnʿAbbās:<O God, teach him faith and instruct him [how to] interpret>.Likewise,ʿAlīb. AbīṬālib said: The Book of God Most High is our only thingthat the Messenger of God–may God bless him and grant him salvation–confided to us.

Likewise, it is said in the interpretation of His word–the MostHigh–,«He giveth wisdom unto whom He will» (2:269), [thatʿAlī] said: [Itmeans] the understanding of the Book of God.(p. 335)The Most Truthfulamong the narrators said: «And We made Solomon to understand (the case)»(21:79). He bestowed understanding of Him unto him and, through it, raisedhim above judgement and knowledge, which he shared with his father. He thenraised him above the legal opinion of his father.10098 As can be seen in Gramlich’s translation ofshirkas‘Vielgötterei’(Nahrung, vol. 1, p. 389),etymologically, this term signifies ascription of partners to God. However, in the overall contextof theQūt,shirkseems to have a wider meaning than that. In this paragraph [62],‘idolatry’wouldsoundfine, but al-Makkīseems to treatshirkand‘hypocrisy’as parallel concepts, and Lane rendersthe former as‘unbelief or misbelief’and describes it as a synonym ofkufr(Lane, vol. 2, p. 1542).Izutsu argues thatshirkandkufrare interchangeable in the Qurʾān, e.g. in the sense of‘notfollowing Revelation’,‘forging against God’,‘going astray’, because the two concepts are basedon‘uncertain...knowledge’(Concepts, pp. 130–9). He also discusses the fundamental relationshipofshirkwith e.g. arrogance (takabbur) and wrong doing (ẓulm) (ibid., pp. 145, 171). On the whole,shirkshould be understood as the state which is completely against the true,ḥanīfreligion (ibid.,p. 192). In the light of this,shirkis rendered as‘unbelief’here.99 Literally: my hypocrites.100 This refers to a verse about Solomon and his father David, and their judgement concerning thefield(21:78). As al-Makkīdescribes here, it continues as: «And unto each of them We gave judgementand knowledge». Cf. The Bible (1 Kgs 3:12), which tells a story about Solomon asking God forwisdom:‘Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and anunderstanding heart’.

One [who] enlightens intelligence [can] interpretwisdom, one [who] interprets wisdom will be aware of the warning and one[who] is aware of the warning is in thefirst rank.[66]Al-Makkīstresses that the people with religious certainty are those who arefully aware of the presence of God, and those who acquire gnosis by following Hisinternal orders. They therefore realised the necessity of the impulses, which theauthor explained earlier in this section,101in order to understand the knowledge ofthe Hidden.[67]Two Traditions are quoted. It is emphasised that the true believer isable to know what is behind the external through the‘light of God Most High’,which is interpreted as religious certainty. Two Quraʾnic verses are cited concerningthis: «Lo! therein verily are portents for those who read the signs» (15:75);«We have made clear the revelations for people who are sure» (2:118).[68]Al-Makkīhas great regard for the sayings of true believers. According tohim, Abu’l-Dardāʾ102used to say:‘God Most High casts (qadhafa) [truth] into thehearts of [true believers]103and makes it happen on their tongues.’[69]It is criticalto differentiate true believers from ordinary believers. Thinking (ẓann)104of theformer is trustworthy; however, that of the latter is not.[70]A saying is quoted:The hand of God Most High is over the mouths of the wise. They utter only whatGod–may He be praised and glorified–made ready for them from the truth.[71]Another saying is cited. It is stated that God revels some of His secrets to thosewhom He wills.[72]In this regard, a saying ofʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb105is referred to:‘Bear in mind what you are told by those who follow advice. They are the ones towhom truthful matters are revealed.’101 See [21]–[28].102 Abu’l-DardāʾʿUwaymir al-Anṣārīal-Khazrajī(d. ca. 32/652): an authority on the Qurʾān, and listedas one of the people of the veranda by Hujwīrī(Kashf, p. 80) and al-Muḥāsibī(Early Mystic, p. 63).Abu’l-Dardāʾis one of the early ascetics, and so is his wife, Umm al-Dardāʾ(d. 81/700).

According to Izutsu, this concept isopposed toʿilm, which is connected with the truth (ḥaqq), whileẓannis related to desire (hawā)(ibid., p. 61).Ẓannis also linked withshirkandkufr(see [62] and its footnote), as the Qurʾānassociatesshirkwith‘the working of the mental faculty ofẓann’(Concepts, p. 132).105 He is one of thefigures most frequently cited in theQūt, together with his son, IbnʿUmar (see Ch. 2).64Summary of Section 30 of theQūt, part 1"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"[73]Two Qurʾanic verses are cited.106(p. 336)The importance of sound judgementis highlighted.[74]Al-Makkīquotes two more Qurʾanic verses.107It is emphasisedthat God bestows the gift of knowledge and discernment upon those who fear Him.[75]Al-Makkīgoes on to discuss the importance of righteous action based onproper knowledge. A Qurʾanic verse is cited: «As for those who strive in Us,We surely guide them to Our paths» (29:69). It is stressed thatfirst of all believershave to make an effort to be on the right path to God. God will then guide them andmake them holders of true knowledge. Believers should also keep themselves awayfrom worldly people. It is stated that God has sent various people to instruct andinspire humans.108[76]Al-Makkīquotes a Tradition in this regard:<Upon the one who has acted in accordance with what he knows, bestows GodMost High the knowledge of what he did not know, and gives him success inproportion to what he acts. He will then be entitled to [enter] Paradise. On theother hand, the one, who has not acted in accordance with what he knows, loseshis way because of what he knows. [God] will not give [him] success inproportion to what he acts; then he will be entitled to [enter] Hell>.[77]Al-Makkīinterprets the meaning of‘the knowledge of what he did not know’as gnosis, which results from actions of the heart. True believers are given thisspecial knowledge and are able to make sensible decisions through it. This is theknowledge of, for instance:the difference between examination and selection, trial and choice, reward andpunishment, realisation of deficiency and [that of] excess, receiving and offering,untying and tying, gathering and separating and so on.[78]Al-Makkīstresses that if believers act in accordance with even one-tenth ofwhat they know, God will give them what they did not know.

It isstated that‘various kinds of rational knowledge are created beings’, and religiouscertainty does not appear directly from speculation. According to the author, rationalthinking itself has its place and it is still recommended to believers.[80]Al-Makkīlays stress on the point that the impulse of religious certainty appears only throughcertain sight (ʿayn al-yaqīn),1which can verify hidden meanings. Religious certaintyarrives after believers seek it persistently and achieve total realisation of Divinereality. According to al-Makkī, certainty comes rather‘unexpectedly and surpris-ingly’. It does not come to those who seek for God merely by custom, who take only arational approach, or who concern themselves in worldly matters.[81]Al-Makkīgoes on to discuss characteristics of those possessing gnosis.Hidden knowledge is revealed to them directly through certain sight. The impor-tance of complete devotion to God and remembrance of Him is highlighted. Theauthor also stresses the point that true believers are‘guided and prompted’by God.A Tradition is quoted:<Follow the antecedent of those who have been withdrawn from mankind(mufarradūn)–withfatḥa–, as well as those who have withdrawn frommankind (mufarridūn)–withkasr–.2They are the ones who withdraw1 According to al-Sarrāj, the Qurʾān mentions three types of religious certainty:ʿilm al-yaqīn,ʿaynal-yaqīnandḥaqq al-yaqīn(Lumaʿ, p. 70 [Arabic]). Hujwīrīexplains these three concepts as follows:ʿilm al-yaqīnis the knowledge of theʿulamāʾ, who observe religious practice in this world;ʿayn al-yaqīnis the knowledge of gnostics, who have sure knowledge about departure from this world;ḥaqq al-yaqīnis the knowledge of those who reject all created beings (Kashf, pp. 381–2).

The remembranceeases their heavy burdens, and they will come to the Last Judgment withlightened load>.[82]Al-Makkīreiterates the point that it is God who decides. It is stated that whenGod wills to separate those who withdrew from humankind from the rest ofhumans, the knowledge oftawḥīdappears in their heart.[God] then remembered them and remembrance of Him overpowered them.His light–the Most High–obliterated their hearts, and then their remembrancebecame incorporated into His remembrance.

If the skies and theearth were put in a scale of a balance, His remembrance–the Most High–forthem would weigh more than [the skies and the earth].[83]Al-Makkīnarrates a saying of God concerning those who withdrew fromhumankind:<Do you then see the one whom I met face to face, the one who knowsanything I wished to bestow upon him? If the skies and the earth were undertheir rules, I would be truly proud of3[the skies and the earth] for them.

The prime share of theiraim is the knowledge of absolute certainty (ʿilm al-yaqīn). This is the puregnosis through God Most High.53Istaqlala:s’énorgueiller (Kazimirski, vol. 2, p. 794).

Aservant reaches the spiritual vision of the knowledge oftawḥīdonly throughthe knowledge of gnosis. And this is the light of religious certainty. The light ofcertainty is not given unless the limbs are moved (tamkhuḍ) with the rightactions, as the skin of milk is churned (yumkhaḍ)6until cream appears. [Thiscream] is religious certainty.[86]Al-Makkīexpands this metaphor. According to the author, religious certainty(cream) is‘not the aim of seekers’, since this is still not in its purest state. Cream hasto be melted away and when all fat is removed from it, this creamfinally becomesthe cream of cream. This is certain sight, which appears after seeing the‘vision ofthe Face’in a mirror of the heart in close proximity. As in the case of cream, theknowledge of the impulses has to be melted away.

Through thisexternal striving, they realise what they should be conscious of internally.[89]Theauthor stresses the point that after sincere repentance, believers enter into the‘states6Makhaḍa: to churn milk, shake or agitate something vehemently (Lane, vol. 2, p. 2693).7 Al-Raḍwānīdoes not indicate this as a Qurʾanic verse.8 Cf. The previous part of 29:69 is: «As for those who strive in Us, We surely guide them to Our paths».(See [89].)9 This verse continues as: «And He will not grudge (the reward of) your actions».68Summary of Section 30 of theQūt, part 2"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"of novices’. They should then strive against the self and the enemy, until they reachthe impulse of religious certainty. According to al-Makkī,«As for those who strive in Us» (29:69) means: [against] their selves and theirpossessions. They strive against their enemy, as he promises them poverty andbids them to be abominable.10After conquering blameworthy impulses and freeing themselves from the shacklesof worldly desires, God will lead them to Him.«We surely guide them to Our paths» (29:69) means [that]‘We surely make away for them to the revelations of various types of knowledge’;‘We surely letthem hear the marvels of understandings’;‘We surely lead them to the closestways to Us through their excellent strivings in Us’. Then He closed the orderwith His word–the Most High–:«God is with the good» (29:69).[90]According to al-Makkī, this is the‘station of the spiritual vision’of Divinequalities. It is stated that in this station, God gives them guidance,11which leadsto Him. The believers then endure affliction,12but God strengthens13them toovercome it.[91]Al-Makkīmoves on to describe the characteristics of the heart. AḤadīth ofthe Prophet is cited on the authority of al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī:<Knowledge has twotypes. Internal knowledge is in the heart, and this is the beneficial [one]>.[92]Concerning the close connection between God and the heart, al-Makkīquotes aḤadīth of the Prophet, who interpreted a Qurʾanic verse14and said:(p. 340)‘Whenthe light [of God] is cast into the heart, the chest will be widened for Him andopened’.[93]Another saying is quoted in this regard:‘I have a heart. If I disobey it,I would disobey God Most High.’Al-Makkīstates that the heart is the messengerwho can reach God. Two Traditions are cited to highlight the quality of the heart:<Belief is what stays in the heart and the action confirms it>;<The believer sees through the light of God. One who sees through the light ofGod has insight into God Most High, and whose action is obedient to GodMost High through His light>.[94]Another saying is quoted:‘For twenty years, my heart did not have faith in myself for an instant, as I did not live together with [the heart] for one moment.’10يعدهمالفقرويأمرهمبالفحشاء: cf. 2:268 «The devil promiseth you destitution and enjoineth on youlewdness(الشيطانيعدكمالفقرويأمركمبالفحشاء).

He refers to a saying ofthose possessing knowledge, who were asked about the nature of internal knowl-edge and replied as follows:‘A secret from the secret of God Most High. He casts itinto the hearts of His dearest ones. He has told neither angel nor mankind about it.’[96]Al-Makkīquotes a Tradition of the Prophet concerning the marvels of knowl-edge, which are in gnosis of God. The significance of the Qurʾān is highlighted, asthe Prophet says:<Read the Qurʾān and seek its marvels>. Al-Makkīinterprets the‘marvels’as the innermost meanings of the Qurʾān, as God’s close associates(awliyāʾ) obtained His gnosis through His words.[97]The author confirms thevalue of the Qurʾān by quoting a saying of Ibn Masʿūd:‘One who wants theknowledge of the past and present15should examine16the Qurʾān.’[98]Al-Makkīreiterates the significance of understanding of the Qurʾān and goeson to highlight the importance of carrying out duties in this world following therevealed law. An interpretation of a Qurʾanic verse, «Lo! God enjoineth justice andkindness»(16:90),isintroduced:‘“Justice (ʿadl)”is to contemplate the Qurʾānandtounderstand it.“Kindness (iḥsān)”is to witness the understanding.’[99]Al-Makkīstates thatʿAlī’ssayingconfirms this commentary. According to the author,ʿAlīsays:Belief is [based] upon four foundations: upon(p. 341)patience (ṣabr),religious certainty (yaqīn), justice (ʿadl) and striving (jihād). He then said:Justice is [based] upon four divisions: diving into understanding, brilliantknowledge, trained discernment and the legal rule.[100]The one who under-stands [can] interpret the whole body of knowledge; the one who knows isaware of the legal rule; and the one who is discerning would not exaggerate hisbusiness and live among the people harmlessly.[101]Al-Makkīkeeps emphasising the importance of fulfilling religious duties. Asaying is quoted in this regard. It is stated that even angels do not know what isrevealed from the Hidden to those possessing‘spiritual vision oftawḥīd’. Al-Makkīstresses that completing duties according to the revealed law is the key to reachingthis stage.[102]Al-Makkīnarrates a story concerning the superiority of the heart torecording angels in terms of religious knowledge.I asked some of the righteous persons (abdāl)17about a matter of the spiritualvision of certainty.

I then asked the right recordingangel, as he is more knowledgeable than [the left recording angel], but he said:I do not know. I then looked at my heart and asked it. It told me what Ianswered you. Hence, it is more knowledgeable than they are.[105]According to al-Makkī,AbūYazīd18and others used to say that religiousknowledge does not mean memorising the whole Qurʾān. Memory is unreliable,since‘if one forgets what he has memorised, he will become ignorant’. On thecontrary, stresses al-Makkī, the one possessing knowledge is the one who obtainshis knowledge directly from God.[106]Upon my life! This one does not forget his knowledge. He remembers[it] forever. He does not need a book, as he possesses his knowledge frombeing a faithful servant of the Lord (al-ʿālim al-rabbānī).19This is thecharacteristic of the hearts of the righteous persons (abdāl), such as thosepossessing religious certainty.18 AbūYazīd al-Bisṭāmī(d. 261/874 or 264/877–8): one of the most famous Persian mystics. Togetherwith al-Ḥallāj, they are known for their spiritual intoxication. Al-Bisṭāmīdid not leave any writinghimself; however, a large amount of his sayings have been handed down. One of hisshaṭaḥāt(ecstatic utterances),‘Glory be to me; how great is My majesty (subḥānī;māaʿẓama shaʾnī)’,isasfamous as al-Ḥallāj’s‘I am the Truth (ana al-ḥaqq)’.19Al-ʿālim al-rabbānīseems to be one of therabbānīyūnin the Qurʾān: «It is not (possible) for anyhuman being unto whom God had given the Scripture and wisdom and the Prophethood that heshould afterwards have said unto mankind: Be slaves of me instead of God; but (what he said was):Be ye faithful servants of the Lord(rabbānīyūn)by virtue of your constant teaching of the Scriptureand of your constant study thereof» (3:79) (this verse refers to Christians who teach the Divine aspectof Jesus). Al-Qushayrīinterpretsrabbānīyūnas those who possess knowledge by God, reflect uponHim, eradicate themselves and acknowledge God alone, and are not affected by appearance andlisten to their heart (Tafsīr al-Qushayrī, Cairo: al-Maktabat al-Tawfīqiyya, n.d, vol. 1, pp. 241–2).According to Lane, this term denotes: one who devotes himself to religious services, who possessesknowledge of God; a master of knowledge; a worshipper of the Lord (vol. 1, p. 1006). Izutsu explainsthat being a Muslim means standing‘submissive as a“servant”(ʿabd) before God who is his Lord(rabb) and Master’(God and Man, p. 201). This stark contrast between God and His servants isemphasised elsewhere in theQūt(e.g. [120]), which also highlights the importance of the examina-tion of the Qurʾān (e.g. [96]–[98]).Rabbānīyūnalso appears in theʿIlm(ʿIlm, p. 47).

According to aTradition of the Prophet:<In myumma, [there are] those who have been talkedto20and spoken to [by God].ʿUmar [b. Khaṭṭāb] is indeed one of them>. Accordingto al-Makkī, IbnʿAbbās interprets a Qurʾanic verse21and states that apart fromMessengers and Prophets, righteous believers are those who are spoken to by God.[108]Al-Makkīstresses that this was the‘path of the predecessors among theCompanions’, who were directed and inspired rightly. It is emphasised that directknowledge of God appears through spiritual vision of the heart, which is promptedby the impulse of religious certainty. The author underlines the point that the arrivalof internal sight is subtle and its significance is obscure to others.[109]Al-Makkīreiterates the distinguished qualities of those possessing reli-gious certainty, God-fearingness and true knowledge. Six Qurʾanic verses arequoted in this regard.22[110]According to the author, the knowledge that isinspired by God-fearingness and religious certainty is the‘knowledge of specialgnosis’. This knowledge appears to those who are close to God. A Qurʾanic verse iscited in this regard.23Al-Makkīhighlights the close connection between the heart and God. Accordingto the author, the heart is the treasury of God, because the heart can understand Hissigns.«When God’s are the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocritescomprehend(yafqahūna)not» (63:7).[111] (p. 343)Comprehension (fiqh)isaquality for the heart, not for the tongue. The Arabs, you say‘I comprehended(faqihtu)’, in the meaning of‘I understood (fahimtu)’. IbnʿAbbās explains thewords of God–may He be praised and glorified–,«Having hearts wherewiththey understand(yafqahūna)not» (7:179),24and says: They do not understand(yafhamūna) with [hearts]. [IbnʿAbbās] thinks‘comprehension (fiqh)’to be‘understanding (fahm)’.25[112]Al-Makkīrefers to the six impulses26and their relationship with the heart.The impulses of religious certainty, the soul and the angel belong to thetreasuries of God, while the impulses of reason, the self and the enemybelong to the treasuries of the earth.20Muḥaddath: a true, veracious man who talks conjecturally and with sagacity, as though he were told athing, and said it (Lane, vol. 1, p. 529).

It is made from the Kingdom, so it is pleased with the Sublime.[113]The heart is‘a treasury of the treasuries of the Kingdom’.Itis‘likened to themirror’, which reflects treasuries of the Hidden. Al-Makkīexplains that these siximpulses take place in the heart and he discusses four types of its perception.According to the author, the heart has hearing, which is understanding (fahm);the seeing of the heart is observation (naẓar) and spiritual vision (mushāhada); thetongue of the heart is speaking (kalām) and taste (dhawq); and smelling of the heartis knowledge (ʿilm) and contemplation (fikr).Al-Makkīstresses that all humans have to improve their inborn reason (al-ʿaqlal-gharīzī). This enables them to operate the senses of the heart, so that Divine light‘penetrates its pericardium and reaches its deepest folds’. This is the direct contactwith God, which is called‘ecstatic encounter (wajd)’.27This is a‘state on the basisof the station of spiritual vision’. Concerning this, a Tradition of the Prophet isquoted:<I beg You for belief [which] touches my heart directly>.[114]Al-Makkīcites two sayings to support his statement:If belief stays on the exterior of the heart, the servant is in love with thehereafter as well as this world; he is one time with God Most High and anothertime with his self. If belief enters to the interior of the heart, the servant hatesthis world and renounces his desire.[115]Our [master] who possesses knowl-edge, AbūMuḥammad Sahl–may God have mercy upon him–, said: Theheart has two hollows. One of them is inside. It comprises hearing and seeing;and this could be called the heart of the heart. Another hollow is outside of theheart, and it comprises reason.[116]Al-Makkīcalls attention to the point that humans have the choice of how theyoperate each impulse. Among the six impulses, the author highlights the double-edged quality of reason.28[117]Al-Makkīreiterates that if these impulses are27 Various authors explainwajdin different ways; e.g. al-Kalābādhīstates that it is‘what the heartencounters’, which could be‘fright’or‘grief’or an‘unveiling state between the servant and God’,and he quotes:‘It is the hearing of hearts and their sight’(Taʿarruf, p. 112). Al-Qushayrīexplains theterm in a similar way and emphasises the unintentional quality of this experience. He compareswajdwithtawājud, which is deliberate ecstatic behaviour, andwujūd, which comes after the stage ofwajd.According to him,tawājudcomesfirst, thenwajdand thenwujūd, which is the truefinding of Godthrough direct contact with Him (Risāla, pp. 61–4). Hujwīrīalso has a section on these three stages(Kashf, pp. 413–16), and al-Sarrāj has a chapter onwajd, where he explains them (Lumaʿ, pp. 300–14[Arabic]). Knysh translateswajdas‘ecstatic rapture’(Epistle, p. 83), Arberry‘ecstasy’(Doctrine,p. 106), and Böwering‘ecstatic experience’(Vision, p. 72).

They relate to the‘treasuries of the Excellent, and the keys to the Mercy’. These impulses cast lightinto the heart and the right recording angels acknowledge them as good deeds.[118]On the other hand, if the impulses are operated as a tempter, they are with theenemy and the self. They are‘immoral and astray from the right path’, and theybelong to the‘treasuries of evil and the locks29of honours’. These impulses blackenthe heart and the left recording angels write them down as misdeeds.[119]Al-Makkīemphasises the omnipotence of God. According to the author, allthese impulses are‘inspiration’,30cast from the‘Fashioner’31of the self and the‘Turner’32of the heart. This inspiration is cast by Him with His‘justice to thosewhom He wills, and [His] grace and kindness to those whom He loves’. Al-Makkīquotes a Qurʾanic verse33and states that God guides humans and gives themreward, but, at the same time, He causes them to stray and gives them punishment.A Qurʾanic verse is cited: «He will not be questioned as to that which He doeth, butthey will be questioned» (21:23). God controls everything. He is the‘omnipotent,powerful and almighty King’, and He‘stays away from direct [contact with]matters’.34When God wants a thing, He just simply says‘Be’.35Then it exists.[120]Al-Makkīcontinues to emphasise the point that God‘possesses powerover everything’as stated in the Qurʾān.36On the contrary,‘a servant is weak,feeble and ignorant; he has no power over anything’. Al-Makkīinsists that thenature of this world is a test. It is stated that God‘drops a veil’on humans in order toassess them.[121]The First–praise be to Him and the Most High–, He is [the one who]tests, wills, brings forth and brings back. He makes you what you do notknow37and «He might test the believers by a fair test from Him» (8:17).29Maghāliq: locks, bolts (Steingass, p. 1278).

Al-Makkīstressesdifferences in their understanding, according to the level of an individual’s spiritualvision.[122]Believers also differ in the degree of realisation of the signs of God. Itis emphasised that God always tests humans. According to al-Makkī, when Godwills to reveal a thing from the hidden treasuries, He prompts the self in order to puta test on humans. The self is then roused and acts as evil aspiration (himmat sūʾ)38inthe heart. Then the enemy notices the heart.He is a watcher. He examines closely. Hearts are extended for him and selvesare spread out in front of him, [so that] he sees what is in them.According to al-Makkī, the enemy was‘put to a test’(p. 345)by God and givenfreedom in this regard.39If the enemy sees inner aspiration impairing the self andblackening the heart, his control becomes stronger.[123]Every heart has the Devil. However, al-Makkīlays emphasis on the pointthat this enemy can be controlled by good or evil conduct of the heart. This is a testfrom God and humans have choice. There are two types of spiritual drive. Theauthorfirst elucidates evil spiritual aspiration (himma). This is based on threequalities. One of them is desire (hawā), which is part of the self. The second islonging (umniyya), which results from inborn ignorance. The third is making falseclaims (daʿwā),40which is caused by damaged reason and attachment to this world.[124]Al-Makkīstates that any of these three factors impairs the heart, if believersyield to these temptations of the enemy. They stem from either‘ignorance (jahl),38 Sahl al-Tustarīexplains the verse, «and eased thee of the burden» (94:2), as‘We withdrew from youthe confident abandonment to other than Us...which is due to the inner drive (himma) of the naturalself’(Vision, p. 158). However,himmadoes not seem to be evilper se, as Hujwīrīstates that‘conceitreally springs from the suspiciousness...of the intellect, which is produced by the insatiable desire...of the lower soul; and holy aspiration (himma) has nothing in common with either of thesequalities’(Kashf, p. 155). Danner translates this term as‘decisive force, spiritual aspiration; fervor’(IbnʿAṭāʾAllāh,IbnʿAṭāʾAllāh’sṢūfīAphorisms, Leiden: Brill, 1973, p. 74). As Böweringsometimes renders it as‘spiritual striving’,‘spiritual drive’,‘intention’(Vision, pp. 235, 238, 255),himmaseems to designate inner power, which makes the believer aim at something. Al-Makkīdiscusses both evilhimma([123]–[125]) and goodhimma([129]–[130]). Cf.‘Streben’(Nahrung,vol. 1, p. 400).39 Cf.Satan, p. 96.40Daʿwā: a claim, a demand (Lane, vol. 1, p. 884); prétention, assertion, réclamation (Kazimirski,vol. 1, p. 706). Al-Sarrāj explainsdaʿwāas one of the Sufiterminologies, meaning somethingconnected to the lower self, like a veil between the believer and God (Lumaʿ, p. 352 [Arabic]).Hujwīrīquotes Dhu’l-Nūn and gives a warning againstdaʿwā(‘pretension’as translated byNicholson):‘Beware lest thou make pretensions to gnosis’...‘The gnostics pretend to knowledge,but I avow ignorance: that is my knowledge’(Kashf, p. 274). In a similar negative tone, Izutsudescribes the link betweendaʿwāand lack of rational thinking in Kalām. He quotes IbnḤazm andstates:‘any thesis that is not based upon...a logical proof is merely a“claim”(daʿwā)’, which cannotproduce belief in the heart (Theology, p. 125). From al-Makkī’s description of this concept as‘thedamage of reason and the attachment of the heart’,daʿwāhere seems to imply both Sufiand Kalāmarguments.

The author warns believers not to be concerned with them.[125]In order to nullify the effect of evil aspiration, al-Makkīadvocates‘strivingagainst the self’and‘controlling the limbs’. If temptations appear as forbiddenmatters, according to al-Makkī, it is a believer’s duty to resist them, as they are‘aveil between his heart and religious certainty’. If temptations appear as permissiblematters, the author recommends the reader to‘banish them from his heart’.Al-Makkīstresses that the essential nature of the existence of temptations is atrial from God. It is stated that this is the reason God created‘the self, the soul, deathand life’. God created difficulty in assessing human behaviour and caused tempta-tion‘as an embellishment’in order to check whether humans can resist it.41AQurʾanic verse is quoted: «He may see how ye behave» (7:129).42[126]Al-Makkīinsists that,first of all, a believer has to make an effort to controlthe situation and not to let‘the enemy overpower him’or‘the self tempt him’. Afterthis, if God wills, he will be able to‘see the heart at the time of [God’s] trial’and‘guide the self with the light of his belief in God Most High’. Al-Makkīhighlightsthe importance of total obedience to God. God-fearingness leads a believer toescape from the enemy. God will then save him.God Most High gives the heart observation (naẓra), [which] abates the self,effaces inner aspiration, shrinks the enemy by [making him] fall from his place,and eliminates the affliction, [which was under] his control, by removinghim. The heart then becomes clear from the influence [of the enemy] throughthe light of the luminous lamp,(p. 346)and becomes active43by the release[from the control of the enemy] through power of the Subduer, the Almighty.The servant becomes afraid of standing before the Lord,44because of theclearness of the heart [which can] see the Lord–the Most High–, and becomesscared of sin. He thenflees or asks pardon for [sin], and repents. The sign of hisGod-fearingness gains control over him.[127]On the contrary, if believers let themselves fall into the hand of evil, and Godwants them to be lost, the enemy takes over the heart. Reason then works with theself. According to al-Makkī, desire widens the chest, where the enemy expands hisplace with‘his pretence, his deception, his aspirations and his promise’.41 Cf. «Lo! We have placed all that is in the earth as an ornament thereof that we may try them: which ofthem is best in conduct» (18:7).42 Al-Raḍwānīdoes not indicate this as a Qurʾanic verse.43 Or‘becomes polished’.Malasa: to go quickly, be light or active (Lane, vol. 2, p. 2735); être lisse,poli, satiné (Kazimirski, vol. 2, p. 1147).

According to the author, byaiming at God only, all different parts of a believer become one part.47As God said,«Be! and he is» (3:59),48this happens‘as quick as lightning’, once a believer letsHis‘power triumph over [his] will’.[129]If God wishes to reveal good, He prompts the soul through inspiration ofGod-fearingness. Light glows from the essence of the soul and‘shines in the heart’.[130]Al-Makkīnow moves on to elucidate good spiritual aspiration (himmatal-khayr).49It comes from three major causes: rapidity (musāriʿa) of obedienceto the order of God as duty, commitment (nadb) to His grace, and knowledge (ʿilm)or realisation of His reality. According to al-Makkī, true knowledge is revealed tobelievers through‘manifestation of the Hidden’. Among permissible matters on theearth, it is emphasised that believers must think what is good for them by them-selves.[131] (p. 347)The author stresses once more that humans have a choice ofwhat they worship and whether they follow Divine command.[132]From here al-Makkīstarts summarising the main arguments of this section.First, the nature of testing in this world is highlighted. It is stated that there is alwayschoice between good and evil, which is described as‘the companion of the angeland the companion of the enemy’,50‘the inspiration of God-fearingness and theinspiration of immorality’,51and‘will and temptation’.[133]The way in whichbelievers see God accords with how much they realise the differences betweengood and evil. God bestows awareness upon believers through good and evil, and‘opens the gate of intimacy (uns) and longing (shawq)’52for them.45 Literally: burns, destroys byfire.46 [126] and [127].47 Rābiʿa says:‘God has to be the only goal for the lover who not only loves Him with his heart but all ofwhose limbs are hearts pointing to’Him (Dimensions, p. 78). Similarly, al-Makkīhere seems toemphasise that believers must devote themselves to God both externally and internally. Absolutesubmission to God can be achieved only after they coordinate the heart and the bodily membersproperly, and make all of them aim at Him only.48 The previous part of this verse is, «He created him of dust, then He said unto him: Be! and he is».Cf.‘And God said, Let there be light: and there was light’(Gn 1:3).49 See [123]–[125] for a description of evil inner aspiration.50 See [7].51 Cf. Q. 91:8 which appears in [1].52 These two concepts are discussed by many authors. See e.g.Lumaʿ, pp. 63–5 (on the state ofshawq),65–7 (on the state ofuns) [Arabic];Risāla, pp. 60–1 (onhaybaanduns), 329–33 (onshawq).Summary of Section 30 of theQūt, part 277"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"[134]Al-Makkīemphasises that worshippers vary in their level of spiritualvision and religious certainty. This depends on the degree of their understandingof the meaning of good and evil, which the author summarises as follows:The roots of the meanings of good and their centres are inspiration of the angel,casting into the soul and shedding lights into the books of belief and theirsections of the hereafter. [This is] the knowledge of what was ordered by Himor [what] was designated for Him, and the permissible. The roots of themeanings of evil are their opposite. Their centres are the self and the enemy.Their causes are lust and desire. They appear from ignorance. They drop a veiland produce obstacles.[135]Al-Makkīputs emphasis on the point that it is God who activates the soul.When the soul starts to shine in the heart, an angel will look at it and see‘what GodMost High founded in it’. It is stated that the case with the enemy is opposite to this.The connection between the enemy and the self is repeated.[136]Al-Makkīfinally shows a stark contrast between what believers shouldfollow and what they should not follow.The angel is moulded to guide and is disposed by nature for the love ofobedience. Likewise, the enemy is moulded to seduce and is disposed bynature to love of disobedience.The angel casts inspiration into the heart. This produces the six impulses,53whichprompt believers in various ways. Al-Makkīinsists that believers then have toimprove their heart by God-fearingness and proper conduct. According to theauthor,‘the angel looks at religious certainty as the enemy looks at the self’.When absolute certainty is confirmed by the angel, reason becomesfinally inclinedto the will of God. Believers can then, for thefirst time, trust the self, as the heart isrelaxed now by achieving absolute certainty and the appearance of true knowledge.Al-Makkīends this section as follows:The power(p. 348)of absolute certainty will become strong through purity offaith. Darkness of desire will become included in the light of certainty, and theflame of lust will die down through the appearance of the light of belief. Beliefis decorated with the embellishment of shame. Qualities of the self becomeweak because of the decline of lust, while the heart becomes strong throughweakening of the self. Belief increases by the power of certainty and theappearance of the indication of knowledge. Then guidance overpowersthrough the utmost belief and the obscurity of shame. Obedience then appearsdue to the victory of the Truth, «And God was predominant in his career, butmost of mankind know not» (12:21).53 See [21]–[28].78Summary of Section 30 of theQūt, part 2"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"List of the religious authorities and the Qurʾanic verses in the extractfrom Section 30 of theQūti.

He is your Lord»(11:34);61«And God’s is the direction of the way, and some (roads) go not straight.And had He willed He would have led you all aright» (16:9). These versessummarise al-Makkī’s argument that in the end it is God who decides. In the faceof inescapable fate (jabariyya), stresses al-Makkī, God’s servants must realise theirown actual status. They will then be aware of their duties and strive to be obedientto God, because they now see the only way they can take is the complete surrenderof themselves to the power of God.62The idea of the heart in Section 30 of theQūtHaving exploring al-Makkī’s spiritual teachings closely, this sectionfirst illustrateshis idea of the heart as set out in Section 30 of theQūt. A brief comparison is thenmade between his religious views on the heart and those of several other contem-porary and later Muslim thinkers. After engaging with the symbolism of the heart inother religious traditions and in the early history of Sufism inChapter 2,this sectionattempts to contextualise the essential features of al-Makkī’s doctrine on the heart.The main arguments of Section 30 of theQūtIn Section 30 of theQūt, al-Makkīelucidates the major characteristics of the heartthrough describing six impulses (khawāṭir). Among these, the impulse of the self(nafs) and the impulse of the enemy (ʿadū) are to be blamed and avoided,63whilethe impulse of the soul (rūḥ) and the impulse of the angel (malak) are to be praisedand sought.64The impulse of reason (ʿaql) can be either good or bad, depending onhow the believer uses it.65The impulse of religious certainty (yaqīn) is the specialimpulse and the core of belief.

Divine reward or punishment is in accordance with the level of theproper operation of intellect.67In other places, however, al-Makkīstresses that it isGod’s decision whose heart is to be guided to Him or led astray, highlighting theomnipotence of God.68From this particular argument, it might appear thatal-Makkīdowngrades human free will. However, he condemns unquestionedacceptance of belief69and keeps emphasising that this world is a test given byGod. On the whole, al-Makkīseems to argue on the basis of the idea that believersalways have choice and that they are always tested. Every heart has the Devil,warns al-Makkī, but the Devil’s activity can be controlled by good deeds of theheart. It is therefore important not to weaken the heart by ignorance, inattention andattachment to trivial matters in this world.70First of all, believers have to make an effort to be on the right path to God, andthen He decides whether He will lead them to true knowledge.71In making thiseffort, believers should start by controlling their external actions.72Al-Makkī, whonever fails to emphasise the importance of outward conduct, states that one whopossesses revealed knowledge of God should fully understand the meaning of thelaw. This person is discerning and can live in a praiseworthy way among people,without ostentation.73From this statement, it may be deduced that al-Makkīmighthave been in disfavour with some mystics who did not see much importance inconforming to society.External deeds have to be in accordance with the internal activity of the heart,since the heart has a special connection with God. It is the place where God resideson earth.74As eyes see and ears hear, it is the heart which understands Divinequality. Belief is not words: it is what isfirmly established in the heart. Al-Makkīstresses throughout Section 30 that external action is a sign which indicatessoundness of the heart.75The root of good is connected with the angel, the soul, the Qurʾān and Sunna, andthe knowledge of proper action in this world. The root of evil is, on the other hand,connected with the Devil, the self, lust, desire and ignorance of Divine guidance.These create a veil between the believer and God.76This is a test from God. Theangel symbolises obedience and the right path to God, whereas the Devil representsdisobedience and temptation.

The utmost level of belief, stresses al-Makkī, is totalobedience before the might of God. In order for the heart to point at God alone,believers simply have to let His power overcome them.77These are al-Makkī’smain arguments in Section 30 of theQūt.Religious images of the heartBased upon the Qurʾān,Ḥadīth and pious sayings, al-Makkī’s views of the heartseem to be in the same line as those of the earlierfigures in Islam seen in Chapter 2,as well as those of the followers of other religious traditions. Section 30 appears toshow that there has been a development of the spiritual image of the heart in Islamby the time of al-Makkī. However, most of those above-mentioned Sufis do notappear in the translated section. It should be mentioned that al-Makkīdoes not evenrefer to al-Muḥāsibīor al-Nūrīin this section, when one would assume that they arethe authors most likely to be included on the matter of the heart.For comparison, I would like to have a brief look at several religious authoritiesfrom al-Makkī’s time and the following period. Among the writings on Sufism, forinstance, al-Sarrāj states that religious law has both internal and external aspects:internal actions are the actions of hearts, and the science of interior actions (ʿilmaʿmāl al-bāṭin), Sufism, is in accordance with the interior part of the body, namely,the heart.78The metaphor for the heart is also used by Hujwīrī, who asserts that hisbook is composed for‘polishers of hearts’.79Al-Qushayrī, in his explanation ofSufiterminologies, states that the heart and the soul (rūḥ) are the place forpraiseworthy qualities, while the self (nafs) is for blameworthy ones.80He goeson to say, in a section onsirr,81that, according to the Sufis, thesirris more delicate(aṭlaf) than the soul, and the soul is more exalted (ashraf) than the heart.82These authors do not have a separate section on the heart. From their overallargument, it seems that the spiritual image of the heart and its importance are alreadyassumed and as a Sufiterm it does not require further explanation. This might bebecause this metaphor is easily understood as discussed in Chapter 2. In the light ofthis, it should be mentioned that al-Ghazālīincluded a section on the heart when hecompiled theIḥyāʾ. In Book 21, on the marvels of the heart (ʿajāʾib al-qalb),al-Ghazālīstates that he will elucidate internal knowledge (al-ʿilm al-bāṭin)oftheheart in this part of the book, after exploring external knowledge (al-ʿilm al-ẓāhir),which consists of acts of devotion (ʿibādāt) and the practices (ʿādāt)ofthebodily members, in thefirst half of his work.83In addition to the similarity between77 Ibid., vol. 1, pp. 346 [128], 347 [136], 362.78Lumaʿ, pp. 23–4 [Arabic].79Kashf,p.5.80Risāla, p. 87.81 Innermost part, a secret.

According to the Qurʾān, Divine revelation was sent downverbally and directly only to the Prophet. At the same time, it is also stated thatall mankind has the capacity to interpret Divine signs. Living among His createdbeings, what humans have to do is to operate their spiritual organ, the heart,properly. The Qurʾānaffirms that the heart is made to understand the hiddenmeanings of its verses.86This statement exactly echoes what we have seen inal-Makkī’s argument.Due to this supreme position of the heart in the Qurʾān, various scholars in Islamhighlight the significance of this organ. For instance, the Māturīdīschool, whichclaimed that humans are capable of obtaining Divine knowledge as the Muʿtazilitesdid, emphasise that the heart is the locus (mawḍiʿ) of belief.87The prominentIslamic scholar Ibn Taymiyya also attaches great importance to the heart as beingthe root of belief. He divides the actions of the heart from those of the body, andasserts that it is the heart which loves and fears God.88As can be seen in the summarised translation, al-Makkīuses some terms whichare claimed as Sufiterminology by, for instance, al-Sarrāj, al-Kalābādhī, Hujwīrīand al-Qushayrī. For example, the key term of Section 30,khawāṭiror sing.khāṭir,does not appear in the Qurāʾn, and neither does the termmushāhada.89These termsshould be understood as used among Sufis. At the same time, Section 30 does notdemonstrate al-Makkī’s heavy reliance upon Sufisayings. Considering the mostesoteric topic treated in theQūt, this section could have been more mystical.However, the term‘Sufi’does not even appear there. The annotated part confirmsthe suggestion that al-Makkīis a Qurʾān- andḤadīth-minded author, and that hisbook does not have to be understood exclusively within the framework of Sufism.The discussion about the symbolism of the heart in Chapter 2 further affirms thelatter point.84 Near-verbatim passages can be seen in e.g.Iḥyāʾ, vol. 2, pp. 9–10 andQūt, vol. 1, pp. 333–4 [55],[58]–[59];Iḥyāʾ, vol. 2, pp. 22–3 where al-Ghazālīseems to rearrange some passages of theQūtfromvol. 1, pp. 339 [92], 334 [64], 335 [68], [67], 339 [91], 340 [95] and 342 [107] (in this order).85 Shukri, p. 149.86God and Man, pp. 136–8.87EI2, s.vv.‘al-Māturīdī’,‘Māturīdiyya’(W.

Although it is not entirely clear what criteria were used forselecting thesefigures, it appears that they were all prominent in thefield of Sufismand Tradition over a span of sixteen years between 371/981–2 and 387/997,al-Makkīdying in 386/996. Not all of them were active in Mecca or present-dayIraq, where al-Makkīwas, and there seems to be no evidence to indicate al-Makkī’spossible encounter with thesefigures.2This chapter will compare theQūtwith two contemporary treatises,Kitāb lumaʿfi’l-taṣawwuf(‘The Book of Sparkling Lights in Sufism’) by al-Sarrāj, andKitābal-taʿarruf li-madhhab ahl al-taṣawwuf(‘The Book of Acquaintance with the Pathof Sufis’) by al-Kalābādhī. Modern-day studies of Sufism often treat al-Sarrāj andal-Kalābādhīas contemporaries of al-Makkīand regard these three as the earliestauthors of encyclopaedic Sufitreatises.3In Karamustafa’s list of‘major Sufimanuals and biographical compilations’, for example, these three authors’worksappear as the earliest extant treatises.4Schimmel describes their‘theoretical bookson the tenets and doctrines of Sufism’as the earliest writings in this genre,5and, asdiscussed later, Nicholson often compares al-Sarrāj with al-Makkīin his edition ofthe former’s work, as does Arberry in his translation of al-Kalābādhī’s treatise.There had been many Sufiwritings before them, for instance by al-Ḥārithal-Muḥāsibī(d. 243/857), AbūSaʿīd al-Kharrāz (d. ca. 286/899), al-Ḥākim1 Shukri, pp. 34–8.2 Thesefigures do not appear in theQūtor theʿIlm, with a single exception of al-Ḥusrīwho is quoted inthe latter once on the matter ofikhlāṣ(ʿIlm, p. 158).3 See e.g. Khalil, pp. 8–10.4Sufism (K), p. 84.5Dimensions, pp. 84–5."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"al-Tirmidhī(d. ca. 300/910),Ḥusayn b.

This span of approximately one and half centuries is some-times called a period of‘the systematisation of the Sufitradition’,6when greatefforts were expended to make Sufism accessible to those who were not familiarwith mystical ways of thinking. During this time, many Sufimanuals andhagiographies were compiled,7and the writings of al-Sarrāj, al-Kalābādhīandal-Makkīare often presented as the earliest mystical treatises to aim primarily atthe theorisation of Sufiideas. In the light of this, this chapter examines al-Sarrāj andal-Kalābādhīand sets out the characteristics and main arguments of their treatises incomparison with those in al-Makkī’s work.8Al-Sarrāj andLumaʿfi’l-taṣawwuf: the pseudo and thegenuine SufiAl-Sarrāj, a native of Tūṣin Khurāsān, is the author ofKitābal-lumaʿfi’l-taṣawwuf,amodern edition of which wasfirst published in 1914 by Nicholson with an abstract ofits contents.9TheLumaʿseems to be the only extant book of al-Sarrāj.10The aim ofthis treatise, which is clearly stated at the outset, is to elucidate the nature of Sufismthrough a description of the main arguments of past Sufimasters, the basis of‘theirdoctrine (madhhab), their traditions, their poems, their questions and answers’,andtheir unique use of symbols and expressions.11Al-Sarrāj urges his reader to be6Mysticism, p. 116.

Regarding Ibn Baṭṭa, aprominentḤanbalījurist, al-Azjīstates that he narratesḤadīth from both al-Makkīand Ibn Baṭṭa(Muntaẓam, vol. 7, pp. 193–4).

It consists of approximately 150 chapters(abwāb, sing.bāb), which are arranged into thirteen sections (lit. books,kutub, sing.kitāb). In the introductory section (Chs 1–6, pp. 4–15 [Arabic], [henceforth Chs 1–6,4–15]), al-Sarrāj divides theʿulamāʾinto three categories, the Traditionists (aṣḥābal-ḥadīth), the jurists (fuqahāʾ) and the Sufis, and explains the distinguishingcharacteristics of Sufism in comparison with the former two types of scholars inorder to locate Sufism in Islam.15This is followed by the etymology of the term‘Sufism (ṣūfiyya)’(Ch. 10, 20–1) and the description of the inner science (ʿilmal-bāṭin), i.e. Sufism (Ch. 12, 23–4), and its nature (Chs 13–14, 24–8).After this lead-in, al-Sarrāj provides definitions of mystical terminologies, suchastawḥīd(Ch. 15, 28–35), gnosis (maʿrifa) (Chs 16–18, 35–41), religious stations(maqāmāt, sing.maqām) and states (aḥwāl, sing.ḥāl) (Sec. 1, 41–72). Towards theend, al-Sarrāj includes sections on obscure Sufiterms (Sec. 11, 333–74), and theproper interpretation of ecstatic expressions (shaṭḥīyāt) which seem to be abomin-able (mustashniʿ) (Sec. 12, 375–436). TheLumaʿends with explanations of theSufiway of manners and understanding, and the true essence behind its apparentmeanings.This kind of arrangement is not found in theQūt. Al-Makkīprovides no chapteron a definition of Sufism, a clear comparison of Sufis with the other types ofʿulamāʾor an interpretation of their apparent heretical utterances. Al-Sarrāj’sapproach has made some scholars consider theLumaʿto be apologetic,16whileothers state that this is the sign of his‘confidence’in the Islamic root of Sufism,17asal-Sarrāj believes that true Sufis are not only in‘complete conformity with Islamicorthodoxy’but more importantly they are the‘spiritual élite’.18This seems to be aquestion of perception and, although this is not the place to explore this issuefurther, al-Sarrāj’s way of argument appears to show his organisational skill ratherthan being an apology or justification.12 Ibid.13 Ibid., p. 3 [Arabic].14 Ibid., p. 4 [Arabic].15 Ibid., p. 5 [Arabic].16 E.g. ibid., p. v [introduction by Nicholson];Mysticism, p. 120.17Sufism (K), p. 68.18EI2, s.v.‘al-Sarrādj’(P.

As stated at the beginning, al-Sarrājbelieves that knowledge and understanding can be found only‘in the book ofGod..., what is handed down from the Prophet of God...and what has beenrevealed to the hearts of those close to God (awliyāʾ)’.19In the elucidation ofvarious Sufidoctrines, al-Sarrāj supports his argument by citing the Qurʾān,Ḥadīthand the words of pious predecessors. The same idea can also be seen in theQūt.This technique, however, is not something distinctive to the two books: it can alsobe seen in much Sufi(or Islamic) literature. The distinguishing characteristic that iscommon to the two is their descriptiveness, as manifest in their attempts to explainreligious ideas in an almost pedagogic way, and their comprehensiveness, as bothdiscuss a wide range of the spiritual aspects of Islam. (Although Nicholson statesthat theLumaʿdoes not have‘a systematic and exhaustive analysis of mysticaldoctrines’as theQūtdoes,20it should be mentioned that the former is much shorterthan the latter.)These shared characteristics, however, also reveal their dissimilarity, whichmight be a reflection of their separate objectives. As clearly stated in the title oftheQūt, its target audience is those who would like to follow the path which leads toGod. In view of its explanatory character, on the other hand, theLumaʿcouldalso be for Sufinovices; however, its original intended readers are those whomisunderstand Sufism, as explained in the introduction.This different position can be clearly found in their treatment of external actions.In thefirst chapter, al-Sarrāj emphasises the importance of the combination ofknowledge and action, since‘knowledge is joined with action and action is joinedwith sincere devotion (ikhlāṣ)’,21which requires believers to have God alone as thegoal (wajh Allāh) of their life in their knowledge and action.22However, al-Sarrājdoes not provide detailed accounts of actions which could be carried out ineveryday life, whereas theQūtis full of this kind of practical description.On the whole, although theLumaʿcontains extensive discussions of mysticalvocabulary, this treatise is not for those who would like to have practical guidanceon how to become a Sufior a good believer, since the way it covers mystical ideasis aimed at those who do not know them well, not those who would like to carrythem out. This quality of practicality keeps theLumaʿapart from theQūt.(Considering this, Shukri’s statement that theLumaʿwas composed‘with thesame objective’as theQūtsounds implausible.)23The last issue that is worth mentioning in regard to al-Sarrāj is his connectionwith al-Sālimiyya. According to Nicholson, among approximately 200 citations in19Lumaʿ, pp. 1–2 [Arabic].20 Ibid., p. viii.21 This term, which can also be translated as‘purification of faith’, is an important Qurʾanic concept.For a detailed discussion, seeʿIlm, Ch. 6 onikhlāṣ.

Muḥammad Ibn Sālim (d. 356/967), a leader of al-Sālimiyya. It is clear fromtheLumaʿthat al-Sarrāj had a strong connection with Ibn Sālim: he attended IbnSālim’s gathering (majlis) and cites a large number of his sayings. Nicholsonconcludes that al-Sarrāj was not a member of al-Sālimiyya; however, he admitsthat Ibn Sālim and his theological group had a strong influence on al-Sarrāj’smystical thoughts.25There is no description of al-Makkīin theLumaʿ, and al-Sarrāj does not appear intheQūt(or theʿIlm). Although Knysh states that al-Makkīwent to Baghdad to‘study with al-Sarrāj’,26and Abdel-Kader claims that he studied‘under’al-Sarrāj,27no sources are given and it seems impossible to determine whether there wasinteraction between the two. Although we do not know when they carried outtheir writing, a plausible timing would be after they had personal contact with theSālimiyya school, due to the frequent appearance of Ibn Sālim in their works. Whatcan be conjectured so far is that their surviving treatises were probably composed inthe same intellectual milieu, or soon after they shared it.Al-Kalābādhīandal-Taʿarruf li-madhhab ahlal-taṣawwuf: misconception about Sufism and the truepath to GodAnother important contemporary of al-Makkīis al-Kalābādhī, whose fame lies inone of his two extant books,Kitāb al-taʿarruf li-madhhab ahl al-taṣawwuf,28arenowned Sufitextbook. A complete translation (based on manuscripts) was pub-lished by Arberry in 1935, and the Arabic text was edited byʿAbd al-ḤalīmMaḥmūd andṬāhāʿAbd al-BāqīSurūr in 1960. The aim ofal-Taʿarrufand itsintended readership are clearly stated in the preface. According to al-Kalābādhī,he attempts to elucidate the characteristic of the Sufiway and to refute its false imageand‘the evil interpretation (sūʾtaʾwīl) of the ignorant’in connection with Sufis; atthe same time, he wrote his treatise for those who would like to follow God’s path(ṭarīq) and are‘in need of God Most High in order to attain His reality’.29The seventy-five chapters ofal-Taʿarrufcan be divided intofive sections.30Afterpraising Sufis for their‘ears being attentive (wāʿiya), their innermost parts (asrār)24Lumaʿ, pp. xii, xxii.25 Ibid., pp. x–xi, xix–xx.

The next section (Chs 5–30, 33–86) explores the Sufiway of understandingthe central tenets of Islam, such astawḥīd, the attributes of God (ṣifāt), the Qurʾānand predestination (qadar). These true Sufidoctrines are the ones that he has‘verified (taḥaqqaqa)’from what he has studied.32Most of the chapters inthis section begin with the expression,‘Sufis were agreed...’,33and the objectiveof this section seems to be to show the conformity of Sufism with Islam.From the following section onwards, al-Kalābādhīstarts to elucidate what isparticular to Sufis in their expressions.34The third section (Chs 31–51, 86–111)discusses the religious states (aḥwāl) and the seventeen mystical stations(maqāmāt), starting with repentance (tawba) and ending with love (maḥabba).The next section (Chs 52–63, 111–41) elucidates technical terms (iṣṭilāḥāt) thatare used among Sufis but not by others. According to al-Kalābādhī, although thesewords are‘inadequate (maqṣūra)’to express the real nature of mystical states, theyare‘widely known (mashhūra)’35among those who have experienced these con-ditions.36The meanings of mystical ecstasy (wajh), intoxication (sukr), passingaway (fanāʾ) and remaining (baqāʾ), gnosis (maʿrifa),37tawḥīd, etc. are explored inthis section. The last part ofal-Taʿarruf(Chs 64–75, 141–61) analyses mattersarising mainly from the relation between God and Sufis, including various types ofGod’s favour and grace which are given to them. After al-Kalābādhī’s attempt toattest that Sufis are the true worshippers of God, the book ends without anyparticular concluding remarks.According to al-Kalābādhī,Sufis bring together various types of inheritedknowledge (ʿulūm al-mawārīth) and acquired knowledge (ʿulūm al-iktisāb), andtheir way of understanding is obtained through a combination of the‘Ḥadīth,jurisprudence (fiqh), Kalām, linguistics (lugha) and Qurʾanic science’.38As canbe seen in the writings of al-Sarrāj and al-Makkī,al-Taʿarrufis full of citations fromQurʾanic verses, Traditions and religious sayings in order to elucidate Sufidoctrines. This usual method of citing canonical sources validates the ideasexpressed and consequently, as was the case with theLumaʿ, al-Kalābādhī’swork is sometimes considered to be‘frankly apologetic’.3931Taʿarruf, p. 20.32 Ibid., p. 85.33 E.g.

The life of al-Kalābādhīis almostunknown, but hisnisbaindicates his native town to be Kalābādh,‘a quarter ofBukhārā’, where he was buried.41His social environment must have been verydifferent from that of al-Sarrāj and al-Makkī, who were in the centre of Islamiccivilisation and the Sufimovement of the time. As stated in the preface,al-Kalābādhīstudied Sufism mainly through reading,42which can be also assumedfrom his lists of Sufiwritings inChapters3 and 4.Al-Taʿarruf, on the whole, takes ahighly theoretical approach and seems to be a collection of mystics’sayings, ratherthan containing the author’s own arguments. This is significantly different from theimpressions we receive from theQūt,43and might reflect the different intentionsand social milieu of the authors.Concerning the issue of apologia, Karamustafa states that‘after all, there werenoapproaches...in this early phase of Islamic history whose credentials [and]authenticity...werenotdebated’.44Al-Kalābādhīclaims at the beginning thathe compiled his work in order to provide proper information on Sufism, and, inthe view of the fact that the major Sufis were active many miles away from where helived, his statement sounds plausible.Al-Taʿarrufwas widely read among Sufis,highly esteemed after theQūtand al-Qushayrī’sRisāla, and a number of commen-taries were made on it.45If this treatise contained only a defensive justification ofSufism, it would have been unlikely to have received this treatment.In comparison with theQūt, which explores both the theory and practice ofSufism,al-Taʿarruflacks the second element, as was also the case with theLumaʿ.Al-Kalābādhīdoes not dismiss the importance of action and quotes a Sufisayingthat‘piety (taʿabbud) is the performance (ityān) of what God imposed as duty(wājib)’.46However, the main focus of his book is on spiritual performance (whichprovides a good introduction to Sufism, as he hopes that his work can serve fornovices), while the application of the Sufitheories is not covered.Al-Makkīis not mentioned inal-Taʿarrufand al-Kalābādhīdoes not appearin theQūt(or theʿIlm) either. This itself does not say much on the issue of a possiblepersonal interaction between al-Makkīand al-Kalābādhī, since al-Kalābādhīexplains, after enumerating the names of notable Sufis, that he has not mentionedanybody close to or in his own time, though he is mindful of numerous40Sufism (K), p. 70.41Doctrine, p. xi.42Taʿarruf, p. 20.43 Cf.

Fromthe title and the contents, theQūtseems to be written for those who would like tofollow, or have already started to lead, a religious way of life (which could also becalled a Sufiway of life). This can also be verified by the coverage of practicalinformation and, in the light of this guiding feature, theQūtshould be considered asa moral instruction book which could also be used as a Sufimanual.TheLumaʿandal-Taʿarruf, on the other hand, seem to manifest more compen-dium characteristics. Their main target audience is those who have misunderstoodSufism and are not acquainted with its true meaning. Due to their comprehensive-ness, both works can be used as a guide for novices, as al-Kalābādhīhopes;however, the design of the books is not originally intended for them. It might bealso worth mentioning that theLumaʿandal-Taʿarrufhave the term‘Sufism(taṣawwuf)’in their titles, while theQūtdoes not. This could also support theargument that the former two books are written especially for non-Sufis.Although the motivations of al-Makkī,al-Sarrāj and al-Kalābādhīvary, the factthat their writings present wide-ranging discussions that have been widely readamong later Sufis makes it understandable that they are often classified in thesame category as the authors of Sufimanuals. However, it is important to note the47 Ibid., p. 33.48Mysticism, pp. 123–4.49Sufism (K), p. 69.50 Ibid.51Sufism (K), p. 84.92Contemporaries of al-Makkī"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"different objectives among them and their varied treatment of Sufism. In theLumaʿandal-Taʿarruf,Sufism is presented as one of the Islamic sciences and an effort ismade to show not only its conformity with Islam but also its excellence within it.52IntheQūt, on the other hand, the aim is mainly to encourage or warn the reader to be atrue worshipper of God, and pages are spent on the description of the actual practicesof a moral believer, rather than the definition and origin of Sufism in Islam.53It should also be considered whether al-Makkī, al-Sarrāj and al-Kalābādhīwereactually Sufis or presented themselves as such. Although they often appear inthe study of Sufism and their writings are generally classified as Sufitreatises, asthe famous examples of al-Ghazālī’sMaqāṣid al-falāsifa(‘The Aims of thePhilosophers’) andTahāfut al-falāsifa(‘The Incoherence of the Philosophers’)remind us,54it is not a necessary condition for giving an analysis of a matter, thatthe writer be a practitioner or supporter.Gramlich argues that although al-Makkī’s association with the Sālimiyya schoolcontributed to the idea that al-Makkīwas a Sufi, he does not describe himself assuch and he barely uses the term‘Sufi’; instead he often refers to‘worshippers(ʿubbād)’,‘the poor (fuqarāʾ)’,‘those possessing gnosis (ʿārifūn)’,‘those whohave reachedtawḥīd(mutawaḥḥidūn)’and so on. Gramlich concludes that not alladvocates of al-Sālimiyya were mystics, with an implication that al-Makkīwas notaSufi.55The basis of Gramlich’s conclusion that al-Makkīwas probably not a Sufi,however, does not rule out the possibility that al-Makkīactually was one.Al-Makkīputs great effort into illustrating moral practices in Islam. This couldbe considered an indication that he himself takes a practical approach to his ownbelief, not only a theoretical one, given that belief in experiential knowledge is oneof the characteristics of Sufism.Ibn Khallikān mentions al-Makkī’s ascetic practices,56al-Yāfiʿīreports his laterspiritual enlightenment57and Ibn al-Jawzīgives a mythical account of his death.58This would indicate that al-Makkīwas considered by his associates, or at least bythose who lived not long after him, to be a diligent worshipper with esotericknowledge. His deathbed scene especially, which echoes a story in theQūt,59adds credibility to the idea that al-Makkīwas remembered as a Sufi.52 E.g.Lumaʿ, pp. 4–11, esp. p. 10 [Arabic];Taʿarruf, pp. 33–86.53 See the summary of theQūtin Ch. 2.54 The former is usually considered to be clearer than any writings by the‘philosophers themselves’(Watt,Islamic Philosophy and Theology, Edinburgh: EUP, 2003, p. 90) and the latter was written torefute philosophers’views, but the clarity of his argument made the Latin world believe that hehimself was a philosopher (cf. Nasr,Islamic Philosophy from its Origin to the Present, Albany, NY:State University of New York Press, 2006, p. 113).55Nahrung, vol. 1, p. 13; Gramlich argues that‘nicht die Aussagen, die ihn unter die Sufis einreihen,decken sich mit Makkīs eigenen Worten’but‘er selbst hat sich nicht als Sufibezeichnet’.56Wafayāt, vol. 4, pp. 303–4.57 Al-Yāfiʿī,Mirʾāt al-janān, vol. 2, p. 430.58Muntaẓam, vol. 7, pp. 189–90.59Qūt, vol. 2, pp. 637–8; see Ch. 1 for the life of al-Makkī.Contemporaries of al-Makkī93"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"It is hard to know, however, whether al-Makkīregarded himself as a Sufi,asheisnot explicit about this. His writing and his association with al-Sālimiyya does notcontradict the possibility of his mystical orientation. It should be also pointed outthat it is not clear either whether the Sālimiyya can be simply called a Sufigroup,as Massignon argues that the main concern of the group iszuhdand its followerswere never explicitly considered as Sufis in the early sources.60What could beconcluded here is that although al-Makkī’s spiritual orientation might have been theproduct of his earnest religious practices, it seems to have been enough for the laterbiographers to deem him a Sufi.To a certain extent, the same might be the case with his contemporaries, al-Sarrājand al-Kalābādhī.Hujwīrīreports al-Sarrāj’s ascetic lifestyle,61and Nicholsonrelates another story of al-Sarrāj who was‘seized with ecstasy and threw himself...upon a blazingfire’but no damage was done.62Despite these few accounts showingal-Sarrāj’s ascetic and mystical tendency, his work gives the impression, asKaramustafa argues, that the author is principally a‘scholar’rather than a Shaykh,and theLumaʿis his‘survey’of Sufism.63Al-Sarrāj’s research is carried out throughhis collection of Sufisayings, drawn indirectly from written sources and directly fromhis acquaintance with notable Sufis of his time. The result of his examination providesa good overview of the history and theories of Sufism, but it lacks practical aspects.Al-Kalābādhīpushes this tendency further in hisTaʿarruf. Most of his informationcomes from reading and his study succeeds in producing an‘authoritative writtenguide’to Sufism,64as he intended, but again lacks practicality. At this moment, itseems impossible to know whether al-Kalābādhīwas a Sufi, not only because his lifeis shrouded in mystery, but also because it is simply difficult to assess a person’sspiritual orientation. However, his treatise on Sufism and his almost objective way oftreating this subject give the impression that he was, like al-Sarrāj, a scholarly typerather than a Sufimaster. Even so, the fact that their writings are a good introductionto Sufidoctrines was enough for them to be considered Sufiwriters later on.Shukri argues that al-Makkī’s work does not manifest an apologetic nature,unlike his two contemporaries’treatises.65However, as shown above, these threefigures have different aims in their writing and probably adopted varied approachesto Sufism in their lives. In point of objective, structure and main topics, theLumaʿandal-Taʿarrufshow more resemblance to each other than theQūt, with the formertwo being scholarly works on Sufism, while theQūtis a moral guide full ofwarnings and sermons. Categorising al-Makkī, al-Sarrāj and al-KalābādhīasSufis and classifying their work as Sufimanuals might not be completely on thewrong path, but seems to be too simplistic and could be misleading.60EI2, s.v.‘Sālimiyya’(L.

As al-Makkī’s major work, theQūt, heavilyrelies onḤadīth rather than Sufisayings as we have seen, this chapter will secondlyexplore major biographical dictionaries andḤadīth literary works.In order to study the extensive attention given to Islamic piety in al-Makkī’swriting, Chapter 7 will focus on al-Makkī’sinfluence on four notableḤanbalīscholars who left literary works which mention al-Makkīin thefields of Kalām,Sufism, polemics,Ḥadīth, historiography and law. An exploration of the treatmentof al-Makkīby thoseḤanbalīthinkers also reveals the complexity of theSufi–Ḥanbalīrelationship. This may challenge the general estimations thatḤanbalīscholars are simply hostile towards Sufism due to its heretical views ofthe Divine and its religious practices.The accounts of al-Makkīare widely scattered and it is also an aim of the presentstudy to collate these materials to establish the basis on which further study canbe hopefully developed.1Additional important sources, which do not fall into thesecategories, are also studied in Chapter 6, especially when they do not seem to have1 A chronological list of most of the materials treated in Chs 6 and 7 can be found in Appendix X of mythesis (Yazaki, pp. 342–3).

After an examination of historical narrativesabout al-Makkī, at the end ofChapter 7,concluding remarks are placed addressingpossible reasons for al-Makkī’s presence or absence in works on Sufism. This raisesquestions of the fundamental meaning of mysticism in the history of Islam andproblematises the way in which we study it.Works on Sufism and religious sciencesAl-Sarrāj (d. 378/988),al-Lumaʿfi’l-taṣawwufAs studied in the previous chapter, al-Makkī’s two contemporaries, al-Sarrāj(d. 378/988) and al-Kalābādhī, do not mention al-Makkīin their writings. Aminargues that this is probably because al-Makkīwas‘too closely associated’withal-Sālimiyya.2This statement, however, does not apply to at least the case ofal-Sarrāj, who was‘intimately acquainted with Ibn Sālim’and quotes many ofhis sayings in hisLumaʿ.3It is not certain whether al-Makkīand al-Sarrāj knew each other personally, nor isit clear either why the former does not appear in theLumaʿin the section where thelatter collects Sufisayings, both directly and indirectly.4The possibility that theyknew of each other does not seem to be so remote, in view of their age (al-Sarrājdied eight years earlier than al-Makkī), association and the places where they lived.If al-Sarrāj knew (of) al-Makkīand still did not mention him in his compilation, thismight be because al-Sarrāj did not consider al-Makkīto be a Sufi, or because he didnot agree with al-Makkī’s ideas as al-Sarrāj criticises many of his contemporarySufiauthors for their lack of proper knowledge of Sufism,5or because of somethingelse we do not know.Al-Kalābādhī(d. ca. 385/995),al-Taʿarruf li-madhhabahl al-taṣawwufIn the case of al-Kalābādhī(d. ca. 385/995), he states that he has not mentioned‘recent authors or the people in [his] time’,6after he lists previous Suficompilationsin hisal-Taʿarruf. He does not include al-Sarrāj in this list, despite his apparentfamiliarity with theLumaʿ.7Taken at face value, al-Kalābādhī’s statement seems tobe a good reason for the absence of al-Makkīinal-Taʿarruf. Other possibilitieswould be that al-Kalābādhīdoes not deem al-Makkīto be a Sufiwriter, or that thelatter’s work is not known to the former, since it is not certain when al-Makkīdid2 Amin, p. 20.3Lumaʿ, p. xx [introduction by Nicholson];Vision, pp. 95–6.4Lumaʿ, pp. xii, xxii.5 Ibid., p. 3 [Arabic].6Taʿarruf, p. 33.7 Cf.Sufism (K), p. 69.96The influence of al-Makkī, part 1"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"his writing or how and when his work travelled to the eastern part of the Islamicempire.

One of thefirst major Sufihagiographies,Ṭabaqāt al-ṣūfiyya(‘SufiBiographical Dictionaries’), compiled by al-Sulamī(d. 412/1021), keepsquiet about al-Makkīand theQūt.8Al-Sulamīquotes al-Sarrāj on numerousoccasions,9but the name of al-Kalābādhīcannot be found in theṬabaqātat all.This book is a summary of al-Sulamī’s own massive work,Taʾrīkh al-ṣūfiyya(‘SufiHistory’), which contains a thousand biographies of Sufis (while theṬabaqātincludes abridged biographical data of 105 Sufis). This work, unfortunately, hasnot survived in its original form, and it is unknown to us whether al-Makkīwasincluded in this lost work.AbūNuʿaym (d. 430/1038),Ḥilyat al-awliyāʾIn one of the most famous Sufibiographical dictionaries,Ḥilyat al-awliyāʾ(‘The Adornment of the Saints’), AbūNuʿaym al-Iṣfahānī(d. 430/1038) collects649 accounts of pious people, whom he deems to be Sufis, but there is no sectiondedicated to al-Makkī.10Being aḤadīth expert himself, AbūNuʿaym attaches greatimportance to the activity of the Sufis in his collection as aḤadīth transmitter.11Since AbūNuʿaym studied in Iraq and travelled widely, there seems to be a goodchance that he was acquainted with al-Makkī’s work. If he knew about al-Makkīand still did not mention him, the three possible reasons would be either that hedoes not regard al-Makkīas important, he does not consider him to be a Sufi,orhe does but disapproves of al-Makkī’s ideas.Al-Qushayrī(d. 465/1073),Risālat al-QushayriyyaAbu’l-Qāsim al-Qushayrī(d. 465/1073), a great mystical scholar, does not refer toal-Makkīeither (nor al-Sarrājoral-Kalābādhī) in his famous compendium of Sufism,8 Although Pedersen, the editor, mentions al-Makkī’s seventy‘sciences desṣūfīs’in comparison withal-Sulamī’s description in the introduction (al-Sulamī,Ṭabaqāt, p. 27).9 Ibid., pp. 23, 76 [introduction by Pedersen], 572 [Arabic, index].10 The available edition does not contain an index, and although al-Makkī’s name does not appear in thecontents, which is a list of names, it is difficult to know whether he is mentioned in the textsomewhere in this voluminous work. This has to wait for a further study (including a completeindexing).11 Melchert,‘Early renunciants’, p. 409.The influence of al-Makkī, part 197"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Risālat al-Qushayriyya(‘The Treatise of al-Qushayrī’),12where an effort is made toelucidate the principles of Sufism and to position them within the Sharīʿa.13Possiblereasons for al-Makkī’s absence in al-Qushayrī’s work seem to be the same as thosefor the case of AbūNuʿaym, i.e. it is not possible to go beyond guesswork here.Hujwīrī(d. between 465–9/1072–7),Kashf al-maḥjūbIn the earliest extant Persian treatise on Sufism,Kashf al-maḥjūb(‘The Revelationof the Hidden’), the authorʿAlīb.ʿUthmān Hujwīrī(d. 465–9/1072–7) elucidatesSufism and enumerates twelve Sufisects (ten approved and two disapproved).14Although al-Makkīhimself is not mentioned in the book,15it might be worthmentioning that Hujwīrīesteems the‘Sahlīs’(the followers of Sahl al-Tustarī)asone of the approved schools.16He differentiates this group from the Sālimīs whomhe reproaches as being‘anthropomorphists’, and he connects them to theḤulūlīs,which is described as being one of the condemned Sufischools.17According toAbūManṣūrb.Ṭāhir al-Baghdādī(d. 429/1037), al-Ḥulūliyya can be divided intoten sects, but he does not include al-Sālimiyya. The followers of the latter groupare described as those belonging to the‘theologians of the Sālimiyya of Basra(mutakallimūal-Sālimiyya bi’l-Baṣra)’, who relate themselves to the‘real mean-ings of Sufism (ḥaqāʾiq maʿānāal-Ṣūfiyya)’,18while Karamustafa states that al-Sālimiyya cannot be identified as‘Sufior mystical in nature’due to its theologicalorientation.19Since Hujwīrīdoes not expand this point further or mention Ibn Sālim–eitherthe father or the son–in his book, it remains unclear how he sees the differencesbetween the two pupils of Sahl al-Tustarīand al-Tustarīhimself, given that thedisciples are disapproved of while their teacher is introduced as a pious man andreferred to many times in theKashf.20In light of the respect for Sahl al-Tustarīwhich both al-Sarrāj and al-Makkīshowin their respective writing, as well as the two writers’intellectual relation to IbnSālim, it is not obvious why Hujwīrīremains silent about al-Makkīwhile Hujwīrīnot only mentions al-Sarrāj but also appears to have consulted theLumaʿ.2112 Knysh’s translation of theRisālaincludes an index, but al-Makkīdoes not appear there (Epistle,pp. 429–60).13 The same kind of attempt can be seen in his mystical interpretation of the Qurʾān,Laṭāʾif al-ishārāt,whose available modern edition lacks an index (Tafsīr al-Qushayrī).

This could be a reason for the absence of al-Makkīin theKashf;however, again, it is not possible to go beyond guesswork.Al-Ghazālī(d. 505/1111),Iḥyāʾʿulūm al-dīnandal-Munqidhmin al-ḍalālThe next author to examine in this section is AbūḤāmid al-Ghazālī(d. 505/1111),who mentions al-Makkī’sQūtas a Sufiwork which he consulted during his study.Al-Ghazālī’s reference to al-Makkīis not the earliest; at least Ibn al-Farrāʾandal-Khaṭīb mention him before al-Ghazālī. However, the impact of his reference maybe greater than the two other authors’, due to al-Ghazālī’s fame as a prominentscholar and his heavy reliance on theQūtin hismagnum opus,Iḥyāʾʿulūm al-dīn(‘The Revivification of the Religious Sciences’). As Brockelmann describes theQūtas the‘main source (Hauptquelle)’of theIḥyāʾ,24al-Makkī’sinfluence onal-Ghazālīis known among scholars on Sufism, as he quotes al-Makkīmany timesin his massive work.25Al-Ghazālīalso clearly states inal-Munqidh min al-ḍalāl(‘The Deliverer fromError’) that he used al-Makkī’sQūtwhen he studied Sufism.26In this‘autobio-graphical’book, al-Ghazālīcompares four groups of‘seekers (ṭālibūn)’in Islam:the Kalām theologians, the Bāṭiniyya, the philosophers and the Sufis.27He thendecides that the Sufiway of life is the best among them in order to attain the truth.After critically analysing thefirst three groups of seekers, al-Ghazālīmoves on toSufis and lists the books which he has read for his study of Sufism: al-Makkī’sQūt,the writings of al-Muḥāsibī, al-Junayd, al-Shiblī, al-Bisṭāmīand others (in thisorder).28Since various scholars have pointed out the similarities between thewritings of al-Makkīand al-Ghazālī, I will not examine this issue further here.29They all point out the great influence of al-Makkīon al-Ghazālī, and how the latter21 Al-Sarrāj appears three times (ibid., pp. 255, 323, 341) and theLumaʿis mentioned (p. 341) amongthe four mystical writings to which Hujwīrīrefers; cf.EI2, s.v.‘Hudjwīrī’(H.

(TheṢifa, an abridgement ofḤilyat al-awliyāʾby AbūNuʿaym, will be treated in the next chapter on al-MakkīandḤanbalīscholars.)The well-known prose workTadhkirat al-awliyāʾby the famous Persian poetʿAṭṭār, contains biographies and anecdotes of about seventy Sufis and saints.32Theauthor himself is not said to have actually been a Sufi, but he had admired themystics and collected their sayings from his childhood onwards.33ʿAṭṭār appears tohave written a book entitledKitāb sharḥal-qalb(‘Book on the Exposition ofthe Heart’), but a copy of it has not been found and its authenticity and evenexistence have not been clearly proved.34However, if he did write such a book, hewould probably have been familiar with al-Makkī, since al-Makkī’s fame lies in hiswork on the heart, and it would be rather odd ifʿAṭṭār did not mention al-MakkīintheTadhkira. Among the possible sources ofʿAṭṭār’s book enumerated by Arberry,namely Jaʿfar b. al-Khuldī’s (d. 348/959)Ḥikāyāt al-mashāyikh(‘Narratives of the[Sufi] Shaykhs’), al-Sarrāj’sLumaʿ, al-Sulamī’sṬabaqāt,AbūNuʿaym’sḤilya,al-Qushayrī’sRisālaand Hujwīrī’sKashf,35none mentions al-Makkī(with a singlepossible exception of theḤikāyāt).36This could be a possible reason for hisabsence in theTadhkira.30 For methodical evaluation of this issue, see e.g. Lazarus-Yafeh,Studies in al-Ghazzali, Jerusalem:Magnes Press, 1975, pp. 34–5 n. 19; Nakamura,‘Makkīand Ghazālī’, pp. 83–91; Amin,pp. 190–220; and my comments on them in my thesis (Yazaki, pp. 35–6, 43–4).

In theTadhkira, a well-known‘sober’mystic, al-Junayd, is depicted as fullof lively anecdotes.39As for al-Makkī, his only typical Sufi-like episodes are hisapparent problematic saying and his deathbed story, which seem to lack the excitingfeatures necessary to be included inʿAṭṭār’s mystical prose. I should also highlightthat, according to Arberry,ʿAṭṭār seems to have regarded al-Ḥallājas‘forming theclimax’which was followed by‘supreme crises of the early Sufimovement’, withfair justification, and the original edition of theTadhkiraended with the episode ofal-Ḥallāj.40ʿAṭṭār’s interest in post-al-ḤallājSufis might not have been huge.Al-Suhrawardī(d. 632/1234),ʿAwārif al-maʿārifThe accounts in this section so far have concerned mainly why al-Makkīis notmentioned by the authors discussed above. From al-Suhrawardīonwards, however,the tide changes and we see al-Makkī’s name in various places. This section willnow look at several famous Sufis and important works on Sufism to evaluate howal-Makkīis treated.One of the most renowned Sufis, AbūḤafṣʿUmar al-Suhrawardī(d. 632/1234),refers to al-Makkīmany times in his main work,ʿAwārif al-maʿārif(‘The Giftsof Gnoses’). In this Sufihandbook, al-Suhrawardīincorporates mystical ideasfrom early Sufiwritings in order to elucidate sixty-three topics, ranging fromfundamental questions (e.g. the essence (māhīya)ofSufism) and mystical concepts(e.g. state (ḥāl) and station (maqām)) to practical issues (e.g. good manners (ādāb)between the Shaykh and the novice). The mainfigures, whom he has consulted, areal-Tustarī, al-Sulamī, al-Sarrāj, al-Makkī, al-Kalābādhīand al-Qushayrī.41Gramlich, who translated theʿAwārifinto German, mentions the link betweenal-Makkīand al-Suhrawardīin the introduction to theNahrung, although thediscussion takes up less than half a paragraph.42Ohlander also mentionsal-Makkī’sinfluence on al-Suhrawardīin his study on the latter;43however, thereseems to be no other detailed study.

If the knowledge ofthem is a duty, the knowledge of action according to them becomes a duty.He said that the knowledge oftawḥīdlies with this, since thefirst [duty] is twotestimonies (shahādatān).46Purification of faith (ikhlāṣ) lies within this, sincethis is necessarily Islam, and the knowledge of purification of faith lies withinthe soundness of Islam.This is most likely drawn from Section 31 of theQūtregarding knowledge,where al-Makkīpresents this argument in slightly more detail, quoting otherḤadīth.47This excerpt from theʿAwārifdemonstrates several patterns in the way in whichal-Suhrawardīrefers to al-Makkī. First, al-Suhrawardīalways putsal-Shaykhwhen he mentions al-Makkīwith a doxology (except where the name is mentionedin close proximity). Although al-Makkīis not the only author for whomal-Suhrawardīadds an honorific title and eulogy, he does not do so to all thefigureshe mentions.48Second, al-Suhrawardīdoes not always quote directly fromal-Makkī’s work. In general, he summarises the original material and sometimesadds his own comments. Third, he only occasionally mentions the title of al-Makkī’sbook, which he has been consulting. Last, this excerpt also shows the importanceof the combination of knowledge and action, which is given great significance byal-Makkīand continues to be emphasised by al-Suhrawardī.After al-Suhrawardīmentions al-Makkīand quotes aḤadīth in theQūtalmostverbatim in Chapter 19 on the mystical state (ḥāl),49he expresses his admiration for44ʿAwārif, pp. 22–35.45 Ibid., p. 24.46 This is probably because al-Makkīexplains the testimony totawḥīdand that to the prophethood ofMuḥammad separately (Qūt, vol. 3, pp. 1171–88).47 Ibid., vol. 1, p. 367. The same discussion can also be seen in Ch. 3 of theʿIlmwhere theḤadīth atissue is examined (ʿIlm, pp. 80–1).48 E.g. al-Suhrawardīdoes not call Sahl b.ʿAbd Allāh (al-Tustarī) or al-Junaydal-Shaykh(ʿAwārif,e.g. pp. 15, 23, 18). He does so for al-Shaykh al-ṢāliḥAbu’l-FatḥMuḥammad b.ʿAbd al-Bāqī, butwithout a doxology (ibid., e.g. p. 28).49 Ibid., p. 108.

According to Knysh,‘almost all ofthe early writers onsamāʿwere Persians, with the exception of’al-Makkī(Mysticism, p. 323),although al-Makkīmight have been Persian (see Ch. 1).53Qūt, vol. 3, pp. 1711–39.54ʿAwārif, pp. 127 (cf.Qūt, vol. 2, p. 1094) and 133 (theQūthas a similar argument to that here (vol. 2,p. 1094), but I could notfind the exact place).55ʿAwārif, p. 162. Although the length of the period is not specified, this seems to be based on aQurʾanic verse, «And David guessed that We had tried him, and he sought forgiveness of his Lord,and he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and repented. So We forgave him that» (38:25–6).The Hebrew Bible tells a story where David prostrated and fasted for his child after he hadcommitted adultery with Bathsheba and had her husband, Uriah, killed; however, he stoppedfasting on the seventh day (2 Sm 12:16–19). The Babylonian Talmud does not contain the samekind of story.56Qūt, vol. 3, p. 1376.57ʿAwārif, p. 236;Qūt, vol. 1, pp. 222–3. Cf.

If [reading] this does not do any good, say «Say: He is God, theOne»61250 times while performingrakʿathirteen times.Al-Suhrawardī, on the other hand, reduces the number greatly and recommendssaying this versefive times for eachrakʿa, for a start, and then ten times, andmore, if one has not memorised the Qurʾān.62This seems to be the only place whereal-Suhrawardīmakes changes to al-Makkī’s original statement.Al-Makkīnext appears in Chapter 48, concerning how to divide the night ofstanding (qiyām al-layl),63which is based on a Qurʾanic verse, «And who spend thenight before their Lord, prostrate and standing» (25:64). TheQūthas a section onthis theme, quoting the same verse (among others),64and this is the only placewhere al-Suhrawardīmentions the titleQūt al-qulūb, not only its author’s name.The‘book of Shaykh AbūṬālib al-Makkī’is then referred in Chapter 55 on goodmanners towards comrades (ṣuhba) and brothers (ikhwa), where al-Suhrawardīclaims that this topic has already been treated in al-Makkī’s book which covers‘every good thing about this’.65The last reference to al-Makkīis in Chapter 56, where al-Suhrawardīexplainsgnosis, the self (nafs), soul (rūḥ) and body.66This chapter deals with variousmatters regarding the heart and there are several arguments andḤadīth whichecho topics in al-Makkī’s writing. Al-Suhrawardīmentions his name only once inthis chapter and it is not clear whether his discussions are directly from al-Makkī.For example, al-Suhrawardīstates that:67If the soul operates (tataḥarraka) for good, light appears in the heart from itsmovement (ḥaraka) and the angel sees [the light]..., while [if the soul]operates for evil, darkness appears in the heart from its movement and theDevil sees the darkness.58ʿAwārif, p. 258.59Qūt, vol. 1, p. 57.60 Sūra 67.61 Cf.

Al-Suhrawardīuses a range of al-Makkī’s main arguments,such as knowledge as a religious duty, the importance of recognition of thedifference between permissible, forbidden and obscure matters, and both spiritualand practical elements, such as the concepts ofḥāl, the heart and the soul, andsamāʿpractice, fasting,rakʿaand certain codes of manners. Al-SuhrawardīalsotransmitsḤadīth from al-Makkī’s writing, which is full of it. Therefore, it does notseem to be so absurd to suggest that al-Suhrawardīmight have used al-Makkī’sideas without mentioning his name. For instance, a quick look at Chapter 56 of theʿAwārifis enough to recognise a similar argument in al-Makkī’s work (especiallySection 30 of theQūton the characteristics of the heart).69One of al-Suhrawardī’s disciples, Abu’l-Baqāʿal-Tiflīsī(d. 631/1234),composed a poem about al-Makkī. After praising theQūtas an‘excellentoeuvre’, al-Tiflīsīrecites that this work concerns hidden matters beyond the rationalsphere, revealing the reader’sdeficiencies.70According to Ohlander, al-Tiflīsī, whois associated with the line of Shumaysāṭiyyakhānqāh, helped spread the teaching ofal-Suhrawardīin Syria.71A more extensive study would doubtless reveal a yetgreater influence by al-Makkīon al-Suhrawardī(and Suhrawardiyya).Ibn al-ʿArabī(d. 638/1240),al-Futūḥāt al-MakkiyyaandFuṣūṣal-ḥikamAfter al-Suhrawardī, the next important Sufiphilosopher who shows high regardfor al-Makkīis Ibn al-ʿArabī(d. 638/1240). The link between these twofiguresdoes not appear to have been studied properly. However, as a copy of a section oftheQūtonshahāda, written by either Ibn al-ʿArabīhimself or one of his disciples,demonstrates, he has a great interest in al-Makkī’s work.72Ibn al-ʿArabī, one of themost influential Islamic thinkers, is known for his prolific output.73Here, his twomain works on Sufism will be briefly discussed:al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya(‘TheMeccan Revelations’) andFuṣūṣal-ḥikam(‘The Bezels of Wisdom’).68 One of the closest arguments might be a report in theQūt(vol. 1, p. 323); cf.

Ibn al-ʿArabīcalls al-Makkīone ofthe‘masters of the people of tasting (sādāt ahal al-dhawq)’75and praises him asone of‘God’s men (rijāl Allāh)’.76The titleQūt al-qulūbis also mentioned severaltimes in theFutūḥāt77and Ibn al-ʿArabīintroduces al-Makkīas‘Shaykh AbūṬālibal-Makkī, the author ofThe Nourishment of Heartsand other(s) (wa ghayrihi)’.78Although unfortunately he does not trouble to specify the title(s) of al-Makkī’sother work(s), this statement indicates that al-Makkī’s fame lies principally in theQūtbut that he is also known for other literary writing(s).Ibn al-ʿArabīshows great respect for al-Makkīand uses his ideas in variousplaces. He does not, however, always agree with what al-Makkīsays. In one place,for example, Ibn al-ʿArabīwrites:‘we do not hold what al-Makkīsaid and limitourselves [to it], nor what the other said and limit ourselves [to it]...I say...’andstates his theory.79Ibn al-ʿArabīlists al-Makkī’s name as‘one of our companionsand Shaykhs’and declares that‘we hold his view and I support his view’.80It is ingeneral clear that Ibn al-ʿArabīesteems al-Makkī’s writing highly. For instance,after he introduces al-Makkī’s theory in the section on the most important realities(ḥaqāʾiq),81Ibn al-ʿArabīsays:82Try to understand what we have pointed out and make sure of it. It is indeed amarvellous secret (sirrʿajīb) from amongst the greatest divine secrets. AbūṬālib already pointed it out in his book, theQūt.Another work of Ibn al-ʿArabī, theFuṣūṣ, is his most important work on Sufismapart fromal-Futūḥāt. TheFuṣūṣcontains the teachings of twenty-seven prophets,from Adam to Muḥammad, regarding Divine wisdom. This famous mystical andenigmatic work has been commented on by various authors, including Ibn al-ʿArabī74 E.g.Futūḥāt, vol. 1, p. 260, vol. 2, pp. 62–3, vol. 3, pp. 172–3, vol. 4, pp. 190–1, 256.75 Ibid., vol. 1, p. 602.76 Ibid., vol. 4, p. 190. Chittick quotes a passage where Ibn al-ʿArabīcites al-Makkī:‘Shaykh AbūṬālib al-Makkī, author ofHeart’s Food, and other men of God have said,“God never disclosesHimself in a single form to two individuals, nor in a single form twice”’(Imaginal Worlds,p. 160; cf.The SufiPath of Knowledge, Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1989,p. 354).77 E.g.Futūḥāt, vol. 1, p. 63, vol. 4, pp. 190, 256.78 Ibid., vol. 4, p. 256.79 Ibid., vol. 2, p. 62.80 Ibid., vol. 3, p. 172.81 Although I could not locate the exact place where al-Makkītalks about‘the sublime celestialbody (al-farak al-ʿuluwī)’, this term can be found in two places in theQūt(vol. 2, pp. 660,1135).

Due to the scope of this book and the volume of Ibn al-ʿArabī’s work, it isdifficult to examine the link between them further here; however, as in the case ofal-Suhrawardīand other subsequentfigures, the influence of al-Makkīon theserenowned Sufis deserves more academic attention.Jalāl al-DīnRūmī(d. 672/1273),Mathnawī-i maʿnawīOne of the best-known Persian Sufipoets, Jalāl al-DīnRūmī(d. 672/1273), alsospeaks highly of al-Makkīin his masterpiece,Mathnawī-i maʿnawī(‘The Poems ofInner Meaning’). Iqbal argues that Rūmīmust have read al-Sarrāj’sLumaʿ,al-Kalābādhī’sTaʿarruf, Hujwīrī’sKashf, al-Makkī’sQūtand al-Qushayrī’sRisāla, although not all of them are mentioned in theMathnawī.85According toIqbal, theQūtis quotedfive times.86However, apart from a place where the phrase‘qūt al-qulūb’clearly appears as a book title, the intention of the poet is not alwaysobvious, because of the allusive nature of his edificatory masterpiece.The verse where theQūtis cited demonstrates Rūmī’s esteem for al-Makkī:87Nine hundred years Noah (walked) in the straight way, and every day he had anew sermon to preach.His ruby (lip) drew its eloquence from the corundum (precious jewel) in thehearts (of prophets): he had not read (mystical books like) theRisálaor theQútu’l-qulúb.83 Ibn al-ʿArabī,Fuṣūṣal-ḥikam,Beirut:Dāral-Kitābal-ʿArabī, 1970, p. 165; cf. p. 349 [index].Al-Makkīis mentioned twice in the latter half of this edition, which contains an annotation of thetext (pp. 227, 277).

Although there may be only one (or two)places inMathnawīwhere Rūmīclearly refers to theQūt, this is enough to seeRūmī’s respect for theQūt. This also indicates that theQūtmust have been so wellknown among (at least) Sufis at the time of Rūmīthat the title could be used in ametaphorical way.88 Rūmī,Mathnawī, vol. 8, p. 367.89 Ibid., vol. 4, p. 73 (III. 1284–5); vol. 3, p. 73.90 Ibid., vol. 8, p. 35.91 Ibid., vol. 4, p. 345 (IV. 1317–18); vol. 4, p. 356.92 Ibid., vol. 8, p. 138.93Qūt, vol. 1, pp. 324–6; see Ch. 3 [19]–[29].94 Rūmī,Mathnawī, vol. 2, p. 52 (I. 927); vol. 1, p. 58, and vol. 2, p. 256 (III. 4591); vol. 3, p. 263.

To al-Rundī, these are truths,but it is simply too difficult for the novice to grasp their deeper meanings, as theyare incomprehensible in the conventional way. A similar approach can be seenwhen al-Rundīadmits that the authenticity ofḤadīth which al-Makkīquoted isquestionable. Al-Rundīgives full support to al-Makkī’s argument that if a certainTradition has been circulated and does not contradict the Qurʾān or Sunna, it can beconsidered as authoritative material (ḥujja), in spite of its obscureisnād.115Al-Rundī’s defence of al-Makkīcan also be seen in another place. In Letter 16,where he emphasises the importance of having a Shaykh as a guide on the Sufipath,116al-Rundīadmits that this sort of argument does not appear in the earlywriters’discourse, such as that of al-Muḥāsibīand al-Makkī. However, he claimsthat the tendency to rely on a Shaykh almost as a parent, who nourishes his child(shaykh al-tarbīt),117started later. At the time of these earlyfigures, the role of aShaykh was to instruct the novice (shaykh al-taʿlīm), and having a spiritual guidewas not a requirement. This is why the issues around the Shaykh cannot be found inthe early writings. However, al-Rundīinsists, they still cover the fundamentalmatters of Sufism, and this is especially true in the case of al-Makkī.118This statement is of interest not only in the light of the link between al-Makkīand al-Rundī. It shows al-Rundī’s recognition of a change in the role of a SufiShaykh and his classification of the history of Sufism into early and later periods,with al-Makkībeing in the early one. (Al-Rundīdoes not specify here when thelater period begins.)From these examples, it is evident that al-Makkīexerted great influence onal-Rundī. Apart from theRasāʾil, he wrote a commentary on IbnʿAṭāʾAllāh’sfamous collection,Kitāb al-ḥikam(‘The Book of Aphorisms’). The name al-Makkīdoes not seem to appear in the original work;119however, al-Rundīrefers toal-Makkīin his annotation.120Al-Rundī’s commentary was a great success.Although he himself did not become the leader of the Shādhiliyya order, its113 Ibid.114 Ibid.115 Ibid., p. 24.

This is allegedly written by the famous historian and philosopher IbnKhaldūn (d. 808/1406). However, according to Talbi, its authenticity has not yetbeen proven.123The titleQūtappears in this treatise where the author enumeratesliterary works on piety, such as‘theIḥyāʾ, theRiʿāya,124theQūt, [the work of] IbnʿAṭāʾand others’.125Amin refers to this work briefly and states that Ibn Khaldūn calls al-Makkītheqāḍī.126However, the person who is designated here might not be al-Makkī.Itiswritten as‘theqāḍīAbūMuḥammad b.ʿAṭiyya said...’,127when al-Makkī’s nameis AbūṬālib Muḥammad b.ʿAlīb.ʿAṭiyya and has been referred to so far as AbūṬālib or AbūṬālib al-Makkīin the Arabic writings. Ibn Khaldūn’s famous workal-Muqaddima(‘The Introduction’) has a section on Sufism, but neither al-Makkīnor theQūtappears there.128Together with the authenticity of theShifāʾ, the linkbetween al-Makkīand Ibn Khaldūn is not clear.Jāmī(d. 898/1492),Nafaḥāt al-unsAl-Makkīcan next be seen inNafaḥāt al-uns(‘Breezes of Intimacy’), written by thePersian poetʿAbd al-RaḥmānJāmī(d. 898/1492).

The relationshipof Shaykh Abu’l-Ḥasan is with his father, AbūʿAbd AllāhAḥmad Ibn Sālimand the relationship of his father is with Sahl b.ʿAbd Allāh Tustarī–may GodMost High sanctify their souls–.It should also be mentioned that although Jāmīcomposed his treatise based onṬabaqāt al-ṣūfiyya(‘SufiBiographical Dictionaries’) of a famousḤanbalīSufi,ʿAbd AllāhAnṣārī(d. 481/1089), andʿAṭṭār’sTadhkira,130Jāmīadds al-Makkī,who is not included in the two works which the former consulted.MullāṢadrā(d. 1050/1640)After Jāmī, al-Makkīdoes not appear so often in the Muslim works on Sufism.131For instance,ʿAbd al-Wahhābb.Aḥmad al-Shaʿrānī(d. 973/1565), an EgyptianSufi, does not have an entry dedicated to al-Makkīin his collection of Sufiwordsand deeds,al-Ṭabaqāt al-kubrā(‘The Major Classes’),132even though he wasgreatly influenced by the Shādhiliyya order.133However, Nasr points out thatShīrāzīSaḍr al-Dīn MullāṢadrā(d. 1050/1640), one of the most renownedShīʿite philosophers, was deeply influenced by early Sufiwritings, such as theQūt,Manāzil al-sāʾirīn(‘Places of the Wanderers’),134theʿAwārif, theIḥyāʾ, theMathnawī, theFuṣūṣand theFutūḥāt.135Most of these books have been discussed130 Cf.EI2, s.v.‘Djāmī’(Cl. Huart);Mysticism, pp. 138, 163.131 Gramlich, Amin and Shukri also failed tofind major books on Sufism which mention al-Makkī.132 The available edition does not include an index; al-Shaʿrānī,al-Ṭabaqāt al-kubrā, 2 vols in 1,Cairo: al-Maṭbaʿat al-ʿĀmirat al-ʿUthmāniyya, 1316/1898.

Winter);Mysticism, p. 252.134 Written by Anṣārī.135 Nasr states that MullāṢadrāoften quotes these writings, but he does not refer to any specific pagenumbers (Ṣadr al-DīnShīrāzīand his Transcendent Theosophy, Tehran: Imperial Iranian Academyof Philosophy, 1978, pp. 73–4). He also emphasises MullāṢadrā’s great acquaintance withal-Ghazālī’s thought (ibid., p. 81 n. 10). It is beyond the scope of the present study to check allthe books MullāṢadrācompiled; however, e.g. in his commentary onḤikmat al-ishrāq, written bythe famous philosopher Yaḥyāb.Ḥabash al-Suhrawardī(d. 587/1191), MullāṢadrārefers to Ibnal-ʿArabīmany times, and also mentions, although much less frequently, al-Ḥallāj, al-GhazālīandRūmī(Le livre de la sagesse orientale, Lagrasse: Verdier, 1986, see pp. 677–80 [index des noms]).In histafsīrof the Light verse, MullāṢadrāagain refers to many writers on Sufism, such as Dhu’l-Nūn al-Miṣrī, Sahl al-Tustarī, al-Ḥallāj and al-Ghazālī(On the Hermeneutics of the Light-Verse ofthe Qurʾān, London: ICAS Press, 2004, see pp. 163–7 [index]). Not only the matter of al-Makkī,but also the link between MullāṢadrāand Sufism seems to deserve more academic attention, asNasr suggests. In terms of al-Makkī, he does not appear inal-Maẓāhir al-ilāhiyya,Kasr aṣnāmal-jāhiliyyaorMashāʿir.

This is an extensive commentary onal-Ghazālī’sIḥyāʾ, where Muḥammad Murtaḍāpays special attention to words aswell as traditions which appear in the book.136This issue does not seem to havebeen discussed properly, although Reichmuth refers to al-Makkīin his work onMuḥammad Murtaḍāand states that the‘main source’of al-Ghazālīin thefield ofSufism is al-Makkī, whoseQūtis quoted‘at length’in theItḥāf.137The available1894 edition does not contain an index, and it would be impossible to present acomplete analysis here; however, it is still worth mentioning how al-Makkīistreated in this voluminous commentary.In a chapter commenting on Section 2 of theIḥyāʾregarding the foundations of thearticles of faith (kitābqawāʿid al-ʿaqāʾid), Muḥammad Murtaḍāpresents al-Makkīas the‘author of theQūt’, and states, for instance,‘this is how the author of theQūtcited from Sahl’or‘this is the saying [which] the author of theQūtcited inSection 33’.138Al-Makkīappears throughout in a chapter on Section 21 of theIḥyāʾconcerning the wonders of the heart (kitābʿajāʾib al-qalb).139At the beginningof this chapter, Muḥammad Murtaḍācalls al-Makkīal-Shaykh, while he does notgive any honorific title to otherfigures, such as al-Junayd, IbnʿAṭāʾ,al-Ḥasanal-Baṣrī,AbūNuʿaym or al-Qushayrī.140Several tendencies can be seen in how Muḥammad Murtaḍārefers to al-Makkī.At least in this chapter on the heart, al-Makkī’sQūtis the most frequently citedwork, followed by, probably, AbūNuʿaym’sḤilya, al-Suhrawardī’sʿAwārifand some work of al-ʿIrāqī.141Apart from thefirst entry, al-Makkīis always136EI2, s.v.‘Muḥammad Murtaḍā’(C.

Al-Makkī’s reference to Sahl al-Tustarīis sometimes quoted in theItḥāf(e.g. vol. 7, p. 254), which could show the former’s importance inthe study of the latter, as Böwering suggests in hisVision, pp. 25–8et passim.139Itḥāf, vol. 7, pp. 205, 224, 228, 229, 230, 234, 235, 236, 237, 240, 241, 244, 254, 255, 256, 257,258, 259, 260, 263, 264, 266, 267, 269, 299, 302, 303, 305, 307, 308, 312.140 As for al-Makkī, see ibid., vol. 7, p. 205.

This issue seems to be worth specialinvestigation, and a comprehensive index of theItḥāfis awaited.As can be seen from al-Ghazālī, and especially al-Suhrawardīonwards, many notablemystical authors show their great respect for al-Makkī. It is therefore puzzling whyal-Makkīis not included in early Sufihagiographical writings. It is possible thatal-Makkīis not known to those compilers, or is known but considered as of lesserimportance. However, such a conclusion seems implausible, considering the factthat al-Ghazālīstarted his study of Sufism with theQūt, among other famous writings.The intention of the earlier compilers is still not entirely clear; however, al-Makkī’sentryinJāmī’s hagiography seems more explainable. After being cited in variousimportant mystical works, al-Makkīmust have established a reputation as a Sufiwriterby the time of Jāmī.Al-Makkī’s appearance in other types of writings might have hadan influence on Jāmī’s selection; however, this is no more than a hypothesis.Ḥadīth and biographical literatureHaving examined al-Makkīas a Sufiauthor in works on Sufism and otherreligious sciences, this section explores how al-Makkīis treated in medievalgeneralṭabaqātliterature andḤadīth literary works–does he always appear asaSufimaster? Since many authors of well-known biographical literature areḤadīthscholars and it is difficult (and sometimes pointless) to try to separateḤadīthliterature from biographical dictionaries, they will be studied together here.Al-Khaṭīb (d. 463/1071),Taʾrīkh BaghdādOne of the earliest extant sources to mention al-Makkīis found in the famousbiographical reference book forḤadīth scholars,Taʾrīkh Baghdād(‘The History of142 E.g. the former:Itḥāf, vol. 7, pp. 228, 234; the latter: vol. 7, p. 229 (in four places), p. 230.143 Ibid., vol. 7, p. 308.144 Ibid., vol. 7, p. 312.The influence of al-Makkī, part 1115"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Baghdad’), written by AbūBakr Aḥmad al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī(d. 463/1071).145As discussed in Chapter 1, his short (but valuable) sketch of al-Makkī’s life hasoften been cited by later authors. From his account, it can be discerned that althoughal-Khaṭīb cannot fail to include al-Makkīas one of theḤadīth transmitters to hisbook, he is not particularly in favour of al-Makkī’s thought. For instance, he statesthat al-Makkīwrites‘objectionable and dishonourable matters (munkara wamustashnaʿ)’about God in theQūt.146Since no example is cited in his report ofal-Makkī, it is not clear which aspects of theQūtmade al-Khaṭīb think this way.However, the frequent appearance of IbnḤanbal in theQūtwould not have made agood impression on thisḤadīth scholar, who was openly against theḤanbalīs.147Ibn al-Qaysarānī(d. 507/1113),al-Ansāb al-muttafiqaandal-Samʿānī(d. 562/1166),Kitāb al-ansābAl-Khaṭīb’s narrative is soon used in an account of al-Makkīinal-Ansāb al-muttafiqa(‘Homonymous Lineages’), written by anotherḤadīth scholar, Ibn al-Qaysarānī(d. 507/1113).148Al-Makkīthen appears in anotherAnsāb(‘Lineages’)byal-Samʿānī(d. 562/1166).149No extra information can be found in the entry onal-Makkī, in which al-Samʿānīappears to copy Ibn al-Qaysarānī’s account almostverbatim with some minor omissions.Ibn al-Jawzī(d. 597/1200),al-Muntaẓam fītaʾrīkh al-duwalwa’l-umamOne of the most important accounts of al-Makkīcan be seen inal-Muntaẓam fītaʾrīkh al-duwal wa’l-umam(‘Systematic Arrangement in the History of States andCommunities’) by the famousḤanbalīscholarʿAbd al-Raḥmān Ibn al-Jawzī(d. 597/1200), as discussed in Chapter 1.

Al-Dhahabīmade six abridgements ofTaʾrīkh al-Islāmby himself, and one of them,al-ʿIbar fīkhabar man ghabar(‘Lessons in the Narrative[s] of Those Who Have Lived in Some Time Past’), hasa short account of al-Makkī, where he is recorded as having encountered Sufism, ashaving been a disciple of Abu’l-Ḥasan Ibn Sālim who was the head of al-Sālimiyya,and as having become the Shaykh of the School himself.161(Amin claims thatal-Dhahabīis thefirst author who reports that‘in his opinion at any rate, al-Makkīwas a pupil of Ibn Sālim’.162Al-Khaṭīb, however, mentions the link betweenal-Makkīand Ibn Sālim nearly 300 years before al-Dhahabī, and his statementhas been copied in various places. A translation of this account is offered by Aminhimself.)163In addition to his many books on history, al-Dhahabīcompiled several works inthefield ofḤadīth. In hisMīzān al-iʿtidāl(‘The Scales of Justice’), al-Dhahabīenumerates more than eleven thousandḤadīth authorities and presents al-Makkīas an ascetic (zāhid) and a preacher (wāʿiẓ).164His short account explainsal-Makkī’s main authorities for the narration ofḤadīth, and gives the name of afigure who transmittedḤadīth from al-Makkī, in addition to some quotes fromal-Khaṭīb’s account of al-Makkī.

This diverges from the rather approving tonewhich al-Dhahabīadopts in hisTaʾrīkh, or the neutral statements in theʿIbarasdiscussed above. The term‘Sufi’does not appear in the report in theMīzān, unlikethe accounts in his other two works, or the narrative in theSiyarwhich will beintroduced next.158Taʾrīkh (381), pp. 127–8.159 See Ch. 1.160Taʾrīkh (381), p. 127.161ʿIbar, vol. 3, pp. 33–4.162 Amin, p. 26.163Taʾrīkh, vol. 3, p. 89; Amin, pp. 21–2.164Mīzān, vol. 3, p. 655.118The influence of al-Makkī, part 1"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Al-Dhahabī’s voluminous work onḤadīth transmitters,Siyar aʿlām al-nubalāʾ(‘Biographies of Noble Personalities’), contains a much longer account of al-Makkīthan that in theMīzān, although most information in theSiyaris almost the same asthat in al-Dhahabī’sTaʾrīkh.165Unlike in the latter, however, al-Makkīis clearlyintroduced as‘an imām, an ascetic, a knowledgeable person (ʿārif) and a SufiShaykh’, who was brought up in Mecca but was originally Persian (ʿajamī).166Al-Makkī’s ascetic exercises are highlighted in theSiyar, as an episode is presentedin which his belly became green due to his limiting his diet to herbs.167Al-Dhahabīthen quotes from al-Khaṭīb’sTaʾrīkh, including al-Makkī’s problematic saying,narrates his deathbed story and mentions hisḤadīth collection and hisḤadīthmasters, as can be seen in al-Dhahabī’sTaʾrīkh.Towards the end of the account in theSiyar, the fame of theQūtis underlined.Notably, the heading of this report is‘the author of theQūt(ṣāḥib al-Qūt)’, notal-Makkīor AbūṬālib al-Makkī, while most headings in theSiyarare the name of afigure.168This verifies al-Dhahabī’s statement about theQūtbeing famous. TheQūtmust have been sufficiently well known in the time of al-Dhahabīthat he couldexpect his reader to identify al-Makkīsimply by saying‘the author of theQūt’(and notQūt al-qulūb).On the basis of the examination of his biographical worksTaʾrīkh al-Islāmandal-ʿIbar, and theMīzān, andḤadīth literature theSiyar, al-Dhahabī’s opinion onal-Makkīis, on the whole, not entirely clear. In his work on weakḤadīth transmit-ters,Tadhkirat al-ḥuffāẓ(‘Memorial of the Qurʾān Masters’), al-Makkīis notlisted.169This might indicate that he does not consider al-Makkīas a transmitterof dubious Traditions, contrasting with Ibn al-Jawzī’s criticism of al-Makkīon thisaccount. When al-Dhahabītouches upon al-Makkī’sḤadīth collection in theTaʾrīkhand theSiyar, he could have made negative comments on this compilation,since he stated that he had seen it. But he does not take a disapproving tone here;rather, he quotes a few Traditions from al-Makkī’s collection. It may therefore bededuced that, in terms of aḤadīth transmitter, al-Dhahabīdoes notfind anythingparticularly unacceptable in al-Makkī’s works.As discussed above, theMīzāngives the impression that al-Dhahabīhas anegative opinion of al-Makkī. On the other hand, in theTaʾrīkh, al-Dhahabī165Siyar, vol. 16, pp. 536–7; cf.Taʾrīkh (381), pp. 127–8.166Siyar, vol. 16, p. 536.167 Ibid., vol. 16, p. 537. This story might be from an account in Ibn Khallikān’sWafayāt(vol. 4,p. 303), but it is not clear.168Siyar, vol. 16, p. 536. Al-Makkīis also introduced as‘the author of theQūt’in theMīzān(vol. 3,p. 655).169 This work has been supplemented many times; e.g.Dhayl tadhkirat al-ḥuffāẓby Muḥammad b.ʿAlīal-Ḥusaynī(d. 763/1362),Laḥẓal-alḥāẓbi-dhaylṭabaqāt al-ḥuffāẓby Muḥammad al-Hāshimīal-Makkī(d. 871/1466) andDhaylṭabaqāt al-ḥuffāẓby Jalāl al-Dīn al-Suyūṭī(d. 911/1505).Al-Makkīdoes not appear in thefirst two works at least, and probably not in the last one either(all three works are published in one volume; al-Ḥusaynī,Dhayl tadhkirat al-ḥuffāẓ, Beirut: DārIḥyāʾal-Turāth al-ʿArabī, 1968. Only the last work does not have an index in this edition).The influence of al-Makkī, part 1119"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"makes a positive comment on al-Makkī’s writing style on the subject of Sufism, andquotes al-Khaṭīb as in theMīzān, but omits the latter’s criticism of theQūt. There isa possibility that al-Dhahabīhad not read al-Makkī’s work himself when he wrotetheMīzān, where he mainly cites from al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī; but al-Dhahabīhadbecome acquainted with al-Makkībefore he compiled theTaʾrīkh, where hepresented his own opinion. TheTaʾrīkhwas abridged by the author himself sixtimes and the estimated end date of the compilation of this work therefore cannot bevery late in his life. However, the timing of al-Dhahabī’s writing is unknown andthis issue cannot progress beyond hypothesis.170Al-Dhahabī’s ambivalent views on al-Makkīmay be due to his indefinite posi-tion on Sufism in general, and not particularly because of al-Makkī. For instance, inan account of al-Muḥāsibīin theMīzān, al-Dhahabīquotes a saying of AbūZurʿawho criticises al-Muḥāsibī’s works for being innovative, erroneous and strayingfrom the right path (ḍalālāt), and states that:171Where is someone like al-Ḥārith [al-Muḥāsibī]? How then if AbūZurʿa sawthe writings of the later authors, such as theQūtof AbūṬālib [al-Makkī].Where is something like theQūt? How then if he sawBahjat al-asrārof IbnJahḍam172andḤaqāʾiq al-tafsīrof al-Sulamī; his mind wouldfly away.Al-Dhahabīcontinues by enumerating al-Ghazālī’sIḥyāʾ,ʿAbd al-Qādir’sal-Ghunya, and Ibn al-ʿArabī’sFuṣūṣandFutūḥātin the same vein, and thenconcludes that at the time of al-Muḥāsibī, there were‘a thousand imāms’in thefieldofḤadīth, such as IbnḤanbal.173This statement gives the impression thatal-Dhahabīrejects these major authors on Sufism, and recommends the reader tostudy‘proper’(according to his estimation)Ḥadīth scholars. (It is probably thisstatement to which al-Suyūṭīresponds and claims that al-Dhahabī’s comment ismisleading, as he‘murmurs against Imām Fakhr al-Dīn b. al-Khaṭīb [al-Rāzī]’,against the one who is‘greater than the imām’, namely‘AbūṬālib al-Makkī, theauthor ofThe Nourishment of Hearts’, and against the one who is‘greater than AbūṬālib’, namely‘Shaykh Abu’l-Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī’. Finally, al-Suyūṭīannounces thatal-Dhahabī’s statement is‘not accepted regarding them’.)174However, in his account of the Sufipoet Ibn al-Fāriḍ(d. 632/1235), al-Dhahabīsays that although the work of this poet is something on which‘you [would] turnyour back’, he advises that you‘do not hasten [to judge]’, but, rather, keep‘a good170 Cf.EI2, s.v.‘al-Dhahabī’(M.

Examining his apparently contradictory narratives on al-Makkī,and his sayings on the writers on Sufism and his opinion on mysticism, it appears tobe difficult to make general observations about al-Dhahabī’s position on al-Makkīor Sufism.Al-Ṣafadī(d. 764/1363),al-Wāfībi’l-wafayātAl-Makkīand hisQūtnext appear in an enormous biographical work,al-Wāfībi’l-wafayāt(‘Completeness in Obituaries’), composed byṢalāḥal-Dīn al-Ṣafadī(d. 764/1363).176In his account of al-Makkī, it appears that al-Ṣafadīfirst borrows anarrative in al-Dhahabī’sTaʾrīkh(including the statement about al-Makkīhaving‘a sweet tongue’in Sufism). He quotes al-Khaṭīb’s report about al-Makkī’s allegedproblematic utterance, and then mentions his ascetic practices, a reference whichcan be seen in Ibn Khallikān’sWafayāt. Al-Ṣafadīnext cites Ibn al-Jawzī’s criticismof al-Makkī’s use ofḤadīth whose origin cannot be traced.177Up to this point,al-Ṣafadīdoes not add any new information and it is not clear whether he is infavour of al-Makkī.At the end of the narrative, however, al-Ṣafadīrelates his own experience178thathe saw a copy of theQūtrepeatedly used by Majd al-Dīn al-Aqṣarāʾī, who was the‘Shaykh of Shaykhs at thekhānqāhof Siryāqūs’and he says that, if possible,he would have bought it for 3,000dirhams, but it was thewaqfproperty ofthekhānqāhof Karīm al-Dīn and he could not obtain it.179It cannot be certainfrom this whether al-Ṣafadīhad actually read theQūtwhen he wrote this account;however, it is clear that he had a great interest in this work.175Mīzān, vol. 3, pp. 214–15.176 Al-Ṣafadī,al-Wāfībi’l-wafayāt, Beirut: DārIḥyāʾal-Turāth al-ʿArabī, 1420/1999–2000, vol. 4,pp. 86–7.177 Al-Ṣafadīhere refers to Ibn al-Jawzī’sMirʾāt.

His short biographicalsketch of al-Makkīseems to be copied almost verbatim from al-Dhahabī’sʿIbar,although he does not describe al-Makkīas the head of the Sālimiyya as al-Dhahabīdoes, while he does mention that al-Makkī’s teacher is the renowned‘great Shaykhand gnostic’Abu’l-Ḥasan Ibn Sālim al-Baṣrī.The value of theMirʾātfor the study of al-Makkīlies in al-Yāfiʿī’s summary ofhis spiritual life. According to al-Yāfiʿī, al-Makkīwas in the beginning‘a man ofreligious practice and struggle (ṣāḥib riyāḍa wa mujāhada)’but in the end hereached‘innermost secrets and perception (asrār wa mushāhada)’.

He was inspired by al-Dhahabīand com-piled a voluminous book entitledLisān al-mīzān(‘The Discourse of the Scales’),where IbnḤajar reworked al-Dhahabī’sMīzān. As explained at the beginning of theLisān, IbnḤajarfirst introduces an account in theMīzān, whose end is indicated as‘concluded (intahā)’, and then his own words are presented.187This is the case withthe account of al-Makkī: thefirst part of which is an exact copy of the report in theMīzān.IbnḤajar then adds useful information about al-Makkī’s teachers, namelyʿAbdAllāhb.Jaʿfar b.

On thewhole, although his report of al-Makkīoffers some useful information, it ispresented in a simple practical manner and does not convey the compiler’s ownopinion on al-Makkī.192186 Ibn al-Qunfudh,al-Wafayāt, Beirut: Dār al-Afaq al-Jadīda, 1983, p. 222.

This biographical history was compiled for impoverished scholarslike himself who could not obtain a large number of books (EI2, s.v.‘Ibn al-ʿImād’(F.

This is also the case with his treatment of al-Makkī, whose account begins with theverbatim report from al-Dhahabī’sʿIbarand moves onto a near-verbatim narrative from theWafayātof Ibn Khallikān.

His book,al-Muʿtamad fīuṣūlal-dīn(‘What is Approved amongst the Principles of Religion’), seems to be theearliest extant source which mentions al-Makkī.1This work is an abridgement ofhis own compilation with the same title, and deals with the major Kalām arguments,such as the existence of God, Divine attributes and names, God’s will and speech,reason (ʿaql), and the inimitability (iʿjāz) of the Qurʾān. Ibn al-Farrāʾalso discussesal-Sālimiyya and the Imamate, and he ends the book with an interpretation ofKalām terminologies.2This work sheds a different light on the link betweenal-Makkīand al-Sālimiyya.Al-Muʿtamadshows the incorporation of Kalām intoḤanbalite dogma,apparently for thefirst time among the disciples of IbnḤanbal. According toHaddad, the editor, this work could dispel‘the myth of Hanbalite uniformity andanti-rationalism’.3However, the attitudes of Ibn al-Farrāʾtowards Kalām theolo-gians, especially the Ashʿarites, are not always clear. Ibn Taymiyya, who oftenquotes Ibn al-Farrāʾ, criticises him for accepting Ashʿarite views, when Ibnal-Farrāʾrefutes them in his lost work (as do others, such as the Karrāmiyya,Bāṭiniyya and Sālimiyya).

One of his lost works includes refutations of thelatter,5and theMuʿtamadcontains a chapter on this mystico-theological school,1 See Ch. 1.2Muʿtamad, pp. 11–12 [Arabic]; cf. pp. 13, 27–8 [Arabic].3 Ibid., p. 28.4 Ibid., pp. 21, 25;EI2, s.v.‘Ibn al-Farrāʾ’(H.

Gramlich also highlights this point and arguesthat it is questionable to criticise al-Makkīfor his association with the allegedheretical teachings of al-Sālimiyya. After comparing four propositions of Ibnal-Farrāʾagainst al-Sālimiyya with al-Makkī’s views of each of these in theQūt,Gramlich tries to point out how the former misunderstands the ideas of theSālimiyya. Gramlich concludes that its heresy is the product of its adversaries,and that the negative comments by al-Khaṭīb on theQūtshould be interpreted in thesame way.7Bin Ramli carries out more thorough research on this, comparing all thepropositions of Ibn al-Farrāʾwith the relevant passages in theQūt. He points outmore similarities between the nineteen tenets and al-Sālimiyya than Ibn al-Farrāʾ‘leads us to believe’, despite the general view that the list in theMuʿtamadis atypical example ofḤanbalīhostility towards Sālimīteachings.8Here I examine how and when al-Makkīmakes his presence in theMuʿtamad,aswell as the author’s treatment of al-Makkī. Ibn al-Farrāʾincludes the eulogy‘mayGod have mercy upon him (raḥimahu Allāhuʿanhu)’every time he quotesal-Makkī, and mentions theQūtwhen hefirst cites al-Makkīin a chapter on thescales (mīzān).9Here Ibn al-Farrāʾexplains the scales, which God sets up on theLast Day, and cites a passage from theQūtwhere al-Makkīdescribes the accuracyof the scales, which can weigh‘motes and mustard seeds’and easily differentiategood from evil.10Al-Makkīnext appears in a chapter on the path (ṣirāṭ) which leadsto Hell.11Ibn al-Farrāʾquotes al-Makkīin support of his argument, drawing almostverbatim from theQūt.12Ibn al-Farrāʾagain relies on al-Makkī’s views in a chapter concerning revivifica-tion (iḥyāʾ) of the deceased in their graves.13In theQūt, al-Makkīaffirms the realityof this and claims that suffering will visit the disobedient, while felicity will come tothe obedient; in either case, this occurs not only physically but it affects the soul(rūḥ) and the self (nafs).14Fourthly, al-Makkīappears in a chapter on Paradise andHell in theMuʿtamad, where, again, the author supports his argument with6 Ibid., pp. 217–21 [Arabic].

Ibn al-Farrāʾcopies thispassage almost word for word, except that he omits‘our imām’before the name ofal-Tustarī.16Al-Makkīlast appears in theMuʿtamadin a chapter on repentance, where theauthor has a section concerning a basin (ḥawḍ) which the Prophet Muḥammadholds for believers before entering Heaven.17The same story can be seen in theQūt,which states that the liquid in the basin is‘whiter than milk’and‘sweeter thanhoney’, and after drinking it, believers will never be thirsty again.18As can be seen, al-Makkīis found infive different chapters in theMuʿtamad;however, all these citations appear almost consecutively in Section 34 of theQūtregarding Islam and belief. Whether Ibn al-Farrāʾread the other parts of the book,we do not know. Apart from the fourth case, where he cites a saying of Sahlal-Tustarī, al-Makkī’s words are always followed by an expression,‘contrary tothe Muʿtazilites who are in denial of this’. Ibn al-Farrāʾverifies al-Makkī’s state-ments by quoting from either the Qurʾān (for thefirst four cases) or theḤadīth (forthe last case).19This seems to demonstrate that Ibn al-Farrāʾnot only agrees withal-Makkī, but also uses him to refute the Muʿtazilites.At least in theMuʿtamad, thisḤanbalītheologian does not suggest any connec-tion between al-Makkīand al-Sālimiyya. This is evidenced by the fact that theauthor does not mention al-Makkīin the chapter on refutations of this school. Itmight also be worth mentioning that Sahl al-Tustarīappears only once in theMuʿtamad, in the citation from al-Makkīwhich we have just seen, without anyreference to al-Sālimiyya. On the whole, this work indicates no obvious relationbetween this group and al-Tustarīor al-Makkī.Besides the lack of association of al-Makkīwith al-Sālimiyya, Ibn al-Farrāʾdoesnot suggest any connection between al-Makkīand Sufism either. All the citationsfrom theQūtin theMuʿtamadare about after death, the Last Day, the hereafter andHeaven and Hell. This gives the impression that theQūtis a book on devotion inwhich its author preaches on moral conduct in this world in the manner of awarning. The attitude of Ibn al-Farrāʾtowards Sufism is not clear, as he does notseem to have compiled anything regarding it;20however, whatever his attitude maybe, it seems certain that Ibn al-Farrāʾdoes not relate al-Makkīto this phenomenon.15Muʿtamad, p. 186 [Arabic].16Qūt, vol. 3, p. 1277.17Muʿtamad, p. 206 [Arabic].18Qūt, vol. 3, pp. 1276–7.

This paradigmatic book became a favouriteMuslim manual for‘Ḥanbalīs, Sufis and non-Sufis alike’.21The author not only is aḤanbalite writer on mysticism, following his famous predecessor, Anṣārī, but alsogave his name to thefirst known Sufiorder, al-Qādiriyya. TheGhunyatreats allsorts of religious issues, from rules of conduct (ādāb), Muslims’obligations(e.g. fasting, pilgrimage, almsgiving and prayer), and eschatological issues, tointernal matters (e.g. the characteristics of the heart, soul and the self), and theDevil. The link between al-MakkīandʿAbd al-Qādir has been mentioned byal-Raḍwānī, Braune and Knysh, though not in depth.Al-Raḍwānībriefly refers to the influence of theQūton theGhunya.22Braunementions that Ibn Taymiyya criticises certain litanies in theGhunya, which aretaken from theQūt. However, no source is specified, and it is not clear where IbnTaymiyya states this nor which particular prayers he frowns upon in theGhunyaand theQūt.23Knysh adds to this point and states that someḤanbalīscholarsunderline the similarities between the two books.24He claims that a model for theGhunyais theQūt, except for a section on suspicious groups, includingal-Sālimiyya.25Here again, however, no reference is identified, and it is unknownto us whichḤanbalites Knysh meant or how he came to the conclusion that the‘source of inspiration’forʿAbd al-Qādir is theQūt.26(As Knysh discusses there,apart from a section on heretical sects, the topics ofal-Ghunyaare the same sorts ofissues as al-Makkīcovers in theQūt, although the latter also explains more mysticalmatters, e.g. religious stations and states. Al-Ghazālītoo deals with similarreligious subjects in hisIḥyāʾ. The arrangement of these three books is different,and it might be worth exploring them from a comparative point of view.)Although these brief statements exist, a close comparison between the texts ofal-MakkīandʿAbd al-Qādir does not seem to have been carried out.

Thisis exactly what al-Makkīstates in theQūt,28and it seems thatʿAbd al-Qādir issummarising his words, apart from the explanation of the concept of reason, wherethe passages in theQūtare copied almost word for word.29In the following section,ʿAbd al-Qādir explains the concepts of the self and soulin more detail, as these are the‘places tofind the angel and the Devil’, and hedepicts the characteristics of the heart as including‘two types of shining light; theseare knowledge and belief’, which are the‘instruments of the heart and its senses’.30This looks like a summary of al-Makkī’s passage in theQūt, with some near-verbatim lines.31(This section appears just before the explanation of the siximpulses in theQūt, whileʿAbd al-Qādir arranges them the other way round.)ʿAbd al-Qādir does not always specify the precise sources upon which he drew incompiling theGhunya, and these have to be identified on the basis of internalevidence. For example, he does not mention al-Makkī’s name in the sections on theheart, which we have just seen, nor does he refer to his fellowḤanbalīscholar Ibnal-Farrāʾ, even thoughʿAbd al-Qādir seems to have copied the latter’s workregarding al-Sālimiyya. Nothing definite can therefore be claimed.ʿAbd al-Qādir studied Sufism under the ascetic and strict Shaykh Abu’l-KhayrḤammādal-Dabbās (d. 523/1131),32and shows great familiarity with early Sufisand Sufiterminologies in his writing.

One might expect Ibn al-Jawzī, being a well-knownḤanbalīscholar, todeny Sufism totally; however, his opinion on Sufis is not so straightforward. Wehave already seen one writing of Ibn al-Jawzīin the previous chapter,al-Muntaẓam,and three more compilations will be examined here.Thefirst work,Ṣifat al-ṣifwa(‘The Characteristic of a Sincere Friend’), is anabridgement ofḤilyat al-awliyāʾby AbūNuʿaym, whom Ibn al-Jawzī‘admired’.34As briefly mentioned in Chapter 6, this work does not refer to al-Makkī. At thebeginning of theṢifa, Ibn al-Jawzīpraises theḤilyaas a‘remedy for malady (dawāʾli-adwāʾ)’,35although he continues that there are ten things which spoil theḤilyaand he enumerates them.36Ibn al-Jawzīthen esteems the saints (awliyāʾ) and thevirtuous (ṣāliḥūn), as their understanding comes through the‘true nature of knowl-edge (ḥaqīqat al-ʿilm)’.37After his explanations regarding these pious people, Ibnal-Jawzīgoes on to discuss the Prophet Muḥammad and his Companions, andshows his respect for them for their‘knowledge (ʿilm), renunciation (zuhd) andworship (taʿabbud)’.38The aim of theṢifais to illustrate the true nature of Sufism, which is supposed tobe in accordance with the guides demonstrated by the Prophet and hisCompanions.39Although it does not go beyond guesswork here, a possiblereason for al-Makkī’s absence in this work would be,firstly, that he was notoriginally included in theḤilyaand Ibn al-Jawzīdoes not seem to have updatedthe original information.40Secondly, while usingḤadīth transmitted by al-Makkīon certain occasions (see below), Ibn al-Jawzīmay not consider hisQūtto be arepresentative of the‘true nature of Sufism’according to Ibn al-Jawzī’s standardwhich is strongly demonstrated in the following work.InTalbīs Iblīs(‘Deception of the Devil’), which is considered to be a typical‘Ḥanbalīpolemic’,41Ibn al-Jawzīpresents strong arguments against numeroussects andfigures.

He[also] mentioned in it false doctrine, and constantly used a phrase,‘some of thosewho have been unveiled46said’, but this is an empty expression (kalāmfārigh).He quoted in [his book] from some SufisthatGod–may He be praised andglorified–reveals Himself in this world to those who are close to Him (awliyāʾ).Ibn al-Jawzīthen quotes an account from al-Khaṭīb’sTaʾrīkh, including the latter’snegative comments on theQūtand al-Makkī’s apparent problematic utterance.47In a section ofTalbīson ascetics (zuhhād), Ibn al-Jawzīalso mentions al-Makkī:48Absolute abstention (kaff) is an error. Note this, as attention should not be paidto the saying of al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibīand AbūṬālib al-Makkī, concerningwhat they said about reduction of food and thefight against the self byrefraining from what is permissible for it.42 Ibid.43 Amin, p. 23.44Talbīs, pp. 164–5.

(The translation here is done by the present author.)45Ṣalawāt: Margoliouth renders this as‘fastings’(Margoliouth (Jul. 1936), p. 356) but this might bebecause of a different edition which is used by the translator (idem (Jan. 1935), p. 3 [the 1340/1921–2edition is used here; whereas the available edition was published in 1368/1948–9]).46Mukāshafūn/mukāshifūn: Amin also translates the same passage but leaves this term as‘mukāshifūn’(Amin, p. 23), while Margoliouth renders it as‘those favoured with revelations’(Margoliouth (Jul.1936), p. 356). Although Ibn al-Jawzīstates that al-Makkīoften uses this word, I could notfind anexample. (Rather, it seems that al-Makkīmore frequently uses the phrases:‘one of those who havegnosis (ʿārifūn) said’(Qūt, vol. 1, pp. 334, 341, 343, vol. 2, p. 509, etc.) and‘one of those who haveknowledge (ʿulamāʾ) said’(ibid., vol. 1, pp. 335, 340, 363, vol. 2, pp. 505, 509, 521 etc.).)The context of the passage where the term at issue is used is therefore not clear; however, thismight be a passive article, i.e.mukāshafūn, not active as Amin suggests, since this term seems todesignate those whose veil has been lifted by God. (Cf.mukāshif: revealer (Lane, vol. 2, p. 3001).)Although theQūtdoes not have a section on unveiling (mukāshafa), al-Makkīstates that revelationenables believers to see andfind God (Qūt, vol. 1, p. 347), andmukāshafūnappears to be those whohave received it.

For instance, Ibn al-Jawzīquotesal-Junayd who said that Sufism is about‘departing from every vicious quality andentering into every sublime quality’, and Ruwaym51who claimed that all peoplecount on impressions (rusūm), except Sufis who observe realities (ḥaqāʾiq).52Ibnal-Jawzīthen argues that Sufis were originally in this sort of state, but the Devildeceived them and their followers.53These early Sufis are also observed to haveonce been agreed that‘reliance is to be on the Book and Sunna’; however, the Devilmanaged to delude them because of their ignorance.54(Presumably Ibn al-Jawzīmeans ignorance of the Sunna, Islam and Traditions. After criticising major writerson Sufism, he mentions this as the reason for their compilation.)55Ibn al-Jawzīoften uses expressions such as‘the Devil’s deceit to the ascetics’,56saying that the basic technique of the Devil for deluding Sufis is that he‘divertedthem from knowledge’57and that most of the time the Devil misleads worshippersand ascetics by‘secret dissimulation (riyāʾ)’.58As the title of this book,TalbīsIblīs,59clearly indicates, this work is about the deception of the Devil. Ibn al-Jawzīstates at the beginning that he decided to compose this book in the way of‘warningagainst temptation of [the Devil]’in order to remove his deception.60As discussedearlier, Ibn al-Jawzītalks in hisṢifaabout the Prophet and his Companions withadmiration for their high level of‘knowledge (ʿilm), renunciation (zuhd) andworship (taʿabbud)’.61In theTalbīs, three chapters concern the ways in which49 Ibid., p. 164.50 Ibid., pp. 164–6.51 Probably AbūMuḥammad Ruwaym b.

This is because the Devil managed to confuse them,owing to their ignorance and/or wrong information.It should also be mentioned that Ibn al-Jawzīis probably a‘laudator temporisacti’(someone who praises the past), one who shows great respect for ascetics andSufis in earlier times but is hostile towards their successors who, he believes, havedeviated from the original path.63This can be, for instance, seen in his division ofthefirst Sufis from later Sufis, as mentioned above, and the fact that the formergroup seems to meet with his approval. Ibn al-Jawzīalso quotes a saying thatSatan used to‘meet people and teach them’but now he‘meets them and learnsfrom them’.64It may therefore be deduced that Ibn al-Jawzīdoes not reject Sufism itself. It is itsdelusions that he refuses. The same reasoning could well be applicable to the caseof al-Makkī. Ibn al-Jawzīrebuts al-Makkīin theTalbīs, but this does not necessarilymean that the author rejects him completely. It seems more likely that what Ibnal-Jawzīcriticises are certain aspects of al-Makkī’s views and manners which aremanifest in theQūt, but not the whole book or al-Makkīhimself.This hypothesis can be further examined through looking at another book of Ibnal-Jawzī,Talqīḥfuhūm ahl al-athar(‘The Impregnation of the Perception of thePeople of Tradition in the Prominent Books of History and Biographies’), wherehe uses al-Makkī’s ideas. This issue is referred to briefly in an article onṭabaqātinEI2,65and discussed more extensively in Bin Ramli’s thesis.66However, thereseems to be no other discussion about this. In theTalqīḥ, Ibn al-Jawzīlistschronologically and alphabetically the people of Tradition who appear in notablebooks of history and biographies.67The last chapter of this book is entitled the‘classes (ṭabaqāt) of this community’, where the author introduces aḤadīth ofthe Prophet, reported by Anas b.

(This is probably because al-Makkīuses this Tradition inorder to confirm the importance of knowledge, as it is stated after theḤadīth that theProphet‘connected knowledge with belief and gave both precedence over the restof classes’.)69After introducing this Tradition, Ibn al-Jawzīexamines other versions and arguesthat al-Makkīis the only person who divides each generation, based on thisḤadīth ofAnas, intofive groups and classifies notable Muslims into each. Thesefive are:caliphs, jurists,Ḥadīth experts, Qurʾān reciters and ascetics. It is stated that al-Makkīcategorises thesefiveṭabaqāt, each of which is forty years, up to his time. Ibn al-Jawzīthen follows his example and enumerates fourteen generations withfive classes, whichends with the year 560/1164–7, Ibn al-Jawzīhaving died in 597/1200.70When considering only theTalqīḥ, one would not guess that in other writings theauthor criticises al-Makkī’s use of weak Traditions, since, in theTalqīḥ, Ibn al-Jawzīshows his trust in theḤadīth which al-Makkīpassed down, as he clearly states that allthe transmitters of this Tradition about theṭabaqātare approved,71and even adopts hisgrouping as a model. Ibn al-Jawzīdoes not specify the title of al-Makkī’s book fromwhich the former cites the Tradition of Anas. There is a possibility that Ibn al-Jawzīconsulted al-Makkī’sallegedḤadīth collection, since the same Tradition in theQūtdoes not have the whole passage. In addition to this, theQūtdoes not containal-Makkī’sclassification of forty years withfiveṭabaqāt.72It should also be men-tioned that, in theTalqīḥ, Ibn al-Jawzīlists a chain of transmitters of this Tradition,whereas a longisnādcannot be found in theQūt, and, in this particular case, al-Makkījust mentions a‘Ḥadīth of Anas from the Prophet’.73From these three reasons, it may be concluded that it is not theQūt(or theʿIlm)where Ibn al-Jawzīfound this Tradition and al-Makkī’s categorisation. This mightraise the probability of the existence of al-Makkī’s alleged collection of fortyḤadīth. Ibn al-Jawzīevidently sees significance in the enumeration ofḤadīth69Qūt, vol. 1, p. 384; this Tradition appears in Section 31 regarding knowledge.70Talqīḥ, pp. 714–17.71 Ibid., p. 714.72 And neither does theʿIlm. (ThisḤadīth itself does not seem to appear.)73Qūt, vol. 1, p. 384.The influence of al-Makkī, part 2135"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"transmitters. For this Tradition of Anas, for example, Ibn al-Jawzīlists eleventransmitters,74and, as Margoliouth points out, many lines of theTalbīsare‘occu-pied with’isnād, which are omitted in the process of translation apart from thefirstand the last.75The short or non-existentisnādin theQūtmight be one reason whyhe states that the Traditions in this book are‘invalid’76and‘have no origin’.77Having examined four books of Ibn al-Jawzī, now is the time to tie up loose endsand evaluate his attitudes towards al-Makkīand Sufism. An assessment of hisoverall opinion of Sufism, however, would take his other writings into account,when he is said to have written more than 200 books.78Rather than making suchconjectures, my focus will be his view of al-Makkīand his standpoint regardingSufism in his writings we have seen so far.His attitudes towards al-Makkīshow the variety of his feelings. The account ofal-Makkīin theMuntaẓamindicates the author’s rather negative opinion ofal-Makkī. As discussed above, Ibn al-Jawzīcriticises theQūtfor using rootlessḤadīth and quotes al-Khaṭīb’s statements about al-Makkī’s apparent problematicsaying (but not al-Khaṭīb’s disapproving remark about theQūt).79Although theterm‘Sufism’or‘Sufi’is not used, the fact that al-Makkīis introduced as an ascetic,as Ibn al-Jawzīexplains in theTalbīsthat a Sufiis essentially an extended version ofan ascetic,80together with the reference to his affiliation with al-Sālimiyya, give aclear impression of al-Makkībeing a Sufi. Al-Makkī’s response in the form ofa poem regarding thesamāʿpractice and his deathbed story seem to follow aconventional image of Sufis as well.This attitude seems to be confirmed in theTalbīs, where Ibn al-Jawzīmakesal-Makkīappear in the sections on asceticism and Sufism in order to criticise hisviews. Although the same author made an abridgement of a famous Sufitreatise,theḤilya, and shows his respect for its author in theṢifa, the image of Ibn al-Jawzīwould seem to be one of hostility to anything which he believes is outsidemainstream Islam.This impression is not inaccurate, since he does rebut, for instance, certain Sufiwriters including al-Makkīin a strong disapproving tone. As seen above, it appearsthat Ibn al-Jawzīrejects al-Makkīand Sufism in general. Laoust, for example, statesthat al-Makkī, al-Qushayrīand al-Ghazālīare‘vigorously attacked’in theTalbīs.81However, in theTalqīḥIbn al-Jawzī’s attitude is entirely different from that in theMuntaẓamand theTalbīs. Thus, there seems to be good reason to re-evaluate theinitial impression and expectation of Ibn al-Jawzībeing hostile to Sufism.74Talqīḥ, p. 714.75 Margoliouth (Jan. 1935), p. 3.76Talbīs, p. 164.77Muntaẓam, vol. 7, p. 189.78 Cf.GAL, vol. 1, pp. 659–66; ibid., SI, pp. 914–20.79Muntaẓam, vol. 7, pp. 189–90.80Talbīs, p. 161.

Laoust).136The influence of al-Makkī, part 2"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"From what we have seen in these chapters, it appears that the thrust of Ibnal-Jawzī’s criticism of al-Makkīis specific. First of all, the bulk of his disapproval isdirected towards theQūt(particularly certain phrases), al-Makkī’s behaviourtowards Tradition, and some of his teachings. As can be seen here, Ibn al-Jawzīspecifies the problems hefinds in al-Makkī’s writing, and it may be assumed thatthe rest of al-Makkī’s views do not trouble him. He would not have used al-Makkī’sḤadīth and method if he had had difficulties with al-Makkīhimself.The same could apply to the case of Sufism. As discussed above, Ibn al-Jawzī’scriticism of Sufism does not amount to total denial. His problem lies in Sufism’sdivergence from its original‘version’. It should also be mentioned that in the list ofṭabaqātin theTalqīḥ, al-Bisṭāmīappears as the representative of an ascetic in thesixth generation and Ibn Sālim in the eighth,82even though the two would seem tobe exactly the sort offigure that Ibn al-Jawzīwouldfind unacceptable, al-Bisṭāmībeing famous for his ecstatic utterances when he reached the mystical state, and IbnSālim being often the target of criticism from theḤanbalites.According to Braune, Ibn al-Jawzīused to hold meetings which are‘paradig-matic’for Sufipractices, despite his vigorous attacks on the‘orgiastic’elements ofSufigatherings.83Braune uses this as an example of aḤanbalite attitude which isnot alwaysfirm refusal of mystical phenomena. Khalidi also argues that despite Ibnal-Jawzī’s general reputation for being‘hard-headed about reporting oddities,omens,karamatand other marvels associated with“low”Sufism’, his work isindeed‘full of them’, and discusses Ibn al-Jawzī’s mixed feeling towards certainelements of Sufism.84It is impossible here to determine for certain Ibn al-Jawzī’s general attitudetowards Sufism, not only because of the need for a laborious process of study ofhis voluminous writings, but also because Ibn al-Jawzīmight after all not have beenconsistent in his views on Sufism. It appears, however, that his criticism is strictlydirected against any doctrine, whether mysticism or any other approach, which has,in his opinion, deviated from the accepted and lawful norms. Shukri briefly men-tions that Ibn al-Jawzīcriticises al-Makkīfor his use of weak traditions.85Aminexpands this, offers a translation of an account of al-Makkīin theMuntaẓamand apassage from theTalbīs, and gives a comment that the particular point of Ibn al-Jawzī’s criticism of al-Makkīis his lack of reliability as aḤadīth transmitter.86However, Ibn al-Jawzī’s feelings towards al-Makkīdo not seem amenable to such asimple summary as this. What has been established as certain so far is that hisestimation of al-Makkīand Sufism is more complicated than it looks atfirst sight.82Talqīḥ, p. 716. It is not clear how much Ibn al-Jawzīmade a change to al-Makkī’s original list up tillthe latter’s era. If he did, he chose these twofigures by himself, and if not, he did not mind leavingthem in the list.83EI2, s.v.‘ʿAbd al-Ḳādir al-Djīlānī’(W.

In hisMajmūʿfatāwā(‘Collection of LegalOpinions’), Ibn Taymiyya responds to a question regarding theQūtand theIḥyāʾ, and claims that the latter is‘subordinate’to the former, as al-Makkīis‘more knowledgeable’than al-Ghazālīin general, including aboutḤadīth andSufisayings, and his words are‘undoubtedly more apposite, better and less here-tical (bidʿa)’than those of al-Ghazālī.87Although Ibn Taymiyya acknowledges thatthere are many useful matters included in theIḥyāʾ, in his opinion the book alsotalks about what he sees as objectionable issues.88Thisfatwāalso demonstrates that Ibn Taymiyya is well acquainted not only withthese two books but also with Islamic religious discourses in general. In hisexplanation of theIḥyāʾ, for example, Ibn Taymiyya relates the work not only toal-Makkī, but also to al-Muḥāsibī, Kalām and philosophy.89Laoust analyses IbnTaymiyya’s familiarity with both Islamic sciences and heretical doctrines, andargues that although he often mentions al-Ghazālīin his main writings, IbnTaymiyya observes that al-Ghazālī’s ideas are borrowed from al-Muḥāsibīand,particularly, from al-Makkī, whoseQūthas‘passé dans l’Iḥyāʾ’.90It seems clear that this famousḤanbalīscholar has a rather high opinion of theQūtand prefers it to al-Ghazālī’sIḥyāʾ. Ibn Taymiyya explains that theQūtelucidates internal matters, such as‘patience (ṣabr), gratitude (shukr), love(ḥubb), trust in God (tawakkul) andtawḥīd’, and states that although the work isless problematic than theIḥyāʾ, it still contains weak Traditions and many dubiousissues.91This last criticism can also be seen in anotherfatwā, where Ibn Taymiyyadiscusses‘the people of gnosis’, whose writings always include‘questionableand false’Ḥadīth, and he enumerates the major writings in this category, such asthe works of‘AbūṬālib [al-Makkī], AbūḤāmid [al-Ghazālī], and ShaykhʿAbdal-Qādir [al-Jīlānī]’.92These two passages above indicate that although IbnTaymiyya has a problem with the use of invalid (according to him) Traditions, hedoes not seem to have any difficulty with mysticism itself.Makdisi in his article concludes that Ibn Taymiyya was a Sufiof the Qādiriyyaorder (although he does not seem to approve ofʿAbd al-Qādir’s use of weakḤadīth), and claims that Ibn Taymiyya has the‘formal credentials’of Sufismwhich has not yet been found for al-Ghazālī.93Laoust argues that Ibn Taymiyya87Fatāwā, vol. 10, p. 551.88 Ibid.89 Ibid., vol. 10, pp. 551–2.90Taimīya, pp. 80–100; the quote is from p. 82.91Fatāwā, vol. 10, p. 551.92 Ibid., vol. 11, p. 579.93 Makdisi,‘Ibn Taimīya: aṢūfīof the Qādirīya order’,American Journal of Arabic Studies1, part 1(1973), pp. 118–28; the quote is from p. 119.

According to Laoust, although the core doctrine of Ibn Taymiyyais based onḤanbalism, he was looking for a‘doctrine of synthesis or of conciliation’,which integrates the three elements of three branches of knowledge: the reason ofKalām thinkers, theḤadīth of Traditionists and the‘free-will (irāda)’of Sufis.100As in the case of Ibn al-Jawzī, Ibn Taymiyya’s criticism of al-Makkīregards hisattitudes towardsḤadīth (and he is not the only writer who receives the sameaccusation as seen above). Shukri and Amin briefly touch upon this point,101whileal-Raḍwānīquotes only thefirst part of an above-mentionedfatwā, which showsIbn Taymiyya’s preference for al-Makkīover al-Ghazālī, and omits the rest whereIbn Taymiyya expresses his disapproval of certain aspects of theQūt.102As can alsobe seen in his other writings, on the whole Ibn Taymiyya speaks highly of al-Makkīand prefers him to al-Ghazālī,103and the link between the twofigures seems todeserve further investigation.This section has examined four notableḤanbalīscholars and their treatment of al-Makkī. The heavy influence of theQūtcan be seen in the writings of thefirst twoauthors, Ibn al-FarrāʾandʿAbd al-Qādir, while Ibn al-Jawzīand Ibn Taymiyya94 See also Homerin,‘Ibn Taimīya’sal-Ṣūfīyah wa-al-fuqarāʾ’,Arabica32, fasc. 2 (Jul. 1985), esp.p. 219.95 Laoust also explains that Ibn Taymiyya regards a Sufias one who‘tout en préconisant une pratiquefervente de la Loi, respecte la théodicée et les pratiques culturelles de la tradition orthodoxe’(Taimīya, p. 89).96 Laoust,‘Le Hanbalisme sous les Mamlouks Bahrides’,Revue des études Islamiques28 (1960),p. 35; cf.

The analysis of these fourḤanbalīthinkersfirst of all sheds light on the extensive attention given to Islamicdevotion in al-Makkī’s writing. Although his teaching may be accepted onlypartially, it is clear that al-Makkīis regarded as an influential author of religiousdoctrines in Islam.It has also become clear that those famousḤanbalīscholars have been inspiredby mystical thought one way or another, while their core doctrine is centred onḤanbalism. It may look quite contrary to the current general image ofḤanbalīs,especially that of Ibn Taymiyya who influenced the anti-SufiWahhābīmovement.It should be worth mentioning again here a summary of theQūtwritten by the Salafīreformer of Damascus in the late Ottoman period, Jamāl al-Dīn al-Qāsimī(d. 1914).104LikeḤanbalism, the Salafītrends are also associated with the anti-Sufisentiment; however, according to Weismann, Salafīʿulamāʾwere originallyinspired by certain Sufirevival movements.105Although I do not intend to exag-gerate the closeness between Sufis andḤanbalīs, the relation between Sufism andḤanbalism (and Salafiyya) evinces more intricate patterns than it seems atfirstsight, and this would be an intriguing subject to explore further.Pre-modern Muslim scholarship: al-Makkī, preacher ofIslamic pietyAfter studying over forty works in various religiousfields, including Sufism,ṭabaqāt,Ḥadīth,Ḥanbalism, it is now time to draw the threads of these two chapterstogether and to evaluate what kind of status al-Makkīhad in pre-modern times.After al-Makkīdied in 386/996, Ibn al-Farrāʾand al-Khaṭīb, who died seventy andseventy-five years after him, seem to be thefirst authors to mention al-Makkīandwhose works have survived until today. In Ibn al-Farrāʾ’sMuʿtamad, al-Makkīisnot connected with either Sufism or al-Sālimiyya, while al-Khaṭīb associates himwith both in theTaʾrīkh. TheMuʿtamadconcerns Kalām-Ḥanbalism, whileal-Khaṭīb’sTaʾrīkhhas been cited in numerous biographical dictionaries since itscompletion. Al-Khaṭīb’s negative opinion of theQūt, and his statement that thiswork is a Sufiwriting and that al-Makkīwas a member of al-Sālimiyya must havehad a stronger influence on later authors than that of Ibn al-Farrāʾ.Despite a certain amount of criticism by non-Sufiwriters, al-Makkīstarts makinga constant appearance among the major works on Sufism after al-Ghazālī’s refer-ence to him. It is still a mystery why early Sufiauthors in the pre-al-Ghazālīperiodwere totally silent about al-Makkī. I would like to explore three possible reasons forhis absence, namely,first, that al-Makkīwas not regarded as a Sufi; second, that histhought and his affiliation with al-Sālimiyya were disapproved of; and, third, thefragile position of Sufism in thefifth/eleventh century.104 Al-Qāsimī,al-Waʿẓal-maṭlūb min Qūt al-qulūb, Beirut: Dār al-Bashāʾir al-Islāmiyya, 2000.105 Weismann,‘The politics of popular religion’, p. 39.140The influence of al-Makkī, part 2"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"As for thefirst point, al-Makkīis often introduced as the author of theQūt.Itwould not therefore be a surprise that the work was not originally received as a Sufimanual, especially by Sufis. There might also be a gap between the criteria forbeing a Sufiasserted by Sufis themselves and those of non-Sufis. Al-Makkī’sascetic practices and mythical deathbed story are reported in non-Sufiwritings,such as by Ibn Khallikān, Ibn al-Jawzīand al-Dhahabī. This kind of narrative couldbe enough for non-Sufis to deem al-MakkīaSufi, but there is a possibility that forearly Sufis this might indicate al-Makkī’s piety and diligence, but no more.Concerning the second and third points, although Ibn al-Farrāʾprojects a theo-logically different image of al-Makkīthan that of al-Khaṭīb, if the latter’s view is theone which was commonly accepted, the main writers on Sufism in its formativeperiod might have avoided mentioning al-Makkī. Their aim is to prove the sound-ness of Sufism, and the link between al-Makkīand al-Sālimiyya might have beenconsidered problematic, especially given that this school seems to have beenregarded as heretical even among those in favour of Sufism, as discussed abovein connection with Hujwīrī’sKashf. Since little is known about this school, it isdifficult to evaluate whether this speculation can be proved correct. However,al-Makkī’s association with this group and the position of Sufism in Islam in thefourth/tenth andfifth/eleventh centuries could be the major external reasons for theabsence of al-Makkīin the early Sufiwritings.In addition to these social and environmental conditions, possible internalreasons should also be considered, namely the characteristics of al-Makkī’s writ-ings. In the historical sources examined in these chapters, three works of al-Makkīare identified: theQūt,aḤadīth collection and (allegedly) atafsīrof the Qurʾān.106As discussed earlier, theQūtcould be classified as a Sufiwork, since it coversspiritual aspects of religion and elucidates certain terms which are often used bySufis. However, theQūthas to be differentiated from the other classical manuals ofSufism, such as al-Sarrāj’sLumaʿ, al-Kalābādhī’sTaʿarruf, al-Qushayrī’sRisālaand Hujwīrī’sKashf, since these are clearly compiled to clarify the nature ofSufism, with explanation of mystical terminologies,figures and writings.The emphasis of theQūtis on the importance of right bodily action based onright action in the heart. This spirit is inherited by al-Ghazālīin hisIḥyāʾ, and IbnTaymiyya and al-Rundīcompare these two works for good reason. The corequestion of both books is how to become a better believer. If a Sufirepresents areligiously right Muslim, theQūtand theIḥyāʾwould evidently be writings onSufism. However, it might be less misleading if we just say that these books areabout Islamic piety in general. At the time of al-Makkīand throughout thefifth/eleventh century, mystical phenomena in Islam must have had a different imagefrom the one which they may have today. In this period of the theorisation ofSufism, there is a possibility that theQūtwas regarded as falling somewhere106 None of his other possible writings (see Ch. 1) appears in these materials, including theʿIlm.Asargued above, Ibn al-ʿArabīstates that al-Makkīcompiled other books than theQūt, and al-Khaṭībmentions his works ontawḥīd; however, their titles or genres remain unknown to us.The influence of al-Makkī, part 2141"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"between a work on Sufism and on religious ethics. In addition to the previous pointsregarding al-Sālimiyya and timing, the characteristics of theQūtitself could be partof the reason why al-Makkīdoes not appear amongst the Suficlassics.From the twelfth century onwards, the tide changes and al-Makkīstarts to becited and esteemed in various writings on Sufism. It should be underlined thatthese works do not always mention al-Makkī’s connection with al-Sālimiyya,107while other non-Sufisources in the same period often refer to this subject. TheSālimīgroup appears to have died down after the time of al-Makkī.108If thereputation of this school was unchanged, since the school did not have achance to improve its reputation, the difference between this and the previousperiod would be the position of Sufism in Islam, which might have had a positiveeffect on al-Makkī’s appearance in later Sufiliterature.Considering al-Ghazālī’s fame and importance in the history of Islam, we couldgive all the credit to him for al-Makkī’s appearance after him. It might be possible toargue that his open respect for al-Makkīand his contribution to the improvementof the status of mysticism in Islam gave encouragement and liberty to later authors touse and mention al-Makkīfreely. However, as Knysh argues, it is more plausible tojudge that al-Ghazālīis a‘vivid example’of the intellectual trend in the sixth/twelfthcentury,109when the Sufimovement seems to have been rooted in Islam religiouslyand socially, and many Sufiorders started to be formed.110The cultivation of mystical activity can also be found in a tighter master–disciplerelationship than before, as al-Rundīpoints out.111These environmental changes inSufism might have taken place gradually; however, overall it can be assumed thatspiritual life in later times must have become different from that of early Sufisthrough the systematisation period. In addition to al-Ghazālī, this altered position ofSufism in Islam might have contributed to al-Makkī’s appearance and the openrespect which he has received in many mystical writings from the sixth/twelfthcentury onwards.Regarding al-Makkī’sinfluence, his direct obvious inspiration can be found in thewritings of Ibn al-Farrāʾ, al-Ghazālī, Ibn al-Jawzī, al-Suhrawardī, Ibn al-ʿArabī,al-Rundīand Muḥammad Murtaḍā. A possible link between al-MakkīandʿAbdal-Qādir al-Jīlānī, and his influence on IbnʿAṭāʾAllāh and Ibn Taymiyya, should befurther explored. In the connection with IbnʿAṭāʾAllāh and al-Rundī, the compar-ison between the Shādhiliyya teachings and those of al-Makkīshould give anotherperspective on the study of al-Makkī. As discussed above, he seems to have made astrong impression on variousḤanbalīscholars, and the relationship between107 An exception is Jāmī, who mentions al-Makkī’s relation with Ibn Sālim and Sahl Tustarī, via IbnSālim’s father (Nafaḥāt, p. 121).108Vision, p. 96;EI1, s.v.‘Sālimiyya’(L.

For instance, al-Khaṭīb expresses his negative opinion about theQūt(but not regarding the use of Tradition); however, it cannot be entirely certainwhether he has read the work himself. Among the writers who have been studiedhere, it appears to be only Ibn al-Jawzīand Ibn Taymiyya who offer original criticalviews on the basis of their own examination of the work, and a careful study of theirwritings reveals that their attitudes towards al-Makkīare not as straightforward asthey look or as one might expect. Al-Dhahabī, too, might have had direct contactwith theQūt, as well as al-Makkī’sḤadīth collection; however, the former’sopinion on the latter is not clear from the works which we have looked at in theprevious chapter.In terms of al-Makkī’s biographical data, al-Khaṭīb’sTaʾrīkhis one of thecore sources for laterṭabaqāt, followed by Ibn al-Jawzī’sMuntaẓamand IbnKhallikān’sWafayāt, which make good use of theTaʾrīkh.Al-Dhahabīthen collatesinformation from these former works and his compilations also serve as a model forlater authors. These writings set a precedent and afterwards many biographicalcompilations became, more or less, supplements or reworkings of the previousversions.At the time of al-Dhahabī, three-and-a-half centuries had already passed sinceal-Makkī’s death, and after the mid-eighth/fourteenth century there is less newinformation about al-Makkī’s life and work.113From this time onwards, the focusof examination of the historical sources would be not only seeking for new data, buthow their authors respond to early writings and how they use al-Makkī’s work–forinstance, al-Suyūṭī’s response to al-Dhahabī, al-Rundī’sRasāʾiland MuḥammadMurtaḍā’sItḥāf.On the whole, then, what kind of status did al-Makkīand his works have in pre-modern times?

As Gramlich says, this work is a‘summary ofIslamic piety’,115inspired by Traditions, early pious ancestors, ascetics and Sufis,as can be seen in frequently cited religious authorities in theQūt. This inclusivenature might come from its author, who can be described simply as a devoutbeliever, since any kind of classification (Sufior Traditionist) is exclusive anddoes not seem to capture his nature. As Melchert discusses, the disciplinary divisionmay have been clear by the time of Ibn al-Jawzī;116however, it seems less so at thetime of al-Makkīwho lived before or in a transition period of classification andformalisation of jurisprudence and religious sciences. This probably explains whyal-Makkī’s writing(s) could be the source of inspiration, including criticism, invariousfields not only of mysticism, but also ofḤadīth,ṭabaqāt117and others. Thetopic of theQūt, the heart, can also draw wider attention, since this seems to be analmost universal subject in many religious traditions, as we have seen.

The focus of the last two chapters shifts fromMuslim to Jewish writings, and al-Makkī’s possible influence on a certain Judaeo-Arabic1literary work which was produced when Arabic was the lingua francathroughout the vast area of the Islamic world. Sharing the vernacular inevitablyfacilitated continuous cultural discourse beyond faith borders. In what Goiteinfamously called the‘Jewish-Arab symbiosis’,2there was a dynamic interactionbetween Jewish and Islamic and/or Arabic writings, particularly in al-Andalus.It would be too idealistic and simplistic to regard al-Andalus as the template ofconvivencia; however, there is no doubt that this period produced a great numberof monumental works, which had a far-reaching influence among Jews in thefields of philosophy, science, literature and religion.The last part of this book examines this intellectual relationship through acomparison between the work of al-Makkīand Ibn Bāqūdā(d. after 1080), theAndalusian Jewish judge who wroteKitāb al-hidāya ilāfarāʾiḍal-qulūb(‘Bookof the Right Guidance to the Religious Duties of Hearts’)3in Judaeo-Arabic,approximately a century after al-Makkī’s death.

The conclusion, however, willbriefly discuss the interaction between Muslim and Jewish religious traditions ingeneral and how we approach mystical teachings in these two monotheistic creeds.Ibn Bāqūdā: the Jewish echo?Baḥyāb. Yūsuf Ibn Bāqūdā(also known as Bachya AbūIsḥāq ben Joseph IbnPaqūda) was an Andalusian scholar.14His life is shrouded in mystery. The name‘Paqūda’, quite rare in the medieval Jewish literature, may be of Aramaic origin.15It is not certain when and where he was born and died, nor is the exact place wherehe spent his life known. The latest Jewishfigure among those whom he mentions inal-Hidāyais Ibn Janāḥ, who died around 1050, andal-Hidāyawas translated intoHebrew by Judah b. Tibbon (d. ca. 1190) in 1161, or between 1161 and 1180, at therequest of Rabbi Meshullam ben Jaqob in Lunel (d. 1170).16Yahuda, writing in 1904, states that Ibn Bāqūdāwrote at the very end of theeleventh century or the beginning of the twelfth century, based on his belief inal-Ghazālī’s (d. 1111) influence onal-Hidāya.17However, in 1912, we can seeYahuda’s change of mind, confessing that he does notfind his original argumentconvincing any more and mentions the possibility of the two thinkers studying thesame, previous work.18Kaufmann claims in 1910 that Ibn Bāqūdāwas active in the mid-eleventh century,while in 1927 Kokovtzov places his life towards the end of the eleventh century.Kaufmann argues for Ibn Bāqūdā’sinfluence on a famous Andalusian poet,Solomon ben Judah Ibn Gabirol, who was born ca. 1021 and died ca. 1057. Fromthis, as well as Ibn Bāqūdā’s acquaintance with Ibn Janāḥ, Kaufmann concludes thatIbn Bāqūdācomposed his book in approximately 1040.19Kokovtsov, onfindingnew material, reviews this issue. He reads a passage written by Moses ben Jacob Ibn14 In Jewish studies, his name usually appears as Baḥya (or Bachya); however, I will follow the Arabicrendition here.15 Cf.

More recent studies by Mansoor in 1973 and Lobel in 2007 showthat it is likely that Ibn Bāqūdādid his writing in the latter half of the eleventhcentury, with the very beginning of the twelfth century as theterminus ad quem.Following the argument by Kokovtsov, both authors agree thatal-Hidāyawaswritten probably around 1080,21and Lomba in 2010 also considers the work tohave been written between 1080 and 1090.22The place where he mainly spent his life is, likewise, uncertain. Some scholarsplace him in Cordoba, others in Saragossa.23There seems an inclination towardsthe latter among recent research; for instance, according to Lobel, a manuscript ofal-Hidāyafrom 1340 states that Ibn Bāqūdālived in Saragossa.24In the eleventhcentury, Spain witnessed the collapse of the Marwānid Caliphate. The Kingdom ofal-Andalus was facing its downfall and the political and social situation in Cordobamust have been different from that in Saragossa. It remains obscure, however, howthe work of Ibn Bāqūdāand the place he spent his life would have been involved inhis writing.Concerning his profession, the earliest translation ofal-Hidāyadescribes IbnBāqūdāas adayyān, a judge at a rabbinical court, as his name appears as al-Wāʿiẓal-DayyānBaḥyāb. Yūsuf b. Bāqūdāal-Andalusīin Yahuda’s edition. However,nothing in his writings specifically suggests his occupation. No anecdote about hiscareer seems to have survived. It is clear that he is well acquainted with Talmudicstudies as a member of a rabbinical court. However, it is hard to know whether IbnBāqūdādid his writing in his spare time or whether we should see this as somethingarising from his judicial work.Ibn Bāqūdā’s fame lies in his bookal-Hidāya, but he also composed a number ofhymns in Hebrew for liturgy. According to Tanenbaum, Ibn Gabirol and IbnBāqūdāare‘transitionalfigures’in the history of devotional poetry.25Peles col-lected twenty-eight liturgical poems composed by Ibn Bāqūdā, including threewhich appear inal-Hidāya.26Some of his hymns have been used as part of theprayer service among the Jews of Spain and Italy, and others can be found inthe Cairo Genizah.27On the whole, due to the paucity of sources, we have littlechance offinding out about his personal life.20 Kokovtsov,‘Life of Bahya’, pp. 13, 20.21Direction, pp. 1, 33–6;Dialogue, pp. 1–2.22 Lomba, p. 529.23 Cf.Direction,p.1.24Dialogue, p. 1; cf.

Its influence can beseen, for example, on the writings of the poet and philosopher Moses Ibn Ezra(d. after 1135), the great thinker Abraham Ibn Ezra (d. 1164), the Talmudist IsraelIsraeli (d. 1317) and one of the most distinguished Jewish philosophers, MosesMaimonides.28The only son of Moses Maimonides, Abraham Maimonides(d. 1237), is also known to have been a prominent spiritual successor of IbnBāqūdā. The difference between the two lies in their attitudes towards the use ofIslamic sources. Fenton, for instance, states that while Ibn Bāqūdāhad‘misgivings’about this, Abraham Maimonides not only demonstrates his respect for Sufis, butbelieves they are the‘heirs’of Jewish traditions.29Al-Hidāyawas originally written in Judaeo-Arabic and was translated into Hebrewby Judah b. Tibbon in the latter half of the twelfth century, as mentioned. AnotherHebrew rendition by Joseph Qimḥi (d. 1170) is known; however, only a chapter onrepentance is extent. The book became popular through Ibn Tibbon’s version andamong Jews is generally known by its Hebrew title,Ḥovot ha-levavot(‘Duties of theHeart’). TheḤovotwas later used among Kabbalists, and became a basic manual ofeighteenth-century Hasidism in Central Europe.30Including Hebrew, Ladino,Spanish, Portuguese, Yiddish, German, Italian, French and English,al-Hidāyahasbeen translated into many languages. Most of these translations are based on Judah’sHebrew version, which has more than 200 editions.31In 1912, Yahuda edited the Judaeo-Arabic manuscripts ofal-Hidāyaand pub-lished it in the Arabic script, except for Biblical quotations, pious sayings andJewish names, which were left in Hebrew. Not only painstakingly transliteratingHebrew letters into Arabic, Yahuda added a significant introduction in Germanwhich examined the Arabic and Islamic sources ofal-Hidāya. Born into an IraqiJewish family in Jerusalem, Yahuda’s doctoral thesis also emphasises the Araborigin of this important work among Jews.32As this edition appearedfifteen years28 Cf. Lomba, p. 531.

He isdescribed as‘a direct offspring of Muslim pietism’,37a description which appliesnot only to his ideas but also, it is proposed, to the style and terminologies used inhis book.38It is therefore crucial to examineal-Hidāyain Arabic rather than inHebrew translation, especially for an analysis of Islamic influence on Ibn Bāqūdā.This importance also comes from the way in which Judah b. Tibbontranslatedal-Hidāya. Judah, the father of translators, often suffers from the lackof appropriate words in Hebrew. The contribution of this prominent Ibn Tibbonfamily to the development of philosophical vocabularies in Hebrew precisely lies intheir coinage of technical terminologies for philosophy and science through trans-lation.39At the beginning of theḤovot, Judah states his attitudes towardstranslation:4033 For detailed analysis of the motivation behind Yahuda’s publication, see my forthcoming chapter:‘Yahuda andal-Hidāya ilāfarā’iḍal-qulūb: deep connections between Jewish and Muslim spiri-tuality in the 11thand 20thcenturies’, in Adang and Meri (eds)Muslim–Jewish Relations in Past andPresent, Brill.34 Bettan, review ofal-Hidāja,inCentral Conference of American Rabbis, Yearbook 1914, pp. 303,305.

In order to study the teachings of Ibn Bāqūdā, it is not necessaryfor me to emphasise the importance of consulting the original text. This point,however, does not seem to have always been taken into consideration by scholars inthisfield. For example, one of the reviewers of Mansoor’s English translation,which was carried out for thefirst time from Yahuda’s Arabic edition, pointsout that there are already English versions of it based on the Hebrew versions,42as well as a French and a Hebrew translation from the original Arabic text, andsuggests that Mansoor should have focused on translating other important Jewishworks.43Despite this criticism (and the paucity of annotation and the inconsistency ofrenderings),44Mansoor’s translation should be considered significant in terms ofthe recognition of the importance of the original text. In addition to this translation,Vajda conducts painstaking research on the link between Sufiwritings andal-Hidāya, based on the Arabic original.

He sees two kinds of knowledge in religion: external knowl-edge concerning the obligatory matters of limbs (jawāriḥ), and internal knowledgeconcerning the obligatory matters of hearts (qulūb).45The latter is more importantthan the former, since it is the heart which decides both inward and outward actions,and concerns this world and the hereafter, and the supreme knowledge. Ibn Bāqūdāinsists that this issue is addressed clearly in the Scriptures and sayings of sages.This notwithstanding, he could notfind a single book which draws proper attentionto the heart.46Ibn Bāqūdādivides post-Talmudic Jewish writings into three categories on thematter of religious obligations. He then criticises these early thinkers for their failureto deal exclusively with inner knowledge and the heart’s religious obligations.47Humans are easily caught up by evil thought and he insists that constant remindersare necessary.48While others may consider these obligations too self-evident to bewritten down, Ibn Bāqūdāis aware of the fact that we are all slaves to habit andfamiliarity. For these reasons, he in the end decides to compose a book himself inorder to guide those who attempt to bring‘the treasures of hearts (kunūzal-qulūb)’tolight and to come close to God;49and hence the title,The Right Guidance to theReligious Duties of Hearts. The great popularity the book gained soon after itscompletion demonstrates well that there was a gap to befilled, as Ibn Bāqūdāfelt.The target audience ofal-Hidāyaare those who are neglectful in their observanceof the law (sharīʿa) and belief50–not necessarily only philosophers or theologians,but the intellectuals. Apart from thefirst chapter, where he occasionally uses logicand mathematical arguments to elucidatetawḥīdand God’s creation, Ibn Bāqūdātries not to be too philosophical, and aims to make his book as clear and accessibleas possible. Throughoutal-Hidāya, Ibn Bāqūdāquotes from the books of theProphets and sayings of sages, which, together with a sound mind, are the gatesto God, and he draws simple analogies which should be easily understandable.51Heconfesses that his knowledge of Arabic is not sufficient to express everything hemeans.

(The issue of the useof Judaeo-Arabic in a comparative analysis between theQūtandal-Hidāyaisdiscussed later.)Inal-Hidāya, Ibn Bāqūdāoften quotes the Bible, the Talmud and the Midrashim,but rarely refers to post-Talmudic Jewish writers, except Saʿadya Gaon (d. 942).53In the introduction, Ibn Bāqūdārecommends his reader to study Saʿadya’s books,since they can‘give light to intellects (ʿuqūl)’and‘make minds (adhhān) skilful’.54Like Saʿadya, Ibn Bāqūdā’s aim seems to be to seek rational foundations for beliefin order to strengthen it. This was undertaken by many Jewish philosophers in themedieval era under the influence of Greek and Muslim thinkers and the Islamicinterpretation of Greek philosophy.55Al-Hidāyaalso contains mystical elements.Agus, for instance, divides medieval Jewish philosophy into three categories:rationalistic, romantic and mystical; and describes Ibn Bāqūdāas both mystic andrationalist.56The chapters ofal-HidāyaAl-Hidāyaconcerns ethics. The book consists of ten chapters or gates (abwāb),and each chapter represents a‘fundamental principle (aṣl)’of the religious obliga-tions of the heart. Ibn Bāqūdāelucidates ten primary duties in total with differentaspects and obstacles to accomplishing them.57The internal structure ofal-Hidāyais quite clear. Each chapter starts with a brief introduction to the subject matter,followed by six to ten sections, with each section explaining an aspect of theprinciple. Ibn Bāqūdāquotes many Biblical texts and sayings of sages, and drawsanalogies from them. His intention is always clearly stated and his argument iscoherent.Al-Hidāyais a well-arranged book, despite his rhetorical apologies thathe was in a hurry tofinish it before he died, and that we might thereforefind itinadequate.58Thefirst chapter (Hidāja, pp. 35–92 [Arabic] [henceforth pp. 35–92]) concernstawḥīdand sincere devotion to God. Ibn Bāqūdāstates that the declaration oftawḥīdis the most important principle and all other religious duties follow from it.59This is based on thefive spiritual duties he enumerates: belief in the existence of theCreator; belief that He is our Lord; belief in His oneness; sincere love for God; and53 Saʿadya Gaon is one of the earliest philosophers from upper Egypt. He was inclined to Muʿtaziliteideas and had a significant influence on later Jewish thinkers.54Hidāja, p. 33 [Arabic].55 See e.g. Cahn,The Philosophy of Judaism, New York: Macmillan, 1962, pp. 321–2, 329; Sirat,Jewish Philosophy, pp. 1–5.56 J.B.

The third chapter (pp. 125–74) elucidates man’s dutyto obey (ṭāʿa) God, which should, Ibn Bāqūdāinsists, follow the two principles ofobligatory matters in the heart.64The fourth chapter (pp. 175–227) deals with total reliance upon God (tawakkul).Ibn Bāqūdāexplains that God is the only being who is in charge of everything,including‘gain and loss’.65What humans can do is, therefore, to‘surrenderthemselves completely (istislām) to Him’.66Total reliance upon God is propitiousin respect of both‘belief and this world’.67Correspondingly, he establishes thefifthprinciple (pp. 228–58) as the devotion of all acts to God alone. Considering Hisunique nature, Ibn Bāqūdāexplains that every action should be carried out for Hissake with‘the clarity of minds and the purity of hearts (ṣafw al-ḍamāʾir wa-naqāʾal-qulūb)’.68The sixth chapter (pp. 259–81) concerns humility (tawāḍuʿ). Humility mayremove pride (ʿujb) with which actions can never be righteous. This is also the‘basis of worship’, since humility‘separates the servant of God from the Divinequalities’which belong to God alone and never to created beings.69Humility isthe beginning of repentance (tawba), hence the seventh principle (pp. 282–305) ofobligatory matters in the heart is repentance. Through reasoning and the Book ofGod, states Ibn Bāqūdā, it is clear that humans tend to‘fail to fulfil’their duty toobey God.70He explains that since human natures are manifold, their activities alsobecome varied. This can be proved logically and is frequently mentioned inthe Bible. This is the reason why humans need the‘rein of law (zimāmsharīʿa)’71and he insists that God gives humans opportunities to repent and60 Ibid., p. 37 [Arabic].61 Ibid., pp. 43–5 [Arabic]. Starting an argument with a proof of the existence of the Creator is commonpractice among the Kalām thinkers, as well as Saʿadya who follows their style.

It can lead the self to rightness in both this world and thehereafter.74The ninth chapter (pp. 354–77) concerns renunciation (zuhd) of this world. IbnBāqūdāexplains the thirty important aspects of self-examination, which cover allthe duties of man to God,75and renunciation is an aspect of self-examination whenthe declaration oftawḥīdcannot be obtained without it. Ibn Bāqūdāstates that trueaffirmation oftawḥīdcan be achieved only through the‘completeness (tāmm)’ofthe heart which has abstained from the love of this world.76Renunciation is anobligation for believers and can bring them repose for‘souls and bodies (al-nufūswa’l-ajsām)’.77Ibn Bāqūdāfrowns upon complete abstinence by created beings asthis is against the moderate nature of the law. Instead, he looks with favour uponthose who‘hold the middle of the extreme edges of renunciation (ḥudūd al-zuhd)’,which is from worldly luxuries and longing for them, citing a verse from Isaiah tosupport his argument (Is 45:18).78The last and most supreme principle is sincere love (maḥabba) for God. Thistenth principle (pp. 378–97) is the‘utmost degree of the steps’which Ibn Bāqūdāhas explained in this book so far.79Renunciation is to free the heart in order todevote itself to God alone. Believers can then truly realise their obligation of‘fear(khawf) for God and love for Him’.80This fear is‘the goal of renunciation’and‘theclosest stage to love’.81Love for God is dedication of the soul (nafs)82which isyearning for God and His light. The soul is a spiritual (rūḥānī) substance whichyearns for other spiritual beings, but is bound to a crude (kathīf) entity, the body.This is a test (ikhtibār) given by the Creator; the soul has to learn how to controlthis‘coarse body’which is‘full of darkness’.83It is therefore the obligation andlonging of the human soul to free the heart from the shackles of the body and this72 Ibid., pp. 27–8, 282–3 [Arabic].73 In thefifth section of the previous chapter on repentance, Ibn Bāqūdāenumerates the most importanttwenty conditions.

From now on, this term will be rendered as either‘self’or‘soul’, depending on the context.83Hidāja, p. 379 [Arabic].Ibn Bāqūdāandal-Hidāya ilāfarāʾiḍal-qulūb 155"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"world, and to‘unite (ittaṣala) with the light’of the Divine.84Ibn Bāqūdāclaims thatthis highest stage is love for God.85At the end ofal-Hidāya, Ibn Bāqūdāadds ten couplets which sum up the mainpoints of the ten chapters of his book. They are composed in Hebrew and the poemis written in rhyming couplets and a single acrostic of Ibn Bāqūdā’s name can befound with thefirst letter of each couplet.86Ibn Bāqūdācomposed another poem inHebrew which is mentioned and partly quoted in a chapter ofal-Hidāyaonrepentance87and added at the end of the book. It is entitled‘Admonition’andhas been used in Sefardi prayers on the Day of Atonement. Each section starts with‘my soul (nafshi)’, with Biblical quotations throughout the poem.88Al-Hidāyais a devotional work. It is neither apologetic nor polemical. It is notthe aim of the writing to defend the faith or reveal new discoveries. The value of IbnBāqūdā’s work lies in its systematic arrangement and clear argument, based on theauthor’s thorough knowledge of the Scriptures and religious texts. The book is wellplanned, reasonable and encouraging, and we can easily feel the author’s dedicationfrom the very beginning.Islamic sources ofal-HidāyaFrom the general outline above, it appears that Kalām argumentation, Suficonceptsand Jewish ethics coexist inal-Hidāya.89It is, however, hard to tell when IbnBāqūdārefers to Muslim ideas, since he does not consistently mention the sourcesof his quotations. For instance, he quotes a saying:‘[I] met people returning from awar...and told them: You came back, by praise of God, from the lesserjihād...and [now] prepare yourself for the greaterjihād...[which is] against desire (hawā)and its soldiers’.90This is very likely based on a well-knownḤadīth of the ProphetMuḥammad who emphasised the importance of the inner, greaterjihād,91althoughIbn Bāqūdāsimply mentions that this quote is from‘one of the pious men (ṣāliḥūn)’without suggesting any more detail. (ThisḤadīth also appears in theQūtbut in aslightly different way.92This point will be examined later.) The lack of reference tosources is not unusual for the time of Ibn Bāqūdāand it requires more investigationto identify which anecdotes and sayings inal-Hidāyaare of Islamic origin.Fenton argues that Ibn Bāqūdāattempts to‘camouflage’the Islamic character-istic of his work by giving equivalent Biblical sources as a replacement for Qurʾanic84 Ibid.85 Ibid., pp. 28, 378–9 [Arabic].86Direction, p. 447;Hidāja, pp. 397–8 [Hebrew].87Hidāja, p. 295 [Arabic].88Direction, p. 452;Hidāja, pp. 398–407 [Hebrew].89 Lobel puts this characteristic as‘the creative integration of philosophy, theology, Sufimysticism, andrabbinic Judaism’(Dialogue, p. xii).90Hidāja, p. 232 [Arabic].91 See e.g.Kashf, p. 200.92Qūt, vol. 2, p. 521.156Ibn Bāqūdāandal-Hidāya ilāfarāʾiḍal-qulūb"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"quotations.93It seems reasonable that Malter claims this important Jewish writingas being the most‘thoroughly Mohammedan in style and diction’in Judaeo-Arabicliterature.94The influence of Greek philosophy and Islamic religious thought onIbn Bāqūdāis so strong that comprehension ofal-Hidāyarequires knowledge notonly of Jewish traditions but also of Arabic literature, including philosophy, Kalāmand Sufism.Ibn Bāqūdā’s philosophical and Kalām arguments can be seen most clearly in thefirst chapter, where he proves the creation of the world and the existence of theCreator in order to affirm His creature’s obligation to declare Histawḥīd, and in thesecond chapter where he argues for a dual composition of creatures, as consisting ofspiritual and material elements such as soul (nafs) and body (jasad).95Ibn Bāqūdāemphasises the importance of rational speculation throughout his book and insiststhat it is man’s duty to reason about intelligible matters.96In this sense, he is aphilosopher. However, as mentioned above,al-Hidāyawas written for religiouspeople, not for philosophers. Philosophical argument is for him a tool to strengthenbelief, as it was for many Jewish philosophers at that time.Mystical tones can be found in various places, even inChapters1 and 2 where IbnBāqūdāis developing philosophical arguments. He states there clearly that his book isto elucidate‘inner knowledge (al-ʿilm al-bāṭin)’,97as God cannot be known throughimagination (wahm) and sensory perception (ḥiss).98God comes closest to the heartwhen believers observe His traces (āthār); but He goes furthest if they observe Himby‘likening His nature (tamaththul dhātihi)’to something similar and‘giving a form(taṣawwur)’to Him.99The utmost degree of His gnosis can be achieved whenbelievers reach a stage where the heart is in contemplation of Divine nature only.Ibn Bāqūdāinsists that believers should focus on His meaning rather thanmaking images of Him and associating Him with something resembling. Whenall those images disappear from the soul (nafs), God becomes inseparable from thebelievers.100(This is similar to Ibn al-ʿArabī’s statement that images of God arebased on something that is not God and his criticism of one who‘creates whathe believes in himself through his consideration’.101The significant difference isthat Ibn al-ʿArabīcondemns Kalām thinkers for doing so and Ibn BāqūdāacceptsKalām argument.)93 Fenton,‘Judaism and Sufism’,inCompanion, p. 204.94 Malter, review ofHidāja, p. 380.95Hidāja, p. 100 [Arabic].

Together with the contents of the rest of the book and its verytitle, it is natural to consider that there is a mystical, and especially Sufi,influenceuponal-Hidāya. (Regarding mystical aspects in Jewish tradition, some of IbnBāqūdā’s ideas have been recognised as resembling certain concepts in theKabbalistic tradition, while differences between Ibn Bāqūdā’s and Kabbalisticviews have also been noted.)102It has been pointed out that the writings of al-Muḥāsibī(d. 243/857),Abu’l-Ṭayyib al-Mutanabbī(d. 354/955) and al-Makkī(d. 386/996) might havehad an influence onal-Hidāya.103Ibn Bāqūdādoes not mention any non-Jewishsources in his book and it is difficult to determine its Muslim sources, if there are any.The possible influence of al-Muḥāsibīand al-Makkīonal-Hidāyahas probably beenraised because they are notable writers on the matter of the heart among thinkers inSufism, and clearly the central concern ofal-Hidāyais the heart. In addition to thesetwo authors, Lomba enumerates, as the possible source of Ibn Bāqūdā’s inspiration,al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī(d. 110/728), Muḥammad b. Wāsiʿ(d. 127/744), Sufyānb.ʿUyayna (d. 196/811), Dhu’l-Nūn al-Miṣrī(d. 246/861) and the anonymousEpistlesof Ikhwān al-Ṣafāʾ(written probably between 350/961 and 375/986).104As discussed earlier, it seems unlikely now that al-GhazālīinfluencedIbn Bāqūdā; however, the possibility that they shared common sources remains.Al-Ghazālīclaims that the major sources of his mystical ideas include al-Makkī,al-Muḥāsibīand al-Junayd (d. 298/910),105and it seems also worth examiningal-Junayd’s teaching in comparison withal-Hidāya. As an author of a treatise on theheart, it may be interesting to look at Abu’lḤusayn al-Nūrī(d. 295/907–8) as well.As regards the poet al-Mutanabbī, Mansoor and Yahuda point to a verse inal-Hidāyawhich can be found in theDīwānof al-Mutanabbī, but was not translatedby Judah b. Tibbon.106In his translation, Judah tried to substitute Arabic quotationswith equivalent Hebrew verses, where possible. Al-Mutanabbī’s verse might havebeen omitted during this replacement process without providing a substitute.107This de-Islamicisation, or at least de-Arabicisation, process may indicate that Judahrecognised many Islamic/Arabic sources ofal-Hidāya, even after Ibn Bāqūdā’sown replacement job. This verse is consequently missing in many other renditionswhich are based on Judah’s Islamically attenuated version of the work.

Mansoor states that it is difficult to trace whether hisinfluence was direct or indirect, since later Sufiwritings are greatly affected byal-Muḥāsibī, and Ibn Bāqūdāmight have been influenced by them, not necessarilydirectly from al-Muḥāsibī.110Lobel expands this argument and compares the useof the specific termikhlāṣ, which often appears in bothal-Hidāyaand the works ofal-Muḥāsibī. She evaluates the use ofikhlāṣinal-Hidāyaand how this termis translated (and not translated) into Hebrew, and argues that Ibn Bāqūdā’sapplication of the concept ofikhlāṣhas an Islamic connotation, which she comparesto al-Muḥāsibī’s use of the term.111I limit my analysis to the putative connectionbetween Ibn Bāqūdāand al-Makkīhere. However, it would be worth exploringother Arabic sources ofal-Hidāya.Many scholars argue in favour of the influence of theQūtonal-Hidāya.Mansoor,for instance, analyses that although Ibn Bāqūdādoes not borrow al-Makkī’sideasblindly, many similarities can be found between their writings.112Lobel also men-tions al-Makkī’sQūtfrom time to time,113as does Yahuda.114Vajda, on the otherhand, claims that theQūtexerted a significant influence onal-Hidāyaand refers toal-Makkīthroughout his study, theThéologie. Considering al-Ghazālī’s indebtednessto al-Makkī,similaritiesbetweenworksofIbnBāqūdāand al-Ghazālīmay suggesttheir common source, theQūt.

At the same time, a number ofquestions need to be raised before analysing the possible link between the twowritings. First of all, is there any external evidence to prove that theQūtcouldhave been read in al-Andalus at the time of Ibn Bāqūdā? Secondly, how substantialare the similarities and when do they break down (or not)? Lastly, how do weunderstand this intellectual relationship in the broader cultural context?FrameworkFirst, I attempt to investigate whether the issue of time (the timing of the completionof the books) and space (the geographical gap between present-day Iraq and Spain)can be overcome. Regarding al-Makkī, it is not certain when and where he wrote.Considering the fact that he mentions his personal encounter with Ibn Sālim (d. ca.356/967),1although the exact date and place are unknown, we could assume thattheQūtwas probably written at some point in the latter half of the tenth centurybecause of his death date of 967 and al-Makkī’s death in 996.As regards Ibn Bāqūdā, he is considered to have spent his life either in Cordobaor in Saragossa, and the latest studies show that he wrote between 1080 and 1090.There thus appears to be approximately a hundred years between the completiondates of theQūtandal-Hidāya, and this may be enough to cover the geographicalgap between Iraq and Spain.2The next issue to be discussed is whether a copy of theQūtactually existed inal-Andalus during the life of Ibn Bāqūdā. Due to a paucity of information, onlyscanty evidence can be provided here. According to Sezgin, there exists a summaryof theQūtwritten by Muḥammad b. Khalaf b. Saʿīd al-Andalusī(d. 485/1092).3His1Qūt, vol. 3, pp. 1202, 1318.2 For example, al-Ghazālīis said to havefinished writingTahāfut al-falāsifaat the beginning of 1095 inBaghdad (EI2, s.v.‘al-Ghazālī’(W.M. Watt)), and Ibn Rushd in Spain seems to have composedTahāfut al-tahāfutat some point between 1174 and 1180 (EI2, s.v.‘Ibn Rushd’(R. Arnaldez)).3GAS, vol. 1, p. 667."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"nisbaseems to be able to connect al-Makkīto Islamic Spain; however, it is notcertain where al-Andalusīwrote. One manuscript of theQūthas survived in theEscorial Library, which is written in Maghribi style, but not dated.4It is certain thattheQūtwas read in the western part of the Islamic world, although in a slightly laterperiod, since two prominent Andalusian mystics, Ibn al-ʿArabī(d. 638/1240) andal-Rundī(d. 792/1390), refer to al-Makkīin their writings, as seen inChapter 6.However, there does not seem to exist any other external evidence which canclearly show whether theQūtexisted in al-Andalus in the late eleventh century.Lastly, assuming that theQūtexisted in the time of Ibn Bāqūdā, it should beasked whether it is possible that he read this book. This question is, however, almostimpossible to answer with any certainty. If the book was available in Cordoba orSaragossa, and if Ibn Bāqūdāhad access to it, it is likely that he read it, consideringthe religious environment in al-Andalus and the popularity of theQūt. Given thefact that Ibn Bāqūdā’s main interest is the heart, or the inner aspects of religious life,the very title of theQūtcould have inspired him. In the introduction ofal-Hidāya,Ibn Bāqūdācites a saying:‘Whoever utters a wise word, even if he belongs to theGentiles, is called a sage.’5This might indicate his intention to quote non-Jewishsayings in his book, and might justify his use of Muslim sources.On the whole, it appears to be impossible, at this moment, to prove only fromexternal evidence that Ibn Bāqūdāactually read theQūt. At the same time, noevidence has been found which rules out this possibility. Allowing that this prob-ability provides the basis for further argument, the rest of this chapter studies theactual texts to see if there is any direct link between theQūtandal-Hidāya.Aims and structureFirst, I will explore the contexts and contents ofal-Hidāyaand theQūt. This is toavoid overemphasising textual parallels in certain expressions or short excerpts,since ignoring the whole context might lead us to misrepresent these similarities. Itis possible that, despite the parallels, the aim and attitudes of the writings could beopposed to each other.6This section thusfirst examines the aims of the two booksand their structure. The next section analyses their overall approach in order to formthe basis of a further argument. Lastly, Ibn Bāqūdā’s perspective on the image of theheart will be explored in comparison with its treatment in theQūt. The heart is thekey idea and underlies all the religious concepts which are dealt with inal-Hidāyaand theQūt.7By focusing on the heart, I will attempt to evaluate the degree ofsimilarities and their implications. The main concern here is not to force us to draw4 Ms. árabe 729, fols 1–155.5Hidāja, p. 26 [Hebrew citation]; the translation is fromDirection, p. 103.6 For critical evaluation of literary parallels, see Sandmel,‘Parallelomania’,Journal of BiblicalLiterature81, no. 1, Mar. 1962, pp. 1–13; Davila,‘The perils of parallels:“Parallelomania”revisited’,unpublished draft for discussion, St Mary’s College, University of St Andrews, 2001.7 For a comparative analysis of another important idea of both works, knowledge (ʿilmandmaʿrifa), seemy thesis, Appendix IX, pp. 336–41.TheQūtandal-Hidāya: a Muslim–Jewish dialogue?161"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"a causal connection between the two works, but to set the context in order to gain abetter understanding of them.Ibn Bāqūdā’s aim in writingal-Hidāyais clearly expressed in the introduction.He states that the target audience of his book are those who are mistaken in theirbelief and are remiss in their religious duties; the book is structured in order to guidethose who seek the inner knowledge which leads to God.8The purpose of theQūt,on the other hand, is not stated so obviously; however, the intended reader appearsto be, from its title, the novice who is striving to reachtawḥīd. It could be said thatboth books are written for religious people who would like to take the path whichleads to God alone.Concerning the structure, all the chapters ofal-Hidāyaare closely linked and IbnBāqūdādevelops a coherent argument which starts with the core of all religiousduties,tawḥīd, and ends with their goal, love for God. Apart from this highest aim,all the nine obligations elucidated inal-Hidāyaare equally essential and one cannotbe fulfilled without the others. For instance, the declaration oftawḥīdis the basisfrom where all other obligations of the heart follow,9but, at the same time, it cannotbe achieved without renunciation, which is described in the ninth chapter.10The arrangement ofal-Hidāyais concerned with establishing a logical and lucidargument, rather than creating a hierarchy of the religious duties of the heart.11With regard to theQūt, this work begins with the description of various forms ofoutward conduct. Al-Makkīthen elucidates more internal aspects of religious life,but he does not seem to give a strong structure to the last quarter of the book.The arrangement of theQūtbears no comparison with the structure ofal-Hidāya.There is no doubt that the latter is much more structured than the former. Thechapters ofal-Hidāyaare organised coherently and it is easy to follow Ibn Bāqūdā’sargument. The arrangement and logicalflow of theQūtare not as strong as thatevinced byal-Hidāya.Mansoor makes a brief comment that the structure ofal-Hidāyaaccords closelywith al-Makkī’s nine religious stations (maqāmāt), which are elucidated inSection 32 of theQūt. (SeeTable1.) Ibn Bāqūdādoes not borrow al-Makkī’sideas blindly, states Mansoor, but both of them put love for God as the highest stagefor believers.12Among ten fundamental principles (uṣūl) of the heart’s religiousobligations inal-Hidāyaand nine fundamental principles (uṣūl) of the stations ofreligious certainty in theQūt,13four principles are shared: total reliance upon God,8Hidāja, pp. 5, 24, 29 [Arabic].9 Ibid., pp. 26, 35 [Arabic].10 Ibid., pp. 28, 354 [Arabic].11 On this particular point, my opinion differs from that of Lomba, who states that the ten duties aredescribed in‘an ascending spiritual progression’(Lomba, p. 530).12Direction, pp. 31–2. It is a brief comment and Mansoor does not expand his argument. (He describesal-Makkī’s nine stations as‘classification of the degrees of devoutness’or‘the nine degrees ofknowledge’; however, the words‘devoutness’or‘knowledge’do not reflect the original meaning,‘religious certainty (yaqīn)’; ibid., p. 31;Qūt, vol. 2, p. 499).13Hidāja, the previous page of p. 6*, pp. 6*–9* [Arabic];Qūt, vol. 2, p. 499.162TheQūtandal-Hidāya: a Muslim–Jewish dialogue?"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"repentance, renunciation, and love for Him. Apart from these, the two sets ofreligious notions do not seem to correspond to each other. Furthermore, theessential features of having these principles are different in the two books.Ibn Bāqūdāarranges his book in order to maintain a logicalflow by which hehopes to be able to convince his reader to fulfil the heart’s religious obligations. Thefirst nine gates are the preceding duties which lead a believer to the highest stage offaith, pure love for God (the last gate).14Al-Makkī’s categories, on the other hand,are clear ascending stations. They are the conditions of those possessing religiouscertainty and each subdivision is a station to the next one. The only echo betweenIbn Bāqūdā’s religious principles and al-Makkī’s stations is that both are consideredas mandatory by the authors, as well as gates through which believers can becomecloser to God. Mansoor appears to compareal-Hidāyaonly with the section of theQūtwhere those stations are identified. The similarities are limited and it isimportant to study the wholeQūtin contrast withal-Hidāya. Although themethod is shared, the nature of Ibn Bāqūdā’s ten obligations seems to be differentfrom that of al-Makkī’s stations, or the mystical stations in general, which arerepeatedly referred to in discussions of progress along the spiritual path.It should be added here that Ibn Bāqūdā’s duties are also different from mysticalstates (aḥwāl), which are often used to describe a certain psychological conditionwhich occurs on the path towards God. Unlike mystical stations, those states aregenerally considered to be impossible to be reached by human effort alone; they canbe attained with the help of Divine grace.Al-Hidāyais a book on religiousobligations which Ibn Bāqūdāinsists that believers must make an effort to fulfil.Consequently, unattainable mystical states cannot be directly comparable to IbnBāqūdā’s ten duties of the heart. Al-Makkīstates that the mystical stations are to‘remain and persist’; whereas the mystical states which are‘the gift from God MostHigh’, are changeable and transient, and to be established in the heart.15Table 1Fundamental principles inal-Hidāyaand theQūtIbn Bāqūdā–al-HidāyaAl-Makkī–theQūttawḥīdrepentance (tawba)contemplation (iʿtibār)patience (ṣabr)obedience (ṭāʿa)gratitude (shukr)total reliance (tawakkul)hope (rajāʾ)sincere devotion (ikhlāṣ)fear (khawf)humility (tawāḍuʿ)renunciation (zuhd)repentance (tawba)total reliance (tawakkul)self-examination (muḥāsabat al-nafs)contentment (riḍāʾ)renunciation (zuhd)love (maḥabba)love (maḥabba)—14Hidāja, p. 383 [Arabic].15Qūt, vol. 2, pp. 1164–5.

If thenature of Ibn Bāqūdā’s fundamental principles is not concerned, the very idea ofdividing religious duties into subdivisions is shared betweenal-Hidāyaand theQūt, and so are some of their themes. This technique can also be seen in al-Makkī’scontemporaries’treatises: al-Sarrāj’sLumaʿand al-Kalābādhī’sal-Taʿarruf,16butnot in, for instance, Saʿadya’s book which Ibn Bāqūdārecommends his reader toconsult.17However, starting the argument by proving the existence of the Creator isshared betweenal-Hidāyaand Saʿadya’sDoctrines and Beliefs,18following theKalām tradition; but not with theQūt(or theLumaʿoral-Taʿarruf). The arrange-ment ofal-Hidāya, therefore, might be a product of these two different trends inArabic religious literature.ApproachRegarding the approach to the subject matter, the same technique can be seen inal-Hidāyaand theQūt. Both cite respective religious doctrines and their exegesesby sages.Al-Hidāyais full of quotations of the Scriptures, the Talmud and theMidrashim; likewise, theQūtisfilled with Qurʾanic verses andḤadīth. Both workscontain many sayings of sages, sometimes with reference to their sources and othertimes without. These citations are used to support their arguments, but, at the sametime, the topics of the books are treated as the natural outcome of the interpretationof the respective religious texts.In other words, these two books appear to have been written on the assumptionthat their themes are evident extensions of the Scriptures and interpretive tradition.Ibn Bāqūdāinsists in his introduction that the importance of fulfilling the heart’sreligious obligations is clearly shown in many places in the Scriptures and repeat-edly expressed by pious ancestors; but, since nobody had explored this issueexhaustedly, he decided to do it himself.19As for al-Makkī, although he is neveras explicit as Ibn Bāqūdā, the thirty-three Qurʾanic verses, which are the onlycomponent of thefirst two sections of theQūt,20affirm the significance of rightconduct in this world, which is self-explanatorily stated in the Qurʾān, and alsosignal the motivation of al-Makkīto write theQūt.It is clear that in bothal-Hidāyaand theQūt, quotations from religious textsand pious sayings are used to underpin their claims and justify their arguments;however, it is dubious whether this shared method proves anything. So far, we have16 Al-Sarrāj provides the definition of mystical stations and states, and enumerates seven stations andnine states (Lumaʿ, pp. 41–72 [Arabic]). Al-Kalābādhīdescribes religious states briefly and listsseventeen stations (Taʿarruf, pp. 86–9, 92–111).17 Ibn Bāqūdādoes not mention the name of the books (Hidāja, p. 33 [Arabic]); however, Saʿadya’smagnum opus,The Book of Doctrines and Beliefs, does not show the technique which is used in theQūt.18 This book starts with elucidation of‘creatio ex nihilo’and‘the unity of the Creator’(Saʿadya,TheBook of Doctrines and Beliefs, Oxford: East and West Library, 1946).19Hidāja, p. 8 [Arabic].20Qūt, vol. 1, pp. 9–10.164TheQūtandal-Hidāya: a Muslim–Jewish dialogue?"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"seen thatal-Hidāyaand theQūtshow a similar approach to their theses, and use asimilar technique for their topics. However, it could be said that this is a fairlystandard way of dealing with religious issues and does not necessarily establish alink between them. Although this is not to deny the possibility of a significantconnection, this resemblance may begin to break down as they discuss the externalduties upon believers.The most obvious contrast in approach would be their treatment of outwardaspects of religious life. Unlike theQūt,al-Hidāyadoes not give a detailed accountof the external conduct of believers. TheQūtexplains what believers ought to do ona practical everyday level; for instance, the virtue of prayer from Monday toSunday, recommended Qurʾanic verses after the morning prayer, food, travel,trade21and so on. The book was written for novices and this might be one of thereasons theQūttakes a pragmatic approach. This demonstrates a significantdifference fromal-Hidāya.Ibn Bāqūdāvalues the significance of having right intention as the core of externalconduct;22however, his book does not provide practical examples. Ibn Bāqūdāclaims that religious obligations can be fulfilled only with both knowledge andaction, and there are 613 duties upon the body, while the number of duties of theheart are innumerable.23He quotes the Talmud,‘He who only occupies himself withthe study of the Torah is as if he had no God’,24and states the importance ofcombining study with practice based on a pure heart.25His view of the superiorityof the heart might be the reason he does not elucidate external aspects of religious lifeinal-Hidāya. It might be because of his hurry tofinish his book as he mentions,26orhe might have thought that they would be just obvious to any Jew. It is, however, alsopossible that Ibn Bāqūdādoes not lay the same amount of importance on bodilyduties as does al-Makkīin theQūt.IbnBāqūdā, for instance, insists that fulfilling theheart’s religious duties can balance both the inner and the outer obligations to God.27According to al-Makkī, external knowledge, which concerns actions of the body,and internal knowledge, which concerns those of the heart, are interdependent.These two types of knowledge cannot exist without each other, just as in the case ofthe relationship between the body and the heart. Their status accords with that of agrain which has a skin and an inside. Both the exterior and the interior togethercomprise the grain; the difference in their natures does not result in two grainsexisting separately. The relationship between outer and inner knowledge, and thebody and heart, is the same. Al-Makkīexplains their interrelationship as,‘Islam is21 Ibid., vol. 1, pp. 80–4, 15–19, vol. 3, pp. 1405–21, 1523–32, 1654–710 respectively.22Hidāja, p. 11 [Arabic].23 Ibid., pp. 12–13 [Arabic]. The 613 is the total number of Biblical commandments in Jewish tradition.Ibn Bāqūdādoes not explain the detail of those bodily obligations, while Maimonides elucidatesthem in detail in his book (Maimonides,The Commandments, London: Soncino Press, 1967).24Babylonian Talmud,ʿAbodah Zarah 17b, p. 89.25Hidāja, p. 19 [Arabic].26 Ibid., p. 30 [Arabic].27 Ibid., p. 20 [Arabic].TheQūtandal-Hidāya: a Muslim–Jewish dialogue?165"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"the exterior of belief (īmān) and it is the actions of bodily members, while belief isthe interior of Islam and it is the actions of hearts.’28Islam is the manifestation ofbelief. Belief is not as obvious as external deeds but this is what connects theexterior and interior of religious life. TheQūtclaims that both aspects are necessaryfor believers.29TheQūtstill emphasises the superiority of inner knowledge over outer knowl-edge, since the former has control over the latter.30However, external knowledgeshould not be ignored, since it is‘the proof of God’and unawareness of thisknowledge leads to unbelief.31Al-Makkīquotes a saying of al-Junayd who tellsSārīal-Saqaṭīthat one must have a sound base of external knowledge of belief, suchasḤadīth and Sunna, before taking a Sufipath, since it is the root of faith.32Itappears to be important for al-Makkīnot only that one be knowledgeable about theinner aspects of belief, but also that one combine them with the outward features ofreligion and thus make right bodily actions according to the knowledge of the heart.Like theQūt,al-Hidāyais a moral guide, as evidenced by the title. It describes amodel mindset for believers and attempts to elucidate internal religious phenomenain a logical way. The main concern of this book is the attitudes of believers’heartstowards God, not their external behaviour. In its sense of guidance,al-Hidāyaresembles theQūt, but without the explanation of external religious elements.As a précis of the argument, it could be remarked so far that the purposes of writingal-Hidāyaand theQūtshow similarities. Nevertheless, there are barely any parallelsin their overall arrangement. It is possible to spot a shared structural elementbetween the nine religious stations in theQūtand the ten gates ofal-Hidāya.Atthe same time, Ibn Bāqūdā’s way of opening his book appears to adopt the style ofSaʿadya and/or Jewish theologians and philosophers who adopted Kalām methodsof argumentation. The contents of all ten religious obligations inal-Hidāyado notmatch the religious stations in theQūt; however, they do resonate with the overallthemes of theQūt. Concerning the inner features of religious life, the two bookstreat of similar subject matters and use equivalent materials. Mere observation of thechapter titles ofal-Hidāyawould not reveal its Jewish origin. If there were noBiblical citations, one might consideral-Hidāyaas a Sufiwork.The major difference betweenal-Hidāyaand theQūtlies in the method ofargumentation. Ibn Bāqūdāfollows a line of reasoning and analyses his materialsin a logical way. He emphasises the importance of the use of intellect in progressingto knowledge of the Divine.33Intellect is of prime importance throughoutal-Hidāyaand Ibn Bāqūdā’s manner of elucidation consistently remains at an28Qūt, vol. 3, p. 1284.29 Ibid., vol. 1, p. 366.30 Ibid., vol. 1, p. 436.31 Ibid., vol. 1, p. 406.32 Ibid., vol. 1, p. 428.33Hidāja, p. 4 [Arabic].166TheQūtandal-Hidāya: a Muslim–Jewish dialogue?"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"intelligible level. Al-Makkī, likewise, emphasises the importance of knowledge,since belief, to him,isknowledge,34but this knowledge comes together with properactions both inwardly and outwardly.This is another occasion where an alleged parallel betweenal-HidāyaandtheQūtfalls down. The latter attaches great importance to outward conduct,while the former treats inward matters only. This characteristic seems to followthe philosophical tradition rather than Sufism. Lobel calls this tendency‘philoso-phical mysticism’,35describing Ibn Bāqūdā’s logical argumentation regardingmystical themes. However, it is not only mysticism which is treated in his book.It does not even seem to be his intention to elucidate mysticism. Although mysticaltones and themes can be seen throughoutal-Hidāya, the main concern of the bookis religious ethics based on rational belief. Considering the aim, structure andoverall approach alone, we cannot confirm the influence of theQūtonal-Hidāya.The last section therefore looks at the contents of the books in more detail throughthe key religious idea which is shared between them–the heart.The religious idea of the heartIn the introduction toal-Hidāya, Ibn Bāqūdāclaims that through the reading of theBook of God, the sayings of sages, and reasoning, he has come to the conclusionthat there is an urgent need for the heart to perform certain essential matters ofreligion.36He states that a human is a combined entity of body (jasad) and soul(nafs); the former is exterior (ẓāhir) and the latter is interior (bāṭin). They are God’sblessings and accordingly, insists Ibn Bāqūdā, it is man’s obligation to obey Himboth outwardly and inwardly. External duties are those of the limbs; such as prayerand fasting. A human body is capable of performing them. Internal duties, onthe other hand, can be demonstrated only in an internal way, namely in theperformances of the heart.37Inward obligations, many of which are elucidated inal-Hidāya, can be fulfilledwithout expressing themselves in bodily activity. External tasks, on the other hand,can only be accomplished when they accord closely with those of the internal. IbnBāqūdāemphasises that the‘religious duties of hearts’are the‘foundations(qawāʾiḍ) of all the obligations’.38It is the heart, therefore, which has controlover the actions of the body. It is also the heart which is the measurement of God’sreward, as a good bodily deed without a good intention would not be considered tobe good.39Differentiation of the heart from the body can also be seen in theQūt.34 E.g.Qūt, vol. 1, pp. 383–4: al-Makkīquotes Quraʾnic verses to support his argument (58:11, 4:162,3:7, 30:56).35Dialogue, p. xii.36Hidāja, p. 10 [Arabic].37 Ibid., p. 8 [Arabic].38 Ibid.39 Ibid., pp. 8–9 [Arabic].TheQūtandal-Hidāya: a Muslim–Jewish dialogue?167"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Like Ibn Bāqūdā, al-Makkīattaches the heart to internal qualities and the body toexternal features.40Al-Makkīsays that the heart belongs to the Divine sphere,where God bestows the ability of love (raghabūt) and awe (rahabūt),41and whereGod shines with his might.Love (raghba) and awe (rahba) are twin concepts used to describe humancharacteristics, and they can also be seen employed inal-Hidāya. They aredescribed as a man’s ability with which pure love for God (maḥabba) can besought.42Ibn Bāqūdāuses the term‘fear (khawf)’to illustrate the closest gate tothe goal of believers, love for God. This word appears throughoutal-Hidāya,especially in its last chapter on love.43Following rabbinic literature, Ibn Bāqūdādifferentiates the lower form of fear, fear of God’s punishment (ʿiqāb), from thehigher form which derives from awe (hayba) and reverence (ijlāl) for the Divinereality. This highest stage of fear is, according to Ibn Bāqūdā, equivalent to theHebrew termyirʾatin the Bible,44where God-fearingness concerns not only faithbut also human morality and required attitudes towards God.45It should be pointed out that Ibn Bāqūdādifferentiates the termkhawffromrahba, which comes together withraghba. He also differentiatesmaḥabbafromraghba.46Both theQūtandal-Hidāyatreatrahbaandraghbatogether as humancharacteristics in the heart, andmaḥabbaas the highest station of believers. Thekhawfis described as a state which comes just before love for God inal-Hidāya,while, in theQūt, it is thefifth station among nine stations to religious certainty inthe heart.47This parallel seems to break down here, since al-Makkīputs fear (khawf) beforerenunciation (zuhd) while Ibn Bāqūdāinsists that fear is the goal of renunciationand the closest stage to the highest aim, love for God. However, al-Makkīputs asection on fear in the chapter on love and explains that love and fear are inter-dependent and cannot be achieved without each other.48Fear, for al-Makkī, is theessence oftaqwā49which brings together devotional service to God, as this isnecessary knowledge of the Divine.5040Qūt, vol. 1, p. 324.41 Or‘yearning and fear’(ibid.). For more detail of these two concepts, see Ch. 3, a footnote to [20]. IntheQūt, al-Makkīdescribesraghbaandrahbaas human characteristics which God bestowed, and abasis of the majority of humans’actions (Qūt, vol. 3, pp. 1550, 1579).42Hidāja, p. 386 [Arabic].43 Ibid., pp. 378–97 [Arabic].44 Ibid., p. 387 [Arabic].45 See e.g. B.L. Sherwin,‘Fear of God’, in Cohen and Mendes-Flohr (eds)Jewish Religious Thought,p. 245.46 Mansoor translates bothkhawfandrahbaas‘fear’, andmaḥabbaandraghbaas‘love’throughoutthe last chapter, but they might require clarification (Direction, pp. 426–46).47 SeeTable1 above.48Qūt, vol. 2, pp. 1070–9, esp. p. 1075.49 This term often appears in theQūtwith a mixture of meanings involving fear of God, warding off eviland duty to God. See Ch. 3, a footnote to [15].50Qūt, vol. 2, pp. 616 and 680.168TheQūtandal-Hidāya: a Muslim–Jewish dialogue?"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Al-Makkīinsists that true belief cannot be achieved as long as love of this worldand desire (hawā) stay in the heart.51Ibn Bāqūdāexplains that he has written hischapter on renunciation just before the chapter on pure love for God, as the goal ofrenunciation is to remove love of this world and lusts (shahwāt) for it.52This issuekeeps appearing in both theQūtandal-Hidāya. According to al-Makkī, evil and theevil self manifest themselves only by desire and ignorance. Desire keeps believersattached to this world and detached from their God-fearing duties.53The same lineof thought can be seen in Ibn Bāqūdā’s aforementioned citation of the lesser andgreaterjihādwhere he explains that the greaterjihādis against desire and itssoldiers.54Al-Makkīstates that ignorance (jahl), inattention (ghafla) and occupation withtrivial matters of this world (ṭalab fuḍūl dunyā) damage the heart. Believers have tofight against them by controlling their selves, the evil and their body, because Godcreated this world as a test for believers, to see if they can renounce it.55Accordingto Ibn Bāqūdā, what prevents a believer from performing the heart’s obligations islove of this world and ignorance of God.56Love of this world, ignorance and greedare similarly treated by al-Makkīas the very cause of the appearance of desire.According to him, its manifestation in the heart depends on the control of thosethree evil sources.57In theQūt, the heart of a believer is described as the only place where God resideson the earth. But this heart has to be pure and free from unbelief and hypocrisy, asthese can extinguish the light of the heart.58Ibn Bāqūdā, likewise, states that havinggnosis of God in the heart and all the earthly desires and cravings exterminated,the heart can befilled with love for God. Thefire of desire will then seem to belike the light of a lamp in front of the light of obedience to God, which shines likethe sun during the daytime.59According to Ibn Bāqūdā, the body belongs to thisworld, and the heart to the hereafter. This is why the 613 bodily commandmentshave to be fulfilled with a pure heart. The heart can be cleansed by inner knowledge,which is elucidated inal-Hidāya.60Likewise, a harmonious relationship betweenbelief, heart and action is highly esteemed in theQūt.61Up to this point, the ideas and arguments of Ibn Bāqūdāand al-Makkīon thematter of the heart could be said to be in parallel. However, this putative parallelbreaks down with respect to two important concepts, namely reason andnafs–self51 Ibid., vol. 1, p. 343. See also Ch. 3, the footnote to [16].52Hidāja, p. 379 (cf. p. 131) [Arabic]. See Ch. 3, a footnote to [23] forshahwa.53Qūt, vol. 1, pp. 323–4.54Hidāja, p. 232 [Arabic]. Cf.

According to al-Makkī, the light of religious certaintyfills the heart of thebeliever when the three indispensable elements of the heart work appropriately.They are belief, knowledge and reason.62Belief and knowledge pertain to the heart,whereas reason is a tool of both the heart and the body, and so is desire. Reason anddesire are a pair of measurements which God bestowed upon humans. The formerfunctions as guidance, while the latter as seduction. They are a test of God to assesswhether a believer makes the right decision. Unlike desire, reason can work for bothgood and evil, and it is the believer’s choice as how to use his reason.63In theQūt,reason is described as twofold. It can be useful and harmful. However, its basicstatus is contrary to that of religious certainty. Reason belongs to this world, withthe self (nafs) and the enemy, while religious certainty belongs to the Divine sphere,together with the soul (rūḥ) and the angel.64This is significantly different from Ibn Bāqūdā’s beliefs. To him, reason is vital.Rational thinking is encouraged and recommended throughoutal-Hidāya. Humansare rational beings and he insists in the introduction that the basis of the heart’sobligations lies in reason.65His whole book is based on rational argument, and IbnBāqūdāclaims that believers need to use their reason and speculate on what theyhave learnt from religious tradition until falsity is eliminated and truth becomesunimpaired.66Ibn Bāqūdāseems to see religion as a body of beliefs that needrational justification. This line of thought, which seems to be based on Greekphilosophical tradition, cannot be found in theQūt. For al-Makkī, what counts iswhat worshippers believe and how they manifest their belief properly inwardly andoutwardly.As for the concept ofnafs, al-Makkīdifferentiates the self (nafs) from the soul(rūḥ) in the matter of the heart, and decides that the self is blameworthy. Itassociates with the enemy through desire and ignorance. On the other hand, thesoul is praiseworthy, and it manifests itself with the angels by truth and knowl-edge.67A dichotomous view can also be found inal-Hidāya, but in a slightlydifferent way. As mentioned above, Ibn Bāqūdāconsiders a human to be acomposite of the body and the soul (nafs). In his argument, it appears that thisnafsand the heart are interchangeable. Ibn Bāqūdāexplains that the body is part ofthis world, while the heart belongs to the hereafter. Believers are supposed todisregard their bodies and earthly issues, and focus their souls and hearts onreligious practices and obedience to God.68Inal-Hidāya, thenafsand the heartdesignate the same internal element of the human, which stands in an oppositerelation to the exterior of human beings, the body. It is worth mentioning that, in acitation regarding lesserjihādand greaterjihād, al-Makkī’s greater struggle is that62 Ibid., vol. 1, p. 328.63 Ibid., vol. 1, pp. 324–5.64 Ibid., vol. 1, p. 343.65Hidāja, p. 6 [Arabic].66 Ibid., p. 16 [Arabic].67Qūt, vol. 1, p. 324.

The importance of the heart as the only entity which can reflectDivine light is an important notion among Sufis who condemn the lower self,nafs,or at least advocate control over the self in order to purify the heart. Ibn Bāqūdāseems to adopt the former concept, namely the significance of performing theheart’s religious duties. However, he does not follow the concept of the lowerself in Sufitradition. Here, he seems to adopt the Kalām argument which divideshumans into two components, the soul (nafs) and the body. This may be the reasonIbn Bāqūdādoes not distinguish the heart andnafs, but treats both of them as aninternal human feature.Dynamics between Judaism and IslamThis chapter has discussed the possible influence of theQūtonal-Hidāyathroughtheir aims, structures, approaches and views of the important concept which isshared between the two books–the heart. Various similarities are found in thecontents and terminologies, while interesting contrasts are also seen, especially inthe manner of argument and the views of reason andnafs. Based on what has beenlooked at in this chapter, it appears to be clear that a direct link cannot be easilyestablished betweenal-Hidāyaand theQūt.Four major difficulties exist in making a connection between the two books. Firstof all, empirical evidence is lacking which proves that Ibn Bāqūdāhad a chance toread theQūt. Second, he does not mention any Muslim sources, and thus, in thelight of the previous point, any possible link has accordingly to be establishedthrough examination of the contents.The third difficulty lies in the language ofal-Hidāya, Judaeo-Arabic. This is aform of Arabic which was developed by Jewish citizens in the Islamic world.Although Classical Judaeo-Arabic, which was used between the tenth andfifteenthor sixteenth centuries, reflects Classical Arabic orthography compared to the earliertype of Judaeo-Arabic, it also adopts vernacular elements in varied degrees accord-ing to the writers’ability and their target audience.71Judaeo-Arabic literatureshows a wide range of styles with‘infinitely varied mixtures’of Classical Arabicand Middle Arabic, with Hebrew elements.72Due to the heterogeneous nature of69Qūt, vol. 2, p. 521.70Hidāja, p. 232 [Arabic].71 Cf. Khan,‘Judaeo-Arabic’,inEncyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics.72 Blau enumerates three main kinds:‘some kind of Classical Arabic with Middle Arabic admixture’,‘semi-Classical Middle Arabic’and‘some kind of“classicized”Middle Arabic’(The Emergenceand Linguistic Background of Judaeo-Arabic, London: OUP, 1965, p. 25). The extent of Hebrewelements varies, some of them exist in syntax and morphology (ibid., pp. 133–66). See also Hary,Multiglossia, Ch. 4; idem,Translating Religion, esp. pp. 29–41.TheQūtandal-Hidāya: a Muslim–Jewish dialogue?171"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Judaeo-Arabic, it has to be taken into consideration that Ibn Bāqūdāmight havemodified terms and sentences, if he ever indeed borrowed ideas from Muslimsources. The author also admits, as mentioned, that he does not have good com-mand of Arabic.73Consequently, there are limits to the extent to whichal-Hidāyacan be compared with any kind of other Arabic text at a linguistic level, and the bulkof comparison has to be done at the level of ideas. However, ideas are very difficultto track down, causing problems in establishing links between texts.The last difficulty lies in the shared heritage between Judaism and Islam, whichalso concerns the last question I posed at the beginning of this chapter: whatconclusions can we draw from this comparative study?Al-Hidāyaappears to bean integration of Sufism, philosophy and rabbinical teachings. It is not impossiblethat Ibn Bāqūdāconsulted theQūt, considering the contents of the book, a certainamount of resemblance between the two books and the social interaction betweenJews and Muslims in al-Andalus. However, those similarities could be a paralleldevelopment, having no direct connection. Due to the shared materials betweenJudaism and Islam, and common attitudes towards God as a relational participantof His created beings, it is likely that a similar conclusion will be drawn wheneverJewish or Muslim scholars encounter apparently parallel problems in theirrespective religions.Al-Makkīand Ibn Bāqūdāboth emphasise the omnipotence of God in reiteratingthe unavoidable fact that there exists a sphere which human comprehension cannotreach. By doing so, they widen, intentionally or not, the gap between God and Hiscreated beings.74They then employ the heart as a bridge between the physicalworld and the spiritual world, as well as the human sphere and the Divine sphere.This line of thought (which I would call‘devotional’but might be aptly describedas‘mysticism’, although it is arguable whether al-Makkīand Ibn Bāqūdāintendedto write a book on mysticism in particular) could stem from an ardent search for apious way of life in respective religions without having any direct influence. Thereligious image of the heart is also a common enough thought as we saw, and directcontact is not necessary.It is also true, however, that the shared heritage between the two religions makesit easy to be inspired by each other. The essential ideas ofal-Hidāyaand theQūtseem to contain nothing which could be considered to be incompatible with theother faith. Both works arefilled with citations of the Books, traditions andreligious authorities to support arguments. However, this does not rule out thepossibility that those arguments could be adopted by the other belief, since a changein the source of citations does not necessarily affect the overall ideas. If Ibn Bāqūdādid not have the immediate knowledge of al-Makkī’s work, it raises an intriguingquestion of why then many similarities exist in the two works. Dynamics betweenJewish and Islamic traditions in medieval Spain took place in a particular73Hidāja, p. 23 [Arabic].74 Arberry once described Sufism as‘the mystical movement of an uncompromising Monotheism’(Sufism (A), p. 12).172TheQūtandal-Hidāya: a Muslim–Jewish dialogue?"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"socio-political environment, but the nature of the two religions would also be animportant factor in facilitating the interaction between Jewish and Muslim scholars.When nothing is recognisably Jewish or Islamic, universalism of mystical andphilosophical thought seems to win over the particularism of the two religions.The present study could not establish a direct link betweenal-Hidāyaand theQūt;however, itfinds no evidence to rule out this possibility. It is important not to forcethe comparison, but it seems to be equally important not to avoid it. There are plentyof other themes to investigate among the two books. Possible links betweenal-Hidāyaand Kalām, al-Muʿtazilites, Muslim philosophers and other Arabic andSufisources will be the obvious points to start. I have examined the connectionsbetweenal-Hidāyaand theQūt, but the idea that these two in fact share a commonsource is also worth studying. In a broader context of Judaism and Sufism, Fentonmentions the significant influence of Sahl al-Tustarīon the later Kabbalistic idea ofnumerical values in words, and the impact of Abu’l-Ḥasan al-Shādhilīand IbnʿAṭāʾAllāh beyond Islam.75Here, we may recognise the direct and indirectinfluence of al-Makkīin Jewish tradition. Ibn Bāqūdāand his book have not beendiscussed exhaustively in Islamic studies and more analysis using Arabic andMuslim sources is awaited.Socio-linguistically, the consequences of the use of Judaeo-Arabic providesanother perspective toal-Hidāya. Judaeo-Arabic literature demonstrates complexphenomena, interlacing language with faith, tradition and politics. Consideringthis, the expression of the‘original Arabic text (Arabischer Urtext)’in the title ofYahuda’s edition may need to be revisited. This is not only because he used morethan one manuscript to reproduce the‘original’text and had to sometimes have twoversions of a passage. It is because the visual representation of the Judaeo-Arabictext had to be given up for the convenience of Arabic readers.I hasten to add that this is not to devalue Yahuda’s work by any means. This is topoint out the significance of the graphic function of a text. For instance, a certaineleventh-century trader demonstrates a curious mixture of Arabic and Judaeo-Arabic in his letters preserved in the Genizah collections.76In some cases, heseems to have switched to Arabic letters at the edge of the paper for the pragmaticreason that Arabic script takes up less space than Hebrew script. However, this doesnot explain all the examples. There seem to be more psychological aspects in theuse of the Hebrew script, for example showing intimacy to a fellow Jew. For furtherstudy ofal-Hidāya, although Ibn Bāqūdā’s handwritten text appears to be no longerextant, the sociological and linguistic importance of consulting the‘original’Judaeo-Arabic form cannot be overemphasised.75 Fenton,‘Judaism and Sufism’,inCompanion, pp. 204, 206.76 This is based on a talk by Wagner (Taylor-Schechter Genizah Research Unit, University ofCambridge),‘A matter of script? Arabic and Judaeo-Arabic in the Genizah collections’,attheIntertwined Worlds: The Judaeo-Islamic Traditionsymposium (11–13 Sep. 2011, University ofCambridge).TheQūtandal-Hidāya: a Muslim–Jewish dialogue?173"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"ConclusionQūt al-qulūbessentially concerns ethical issues. In this major writing, al-Makkīalmost attempts to codify the Qurʾān,Ḥadīth and sayings of worthy ancestors inorder to show a pious way of life. Piety and ethics may not be identical. However,religion often defines codes of behaviour, and in theQūt, pious conduct and ethicalaction seem to be treated in the same way. Piety does not require logical compre-hension of the mechanism of belief. In his work, al-Makkīencourages the reader toaccept the unavoidable fact that there exists a sphere which human ability cannotreach. He clearly divides Divinity from humanity, as his belief appears to be basedon the acknowledgement of the limit of man’s faculties.Al-Makkī, however, has complete faith in the enormous spiritual capacity of aparticular human organ, the heart. If employed properly, the heart will be a judgeand guide in this world and can be a bridge to the hereafter. One of the themes ofthe present study has been the universality of the religious image of the heart. As wehave seen, many cultures have attached a metaphorical role to the heart whosereligious images bear a striking resemblance regardless of time and space. Thishas been further confirmed by a comparative analysis of the religious teachings ofthe heart of al-Makkīand Ibn Bāqūdā. Crossing the border of faith and language, aunique aspect of the heart appears to lie in its symbolic ability of encompassingphysical and spiritual worlds, Divine and human spheres.This book has also explored the issue of the Sufi–Ḥanbalīrelationship. Contraryto the prevailing view ofḤanbalīhostility towards Sufism, an exploration of theintellectual reaction towards al-Makkīof fourḤanbalīscholars from differentperiods in different genres has demonstrated their diverse opinions of his work,from respect and total reliance to partial dependence and criticism. For example, thepresent study has unpacked the complexity of the treatment of al-Makkīby IbnTaymiyya, who has often been a reference point for the anti-SufiWahhābīmove-ment. The line between the historical Ibn Taymiyya and the perception of himamong later thinkers is never going to disappear. However, it is not necessary forme to reiterate the importance of a proper understanding of his thought by goingback to his original texts, rather than quoting second- or third-generation citationsout of context. The study of al-Makkīis thus relevant to the modern context and amore in-depth examination should shed a different light on the current politicalimage of Sufi–Ḥanbalīrelations."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"The present study has also evaluated a dynamic interaction between Judaism andIslam based on a comparative analysis between theQūtandal-Hidāya, which hasled to a further question of the way we study al-Makkīand mysticism in general. Ifwe are to assume that Ibn Bāqūdāwent to great pains to substitute Muslim sourceswith Jewish ones, the significant issue is less about the extent to which he did so andmore that he considered them of equal value. Ibn Bāqūdāseems to be able tofindappropriate Jewish sources in many cases, and so does Judah b. Tibbon. If materialsare already available, thought can be simultaneously developed, and influence canbe mutual.When Ibn Bāqūdāquotes a saying which seems to indicate his use of Islamictexts, Fenton sees his anxiety (see Chapter 8). It may have been the case. IbnBāqūdāmay not have been too comfortable in using Muslim sources openly.However, I rather see his confidence here, as Moses Maimonides stated in a prefaceto one of his writings:1Know that neither the teachings nor the explanations which I propound in thefollowing chapters are altogether original to me. They are thoughts gathered byme from the works of sages in the Midrash and the Talmud and from otherJewish writings; furthermore, from the utterances of philosophers of antiquityand our own days, and from the works of various and diverse authors.Iamwilling to learn from anybody and everybody. [Emphasis is mine.]These two authors’scholarly honesty seems to come from their confidence that alltheir arguments can be explained and supported fully by their own Jewish tradition.Without denying Islamic traces inal-Hidāya, it should be emphasised that one ofthe inspiring aspects that Ibn Bāqūdāmay have found in non-Jewish writings wasthe tools for constructing a convincing argument (methodology, argumentation,terminology), not necessarily only the contents.Bettan in his review criticises Yahuda for his‘grave error’in making‘such a boldassertion’of Ibn Bāqūdā’s complete reliance upon Arabic literature.2In terms ofYahuda’s motivation, further investigation is necessary to assess whetherthe demonstration of the total dependence ofal-Hidāyaon Arabic writing was thesole aim in the publication of his edition. Regardless of his objective, however, theidea of‘reliance’or‘borrowing’needs to be revisited. The high level of acculturationand assimilation has been recognised in the medieval world of Judaism and Islam.This phenomenon is particularly remarkable in mysticism, as esoteric ideas seem tobe somewhat easily transferred as philosophical and scientific knowledge. Thisreceptivity may stem from the essence of these ideas which, although expressed inthe vernacular, can go beyond localised tradition and beyond specific creeds, so thatfaith borders become secondary, while the contents become primary.1 This citation from Ch. 8 of thePirke Abothis from Hertz,Sermons, Addresses and Studies, vol. 3,p. 333.2 Bettan, review ofHidāja, pp. 305–6.Conclusion175"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Ibn Bāqūdā’s work reveals the development of the mystico-philosophical tradi-tion in Judaism and the quick spread of Sufism into the Iberian peninsula. This alsohelps us understand the context and phenomenon of Judaeo-Arabic literature inal-Andalus, and the intertwined relationship between Judaism and Islam. In readingtheQūtandal-Hidāya, it should be noted that both authors were publicfigures–they were both preachers and Ibn Bāqūdāwas a judge. Both deny an extreme formof asceticism, and their books pay attention to individual duties, as well ascollective ones. At the end of his article, Ilan poses the question whetheral-Hidāyashould be read as an ethical work or as Sufiliterature.3My answerwould be both. Ethics and mysticism overlap. As can be seen in the teachings ofConfucius and Daoism, individual spiritual exercise and human social behaviourare interconnected. The personal is social and political. This view is shared by boththeQūtandal-Hidāya. In essence they are devotional works, passionately callingfor the cultivation of a human relationship with the Divine, fellow humans, andeverything surrounding them.It is hoped that the present monograph has not only extended the study ofal-Makkībeyond Sufism, and beyond Islam, but that it will also lead to furtherexploration of a fuller range of opinions of the mystical way of life, piety andethics–in both the past and the present.3 Ilan,‘Al-iʿtidāl al-sharīʿi: another examination of the perception of asceticism inThe Duties of theHeartof Baḥya’,Revue des études juives164, nos. 3–4, Jul.–Dec. 2005, p. 461.176Conclusion"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Select bibliographyAbbreviationsBSOASBulletin of the School of Oriental and African StudiesBSOSBulletin of the School of Oriental StudiesICIslamic CultureISIslamic StudiesJAOSJournal of the American Oriental SocietyJQRThe Jewish Quarterly ReviewJRASJournal of the Royal Asiatic SocietyPrimary sourcesPrimary sources in the original languageʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī,AbūMuḥammad,Ghunya li-ṭālibīṭarīq al-ḥaqq, 2 vols in 1,Cairo: Maṭbaʿat MuḥammadʿAlīṢabīḥwa Awlāduh, 1288/1871–2.Abu’l-Fidāʾ, Ismāʿīlb.ʿAlī, al-Mukhtaṣar fīakhbār al-bashar, 4 vols in 2, Cairo:al-Maṭbaʿat al-Ḥusayniyya, n.d.AbūNuʿaym, Aḥmad b.ʿAbd Allāh,Ḥilyat al-awliyāʾwaṭabaqāt al-aṣfiyāʾ, 10 vols, Cairo:Maktabat al-Khānjī;Maṭbaʿat al-Saʿāda, 1932–8.al-Baghdādī,ʿAbd al-Qāhir,al-Farq bayn al-firaq, ed.
