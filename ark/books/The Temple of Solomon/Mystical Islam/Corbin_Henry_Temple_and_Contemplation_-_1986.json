Thus we understand why Corbin wished to link the themes of \"Temple\" and \"Contemplation\": the theory of visionary perception allows for the emergence of the Temple, but the processes of visionary knowing are themselves based on the eternal presence of the Imago Templi. The Author After long periods of research spent in Turkey, Syria, the Lebanon and Egypt, Henry Corbin from 1946 organized the Department of Iranology of the Franco-Iranian Institute in Tehran. There, he established and directed the \"Bibliotheque Iranienne\", an important collection of editions of original Persian and Arabic texts together with analytical studies. From 1954 until 1974 he held the position of \"directeur d'etudes\" at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, Sorbonne (Religious Studies), as the successor of Louis Massignon.

Henry Corbin himself had outlined the plan for this book, whose title suggests that these diverse studies converge on a common spiritual centre. The last three studies explicitly ask us to reflect on the role of the heavenly Temple, or the archetype ofthe Temple, in the spiritual traditions of the Religions of the Book No other work of Henry Corbin brings out more clearly the hermeneutic correspondences among spiritual visions belonging to those religions-religions which differ in their outward aspect, but whose inner dimension (the batin) reveals many comparable forms and structures. Thus it is that the \"astral\" religion of the Sabians, far from being a simple natural worship of the Heavens and their Spheres, is on the contrary one which sees in this universe the threshold beyond which there begins the world ofthe Angels; and the \"celestial temple ofthe mediating Angels\" must lead one beyond toward the invisible and unknowable God. The temple of the Imamate, for the lkhwan al-Safa ' and other Ismaili authors, likewise has this mediating function. Each Angel of the esoteric Heavens, each Prophet in the Cycles of metahistory, is like a buttress or wall of that Temple, with the Imam of the Resurrection crowning and completing that structure. But this \"spiritual form\" ofthe Temple is not simply the esoteric aspect ofthe Cosmos, any more than the Imam is a simple reality external to the heart of his true follower. The Temple becomes the inner form ofthe person, and \"the ritual celebrated by man in the temple ofhis being is his own metamorphosis, the bringing to birth ix"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"EDITORIAL NOTE within himself of that Form of himself which conforms to the angelic archetype\" (p. 169). This was how Hemy Corbin came to interpret the remarkable theosophy of the Temple created by the Shiite philosopher Qadi Said Qummi. There the Temple ofthe Kaaba is \"brought back\" to its invisible arche­types. It leads one back to a hierarchy of worlds and heterogeneous times, passing from the most dense to more and more subtle ones. For the \"House of God\" has an inner correspondence with the Throne of divine Unity, which is the pure noetic, intelligible Temple. Now if this Shiite hermeneutics is thereby able to ascend beyond the Temple visible to our physical eyes, which is only the crypt of the true Temple present in the Imaginal world, so it also makes possible a com­parative hermeneutics oflmages ofthe Temple. It is this same hermen­eutics, moving in an ascent from the sensible form to the world of the revealed Divinity, which permits andjustifies the correlations and corre­spondences among the different manifestations of a single and unique Imago Templi. In this last study, whose very scope demands our appreci­ation, Hemy Corbin brings out the intimate inner homology between Jewish mysticism (centered around the notion of the shekhinah), and Hel­lenistic Judaism, as well as the spirituality of Qumran and the Christian theology of the Temple. The two essays that open this collection might wrongly appear \"out of place\" in the perspective that has just been mentioned. Hemy Corbin gave them their place precisely to point out that Shiite hermeneutics necessarily leads to a theosophy ofthe Temple-just as the Temple itself has no meaning, if we do not have a method and ontology that can lead us there. The \"science of the Balance\" is in fact a general theory of ta 'wil, of spiritual exegesis, which interprets num hers and dimensi ons, and which makes possible the construction ofremarkable \"diagrams\" in which intel­ligible proportio ns become visible and imaginal forms descend into the visible world. For the function ofthis hermeneutics is not to set up mere abstract concepts in opposition to the sensible, material reality, but rather to make a visionary reality manifest to the eyes of the soul, as a visible re ality giving a subtle body to the theophanic reali ty.

They arrange those struc­tures according to a pure space in which they are no longer subject to the limitations of discourse, but are instead grasped all together as a single symbolic pleroma, the simultaneous manifestation ofthe Unknowable at the centre of the diagram. Without such a ta 'wil the spiritual theology of the Temple would be impossible. With it, the visible domain is no longer limited to the physical universe, and the intelligible world is not reduced to a few names and abstract ideas. Thanks to it, the world of the Soul and that of the Intelligences come to possess their own Earth, their own Heaven, time and space. Finally, just as the Imaginal world, being the pure space of symbols, lies beyond the sensible space of material bodies, so likewise colours lead beyond to their subtle being, to a supra-sensible light. \"Light is the Angel of colour\", as the spiritual Temple is the angelic form of the material Temple. Hence the Imaginal world is not simply made up of living numerical or geometric dimensions expressing the structures ofthe divine worlds; for those worlds are not without tone and colour. Since they raise the visible world up to their own level, thereby making themselves accessible to the eyes of the soul, so they too are adorned with spiritual colours. Now one can Understand why Henry Corbin wished to link \"Temple\" and \"Contemplation\" : the theory ofvisionary perception allows for the emergence of the Temple, but the processes of visionary knowing are themselves based on the eternal presence ofthe Imago Templi.

Several years ago, I myself was able to make a study of it, taking as my guide one of the greatest masters of Iranian spirituality : the fourteenth-century 'Alauddawlah Simnani. I was I was thereby led to the heart of a physiology of the subtle body, whose every ccnlre is both defined as a \"prophet of your being\", and characterized by a colour, an aura, visionary perception of which reveals to the mystic the degree of his advancement upon the spiritual Way.*1 There is, moreover, a long Hermetic tradition in Islam, whose testimony makes one ask what perception of colour and colour phenomena it was that enabled alchemists to interpret them in the way they did. Thus, with regard to both subtle physiology and alchemy, one is faced with a question which is essentially one of phenomenology: in what does the phenomenon of colour consist for our authors? How is one to understand correctly what they say about it, when their interpretation seeks to \"preserve its appear­ance\", that is, to explain it in accordance with what they perceive? * Translator's note: Where an English translation of a wcrk by Corbin exists, the reference is to this translation.

I was able to find such a treatise-ofrecent date, certainly, but this, far from detracting from its value, actually increased its scope. The work stems from a school oflranian Shiism, the Shaykhi school, derived from Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i (d. 1826), notable for its intention to preserve in its integrity the theosophical tradition of the Imams of Shiism. This treatise is the work of Shaykh Muhammad Karim-Khan Kirmani (d. 1870), who was second in succession to Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i and whose work, like that of other shaykhs of the same school, is evidence of a tremendous fertility, comprising as it does about three hundred titles. 2 Muh. Karim-Khan Kirmani was a kind ofuniversal genius whose interest extended to all branches of learning, like the masters of our own Renais­sance; and he was thereby led to write on scientific questions which he consistently envisaged from a theosophical point of view. His theory of colours has already given us occasion to speak ofhim as a sort oflranian Goethe, in the same way that the theory of our mystics concerning visions of coloured light led me to evoke the \"physiological colours\" of Goethe's F arbenlehre. 3 The treatise which I propose to analyse and briefly comment upon was written in Arabic in 1851, and was provoked by the question of a tiresome person whose indiscretion our shaykh does not hesitate to condemn. It was written very rapidly, in two days, and comprises about sixty pages. I have used a photocopy ofthe autograph manuscript. It is, to be sure, an occasional piece, but because ofthe author's extensive and intimate grasp of the subject, it is also remarkably concentrated. It is one of many unedited works, and is entitledRisalatal-yaqutatal-hamra', the \"Book ofthe red hyacinth\" (the allusion being to the precious stone ofthat name). We shall have more than one occasion to make it clear that the title was not chosen at random.4 It is divided into two books of more or less equal length. The first book, comprising eight chapters, deals with the concept and the reality of colour. Book II, which contains nine chapters, is concerned more particularly with the colour red, with its \"descent from 2 On the life and work of Muhammad Karim-Khan Kirmani, see En Isl am iran­ien ... , op. cit., IV, book VI (The Shaykhi School). 3 Cf Th e Man of Light ... , op. cit., pp. 139 ff. 4 On this treatise, see my report inAnnuaire of the Section des Sciences religieuses de l'Ecole pratique des Hautes-Etudes, 1972-1973."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS the world of archetypes\", and with a hermeneutics of this colour linked directly with the esoteric hermeneutics of the Koran. This last is particu­larly original, rich in presuppositions and conseq uences. In order to appreciate our author's point ofview-which he realizes is probably unique-we should take stock of the research that has been done into the theory of colour in Islamic philosophy. Let me say at once that this research is still very limited.5 Our assessment would lead us to consider the various theories proposed by Aristotle on the subject, as well as what was known about it by Islamic philosophers, notably by Farabi, Avicenna, Ibn al-Haytham, and so on. It would appear that the greatest advance was made by the philosopher Avempace (= Ibn Bajjah, twelfth century A.D.), who was perhaps the \"best leader\" of the Andalusian philo­sophical school. Because his optical doctrine contradicted generally ac­cepted ideas, it was examined at length by A verroes, who found it valde diff icilis, very difficult to understand in the terms put forward by Avem­l>;icc, for these went so far as to propose that colour exists here and now in potentia in darkness.6 But however interesting these studies may be-as are those of Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham), whose treatise, translated into Latin, had considerable influence in the West, as well as that of his commentator Kamaluddin Farsi (d. 1320 A.D.)-there is still a basic divergence, possibly an abyss, between the statements of these philosopher-opticians and those of a theosophist like Muh. Karim-Khan Kirmani. The latter was himself perfectly aware of this, and never misses an opportunity of showing how beside the point were the philosophers' speculations in this field. Before going further, we should specify th ree points fundamental to our shaykh's colour theory: .5 The best and most recent study of this questim is Helmut Galje's 'Zur Farbenlehre in der muslimischen Philosophic', inDer Islam, 43/3 Berlin 1967), pp. 2ID---J)l. The starling-point of this stuay is actually a reference in Goethe's F arbenlehre to the thlory of colour in Avempace and Averroes. 6 A vempace's theory regarding the relationship between light and colour marks a break with the thesis, commonly held, that the effect of light on a transparent medium can be produced only in so far as the latter is transparent in actuality. For Avempace, light is already a sort of colour (aliquis color); any effect produced by the colour on the transparent medium is equivalent precisely to the actualization of this transparency as such. If light is necessary fur the perception of colours, it is because colours already exist in potentia in the darkness, and because light actualises them in the sense that the colours then suscitate the transparent medium. a: H. Ga1je, op . cit., pp. 293 If On Avempace (Ibn Bajjah), cf my Histoire de Ia philosophic islamique, I, pp. 317 ff. A work by Avempace has recently been discovered which contains a chapter important for his theory of colours: Kitab al-Nafs (The Book of the Soul), ed. M. S.

It is important to make a clear distinction between the existence (wujud) and the manifestation (ZJirur) of colour. It was failure to make this distinction that nullified the labours ofthe philosophers. Colour may exist, yet not be manife sted One must therefore determine the relations hip be­tween light and colour. 2. This relationship cannot be established on the level merely of the physical conditions of ou r world. Although ou r author's attitude may appear to be one of rigorous, even extreme, Platonism, it is in fact nourished by the whole substance of Shiite theosophy. A verse of the Koran (15:21) is both its leitmotiv and its explanation: \"There are no things whose treasures (khaza'in) do not exist alongside Us. We make them descend only in determ ined proportions.\" For our author and his colleagues, the Koranic concept of \"treasures\" here signifies nothing less than archetypes. All the phenom ena of our terrestrial worl d, including the phenomenon of colour, are to be explained by a \"descent of archetypes\" from superior worlds. 3. As a corollary to this, the notion of \"composite\" {murakkab) applies to all levels ofthe universe, including those universes that are supra-sensible. Consequently, the phenom enon of colour extends equally to the totality of these universes, so that a hermeneutic of colo ur would employ not an abstract symbolism, but a symbolics founded on an integral spiritual realism. 1. On a concept ofc olour encompassing the totality of universes. In the course of the first two chapters of Book I of his treatise, our shaykh undertakes a critical examination of the views of the philosophers concerning the phenomenon of colour; we will note only his conclusions. According to him, that which makes up the essence and the reality of colour has eluded the most fam ous of the philosoph ers : these wise men have gone astray in their researches. Avicenna notably, in his Shifa� got no further than the idea-and this with much hesitation-that colour possesses a certain existence in potentia; but after a lengthy development of this idea, he confesses wearily that what constitutes the essence of colour is beyond his grasp. In a general sense our shaykh re jects the usual postulate of the philosophers: that in all cases where colour exists, it must be visible. To this physics, which conf uses the existence of colour with its manifes­tation, our shaykh opposes another physics based on the idea of \"subtle matter\", the latifa h, whose implicit link with Simnani's subtle physiolo gy"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS is easily discernible7 There is a subtle component, a latifa h, which dis­poses the nature of beings and objects into three categories. I. That in which the subtle component predominates. The object is then a source of light that is not only manifest and visible of itself, but in addition manifests and renders visible other objects by virtue of its intrinsic nature. 2. That in which the latifa h the subtle component, is equal with the other compo­nents. In this case, the object, although manifest and visible of itself, even in darkness, is powerless to manifest other objects and make them visible. By way of example he cites red light (one could no doubt think of cases of what we call phosphorescence). 3. That, finally, in which the latifa h the subtle component, is less predominant than the other components. In this instance, the object is not even visible of itself; it needs to be manifested by another object in which the latifa h, the subtle element, does predominate. According to our author, this last eventuality does not mean that bodies do not possess colour in themselves; it means that their colours, in order to manifest themselves-that is to say, in order to be not only illuminated but illuminating-have need of a light that will bring them to fulfilment. Yet fulfilment concerns the manifestation of the colours, not their actual existence; for colour is an integral part of the body's very nature. In other words, it is wrong to think, like certain philosophers, that a body as such is deprived of colour, because the fact of its being what it is presupposes a \"descent of archetypes\"; and part of this descent is the descent of the colour which is proper to the body in question. Its colour in this world is not merely the result of the conditions which prevail in this world, but corresponds to what it is here and now in other worlds that, ontologically speaking, precede this one; it simply happens not to be manifest in this world. So much is this the case that, in agreement with the Koranic verse (6:1), \"He has established Darkness and Light\", it must be said that Darkness is not purely and simply the absence of manifestation, for it entails a manifestation of its own-which is, precisely, its manifestation as Darkness. If colours are invisible to us in the Darkness, it is due to their 7 Cf the references in note I above. The modalities of each of these latifa hs confer their particular modes of the colours which in their turn cornnrunicate the modalities to the imaginative perception. Each latifah is an independent act of coloured light, which actualizes the imaginal transparent medium. For the theosopher, the realm of sm�ble perception, with which the philosopher-opticians are exclusively concerned, is only one realm among others, the level of which is determined precisely with reftrence to the gradations of latifahs which themselves determine the scale of the levels of being."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS weakness or the paucity of their subtle element, their latifa h; it is not due to a basic non-existence of colour (one could, on the other hand, recall the \"black light\" of certain subterranean caves). In the end, therefore, one may justifiably speak of a \"manifestation in potentia': but not of an \"existence in potentia'\"� for colour, even if invisible, is present here and now. We can see, then, what distinguishes our theos­ophical shaykh both from philosophers such as Farabi (for whom \"colours do not exist in themselves\", but are due to the action of the light-source on surfaces) and from all the philosopher-opticians who went so far as to admit that colour possesses a certain potentiality of existence8 \"All these great men\", he says, \"remained in a state of perplexity. They had no knowledge of the meaning and concept of colour. When they did write about it, it was in a conjectural fashion and without arriving at any definite conclusion.\" By contrast, here is a first premiss postulated by our shaykh, the importance of which is evident throughout the rest of the treatise: \"The truth is\", he says, \"that every composite possesses a colour in itself, whether that composite is one of the bodies manifest in time in this world {ajsam zahirah zamaniyah), or the subtle bodies of the imaginal world of the barzakh (the intermediary world, ajsam mithaliyah barzakhiyah), or the bodies of the sempiternal world of the Soul (the Malakut, ajsam dahriyah nafsaniyah), or is one of the composites of theJabarut (m urakkabatjabaruti­yah). The gradations of colour differ according to the differences of the composites: if the composite belongs to the subtle world (latij), the colour is likewise subtle� if it belongs to the world of density and opacity (kathij), the colour is likewise opaque.\" It is important to stress the originality and audacity of this premise, for they typify the position of the theosophist when compared with that of the philosopher: a. The banal dualism between spirit and flesh disappears. Along with 8 In contrast to Farabi, Ibn al -Haytham (AThazen) adopts an intermediate pos­ition: colour \"is born between the eye and the light\", and he concedes that it may possess real existence. In this connection his commentator, Kamaluddin Farsi (d. 720/1320), defines the relationship between light and colour, and makes colour conditional upon light, although conceding that colour possesses existence in potentia. a H. Gatje, op. cit., p. 300. For Muh. Karim-Khan Kirmani, however, the relationship between wuj ud and zuhur is not one between potential existence and actual existence. These are the hesitations of the philosopher-opticians to which he alludes in order to go beyond them. 6"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS the idea of a composite, the idea of the body is progressively sublimated until it comes to denote a body belonging to superior universes: there are the subtle bodies of the intermediary mundus imaginalis, perceived not by the senses but by the active Imagination; there are the subtle bodies of the world of Souls of the Malakut; there are even bodies belonging to the world of the Intelligences of the Jabarut. This world-structure conforms perfectly to that found in Mulla Sadra Shirazi, in whose writings the idea of the body is ultimately sublimated to that of a \"divine body\" (jism ilahi). The structure conforms equally to the physics and the metaphysics of the Resurrection to be found in Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i, from whom our author is spiritually descended, and in whose writings the differentiation between the two jasad and the two jism ultimately links up with the theory of the okhema (Gr.), the currus subtilis of the soul, of the Neoplatonist Proclus.9 b. This spiritualization of the idea of the body derives from a concept of taj arrud (a state separate from m a t t e r ) , which represents a break with the spirituality which the Islamic philosophers had inherited from the Greek philosophers. Yet it is thanks to this break that such a sublimation is possible. The concept of tqj arrud has always created diffi­culties for the strict theologians of Islam, for whom it can only actually refer to the creative Principle, not to any of the beings deriving from it. We arc thus presented with the paradox of a theosophist like Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i taking the side, against the theologian Majlisi, of those philos­ophers who do not attribute the tajarrud to any created thing.10 Even the cherubic Intelligences of the Jabarut are composed of a matter and a form, of an existence and a quiddity or essence: Light is their being, their \"matter\", and Mercy {Rahmah) is their dimension of shadow, their quid­dity. All beings, on whatever level, are composed of this Light and this Mercy. C. Thus, more than a theory is needed. We need a phenomenology of colours which will \"unveil\" (kashj) to us, at every level both sensible and 9.

Our shaykh could not find such a phenomenology either in Aristotle or in the philosophers whom Aristotle inspired. On account ofthis, the line he takes is an extension oftraditional Shiite theosophy. d. We can now divine the significance ofwhat we observed a moment ago. The phenomenon of colour is not limited to our sensible world. Indeed, in this world it simply betokens the archetypes that are here active. It is certainly in order to speak of the symbolism of colour; nevertheless, this must be understood not purely in terms of a language of signs, but in the sense that colours \"symbolize with each other\", in the same way as their state in this world symbolizes with their state in other, supra-sensible universes. Symbolism will here possess the quality of a visionary realism . In support of this realism, our shaykh adduces a group of Koranic verses (chapter II) of which the most important is the verse, quoted above, re ferring to \"treasures\" or \"archetypes\". All these verses are called upon to witness that colours are in fact objectively real: they are neither imaginary nor a purely subjective impression resulting from an admixture of the element of Air with the light-rays. Were the latter the case, the colours would belong not to the bodies but to the light-rays. In a way, the Koranic verses are called upon to witness against Newton.11 Finally, our shaykh refers to a long conversation between the sixth Imam , the Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (d. 765 A.D.) and his disciple andfamulus Mufaddal al-Ju'fi (chapter III). This conversation is really the equivalent of a treatise De sensu et sensato, that is to say a treatise on the faculty of sensible perception and its object. For each faculty there is a corresponding object, and vice versa. Between the two-between the sense and the sensible object-there are mediators, as, for example, the light which makes colour manifest. Our shaykh invites us to meditate on each ofthe terms used by the Imam Ja'far, who speaks of light as that which manifests colour, not that which produces it and makes it exist. It is not the object that needs complement­ing, but our visual faculty.

In short, colours exist in all the worlds; and in the face ofthis thesis the sum ofthe labours ofthe philosophers, as of the scholastic theologians of the Kalam (the Mutakalli­IIIIUI), is seen to be sadly negative. The fact is that they did not know how Id bridge the gap between the Illumination ofthe revealed Book and their own opinions (ash'arites, mu'tazilites, fa lasifah). Already Mulla Sadra Shirazi was maintaining that, of all the schools of Islamic thought, only the Shiites had succeeded in bridging this gap. For by following the teaching oftheir Imams which unveiled the esoteric and the exoteric, the hidden interior and the visible exterior, they had learned to understand, to \"save the phenomena\". The phenomenon in this case is that of colour; and to preserve it in all its integrity, philosophy is not enough. What is needed is a divine wisdom, a theosophia. 2. On the true relationship between light and colour. Light and colour ar e diff erent things, light being the cause not of the existence but of the manifestation of colour, and colour being manifested on all levels of the universes, sensible as well as supra-sensible. How, then, should one under­Nllld the true relationship between them? The answer to this question is given in a second proposition put forward by our author, and he leads us towards it by deploying his theory of archetypes and of their mode of action. He begins by stating (chapter IV) that certain bodies whose composition is qualitatively different can display the same colour; the colour may become more or less intense, but it remains this particular colour. Thus, Colour is not something produced in the way the philosophers say it is. According to them, if the qualitative modality (kayfiyah) of one body were Contrary to that of another, its colour would likewise have to be contrary to that ofthe other. This, however, is not the case. Let each of us, he says, 9"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"have recourse to his own Innate Intelligence (fitrah), and reject the ready­made opinions which he hears being formulated around him. He will at once discover that the object of his vision or contemplation requires two things: first, a light which is the product of a light-source, and second, a colour which belongs essentially to the qualitative modality of the object in question. Anyone who doubts the differentiation between these two things and declares that where there is no light, colour itself does not exist, is like a man who says that if no -one looks at the sky, the sky does not exist, or that if no-one looks at the shadow of a person in the sun, the shadow quite simply does not exist. Similarly, one would be correct in saying that brightness is something which happens to a colour and makes it bright; one might even pay more attention to the brightness than to the colour, or vice versa. But the fact remains that even ifbrightness manifests colour, it does not cause it to exist (inna'l-bariq yuzhim'l-lawn wa-la yujiduh). This being said, our shaykh formulates five premisses which every investigator should take to heart (chapter V). i. There is a difference between the mode of being of the archetype which produces the signature (the mu'aththir, vestigium; cf the notion of signatura in Paracelsus), and the signature that it imprints (athar, mu'athlhar). The world above is exempt from the limitations that condition the world below (hudud al-ddni). The archetype remains \"henadic\" (ahadi) in the sense that this technical term possesses in Proclus. It is the Unific, the Unificient, of all that is unique; it is not itself a unity constituted among other unities, that is to say, a signature among the signatures which its archetypal activity constitutes into so many unities. It is the first and last explanation because it is not itself explicable by any other thing; and it is more epiphanic than all its epiphanies. Such is the meaning of the invo­cation attributed to the third Imam, the Imam Husayn ibn 'Ali: \"Could there be another than You in possession of an epiphany which you did not possess, so that this Other would be that-which-manifests-you when you were hidden; or could you have need of a pointer to indicate You, so that the signatures provided the means ofapproaching You?\" No indeed; the light that enables one to see is the sufficient cause ofthe light which is seen, precisely because it makes the latter visible, not the other way round. It is the colour's archetype which is its principle, not vice versa. The archetype manifests itself in the signature, and the concept of this latter is the manifested archetype. This, again, is suggested by the mystical invocation: 10"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"\"No light is visible in things except Your light; no sound is perceptible in tilings except Your sound.\" a. Our author refers to a parallelism as familiar in Islamic theosophy as in our Western theosophical traditions (notably that ofParacelsus and his disciples): the parallelism between the Liber mundi and the Liber revelatus, between the great Book of the world and the Book of sacred revelation. Indeed, the fundamental phenomenon is the same for all prophetic re­ligions, and hence for all prophetic philosophies: it is the \"phenomenon of the Book of sacred revelation\". As the two books are simply two versions of the same book, it is possible to apply to both of them the same hermeneutics {ta 'wil): in the end we shall see, with some astonishment, the colour red undergo an esoteric hermeneutic whose phases reproduce exactly the phases of the esoteric hermeneutics of the Koran. Neverthe­less, even here our shaykh asks us to consider a difference between the epiphany of being, or ontological epiphany (zuhur kawni), and scriptural epiphany (zuhur shar'i)-between, that is to say, the phenomenon ofbeing and that of the sacred Book. This difference derives from the fact that primary Manifestation, which is the manifestation of being, does not possess an opposite, for non-being is pure negativity; non-being is not merely the opposite ofbeing, otherwise both being and non-being would have to be included within a genus common to both ofthem. Thus, the manifestation ofbeing is so all-inclusive that, as we observed a short while back, it embraces both Light and Darkness simultaneously: the phenom­enon of being manifests both apparition and occultation, visibility and invisibility. It is the total signature, the signature without absence. As for the phenomenon ofthe sacred Book, which is as it were a signature begotten on a signature (the phenomenon ofthe Book begotten on that ofbeing), it consists ofthe manifestation ofwhat is exoteric, but at the same time it is the occultation of what is esoteric, an esoteric which, as such, remains hidden. We are no longer dealing with an all-inclusive manifestation without absence, as in the case ofthe primary manifestation ofbeing; we are dealing with a manifestation which includes an absence, because beneath the revealed appearance (the exoteric) lies the sense which remains con­cealed (the esoteric), and because you start off by being absent from this esoteric, just as it remains absent from you. In other words, the phenom­enon of being reveals to us both apparition and occultation: it renders them present to us. The phenomenon ofthe Book reveals occultation to us 11"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS as an absence, a veiling. How, then, is one to go beyond this absence, to cross the threshold of the esoteric? 3. The investigator should now have his attention drawn to a third point: the conditions ofManifestation a parte subjecti. For there may exist between you and other things a screen which is none other than yourself, your own body; or there may be an obstacle emanating :from the thing itself In the first ofthese cases, your cognizant soul is immured within the secrecy of your body, which constitutes a screen between your soul and sounds, scents and colours. The soul's gates must be opened to these things. Yet is it simply a question ofthe faculties of sense? For to which things, ultimately, should the soul's gates be opened? 4. They should be opened to precisely those things which you cannot perceive until the obstacle that prevents you :from doing so is removed (conditions of Manifestation a parte objecti). At this point, our shaykh refers once again to his theory of the latifah or subtle components, whose dis­posal of things into three categories we have already glanced at. Now it is the subtle component, the latifah, which is the actual signature, the signa­ture of the henadic archetype. If this subtle component predominates in an object, or at any rate is equal to the other components of that object, then there occurs that manifestation or epiphany (zuhur) which is actually the expansion, the unfolding (inbisat) of the Image-archetype (al-mithal al­a'la), the superior Imago projected into the self-ness (huwiyah) 'or individu­ality which is its receptacle. We shall see later how this Imago is the personal lord (rabb) of a being, and in what way it is decisive for the phenomenon of colour. Thus, all obstacles must be simultaneously re­moved from both object and subject in order for \"absence to withdraw\". This is why it is notjust any sound that can be heard, or any colour that can be seen, and so on. Our physics would express this in terms ofwaves and vibrations; our shaykh, with his purely qualitative physics, speaks of the latifah, the subtle element in a being or a thing. The degree to which the latifah is present does not depend on the physical conditions; rather, it is the latifah which determines the state of these conditions, and is itself the work, the signatura or vestigium of the archetype. 5. This introduces the fifth premiss that the investigator must take to heart. Either the latifah is too weak and the object remains occulted, absent, so long as this latifah is not strengthened; or else the latifah, the subtle 12"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS aspect of a thing, is sufficiently strong in itself, and occultation ceases without anything else being required. The application of these five fundamental premisses has still to be demonstrated, and this is done by showing us the archetype in action­that is to say, the activity ofthe world above as it imprints its signatures on the world below. What is colour? It is a qualitative modality which comprises, among other things (min sha'ni-ha), the capacity of being made manifest to sight. The application of the five principles noted above enables us to ailmn that an object is manifest only in so far as the superior agent produces its own signature in that object (al-'ali al-mu'aththir). Only the activity ofthe archetype repulses the absence accompanying the mani­festation of which we spoke above in relation to the phenomenon of the Book, and which applies equally in the case of the phenomenon of colour. for the veil to be lifted, the absence to withdraw, and for what had been de-occulted to be de-occulted, the latifah needs to be intensified, elevated, kindled; and this is brought about by the same superior agent that imprints the signature. Such intensification of the latifah consists so en­incly in the withdrawal ofthe absence that our author explains it in terms of the remoteness of the archetype being succeeded by its greater proximity. In every case, and in whatever situation they occur, it is the archetypal principle that nourishes and substantiates its signatures, that is to say, the multiple lights-whether these are manifested to the fleshly eyes ofterres­trial beings or to the imaginal eyes of the intermediary world of the barzakh, to the pure gaze of the Souls of the Malakut or to the Intelligences of the Jabarut All is due to the superabundancy of the Manifestation of the archetype or superior agent, which produces its signatures in the mirrors constituted by the receptivities of beings and objects in their various statess. This is true for the phenomenon of colour in so far as colour is in the position ofbeing manifested to sight. When closest to its Principle, it is at its most manifest, and is given the name of light and brilliance (daw�. When, on the other hand, it is furthest away from its Principle, it certainly exists, but in a non-manifest state: it is occulted, as the esoteric sense of the Book is occulted in the phenomenon of the sacred Book It is this that permits us to define the true relationship between light and colour, which our shaykh does in advancing a second proposition that he formulates in two"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"ways, both of them equally representative of the Spirit of Shiite theosophy. 1. Light is the subtle aspect of colour (latif al lawn) or colour in its subtle state. It is, eo ipso, the strong aspect of colour (q awiv al-lawn) or colour in its strong state, whereas colour is light in an opaque (kathif} state, thicker and more dense. Needless to say, both light and colour proceed from the same genu s, otherwise there could be no interaction between them: light would not be able to receive the \"tincture\" of colour {sibgh, tinctura in the alchemical sense) any more than it is able to assu me the \"tincture\" ofscent; and correspondingly colour would not be capable of reinforcement by light. In point of fact, light contains the hidden secret of colour; but unless two things are in the same \"field\", one cannot act on the other. A mediating element is needed between sight and the object of vision; and it is the idea ofthis mediating element that brings the author to the second way of formulating his proposition. He announces it with a warning: \"Firmly grasp what I tell you, for it is extremely subtle. Study it thoroughly in order to perceive its truth. Divine exception apart, no other philosopher or wise man will have opened your eyes to what I say here.\" 2. \"Light\", says our shaykh, \"is the sp irituality [the spiritual element or angel] of colour (mhdniyat al-lawn), that is to say, colour in the spiritual state or sp iritualized {lawn mutarawwah), while colour is the corporeity (t he corporeal element or jasadaniyah) of light, that is to say, light in a material­ized state (daw' mutajassad). \" We must remember here that the notion of \"body\" is not limited to the notion ofthe physical body ofthis world. The shaykh continues: \"Both light and colour are two things from the point of view ofthe individual and the sp ecies, but a si ngle thing from the point of view of genus (fins). Analogous to their relationship is that of spirit and body, for spirit and body are two things according to one point ofview, but one and the same according to another.\" (Our alchemists, of whom the shaykh was one, speak ofthe spirit as \"light in fusion\", and ofthe body as \"light solidified\".) Nothing could be clearer: spirit and body, light and colour, are distinct yet inseparable one from the other, the one being manifested by the other. Light is mediated by colour, and vice versa; and it is thus mediated that they enter our field of vision. Later on we will see this relationship expressed as the relationship between rabb and marbub: lord and vassal imply and me diate each other. That is why Mu h. Karim-Khan Kirmani rejects any hypothe sis put forward by the philosophers conducive to the idea of a pure light that is 14"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS without colour. \"All light is manifested colour, whether it be the brilliance of celestial luminaries or that of fire. Where would you look for the idea of a light to illumine crystal, without that li ght being itself a colour?\" Whether one speaks of the whitene ss of moonlight or the yellow of sun­light, lamplight and firelight, a certain colour is always involved; and it is this that causes the hue in a sapphire-coloured garment to vary according to whether one looks at it by daylight or lamplight (it turns from blue to green, like the enamelled cupolas ofthe mosques oflsfahan). Hence there can no more be li ght without a colour than there can be spirit ma ni fested without a body either physical, or subtle and spiritual. Light, without any doubt, is closer to the Principle. And here the author uses the term hikayah, a term loaded with meaning and connoting both a story and an imitation­which is the case with the parable, the cryptography of all my stical narrations. Light is the supreme hikayah ofthe Principle, whereas colour is further removed from it. Here again, proximity to and distance from the archetype are invoked in order to explain the gradation of colours. With­out light, colour is certainly there, but it is inert and inan imate, like a body without its spirit. The author puts forward a comparison: the Sky (the subtle ma ss of the Sphere animated by the Anima caelestis) is a body, as the Earth is a body. Nevertheless, the Sky, because of the proximity of the Principle, is alive, mobile and conscious, while the Earth, because of its remoteness from the Principle, is inanimate, immobile and unconscious. In the same way, the closer a colour is to the Principle, the more it is manifest unaided, like the blue of Saturn, the white of Jupiter, the red of Mars, the yellow of the Sun, and so on. When it is remote from the Pr inciple it needs to be assisted by an excess of light falling on it, just as the Earth, in order to live, needs the celes tial vital sp irit (ruh hayawdniyah falakiyah). 3. How every composite, whether it belongs to the sensible or to the supra-sensible world, has a colour. Now that he has given us an explanatio n of colours in terms of the activity (proximity or distance) of their respective archetypes, and has defined the relationship between light and colour as a relationship between spirit and body, our author can proceed to his original purpose: the elaboration of a phenomenology and thence of a hermeneutics of colour which accounts for and \"preserves the phenomenon\" of colour at all levels of the entire hierarchy of worlds."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS We have seen the importance of the concept of the signature (athw, vestigium). We must now analyse this concept; and this analysis will lead us to a third proposition: a signature acquires reality only when it occurs in terms of one of the four possible modalities. The author arrives at this proposition by means of a physics of the Elements which appears to be peculiar to himself It should be noted that the principle which allows our shaykh to deduce the four elementary qualities-that is to say, the quadruple modality under which a signature may occur (chapter VI)-should be dependent on a metaphysica l consideration: the movement whereby a signature severs itselffrom the action ofthat which gives it existence. Now, the very idea ofmovement implies the idea ofthe production ofheat and dryness. One can thus consider the signature in relation to the movement which gives it existence, in which case the qualitative modality is that of hot and dry. Or one can consider it in itself, in its dimension ofpassivity with regard to the active agent, in which case the qualitative modality is that ojcold and dry. Because heat and dryness are contiguous to the superior dimen­sion which is the active agent, they move of their own accord in an upwwds direction, whereas cold and dryness move of th eir own accord downwards. Our shaykh clearly means to distinguish himself from the classical physicists who have discussed the Elements and the elemental qualities. He refuses to see the first two elemental qualities as unite d in the idea of a dryness that is common to both of them. The dryness of the element of Fire, which dryness is by nature fiery, is totally different from the dryness of the element ofEarth, which dryness is by nature earthly. Fiery nature, which is hot and dry, is characterized by an extreme suppleness and an unre­stricted tendency to assume all forms; earthly nature, which is cold and dry, is characterized by a hostility towards new forms, by a resistance to metamorphoses (\"Fire is seventy thousand times more supple than Earth, seven hundred times quicker than Water to assume a form\"). Classical physics concerning the Elements considered the humid modality as the most apt to acquire and conserve form. If; therefore, Fire is now said to possess this aptitude pw excellence, we must invert classical physics and declare Fire to be humidity (fa 'l-nw rathah), which is precisely the paradox that the alchemists opposed to the logic ofperipatetic physics. Moreover, a Koranic verse (21 :30) says: \"We made all living things by means of Water\", and certain hadith state that \"Water is the first thing that God 16"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS created\". Now, as we have just seen, Fire is the first thing (hot and dry) that emerges at the initial stage, when the signature separates frcm the archetype. Consequently, if one considers it frcm the point of view of its flexibility and subtlety, its promptness to assume fmn (the metamorphoses of its flames), and the fact that it is the principle and the life of all living things, one might say that Fire is Water. If one considers it with reference to the fact that it is the first to emanate from the movement which imparts existence, it is Fire. (Fire is humidity, Fire is Water: these are paradoxes familiar to the alchemists.) Thus, we have two opposite terms: hot and dry here correspond to the masculine, cold and dry to the feminine. But by means ofwhat mediating dialectic may we proceed from one to the other, uniting the two so as to produce a cpnte17'1¢y? At this point, like a true alchemist, our author resorts to the hermeneutic of a Koranic verse which transfers to the physics ofthe Elements a disposition made by the Prophet with regard to conj ugal matters. The verse in question is 4:35, and it prescribes that in the case of a possible disagreement between husband and wife, two arbiters should be chosen, one from the family of the husband and one frcm that of the wife. This is precis ely what happens in the physics ofthe Elements. The arbiter chosen from the husband's side (Fire, hot and dry) will be what is hot and humid (Air); the arbiter chosen from the side ofthe wife (Earth, cold and dry) will be what is cold and humid (Water). The reconciliatory quality ofwhat is hot and humid and what is cold and humid is here quite obvious.12 When husband and wife are reconciled, there is stability and perfect equilibrium. Earth, which is feminine, prevents Fire, which is masculine, from ascending, because Earth is suspended from Fire. Fire, which is masculine, prevents Earth, the feminine, from descending, be­cause Fire is suspended frcm Earth. The result is the perfect nuptial union of Fire and Earth. {dry (Fire) ><humid (\\'v'atl'r) } hot cold humid (Air) dry (Earth) SPONSUS SPONSA It is interesting to note here how far our shaykh takes this nuptial imagery. What happens in the case ofFire (the husband) and Earth (the [2 The diagram below is intended to illustrate lhis m:re clearly. 17"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS wife) is the same as what happens in the case ofthe love between Zayd and Zaynab. In both cases we have a pair. For the pair to be perfect, the two partners who constitute it must become fo ur. Zayd is not in fact one of the partners in a couple until his isolated state is shattered, and until the shadow of Zaynab has fallen upon him and he is in the shadow of Zaynab. The same is true ofZaynab, until the shadow ofZayd falls on her. What makes two partners not simply two isolated terms but two partners of a couple is precisely the aspect that is added to each of them, the event which doubles each ofthem, as was the case with both Zayd and Zaynab. It is in this way that the two terms, in forming a pair, become four, since the being of each as it is for the other is added to the being of each as it is in and for itself. Here Muh. Karim-Khan Kirmani offers us a kind of intuition which anticipates the idea of quaternity as it is expounded by C. G. J ung. Fire is Zayd; in order for him to form a pair with the Earth­Zaynab, the element Air must mediate. Earth is Zaynab; to form a pair with the Fire-Zayd, the element Water must mediate. In each case, the mediator doubles the partner by adding to him or her an existence which is his or her existence/ or the other. As Water corresponds to the sp ousality of Zaynab, so Air corresponds to the sp ousality ofZayd. One could thus say that the element Air is in some way the Animus ofZaynab or the element Earth, while Water is the Anima of Zayd or the element Fire. Without pushing these instructive analogies any further, we can con­clude that our shaykh has now completed the analysis which will allow him to put forward his third proposition: that a signature, whatever it may be, only acquires reality thanks to the four qualitative modalities known in current physics as Fire, Air, Water and Earth, in order oftheir increasing distance from the Principle. One might say that these four elemental modalities with their respective colours are the hikayah, the imitation, the history, the parable, ofthe archetypal world. But on the level ofEarth, the remoteness is so great that the superior world only manifests itself to Earth by veiling itself in it. It is this that enables our shaykh to say: 11 The degrees oflight are three in number, whereas the degree of darkness is unique. Hence, the sources oflight are three, while the sources of colour are four. 11 It must be noted that the source of colour is by no means reduced to the action of Darkness conquering light. Because the sources of colour are four, they include also those of light. The four sources correspond to the modalities described 18"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS above; and it is the intervention of the terrestrial element that alone is responsible for the visibility of colour in this world, since, without the element Earth, the colours of the other three elements remain invisible to us . That is why the shaykh vigorously denies the opinion of the philos­ophers for whom the scale of colours is situated in the interval contained between white and black. This is not the case at all . The shaykh enumer­ates the stages of greyness and dullness whereby one proceeds from white to black: they have nothing to do with the phenomenon of colour. Colours, therefore, must have other sources. The theme will be taken up again in connection with the four pillars of coloured light which support the cosmic Throne of Mercy. For the moment, the author confines himselfto naming them: the primordial sources of colours in our world are white, yellow, red and black. We have made considerable progress. We now know that the phenom­enon of colour is due to the activity of the world above, to the activity of the archetypes. We have seen how the range of colours is determined by the four modalities which are designated as the four Elements. A further step will establish this more specifically by showing us how, contrary to what was held by ordinary physics to be the case, all transparent bodies­for example, the Elements in their simple state-possess light and colour; but that this colour, while existing, is invisible to our fleshly eyes as long as these bodies do not become dense. As for the colour that is manifested at the level of the sensible world, it corresponds to the colour already pos­sessed by these bodies at the supra-sensible level. The totality of modes of perception actually revolves around three axes (chapter VII). a) There is perception by penetration and impression. Unfortunately, the forms of the world above arc not such that they can imprint themselves on the organs of the lower world-that is, the appar­atus of the sensible faculties. b) There is perception by embodiment ihatah); such is the perception that can be had of the imprinted signature ry that which imprints it, but not vice versa, c) There can be perception by unitive union (ittihad); such is the perception that a being has of itself. But the world above is not \"itself the world below; thus, perception of the world above by the world below is not possible except by means of a manifestation {zuhur) of the former, that is to say, by means of a theo­phany or hierophany. In this way, we are led to conceive of a perception of colour deriving from a perception which is theophanic or hierophanic."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE REA LISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS Nothing, however, is perceptible to our vision unless it has acquired the tinctura ofEarth. The celestial Spheres, for example, are transparent, and that is why they are invisible. If the stars set in the Spheres are visible to us, it is because they are a sort of condensation of sidereal matter, in the same way that water becomes visible to us when it turns foamy. Equally, the trans­parency of Fire, Air and Water in their elemental state makes them invisible to us, and the same applies even to Earth in the case of glass and crystal. Our shaykh is thus able to formulate a fourth proposition : \"So long as these tran sparent and diaphanous {shaffa h shqfij} bodies remain in their subtle (Latif} state, their colours and lights arc not perceptible to our senses, for they too are in a subtle state. But this docs not in the least mean that they do not possess colour and light. How could this be the case, when it is precisely light and colour which are the manifestation of the world above in the world below, and when the closer a thing is to the Principle, the more intense is its manifestation and its light, and the more vigorous its colour? This is why light and colour in tr ansparent bodies are more intense and vigorous [than in opaque bodies]. Nevertheless, the force and intensity oftheir colour are not perceptible to our sight. But lack of visibility is not due to the fact that light and colour do not exist; it is due rather to the proximity ofthe Principle.\" We had been told from the start that we must distinguish between the existence of colour and its manifes­tation; we now learn that the invisibility of colour may be due not to its absence or to its obscuration but, on the contrary, to its extreme intensity. The same is true of all reality which is subtle and transparent; and, as we have already noted, it is here that the theosopher's perception differs from everything that the philosopher-optician could envisage. To follow this up is to go beyond the banal proposition current among the philosophers: that it is light which makes colour manifest itself Hence­forth we must recognize two things: firstly, that it is colour which makes light manifest itself, for it is by means of colour that light becomes vi sible, in the same way as the spirit is made manifest by the body; and secondly, that the relation between light and colour is the same as that between spirit and body. In a formula reminiscent of Suhravardi's Ishraq, the shaykh specifies: \"Light is the Orient made visible (al-mashriq al-mar'iy), it is the manifestation of the Principle (the theophany) tinctured by something which possesses density and which is therefore the cause of its visi bility.\" 20"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS The shaykh has already outlined the gradations of this visibility: that of red light, ofyellow light, and ofwhite light. \"In short,\" he concludes, \"so long as the transparent body stays transparent, it may possess a light and a colour, but both are invisible to us. It is the earthly tinctura that accords it a form of manifestation (m azhar) accessible to us.\" The shaykh cites by way of example the case of gold and silver in their molten state, glass, crystal, and so on. A further step has to be taken (chapter VIII) in order to consolidate what has been indicated from the start. If even a transparent body has a light and a colour, then all composites, all bodies, whether ofthe sensible or ofthe supra-sensible world, must also possess a light and a colour. Here the theosopher enters a field of exploration in which the philosophers, the fa lasifa h, were unable to find their way. What is more, our shaykh's manner of proceeding here assumes a remarkable character, for his phenomenology of colour links up with the highest mystical speculations of an Ibn 'Arabi. He is no longer concerned with the signature as presenting the quadruple, qualitative modality previously analysed. He is concerned with it as a structure composed of two \"dimensions\" or aspects (jihat):one dimension \"from the side of its Lord\" (its rabb), and one dimension \"from its own side\", or in other words a divine and lordly dimension or condition (rububiyah), and a human dimension or condition, as the vessel ofits divine lord (marbubiyah). It is this relationship which, as we have just seen, puts light and colour in a position that permits each to be mediated and manifested by the other. Thus what is in question is the pair or the bi-unity of rabb and marbub; and the idea of bi-unity is of fundamental importance in the mystical doctrine oflbn 'Arabi. The lord who is the rabb is not the hidden unknow­able deity, the Absconditum, not the terrifying, transcendent and all-power­ful God. He is the God created in faith and revealed in the love of each being; between this lord and the being to whom he reveals himself as such, a solidarity is established which renders them interdependent in the manner oflord and vassal, companions in destiny who cannot do without each other. From now on, the relationship between this personal God and his faithful vassal is a chivalric one. Ibn 'Arabi expressed this bond admirably and often, saying for ex­ample: \"lfhe has given us life and existence through his being, I, too, give him life through knowing him in my heart. \" This same! reciprocity of roles"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS is expressed, no less admirably, by one of our own Western mystics, Angelus Silesius, when he says: \"Gild does not live without me; I know that God cannot for one moment live without me. If I become nothing, he too must give up his life. \"13 It is an extraordinary intuition, one that tells us that God's every death is necessarily preceded toy the death ofman; but it is equally extraordinary that the phenomenology of colour should here take us to the heart ofthe soli darity which makes the divine lord and his earthly knight, the rabb and the marbub, responsible foc each other, pre­cisely because light and colour arc in a similar relationship to one another. Our shaykh explains this as follows. The signature's lordly dimension­elsewhere called the imperishable Fa ce or inner Imam of a being (the theme will reapp ear at the end of this study)-is precisely the Image­archetype, the Imago which, as we were told earlier, is the signature projected into the concrete individuality that is its receptacle. This Imago is the dimension of the signature which is \"towards its lord\", its \"lordly dimension\"--that is to say, the manifestation ofthis lord by means ofthe Imago to the concrete individual, and by the individual to others. Its \"dimension towards itself-human and vassal-is that ofits occultation, for it is only manifested through its lord (as in the invocation quoted above: \"Could another than You possess a manifestation which was not Yours?\"). What does this mutual solidarity have to do, ultimately, with the phenomenon of colour? Briefly, in the absence of light, colour would not be manifested but would remain in an inert state, like a corpse. But the process works both ways; for, as we have seen, without colour light would not be manifest to us precisely because of the excessive intensity of its manifestation. In the same way the marbub, the vassal or knight, is main­tained in being by his rabb or feudal lord; yet the latter would be unknown and invisible without his vassal, because his lordly condition would not be manifested, as the spirit would not be manifested without the body, or light without colour. The consequences ofthis are far-reaching: the world of colours, according to this analysis, is part and parcel ofan entire service of mystical chivalry, of which the rabb-ma:rbub relationship is the type par excellence. We will see an example ofthis shortly. Our shay kh explains himself here by means of a diagram that is to be 13 Cf my book, Creative Imagination in the Sufism oflbn 'Ambi, trans. Ralph Manheim (Bollingcn Series XCI, Princeton University Press, 1969), p. 129. 22"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS fotmd in another of his books-significantly enough, one analogous to it figures among the diagrams in a work by Robert Fludd, the great seven­teenth-century English doctor and alchemist, who was also a Rosicrucian.14 The relationship between rabb and marbub, between lord and knight, light and colour, can be illustrated by two interpenetrating spheres or more clearly still, in the world of surfaces, by two interpenetrating triangles. Triangle of the rabb rriangle of thr Marbiib The base of the triangle which represents the lordly dimension (indi­cated here by the dotted line) is above, close to the Princip le, while the tip of its cone touches the base of the triangle which represents the human dimension, the lord 's vassal. Conversely, the base ofthe triangle which represents the human dimension (indicated by the continuous line in the diagram) is at the extreme lower limit, while the tip ofits cone touches, above, the base of the divine dimension oflordship. Our shaykh explains, in his tum, what is already to be found in Ibn 'Arabi: the Manifestation (qiyam al-zuhur) ofthe divine or lordly dimension subsists by virtue ofthe dimension ofthe soul, or human dimension, for the rabb would not be manifested without the marbub, nor light without colour. Equally, the reality (qiyam al-tahaqquq) ofthe human dimension owes its subsistence to the divine dimension. Without the human dimen­sion, the divine dimension would not be manifested, but without the divine lordly dimension the human dimension would be deprived of reality, as colour without light would remain in the inert state of a body deprived oflife. Such is the whole secret ofthe Imago at the heart of man, the sole reality that man may meaningfully invoke as \"My God\", and towards whom (fer that very reason) he is capable ofsupreme devotion. 14 On this di agram, which appears in another of our shar,kh's works, see my Sp iritual Body and Celestial Earth ... , op. cit, p p. 228-229 ( n• \"triangle of light and the triangle of darkness\") See also Serge Hut in, Roeert Fludd (1574-1637) a/chimiste el philosophe rosicmcien (Paris, \"Omnium Litteraire\", 1 'J72), pl.

I desired to be known; that is why I created creatures\"-that is, creatural limits, so that I might manifest myselfto and by these very limits. This is to say that God only manifests himselfto created beings by means of these created beings themselves . The parallel is not a difficult one to follow. Light, because of its intensity, would remain invisible if it did not receive the tinctura of colours. The divine Treasure would likewise remain con­cealed-not by darkness, but by its excessive light. This light must take on the tincture of created beings, must limit its intensity, if it is to become visible. This is the \"theophany within limits\" (a l-tajalli .fi'l-hudud), the secret of the Imago and hence of the Gnostic profession of faith: Eum talem vidi qualem capere potui (I saw him according to my capacity to perceive, him). In order to obtain a complete phenomenology of colour, it only remains to consider its modalities through all the levels of the hidden Treasure's ladder of theophanies. The limits of this ladder belong to the \"human dimension\", their sources being six in num her: time, space, situs, rank, quantity and quality. They also go by the name of \"the six days of Creation\", that is to say, the six limits constitutive of created beings. Among these limits are those which derive from the four qualitative modalities that we analysed earlier. For the creatural dimension of the signature, the qualitative modality which derives from Fire is colour; from Air, sound; from Water, touch; and from Earth, taste. That which is palpable to touch derives from the combination of qualitative modalities which possess something in common. It follows that light and colour are a qualitative modality which exists in every composite, by virtue of the fiery nature (the element of Fire) that each composite contains. Ju st as no composite is deprived of this fiery nature (the element of Fire), so no composite is without a certain light. The totality of the lights existing in things derives from this Fire. When the world above projects its Imago into the world below, its manifestation in each Nature acquires a tincture that corresponds to the nature that is below. Through each Nature, each Element, it manifests itself to one of the faculties of perception, the faculty created by this same Nature (mani­festations by colour, sound, scent and so on) . This is how the \"hidden 24"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS lord\", who is allied to his knight, his marbub, is manifested to the organ of created vision: he is manifested through the fiery nature ofthings, through the elemental Fire that each thing contains. This is so because the light that is the manifestation ofthis lord through the fiery nature, through the elem ental Fire concealed within the signature, is only perceptible to the organ of vision created by that same Fire. \"Like alone knows like\" is a principle effective both for the theory of coloured photisms in Najmuddin Kubra and for Goethe's Farbenlehre. 15 If it is true, therefore, that the eye cannot perceive transparent things or lights in a subtle state until they have undergone a certain condensation, then every signature and composite possesses colour and light, regardless of whether it belongs to the material bodies of this world or to the imaginal realities of the barzakh, to the spiritual forms ofthe Soul's Mala/ad or to those oftheJabarut of the cherubic Intelligences. This is why the shaykh, in anticipating the deductions stemm ing from his consideration of the theme of the cosmic Throne, specifies the scale of colour distributed over seven levels of the universe as follows: I. The colour of the world of Intelligence is white. 2. The colour of the world of Spirit is yellow. 3. The colour of the world of Soul is green 4. The colour of the world ofNature is red 5. That ofthe world ofMatter is ashen. 6. That ofthe world ofthe Image is dark green 7. That of the material body is black He warns his readers that they will find no mention of all this either in the Mutakallimun or in his writings ofthe professional philosophers. \"You will perceive,\" he says, \"their inability to grasp the question decisively ... Such is our way. As for their way, I call God to witness that they know only the appearance and the outer aspect ofthe life ofthis world; they are unaware of the other world (cf Koran 30:7).\" This other world will be revealed to us in the second part of the \"Book of the red hyacinth\" by means of an astonishing esoteric hermeneutic of the colour red, preceded by an analysis ofthe way in which colours are generated in the sensible and supra-sensible worlds. 4. How colours are generated in the sensible and supra-sensible worlds. From the point we have reac hed we can catch a glimpse of the goal envisaged by our shaykh: a goal at which the hermeneutics of the Koran converges in an astonishing way with the hermeneutics of colour in general, and in par-15 a my book, Man of Light ... , op. cit, index, s.v. Goethe, Najmoddin Kobra. 25"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"ocular with that of the colour red which is the theme ofthe \"Book ofthe red hyacinth \". Before attaining this goal, however, there is a stage of some difficulty to be gone through. It will Indude an analysis of the way in whim colours are generated, while its recapitulation should make it possible foc us to profit fr om what we have learned up to now. Very briefly, this stage consists ofthree phases: A. We need a doctrine dealing with the primordial sources of colour; this will be the subject of the discourse on the cosmic Throne of the Merciful One, supported by four pillars of coloured light. B. On the basis of this doctrine, we have to deduce the manner in which colours arc generated and distributed in terms of the four fundamental qualitative modalities which we considered earlier. C. When we have reached this point, we will be in a position to confirm the intial proposition, that every composite in both the sensible and the supra-sensible world possesses its own particular colour. To this end, the author returns briefly to the theme of the signature's double dimension ojrabb and mm-bub, lord and knight, light and its colour. This is what makes it possible for us to understand how at each ofthe seven or eight levels of the universe, there is an anamn£sis of the colours that we contemplate in this world; and the theory of CU'I£ll1U'I£ses or correspondences makes possible in its tum a transcendental hermeneutic ofthe colour red which plumbs what is most esoteric in its esoteric reality. This constitutes our shayk h's goal, and the consummation ofhis book. A. We cannot understand either the significance and source of the colour red, or the qualitative modality of its appearance, its exoteric dimension (zahir) , without having first acquired an understanding of the sources ofthe other colours (II, chapter I). As we saw, it is absolutely out of the question foc these sources to be limited to black and white; or, rather, between black and white, as between the two extreme terms of Fire and Earth, two fundamental colours must interpose themselves and assume the role of mediators. The general proposition is that in the subtle wo rld of transparent colours, where earthly darkness does not intrude, the sources of colour are four in number: white, yellow, red and green. But in our physical, terrestrial world, the four sources are white, yellow, red and black; because in this world black replaces the green of the subtle worlds. Generally speaking, the predication ofthese four sources constitutes one of the great themes of Shiite theosophy, the theme of the Throne ofMercy or of the Merciful One {'ATsh al-Rahmah, 'Arsh al-Rahman), which rests on 26"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS four cosmic supports. When the Koranic verse (15:21) states that \"There are no things whose treasures (archetypes) do not exist alongside Us\" or \"with Us\" ('inda!ui), \"with Us\" is interpreted as signifying the theophany that is accomplished in the creation of the universes.16 The theme is stated in a hadith which is recorded in the great corpus ofKulaym and is attributed to the first Imam: \"God created the throne out offour lights: a red light whereby the colour red beco11l£s red; a green light whereby the colour green beco11l£s green; a yellow light whereby the colour yellow beco11l£s yellow; a white light whence whiteness is derived.\" Briefly, this white light characterizes the upper right-hand pillar of the Throne; it is the world of the cherubic Intelligences, the summit of the Jabcuut typified by the archa ngel Sera­phiel. � World of the Intelligence � World of the Soul (Azrad) (Seraphiel) � World of the Spirit (Michael) \\Vorld of Nawrc (Gabriel) The four pillars ofthe cosmic Throne ofMercy The yellow light characterizes the lower right-hand pillar of the Throne; it is the world of the Spirit (Ruh) typified by the archangel Michael.

The hadith of the Throne recorded by the Imams and quoted below does not mention the colour blue as being one of the fundamental colours. In this connection, the ancient Arabs distinguished only three fields of colour: blue-green ( akhdar ), red­brown (a hmar), and yellow-brown (asfor). The other terms relating to colour refer onJy to degrees of greater or lesser clarity in these fundamental colours. On this point, see Wolfdietrich Fischer, Farb-und Formbezeichi1W'lgen in der Sp rache der alt­arabisclren Dichtung (\\Vi esbaden 1965) (review by Ewald Wagner in Der Islam, 43/3, 1907, pp. 316 ff.).

The red light characterises the lower left-hand pillar of the Throne; this is the world of Nature and is typified by the archangel Gabriel because he is the demiurge of our world. He is the Holy Spirit of the Koran; the philosophers identified him with the Tenth Hierarchic Intelli­gence or active Intelligence, that for humankind is both the angel of know ledge and the angel of revelation. This theme has been developed in many ways, a synthesis of which would be a considerable task and one that has not yet been attempted.17 In the course of previous researches, I was able to ascertain (in the writings, for example, of the seventeenth-century theosophist Qadi Sa'id Qummi) that the theme of the Throne was actually eo ipso that of the heavenly Temple, archetype of all temples, and that it is in fact possible to substitute the word Temple for Throne. In addition, wherever we come across this theme in Islamic theosophy, we are dealing with the same theme as it appears in some form or other in the Je wish Cabbalah, as well as with the theme of the Temple in the tradition of Christian esotericism­I am thinking in particular of the theme of the interiorization of the Temple in the work of the great eighteenth-century mystic Willermoz.18 In the present case, too, the hermeneutics of colour leads to just such an interi orization. For the contemplative exploration of the cosmic Throne of Mercy reveals that the four lights typified by the archangelic tetrad are the sources around which the totality oflights revolves, including the lights of the supra-sensible world. They are the absolute and universal lights, from which all partial lights are derived. Each manifestation of these partial lights is a hikayah (imitation, story, recital, parable) of the supreme Lights, which are themselves not the result of any intermixture but are primordial \"acts of light\". I will merely refer in passing to the question that suggests itself to our author, namely, whether white is a colour like the others or, 17 a below, the study \"The Co nfiguration of the Temple of the Ka'bah as a Secret of Spiritual Life, according to the work of Qadi Sa'id Qummi (1 103/ 1691)\".

In fact, this question is first suggested in a variant reading of the hadith of the Throne quoted above,19 as well as by the fourth Imam, 'Ali Zaynal-'Abidin, when he says that white light is the \"Light of Lights\", while red, yellow and green light are themselves the light of which white is the light. That is why white light can acquire any tincture, although no colour can be tinted by it. It is therefore the most simple of colours, the most faithful hikayah of the supreme world that lies beyond the universes accessible to our contem­plation. B. Now that we know these sources, the archetypes of colour as they exist in the cosmic Throne of Mercy, we have to describe their mode of generation according to the four elemental qualitative modalities analysed earlier. It is clear (II, chapter II) that each of these modalities possesses its own exigency and aptitude. When the light of the Principle manifests itself through one of these modalities, it does so through the colour which is specific to the modality in question. Here we have the conditions necessary for a hermeneutic of colour: each of the four modalities can be a form of manifestation; a particular manifestation is produced according to the colour that is specific to a particular modality. All colour, therefore, is a phainomenon that \"symbolizes with\" the light of its Principle, and the meaning should be interpreted in accordance with this manifestation. We have seen the four elemental modalities emerge on the level of the world of Nature, itselftypified as the lower left-hand pillar of the cosmic Throne of Mercy, whose light is red. It is self-evident, then, that the first modality-Fire-which issues from this Nature will have red as its spec ific colour. The four constitutive modalities of the world of Nature are thus seen as manifesting, each at one level of this Nature, the four colours of the Throne. a) Heat and dryness in a substance postulate the substance's stability in 19 1be text of the hadith, as it is recorded by the first Imam, mentions (as distinct fran the other colours): \"A white light from which whiteness proceeds.\" Thus, he does mt speak ofit as a tinctura, as though things were tinted by it. This text supports those who hold that white is not a colour but the pole of all colours, and exempt from 1he definitions that apply to them; all of them have recourse to it, while it has recourse only to itself. By contrast, the same hadith as recorded by one of the other Imams says: \"A white light whereby whiteness becomes white. \"This variant reading supports those who hold that white is a colour in the same class as other colours, that is, that the white object is similarly tinted by whiteness. Furthermore, white is a colour in that it is postulated by the elemental Natures or qualities, since it is the colour specific to the element of Water. 29"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"TH E REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS the shadow of its Principle and its orientation towards that Principle, in other words coherence and cohesion, subtlety and ascending motion (su 'ud). Its configuration or Gesta/1 is the upright stance: the Arabic letter alif(l) in its vertical solitude, or the Pen, or the tall flame, or the cypress tree thrusting straight at the sky-line. All this is the result of the tendencies of a substance's constitutive parts to move towards one centre, one area of being. When all these properties arc united in one substance which is the first to emanate from its henadic principle (here the lower left-hand pillar of the Throne), they require this substance to be red in colour, because that is what the colour red is, at least when we are dealing with the subtle component parts (the latifa h). ff, however, the colour red acquires an extreme intensity in the parts which are dense, these will turn a verdigris green (zangar) in colour. (What we call the oxidization of copper or silver, for example, is interpreted here in terms of a rigorously qualitative physics, which posits at the origin of a colour only the state of density or subtlety of its parts, its proximity to or distance from the Principle.) That, in short, is why the colour of Fire is red Since it is the most subtle of the elements, its colour is equally subtle and is hidden from our eyes of flesh, created out of opaque Earth. This Earth must itself take on the tincture of Fire before Fire can be seen by us as red and in a state of density, as we observe it to be in the case of a lump of coal, a candle, or a piece of red-hot iron. And while this may be the only Fire we can see, it is also the Fire that Zoroastrian cosmology denounces as that of Ahriman, because it is a fire that ravages, whereas the subtle Fire of Ormazd neither ravages nor destroys. The significance of this differentiation will become clear to us at the conclusion of our enquiry. Let us observe in passing that it should not surprise us if in Persian miniatures, as in the ritual paintings of the Byzantine Empire down to our Middle Ages, natural tints are not reproduced as the artist may have seen them with his eyes of flesh; what counts above all is the colour's symbolic, hermeneutic, sacramental value. b) When heat and humidity are in a substance, they result in swelling, expansion, the opposite to the effects of dryness. Nevertheless, here too heat demands ascending motion, which is why the figuration or Gestalt that typifies such a substance in the world of volumes is the conical form of a pine-cone or, in the world of surfaces, the triangle pointing upwards (A). The internal cohesion that such a substance owes to its heat would postulate, as in the preceding case, the colour red; but its expansiveness 30"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS postulates the colour white. The result is an intermediary, mediating colour (a barzakk-like in-between colour, like the arbiter between man and wife of which mention was made above). Thus, the colour of the element Air is yellow, but in order to be visible to our eyes of flesh, it must take on an earthly tincture (the author gives the example of the yellow colour of bile, thus relating the theory of colours to traditional medicine). c) When cold and humidity come together in the same substance, the humidity demands expansion, as in the case of Air, while the cold demands movement downwards (tasaffu l) , the absence of all spontaneous upward impulsion. Su ch a substance revolves upon itself; its Gestalt is the spherical form (0), the most corpulent of all forms. Because of their lack of compact­ness and cohesion, its constituent parts tend towards dispersion and thus towards transparency; and when the Principle manifests itselfthrough it, it does so through the substance's swelling and expansiveness . The colour deriving from these two properties is white, and thus the colour of the element Water is white. On ce again, to be visible to us it must congeal or agglomerate as foam (or, in another medical reference, as phlegm, balgham = eA.e-y�a). d) Finally, when cold and dryness are the determining factors of a sub­stance, the dryness postulates the compactness and cohesion of the parts, while the cold demands movement downwards, as in the case of Water. The resulting colour is black, the colour of the terrestrial Earth (on the Other hand, the colour of the celestial Earth of Hurqalya is green); and black forms a screen before the lights of the Principle. That is why the Earth is tenebrous, inert and lifeless. Its Gestalt is a toothed form (shakl muladarras) with angles and dents (NW\\) � composing a screen. We now have a succession of morphological types (I 0 6 NWI) attri­buted to the four modalities which are characterized by their respective colours. For the moment, we do not possess any terms of comparison; as our shaykh says at this point: \"Take all this in with care, for you will not find it in any book, neither will anyone speak to you of it.\" C. Now we know the sources of the basic colours in the archetypal Throne or Temple, and we have seen them emerge in each of the four constitutive elemental modalities.

Where on the scale of being is our present world situated? Many hadith have been composed by the Imams on this subject: \"God created millions of universes and millions of Adams, and you are in the last of these universes, and you yourselves are the adamic humanity of this last universe.\" All that we find and sec in our world \"descends\" from the universes that precede it . In place of the current term of Correspondence and symbolism between these universes, our shaykh employs a term of remarkable real­ism, the term dhikr, which signifies a calling to mind (anamnesis) or naming of something. In the current vocabulary of Sufism, the term dhikr designates the practice of invoking a divine Name until the endless repetition seals up the soul's energies and produces a state of ecstatic intoxication. Here, the word has a sense that is more sober and strict. The shaykh means that in every universe there is an anamnesis {dhikr) of what we perceive in this world (the word anamnesis here signifying something similar to \"evocation\" as it is used in connection with music and painting). In every universe, each thing, being or state that we perceive in our universe possesses an anamnesis which corresponds to the state of that universe. There cannot be a hiatus: it is not possible for a signature to be situated at such an extreme distance from its Principle that the inter­mediary degrees lack an anamnesis of it , that is to say, something that calls it to mind and corresponds to it. Colours, therefore, possess an anamnesis in the superior universes over which the Treasures or archetypes have ascen­dency. Obviously, however, one cannot know the modality of these anam­neses without a profound kno wledge of what they call to mind-that is, the four possible modalities of every signature. The point is that in these superior universes, every signature possesses these modalities, but in each universe the modalities exist in accordance with the requirements im­posed by the particular nature of that universe. This is the root of the law which requires that we distinguish between existence and manifestation, a law so rigorous that the Shaykhi School, of which Muh. Karim-Khan Kirmani was a leading figure, had to remind the Shiites that it was the basic law of their esotericism, prescribed by the holy Imams themselves. In affirming the existence of an esoteric hierarchy, 34"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS they affinned the existence of certain perfect Shiites, the Kamilan-i shi 'ah. 21 This scandalized the exoteric Mullas, in whose eyes those who proclaimed the necessary existence of such beings could only be claiming for them­selves the status of \"perfect Shiites\". But this was not the case: the Shaykhis, although they were not always understood, responded tirelessly to this accusation by saying that their affirmation had reference to a category of spiritual persons in this world but that under no circumstances did it ever permit the naming of such persons. A spiritual qualification is a secret between God and his worshipper; it never is and never can be an exoteric prerogative, worldly, social or profane. The existence of these \"perfect Shiites\" is absolutely necessary if the world is to continue to be, for they are its mystical pillars. Yet though their existence is a necessity, not only is their manifestation not necessary, but it is precisely their occultation that is necessary and inevitable under the present conditions of our world. If they were to manifest what they are, they would eo ipso cease to exist as such. One might say that they are under the same strict laws as the knights of the Grail. The esoteric conception of these perfect Shiites, who are unknown to the majority of men, is in a certain respect reminiscent of that of the \"unknown, secret, just men (Saddiqim)\" of the Jewish tradition;22 while in another respect it recalls those \"unknown Superiors\" of a particular esoteric Occidental tradition, provided that the word \"Superiors\" is understood in the metaphysical and spiritual sense. It should be emphasized that the necessity for the occultation of these \"perfect Shiites\" from the eyes of the world is equally applicable to the divine dimension as \"a gem occulted in the human condition\", in the words of the Imam Ja 'far . It also applies to the occultation of the \"divine dimension\" or the \"lordly\" aspect of colour, as our shaykh invites us to contemplate it in the universes that precede that of the earthly Adam. It is this lordly aspect or \"divine dimension\" of colour which is necessarily and inevitably occulted from the common perception of our world. Our shaykh pursues a characteristic line, on which, unfortunately, we cannot elaborate here. He presents us with a hierarchy consisting not just of seven but of 21 On this theme, which links up with what is called the \"fourth pillar\" (rnkn-i chaharum), see En Islam iranien ... , op. cit., IV, book VI (fhe Shaykhi School). 22 C[ Gershorn Scholern, 'Three Types of Jewish Piety', Eranos-Jahrbuch XXXVIII, 1969, pp. 346 ff. 36"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS eight levels of universe, because mention is now made of the world of the hidden deity at the summit, a world that transcends all the theophanic universes concentrated in the Temple of Mercy. To signifY the distance separating one universe from the next, the shaykh reiterates that every superior world is of a light seventy times more intense than that of the world immediately inferior to it. We have already seen that this figure, with its arithmosophic value, is meant essentially to tell us that the distance is beyond our quantitative measure s. 1. The highest of these universes is \"the world of the intimate depths and light of God\" ('alam al-fu 'ad wa-nur Allah).

This is the universe of the cherubic Intelligences ('alam al-'uqul); and here the lights are united in a union which as yet admits only a plurality and multiplicity that are wholly inner, ideal (m a'nawi}, not exterior (white light). 3.

Here colours are differentiated according to their exterior form (tamayuz sun) (green light). 5. This is the world ofNature, in which colours are differentiated by nature and genus (tamayuz tabi'i wa7jinsi), by a diversification accessible to the senses (red light). 6.

Colours are differen­tiated by a material difference (tamayuz mdddi) (ashen colour). 23 Here, the shaykh brings together two quotations-that of the Prophet: \"Know God through God hi mself, as God may not be known save through God; and that of the (anonymous) poet: \"She saw the Moon in the sky, and she remembered me-Each of us two contemplates a single Moon-But I contemplate it through her eyes, and she contemplates it through my eyes.\" 36"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS 7. This is the mundus imaginalis ('alam al-mithal), where colours are differentiated by individual differences, like images seen in mirrors-these last being the lower level of the mundus imaginalis, still linked to material bodies (dark green; cf the green light of the Malakut). 8. Finally there is the world of material bodies, where colours are differentiated in a way we are able to observe (black). \"Such,\" concludes our shaykh, \"are the Treasures (archetypes) of colours, from which they descend and towards which they ascend. Their subtlety or density is in proportion to the subtlety or density of each of these universes.\" He is aware that he has dealt very summarily with the question of the anamnesis of colour in each universe, but \"if we wished,\" he says, \"to comment on these problems in a more profound fashion, with prolegomena of prolegomena, the Moon would disappear before we had completed our elucidation, for as the Koranic verse (18:110) says: 'If the sea were ink for the words of my God, the sea would be exhausted before my God's words were exhausted, even if we had another sea like the first to provide us with ink. \"' 5. Th e henneneutics of the Koran and the hermeneutics of colour. The analysis of these anamneses has of necessity been an incomplete one; nevertheless the idea we have been given of them is enough to justify our shaykh in his sense of having attained the goal envisaged from the start. From this vantage-point he will be able to undertake a hermeneutic of the phenom­enon of colour, and particularly of the colour red, which parallels step by step the esoteric hermeneutics of the Koran. It is a grandiose undertaking, the consummation of an entire theosophy which pivots on the phenomenon of the sacred Book; and it suggests many fruitful comparisons with other esoteric commentaries on the Koran as well as those on the Bible. Here I will simply recall the hadith of the Prophet proclaiming the seven esoteric depths of the Koran, in connection with the undertaking of the great fourteenth-century Iranian mystic 'Alauddawlah Simnani. By means of a radical interiorization of prophetology, Simnani relates all Koranic refer­ences to the prophets to the seven centres of subtle physiology. These centres, which typify the \"prophets of your being\", are each characterized by a colour, an aura, that belongs to it alone. In the case of our shaykh, the undertaking is comparable in scope but follows a di fferent schema from that of Simnani. As we observed earlier, it illustrates in a remarkable way/ 37"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"what is common to the phenomenon of the Book both as Liber mundi, the \"Book of Being\" to which colours pertain, and as the Liber revelatus, the holy Book; for the same hermeneutic leads to an understanding of both of these. The vocabulary to be used needs careful defming. The word ta'wil is the key-word of this hermeneutic procedure, our shaykh defmes the ta 'wil (II, chaptEr V) as \"consisting in referring the litEral appearance back to one of the archetypes [or in 'exchanging' the literal Value for one of the treasures or archetypes],24 with the understanding that this archetype determines what the object is, whether it belongs to the sensible or to the supra­sensible world.\" This definition accocds pErfectly with that given by lsmaili theosophy: \"The ta'wil consists in leading back, in returning a thing to its principle or ar chetype\" (in Persian: chizi-ra bi-asl-i khvud rascmidan). Thus, the idea ofthe ta'wil implies the action ofrising up again, the idea of an ascensional, anagogical way. As an esoteric hermeneutic, the ta'wil is essentially an \"anagogical hermeneutic\". The starting point ofthis hermeneutic is the whir, the exoteric dimen­sion. At evecy hermeneutic level there is both an esoteric dimension (balin) to discover and a ta'wil to accomplish. Thus there is a ta'wil ofthe esoteric as well as ofthe exoteric dimension, and this ta'wil in its turn contains an esoteric dimension. In order to clarifY the route we still have to traverse, we will recapitulate its stages in the following schema: �iihir 1) 111 'wll al-:;iihir l. 3) batin til-ttl 'wll (,�th pillar of T\\ /' (Angel of world of r Thronr of :\\Icrccy: I \\ I I Nature: Gahril'l ) �aturr) \\ I I > I � 5) ba!z\"n al-ba!itt (exoteric of tlw-i colour rnl) I I I I \\ I (Throne of dw �/ \\ I / d),)ne N•me.)

The spiritual hermeneutist is in scme sense an \"exchanger\" of value and a \"changer\" of direction. 38"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS The shaykhs of the Shaykhi School discussed certain chapters of the Koran according to this complete schema, and one can well imagine that it would require an entire library to make a commentary on the Koran in this fashion from one end to the other. In order to make it clear from the start what the process of the ta'wil comprises, the shaykh takes as an example a verse from the Koran, an example which has the virtue of showing us how the colour red belongs to the phenomenon ofthe sacred Book, and how as a result the same hermeneutic can be applied to it. The Koranic verse (13:17) is as follows: \"He makes water descend from the sky, so there are torrents that flow according to their measure.\" By means of the Ia 'wi4 the sky is elevated to the level of the divine creative Will (the mas hi 'ah) which is itself subject and object, organ and source of Creation, the active dimension (jJri al-ja�l) ofthat which is set in motion (the mutaharrak). The water descending from the sky is being-not absolute being, but the determined and delimited being (muqayyad) that descends from this Will. It is the Water whereby every thing in the act ofbeing has been made to live (we have already seen how, in alchemical terms, this Water is the equivalent of the primordial Fire); by this Water, corpses, which are vessels of being in a state of expectation, are aroused to life. The torrents are precisely these vessels ofbeing; they are torrents whose beds are empty and dry until the \"Water of being\" flows into them. This, according to the shaykh, is how the ta'wil is employed, as the anagogical hermeneutic of all verses ofthe Koran and all traditional recitals.25 But he emphasizes that the initiative with regard to its use cannot be left to the first comer: only he has the capacity and the right to assume responsib ility fer the ta'wil who has first acquired a perfect understanding ofthe \"data\" which the literal revelation (tanzil) provides fer the ta'wil, and who is fully apprised ofthe modalities according to which the universes intercorrespond, as well as ofthe meaning ofthe anamneses to be found in all ofthem. For this universality ofuniverses forms the liber mund� the Book ofbeing, the immense register-book (Ki.tab tadwini) which God wrote with the Pen of the creative Act, the Pen which signifies the first Intelligence, the first-created Logos.26 25Cf foc example 7:143: when God manifests himself on the mountain (Sinai), he reduces it to dust; foc the ta'wil, the mountain is the boco/ itself of Moses, and Moses falls down in a swoon; similarly, the foor Elements are the four humours of the hum an body, etc. 26 Cf th e hadith : \"The first thing that God created was the Pen. Then he tdd it 39"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYJ\\.1BOLISM OF COLOURS Other Koranic verses attest that what is posited is a book, as for example (he following: \"You will remain in the Book of God until the day of Resurrection\" (30:56); and again: \"What, then, did the past generations desire ?\" asks Pharoah of Moses, who replies, \"The knowledge of that is close to my God in a certain Book\" (20:51-53). This Book is the glorious Word that God will utter and that is wholly a Book,27 comprising genera (homologous to the large sections ofthe Koran), species (homologous to the chapters), categories (the verses or \"signs\", ayat), and individuals (homologous to the words made up of letters) .28 Such being the case, the colour red is in one sense a letter (harf) of this Book; in another sense it is a word, a verb (kalimah); in yet another sense it is an entire verse (a \"sign\", ayah). In this way it corresponds to all the components of the phenomenon of the Book (\"And among His ayat ... is the diversity of your languages and your colours\" (30:22) ). 29 That is why, concludes the shaykh, recapitulating everything that correlates the two aspects of the phenomenon of the Book, \"the colour red contains a ta'wil as the Book contains a ta'wil.\" The science of Nature and the science of the Book are two aspects of the same science of the Spirit. 1. The ta'wil of the exoteric dimension of the colour red (ta 'wil al-zahir), that is to say, the immediate term to which the ta'wil leads the colour back, is Nature in the act of being, or being as Nature: the lower left-hand pillar of the cosmic Throne of Mercy. A hadith attributed to the first Imam has already informed us that this pillar is characterized by red light, \"whereby the colour red becomes red\". All red colour in our world derives from the essential red light of this pillar; thus, the pillar is the Treasure or arche-'Write! '-'What shall I write?' asked the Pen.-'That which is and that which will be until the Day ofthe Resurrection.' And the Pen wrote. Then God put a seal over the mouth ofthe Pen and, having written, it did not declare the hidden meaning.\" 27 On the transition from the Word as uttered-from its state as Logos-to the Word as it is when set down in scripture, in its state as the Book, cf Mulla Sadra Shirazi, op. cit., pp. 193-194 ofthe French text; cf also the index s.v . .Kalam Allah, Livre. 28 \"The Most High God designates its categories by the word ayat (verses , Signs). He says: 'We will show them our Signs [that is to say, the categories ofthe Book written by the Pen] both on the horizons and within themselves' (4 1 :53). And he designates its individuals by the word kalimah (word, Logos), as he does in the case of Jesus: 'By one of his Words, whose name shall be Christ' (3 :45), and with reference to his name as a sign {ayat) : 'We have made ofMaryam's son and ofhis mother a Sign' (23:50). And he calls the whole by the name ofBook, as you havejust heard. \" 29 This is the verse already quoted (see above, note 11), as a Koranic testimony in favour of the thesis that colours are actually in things themselves, not merely in our perception. 40"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS type whence the colour red \"descends\" into this world, and it is the explanation ofthe colour. To complete the picture, our author reminds us that this fourth pillar of the Throne-Nature-comprises the four elemental modalities characterized respectively by the four basic pillars: Fire (red), which is the very nature of being; Air (yellow), which is its exemplary Image (m ithal); Water (white), which is its matter; Earth (black), which is its body. It is to be observed that the descending order ofthe Elements (beginning with Fire, that accords with the supra-sensible world) is re­versed in our temporal and phenomenal world (in which we ascend from Earth up to the element Fire). A certain legend alludes to this ta 'wil ofthe colour red when it recounts how the Creator produced a \"red hyacinth\" (the words that form the title of our shaykh's work) and that he contemplated it with admiration. Under his gaze, the red hyacinth melted and turned into Water (once again, the alchemical idea of the reciprocity of Water and Fire). Out of the foam on this Water, God created the Earth; out ofits vapour (the subtle part) he created the Heaven. The shaykh explains that the red hyacinth typifies Nature: it turns into Water which is Nature's matter; the Heaven, which is the mundus imaginalis ('alam al-mithal), is created out of its subtle vapour; while from its Earth is created the telluric mass, which is the world ofbodies. In this way, the symbol ofthe red hyacinth embraces the totality of the four fundamental modalities.30 2. The esoteric dimension of the colour red (batin al-zahir, the esoteri c ofits exoteric, II, chapter VI), takes us from the cosmic Throne or Temple of Mercy to another Throne or Temple, which is in perfect symbolic accord with the former. The second Throne is in fact the hierocosmic Throne of Shiite esotericism, and is named the Throne of the \"w alayah\" {'Arsh al-walayah). We know that the word walayah is one of the key words in Shiite theosophy, for it is at the heart of the Imamology that goes hand in hand with prophetology. The walayah (Persian dusti) is the gift of love, the divine love or favour that renders eternally sacred the \"Friends of 30. The author has added later, in the margin ofthe text, a number of possible ta'wi/at \"We can al so lead back the colour red to violence, anger, murder, or to the bile that is in the human body, or to fierce beasts , or to fire, or to the planet Mars , to the sun, to political power, to the Turks, to the sword, to copper, or to the elixir ofgold and oilier, similar things.\" Doubtless on re-reading what he had written, the author added this inventory haphazardly; the rules ofthe ta'wi/ that are thereby demon­strated are not clear, whereas he is extremely precise when speaking of the corre­spondences between the Thrones. 41"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS God\", that is to say, using the ttnn in its proptr sense, the Twelve Imams, and through their mediation all those whose attacltment (walayah) to the Imams makes them likewise \"Frimds of God\". The walayah transforms the religion ofthe Law into the religion oflove. As a gift imparted to the Imams, it is defmed as the \"esoteric dimension of prophecy\", and is thus prophecy's indispensable support. The vocation of nahi or prophet presupposes a previous stale as wall or friend. Thus, just as the four pillars typified by the arcltangelic tetrad arc the supports of the cosmic Throne of Mercy in its function as creator of the universes, the tetrad made up out of four of the twelve Imams is the support of the Throne ofthe walayah. On this Throne is established that Mercy which is called here prophecy or prophetic grace {Rahmcm al-nubuwwah) .31 The correspondences between the structures of the two Thrones are perfect, and they demonstrate the breadth of the cosmic function of the walayah as the word is used in lmamology. I cannot, unfortunately, give more than a brief description of them here: anything more would require a full commentary on lmamology. The pillar of white light is here the mystical figure of the twelfth Imam, the Imam of our times, the \"Imam hidden from the senses but present to the hearts of those who believe in him\". He is never named without the interpolation, \"May God hasten our joy ofhim!\" Thisjoy is his future advent as the Imam ofthe Resurrection, Renewer ofthe world, he who will restore the world to the state ofpurity that it possessed originally, at its creation (restoration, apokatastasis). This no doubt accounts for his role as the keeper of the white light. He bears the forename ofthe Prophet; he is the secret ofthe walayah, which as we have just seen is itself the secret or esoteric dimension of prophecy, of the prophetic vocation and message. The twelfth lmarn is the crown and fulfilment of the pleroma of the Twelve Imams, and is consequently placed at the apex as the \"upper right-hand pillar\" of the Throne of the walayah Finally, he is the pole of thefotuwmzh, the mystical order of chivalry made up of all those who aspire to be numbered among the \"companions ofthe twelfth Imam\". The lower right-hand pillar of yellow light typifies the first Imam, Imam 'All ibn Abi-Talib, the Prophet's alter ego. The upper left-hand 31 On the whole of this theme, see my study 'Juven ilite et chevalerie', L'Homme et Son .Ange (Paris, Fayard, 1984) See also En Islam iranien . . , op. cit., IV, general index s.v. fo towwat, walayat. 42"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS � 12th Imam c::J � 2nd Imam 1st Imam The four pillars of the Throne ofthe waiayah pillar of green light typifies the second Imam, Hasan ibn 'All. Finally, the lower left-hand pillar of red light typifies the third Imam, Husayn ibn 'Ali, whom the tragedy ofKarb ala made into the \"prince of martyrs\" (sayyid ai­shuhaddJ. Thus, then, the Throne or Temple of the walayah of the Imams is the esoteric dimension (the batin) ofthe cosmic Throne of creative Mercy. The fourth pillar, made crimson by the red light ofthe martyred Imam Husayn, is the esoteric dimension of the fourth pillar, that of Nature, which is characterized by red Light in the cosmic Throne. One should meditate at length on this correspondence, this mysterious anamnesis. I shall do no more than mention the beautiful legend recounted by our shaykh, which tells how one feast day, when the two child-Imams Hasan and Husayn asked their grandfather the Prophet to give them a new garment as a present, two robes came down out ofthe sky. The robes were white, but the two boys declared that they would not be satisfied until they were dyed the colour they wanted. Hasan asked for his garment to be green as the emerald, while Husayn wanted a colour like that ofthe red hyacinth. This was brought about through the ministration of the angel Gabriel, the angel ofRevelation. But while the Prophet rejoiced, the angel shed tears; and when the Prophet asked him the reason, he could not but announce the fate that awaited the two young Imams in this world. Hasan would perish through poison, Husayn would be assassi­nated. Another tradition expresses, with delicate symbolism, the link between the Imam Husayn, fourth pillar ofred light of the Throne ofthe waiayah, and the archangel Gabriel, fourth pillar of red light ofthe Throne 6f Mercy. The tradition tells us that \"the Prophet clothed Husayn in a 43"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS garment woven of the archangel's hair\" . Oilier traditions expre ss the same secret (sirr) link by saying that the castle of al-Hasa n in paradise is of emerald green, while the castle of al-Husayn is of red hyacinth. It becomes more and more clear ho w the title of hi s book was imposed on our author. 3. Next comes the esoteric dimension of the ta 'wil of the colour red (batin al­ta 'wil, II, chapter VII): for the conclusion reached by the first phase of the process, the ta'wil of the exoteric dime nsion, contains in its turn its own esoteric meaning . The ta'wil of the exoteric dimension of the colour red led us back to the fourth or lower le ft- ha nd pillar of the cosmic Thro ne of Mercy, that is to say, to the hypo stasi s of Nature (red light). On the other ha nd , what is called the esoteric dimension of Nature or the esoteric dimension of a heaven is the angel of that nature or that heaven. In the archangelic tetrad that supports the cosmic Throne, it is the archangel Gabriel who is the angel of our world of Nature. Such a hermeneutic accords perfectly with the role ascribed to the archangel Gabriel by the philosophers and theosophers of Islam. As we saw, he is the Tenth hierarchic Intelligence, and he is the de miurge of our world. (Here again, tradition offers us a delicate symbol: \"The red rose is an effusion of the archangel Gabriel\"). By the same token, it is he who, on the mystical Sinai, is the goal of the pilgrim in Suhravardi's romances of initiation. In this way, a strict correspondence between the tetrad of theopha ni c uni­verses, the archangelic tetrad, and the tetrad of the walayah is established ; and we can see how in each tetrad there is an anamnesis of the colour red . Our shaykh indicates other possible interpretations. This esoteric dimen­sion of the ta'wil of Nature, typified in the colour red, could also be the Imam of the Re surrection (Qa'im al-Qjyamah); or hi s companions battling at hi s side ; or the walayah itself inasmuch as it is an elixir poured out over the bodies which are hu man hearts; or it can be the gnosis (m a'rifah) and the sciences of love ('ulum al-mahabbah). Doe s not the Imam J a'far speak of love as a \"Fire that unexpectedly invades the depths of the heart and consumes all that is not the beloved object\"? There is certainly no need to reject any of these symbolisms; but the one initially offered ha s the advantage of applying in all respects from one hermeneutic level to an­other.32 32 It is worth emphasizing that our shaykh is remarkably aware of the danger inherent in the ta'w il when it ts used by the ignorant: \"I cannot provi de a more extended 44"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS 4. A further step permits us to accomplish the ta'wil of the esoteric dimension of the colour red (ta 'w il al-batin, II, chapter VIII). In the third phase ofthe process, our shaykh has unveiled to us the esoteric dimension ofthe ta'wil of the exoteric dime nsion, that is to say, ofthe ta 'wil which formed the first phase of our hermeneutical operation. This ta'willed us back, in the first phase, to the world of Nature; and, as we saw in the third phase, th e esoteric dimension ofthis Nature is the angel Gabriel. Now he offers us the ta'wil ofthe esoteric dimension, that is to say, of the dimension discovered during the se cond phase in the person of the Imam Husayn (c f the schema above). This fourth phase is decisive for Shiite sp irituality, for it brings about a radical interiorization of Imamology. In the second phase, the esoteric dimension (batin) of the colour red was shown to us in the person ofthe Imam Husayn, the \"prince of martyrs\" (lower left-hand pillar of the Throne of the walayah). The third phase showed us the esoteric dimension of the ta'w il of the colour red, that is to say, the esoteric dimension ofNature; and this dimension is the angel ofthis Nature, the angel Gabriel. Now, corresponding sy mmetrically to this third phase which disclosed the \"esoteric dimension of the ta'wil\", the fourth phase consists in accomplishing the \"ta 'wil of the esoteric dimension\" of the colour red, the dimension that the second phase disclosed to us in the person ofthe Imam Husayn. To whom, then, does the present ta'willead us? To the Imam within, the secret personal guide of each of us, to the rabb or lord, ofwhom each faithful vassal is the knight?3 commentary now, or, rather, such commentary is not permitted. For there is always a tendency in the hearts of men to deviate from the truth. Once they have under­Stood the matter of the ta'wil and the hatin in all their aspects, they start doing the ta'wil of all religious laws in conformity with the oQject of their desires; they lead themselves and others astray.\" On the other hand, there are the doctors of the Law, the fuqaha', who deny the ta 'wil and the esoteric dimension. Both these categories of person should be reminded of the tradition attribute d to the Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq: \"There are people who believe in the exoteric while denying the esoteric. This does not profit them in the slightest, for there is no exoteric faith save through an esoteric, and vice versa, no esoteric faith save through an exoteric.\" This simultaneous dual affirmation of the zahir and the hatin expresses the whole spirit of Shiite gnosis. One can never say to symbols: \"Vanish, you have been explained!\" Does the colour red wnish once we have explained its genesis and symbolism? 33 It should be observed, in the diagram given above at the start of the present section of this essay, what correspondences are indicated by the direction of the arrows. There is a ta'wil of the zahir and a ta'wil of the hatin; there is ahatin ofthezahir and a hatin of the ta'wil, and so on. The relationship between the hatin of the ta 'wil and the tawi/ of the hatin indicates the relationship between the Angel Gabriel and the inner 45"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS According to our shaykh, there is an Imam Husayn within each man: his intellect, whose divine splendour is a light that derives from the Imam . But this inner Imam is surrounded by enemies, and these are all the powers of the carnal soul that issue from the shadow of the Imam's enemies. Within every man there unfolds a tragedy of Karbala. \"In the Kamala of his hear� it may happen that the powers of the carnal soul kill the intellect and the angelic companions who assist it, and uproot all traces of them from man's heart. Then indeed there is accomplished in each one of us, word for word (haifan bi-harfin), the ta 'wil of the tragedy ofKarbala.\" Such is the ta'wil of the esoteric dimension of the colour red, the ta'wil al­hdtin. By proceeding in this way Shaykh Muh. Karlm-Khan Kirmani places himselfat the forefront ofthe great spiritual tradition ofShiism. The idea of the \"Imam within\" is to be found in the greatest spiritual masters: Najmuddin Kubra, Mulla Sadra Shirazi, and so on.34 I cannot do better than translate the shaykh's own words at this point: \"God has in fact two sorts ofwitness35 before men: the outer Imam (or witness) (HuJjah zahi­rah), in the person of each of the Twelve Imams, and the inner Imam (or witness) {HuJjah batinah). The Imam within is each individual intellect, such an intellect being the irradiation (shu'a� ofthe outer Imam ; for the Shiites, the initiates of the Imams, have been created out of the rays of their light, and light is proportional to the source of light.\" Thus, the process of interiorization is accomplished spontaneously, since this light that is in man, or at any rate in the man who is an initiate of the Imams, is actually a ray of their own light; and so the light, both exterior and interior, is one and the same. The shaykh continues: \"While the esoteric dimension of the colour red is the Imam Husayn [see above, phase 2], Iman. It is the same relationship as that established in the Ishraqiyun of Suhravardi between the Angel Gabriel as the Angel of humanity, and Perfect Nature as the guide and angel of each human individual. The interiorization of Imamology leading to the idea of the Imam within (the \"Gabriel of your being\") is of capital importance for the understanding of Shiite spirituality. See my The Man of Light ... , op. cit., and En Islam iranien ... , op . cit., index s.v. Imam, shaykh al-ghayh, Nature Parfaite. 34 Ibid., index s.v. guide interieur. 35 This teaching is also to be found in the works ofMulla Sadra. The term Hujjah (proof, guarantee, witness) applies, above all, to the Imam. In the technical vocabu­lary of the Ismailism of Alamut, which is also marked by a tendency towards interiorization, the term signifies the dignitary who is the companion closest to the Imam, and who forms a bi-unity with him. 46"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"TH E REALISM AND SY:t-.ABOLISM OF COLOURS because he died a martyr's death at Karbala, the ta'wil of this esoteric dimension [that is, the term to which the ta'wil of the Imam leads us back] is man's intellect, because all intellects derive from the irradiation and the light of this esoteric dim ens ion [that is to say, from the Imam], intellects that can be murdered by the carnal soul and its assistants\", whether these \"latter are typified by the men of Mu'awiyah or by Ahriman's auxiliaries. This is the entire mystery of the Imamate within man. It is a theme that could be developed at length, but the shaykh, in his prudence, chooses to say no more .36 5. Finally, there is the esoteric dimension of the esoteric (batin al-batin, II, chapter IX), a subject on which our authors are usually fairly reticent. Muh. Karim-Khan Kirmani even gives us the motive for this reticence here when he refers to the Pharoah and his troops who immolate the sons of the believers but spare their wives. These sons are the initiates of esotericism, while the wives who are spared are the initiates of exotericism. The reference is transparent : it alludes to all those, East and West, who represent the priesthood of the Grand Inquisitor. And the shaykh says: \"Neither is it permitted to reveal plainly the esoteric dimension of the esoteric.\" Nevertheless, some marginal references to it are permitted. To understand them it is enough simply to pursue the hermeneutical line we have taken up till now. We should keep this line clearly in mind. On the one hand, the ta'wil of the exoteric dimension of the colour red leads us back to the lower left­hand pillar of the cosmic Throne, to the world of Nature whose esoteric dimension is the archangel Gabriel (the esoteric dimension, that is to say, of the ta'wil). On the other hand, the esoteric dimension of the colour red was revealed to be the lower left-hand pillar of the Throne of the walayah typi fied in the person of the third Imam, the Imam Husayn, martyr of Karbala. Next, the ta'wil of this dimension disclosed the \"Imam within\" to each believer. Finally, what of the esoteric dimension of this esoteric dimension, that is to say not merely of the interiorization of the Imam through the ta'wil, but of the essence of his essence in all its secret theosophical meaning? It now appears that the esoteric dimension of this 36 Here, the shaykh recalls that these ta'wilat are arcana. He does not wish to say more, tor he has no confidence in the questioner who made him bring up the question of the colour red, and who belongs to that class of people whose constant questioning is only intended to embarrass the wise. The shaykh has answered here simply out of respect fur the person who is acting as intermediary. 47"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS esoteric dimension can only be the Imam-seen not as he is in the dramatic action ofhis fugitive appearance on earth, but in his metaphysi­cal essence, in the pleroma, that is, ofthe \"eternal Muhammadan Reality\", the Haqiqah muhammadiyah, the primordial theophany of the Absconditum, the pleroma of the \"Fourteen Immaculate Ones\" in their persons of light. By reason of its primordial theophanic function, this \"eternal Mu­hammadan Reality\" is assigned an essential cosmogonic function. And it is pr ecisely about this that it is inadvisable to speak before the Pharoah and his troops, that is to say before the exotericist Mullas. Nevertheless, this is the dire ction in which our shaykh appears to be steering us.

And when the colour red is exalted to the divine Name, it is assigned exclusively to the level of the perfect Epiphany {al-Zuhur al-tamm), since these levels are four in num­ber. \"37 These four levels make up the Throne of the divine Names {'Arsh al-Asma�, which corresponds symbolically to the cosmic Throne of the archangelic tetrad and to the Throne of the walayah, both described above. In speaking ofthe Throne on which Mercy is established, the Mercy in question signifies creative Mercy (the Rahmah that is so close to the Sophia of other gnoses) which is at once subject and object (active and passive), the instrumental and the ablative ofthe act ofMercy which constitutes the liberation of being, the \"absolution of being\", setting being free to be.38 Four ofthe divine Names are here the pillars ofthe Throne. First there is al-Qabid, literally \"he who seizes\"; this is Mercy seizing \"hold\" of itself in a way that, through creative autophony, is transmuted into an act ofbeing. 37 These are, says the shaykh without entering up on explanations, i) the esoteric; 2) the esoteric according to its occultation; 3) the exoteric; 4) the exoteric according to its manifestation. 38 For the context of what is here referred to ouly briefly, see the teaching of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i, with which all Shaykhi thinkers are imbue d.

According to the shaykh, it is the name al-Qabidthat sustains the colour red, which in its turn manifests itself in partial Names such as the Avenger, the Conqueror, the Dominator, the Protector, and so on. These names, however, are perhaps allusions to the twelfth Imam, the Imam of the Resurrection, who dominates the \"heaven ofthe walayah'� Our shaykh does not explain how the colours are divided between the other three Names, but concludes that form s of knowledge are endless and limitless. That which is first projected into intellects still imperfect is knowledge ofthe exoteric; then, progressively, an increasing knowledge of the esoteric is projected into them. \"You must understand the concise words with which I have attempted to convey what I have conveyed. Then the exoteric will convert itself into the esoteric, and vice versa. For, if the esoteric dimension ofthe esoteric is concealed within the esoteric, it is because of its Manifest ation within Manifestation itself It is occulted because of the intensity of its Manifestation, and veiled because of the sublimity of its Light. \" This recapitulates everything that we have been taught by the \"Book of the red hyacinth\" about invisible lights and colours, the reasons for their occultation, and the true relationship between light and colour. The theory and hermeneutics of colour lead us to the heights of metaphysical theosophy. On the final point, the esoteric dimen­sion ofthe esoteric, our shaykh has exercised discretion, and it behoves us to follow his example.39 39 The shaykh llllderlines the motives for his discretion by alluding to some verses by an anonymous poet: \"!four age were not llllited in rejecting the truth, I would speak ofit here. Nevertheless, I can be fo rgiven; I am jealous fur you of everyone 01her than myself, even of myself-I am jealous of you, of the time and space that you occupy-Even were I to have you before my eyes-Up to the Day of the Resurrection, it would not suffice me.\" The \"Seal of the book\", which is its conclusion, returns to the question that was asked initially by a troublesome man in conversation with the person who reported it to Muhammad Karim-Khan Kir­mani. The troublesome man hoped to put the shaykh in a difficult position by provoking him to speak ofthe modality ofthe tint ofthe red carpet (which actually came from Kirmani) upon which the questioners were seated. The analysis that we have given here makes evident the level to which the shaykh raised the question in order to answer it. In his conclusion, he analyses briefly the impulses that arise from the depths ofthe human being. The desires which are \"tinted\" only by the colour red are related to each other with the aid supplied to them by Mars and the Sllll, as astrology explains in detail.

We should study the consequences of this colour theory for the theory and practice of alchemy, of which our shaykh was an initiate. We would need to discover what his doctrine of light and colour in the supra-sensible world has in common with the doctrines of other theosophical schools, notably with that of Swedenborg in the West. We would doubtless have to learn to look with new eyes at Persian miniatures, and also perhaps at the fiery windows of our own cathedrals. But we must postpone this task. Instead, I will conclude without going beyond the Iranian world, and will attempt to perceive in that world the deep resonance of all that shaykh Muh. Karim-Khan Kirmani has proposed for our meditation. In this connection I shall recall some recent incidents, some conversations I happened to have at Persepolis in October 1971, during the celebrations of the twenty-fifth centenary of the founding of the Persian Empire, and during the international congress of Iranology which was being held at Shiraz at the same time and in honour of the same occasion. The previous month, at the beginning of September, what is now called the annual festival of Shimz had taken place, though it is actually held among the grandiose ruins of Persepolis. A work by Xenakis had been performed, which, in the hill setting of the mountain that surrounds the ruins, made allusions to the myth of Prometheus. I was struck to observe, among some Iranian friends, not incomprehension of the Promethean allusions but, on the contrary, a comprehension so perfect that it resulted in a feeling which can only be called indignation. Now, this is one of the myths whereby Western consciousness has affirmed its pride: Fire, and hence permanent possession of the light, stolen from the gods, from celestial beings, by means of man's Promethean audacity. In powerful contrast, the fundamental conceptions of Iranian cosmology, be they those of ancient Zoroastrian Persia with the Light of Orm azd, or those of Shiite Persia with its Muhammadan Light of the walayah are quite the opposite of the myth of Prometheus.

Moreover, the Celestials and the Terrestrials are partners, allied together in defending this Light against the infernal Powers. Ormazd needs the help of the Fravartis (the celestial entities of the beings of light) in defending the fragile world of Light against Ahriman; and this conflict will continue until the end of our Awn. The Zoroastrian believer is a knight fighting alongside the lord of Light, who is not the \"Almighty\". For him there can be no question of betraying his lord, or of deserting the struggle. We have had occasion to analyse the continuance of this sentiment from Zoroastrian Persia into Shiite Persia, passing from the heroic epic of the heroes of the Avesta to the chivalry of the mystical epics of islamic Persia. The same ethic links the Zoroastrian \"companions of Saos0'ans\" with the Shiite \"companions of the twelfth Imam\". How is it conceivable that man should have used force and stolen fire and light from Celestial Beings, when he is their comrade-in-arms in the defence of these very things ? How can the idea of the heavenly gift be perverted into that of Promethean the ft? When he commits such a perversion, is not man simply taking the place and part of Ahriman? This, perhaps, is the first episode of the \"philosophical disfiguration of man\" which Gilbert Durand has analysed so profoundly. 40 Yet this is not all. The celebration of the twenty-fifth centenary included, one evening among the ruins of Persepolis, a \"Sound and Light\" spectacle. It was one of moving grandeur and beauty, but inevitably it evoked the burning of Persepolis, traditionally imputed to Alexander. On this occasion, I heard similar manifestations of vehement indignation. The motives for these were clearly expressed. There are two Fires: that of Ormazd and that of Ahriman. The Fire of Ormazd is a flame of pure light, resplendent and illuminating, which neither ravages nor destroys. It is the burning Hush, which illuminates without being consumed. The fire of Ahriman is fire as we experience it in our world of \"admixture\", in the state resulting fran Ahriman's invasion that violates the world of Light and brings corruption and death into it. It is an opaque fire which ravages and 40 Gilbert Durand, 'Defigurntion philosophique et fJg�.Ire traditionelle de lhanme en Occidenf,Eranos-Jahrbuch XXXVIII, 1%9, pp . 46-93. 51"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS destroys, and is darkened by thick smoke. How, then, could the burning of Persepolis be evoked as though it were an act of natural fire, when it was actually burned by Ahrimanian fire? How could such a catastrophe have been brought about by the Angel of Fire (the Rabb al-naw')? In this connection, a speaker recited to me an entire page of Suhravardi , shaykh al-ishraq, which I myselffelt deeply, and not without cause. The uneasi­ness of the Iranian spectators was thus due to the fact that the \"Sound and Light\" spectacle has surreptitiously staged a demonic spectacle, had staged in ignorance the demonic act which corrupted Creation and the Elements. What is striking about these protests is how closely they tally with what our shaykh has set forth for us in his \"Book of the red hyacinth\", leading us to distinguish between the lights and colours ofthe subtle, tran sparent beings in the supra-sensible world, and the lights and colours of our world which only become visible to us through a process of obscuration. Between his theosophy of light and colour, and the theory of colour professed by the philosopher-opticians, the distance is the same as that between the Zoro­astrian believer who is outraged by the myth ofPrometheus or the burning of Persepolis, and the Western spectator who is indifferent because he is unaware of the true facts about the drama he is watching. I have just referred once again to the idea ofthe pact which binds an entire mystical order of chivalry to the service of the celestial world of Light which it is its duty to defend. This is something that we have previously tried to clarify by tracing the course of thefutuwwah back to Zoroastrian Persia. I am struck by the fact that our shaykh's entire theory of colours leads us in the end to the very source of this chivalric idea. We were told that it is Fire, the fiery nature, that manifests the hidden Treasure, and hence that heav enly Imago of the Lord of Light which is projected into each ofus and is for each ofus the lord to whose service we pledge ourselves as soon as we recognize him . This is the whole se cret of the relationship between rabb and marbub. We have seen how this relation­ship is one of a reciprocal solidarity: the lord needs his knight in order to be manifested, while the knight needs the lord in order, quite simply, to be. It is the introduction ofthis mystical structure into the shaykh's theory of colour that is possibly the most significant thing it has to teach us. Rabb and marbub, lord and knight, are related in the same way as light and colour: it is true to say that the marbub literally \"wears the colours\" ofhis 51"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE REALISM AND SYMBOLISM OF COLOURS lord; and this is perhaps the intuition that lies at the source of heraldry­heraldic science, the science of emblems-as a science of the sacred. Finally, the theory of colour has led us to the confluence of mystical experience and prophetic experience, two forms of spiritual experience which have sometimes been placed in opposition to each other, but which are in fact interlinked, at least in the theosophies represented in the three branches of the tradition that stems from Abraham . The theme of colour is elevated to the point at which light and colour possess a prophetic meaning that derives from a prophetic philosophy. We were given a brief but striking indication ofthis in the elucidation ofthe esoteric dimension of the colour red which refers us to the Throne of the walayah, which is the esoteric dimension and the support ofprophecy. This is why the implications of the hermeneutics of colours as developed by Muh. Karim-Khan Kirmani may not be fully appreciated unless we br ing it into line with Simnani's hermeneutic. We have already seen how this great mystic interpreted the verses of the Koran in terms of seven subtle centres which he calls the seven \"prophets of your being\", each of which is discernible to mystical perception as a colour or aura specific to itself. Now, the tradition of thefutuwwah envisages the mission of each prophet, beginning with Abraham, as knightly service (fa ta). This tells us how we should understand the vocation of each \"prophet of your being\", until we attain the mystical degree which, according to the teaching of Simnani, is the Seal of the prophets of our being. Then the relationship between rabb and marbub reveals itself to be truly such that ifthe knight falters or dies spiritually, it is his lord himself, his rabb, who perishes. Who, ultimately, is this Lord, the \"divine dimension\", simultaneously himself and another? He is the superior Self, the Self who objectifies the \"I\" by saying, for instance, \"I know myself\". It is the Self whom one addresses as Thou. Bearing in mind the Intelligentia agens of the philosophers, one could call this Selfthe Imago agens, the Image that is active, effective, motorial: the Image-archetype because it is the Imago Dei projected into each being, our shaykh reminds us, as its \"divine dimension\", and by the some token inspiring, in the man who recognizes it, the total devotion of a knight. This Image or personal divine lord is he who imparts his mission to the prophet of my being that is assigned to me: myself sent to myself by Myself.

This, too, is what a great mystic of the Arabic language discloses to us, in a couplet with which we will conclude this study: \"I was a prophet sent to myself from Myself, And it is myselfwho, by my own Signs, was guided towards Myself.\"4-1 Thus sang the mystic, Ibn al-Farid ...

The Science of the Balance In Islamic gnosis, the metaphysical and mystical basis of the science of correspondences is called the \"science of the Balance\" ('ilm al-Mizan). This science, with which the name ofJabir ibn Hayyan is particularly associated, was practised par excellence by the alchemists. This being the case, it is important to free as far as possible the actual concept of alchemy from the ambiguities surrounding it; for only thus can we understand how the alchemical process, and the hermeneutical processes that are the subject of this study, both pertain to the \"science of the Balance\". To be sure, we know from Jabir that \"the idea ofthe Balance comprises a number of aspects, and varies according to the obj ects to which it is applied. There are balances for measuring the Intellect, the Soul of the World, Nature, Form, the Celestial Spheres, the stars, the four natural qualiti es, the animal world, the vegetable world, the mineral world, and lastly there is the Balance of letters, which is the most perfect of all.\" 1 There will be occasion to study here several examples of this last type of Balance. But there is something still more important: if \"the Balance is the principle that measures the intensity ofthe Soul's desire during its descent through Matter\", or it; in other words, the Balance \"is the principle which measures the quantities ofthe Natures that the Soul has appropriated for the purpose offorming their bodies\",2 then it seems to us both exaggerated and improper to take the word \"measure\" in the sense in which it is used by the science of today, and to regard the science of the Balance as 1 ct: Paul Kraus, Jahir ibn Hayyan, II: 'Jabir et la science grecque\" (Cairo, 1942), pp.187-188. 2 Ibid., p. 161. 55"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE \"having as its purpose the reduction of all the data of human knowledge to a system of quantity and measure, thereby conferring on them the charac­ter of an exact science. \"3 Such an attitude stems from the desire to discover, at all costs, precursors of the exact sciences. There are other ways of valorizing and justifying these so-called precursors. The numbers used or formulated by the science of the Balance do not conduce to the constitution of an exact science as we understand the term today. They possess a value and significance that are themselves qualitative, totally different from the function of num her in our statistics. To reduce these to one identical concept is, in short, to confuse the task of the chemist with that of the alchemist. Formerly, both the chemist and the alchemist could work wholly or in part on the same material; but the hermeneutical level of their respective operations was completely different. \"To measure the desire of the Soul of the World\" is essentially to release transmutative psycho-spiritual energies; as Jaldaki (fourteenth century A.D.) says, it is to transfer gold from its natural mine to the mine of the philosophers, or in other words extrahere cognitionem-to free the thought, the spiritual energy, which is immanent in the metal.4 This is something quite other than the \"chemical\" analysis carried out nowadays. The science of the Balance does not make alchemy a chapter in the pre-history of our modern chemistry; it does not lead to the formulation of \"math­ematical laws\" any more than it leads, in the examples we are about to study, to conclusions precursive of our philosophies of history. Yet this, precisely, is where its interest lies, in the very real degree to which the now forgotten science of correspondences offers us a recourse against so-called \"modern\" ideologies, which are altogether devoid of the 3 Ibid., p. 187.

Thus, although real balances were of course used in antiquity (such as the one mentioned by Zosimus, or Archimedes' hydrostatic balance), these are not what we mean when we speak about the basis of the science of correspondences. We mean a Balance the very concept ofwhich expresses essentially the harmony and equilibrium of things: a concept exalted, as Jabir ibn Hayyan very well understood, 5 to the level of a metaphysical principle-so much so, in fact, that the principle of the Balance is superior to all our categories of knowledge, in the sense that it is the cause of all determinations and the object of none. By the same token, one can grasp its importance in the vocabulary of religion and in all speculative theosophy. The idea of the equilibrium of things and that of divine equity ('adZ) go together, affirming themselves in the symbol of the Balance as an eschatological symbol (cf. Koran 21:49 and passim). In Islamic gnosis, the Balance signifies the equilibrium be­tween Light and Darkness. In Ismaili gnosis, for example in the writings of Hamiduddin Kirmani (died c. 408/1017), the Balance ofthings relig­ious (m izan al-diyanah) makes it possible to specify the correspondence between the earthly esoteric hierarchy and the celestial angelic hierarchy and, more generally, the correspondences between the spiritual and cor­poreal worlds6 The visible aspect of a being presupposes its equilibration by an invisible and celestial counterpart; the apparent and exoteric (zahir) is equilibrated by the occulted and esoteric (batin). Modern agnostic dissent, by ignoring this law of integral being, simply mutilates the in­tegrality of each being. Against those who think that a being's invisible and celestial counterpart is merely the object of a hypothesis or an act of faith, the science of the Balance affirms the principle which creates and ensures this counterpart's ontological necessity. Viewed in this way, the analogical form of knowledge that typifies the science of correspondences is always an anaphora (the act of raising up), an anagoge (the act of lifting up or elevating); the analogical method follows the anagogical path, the path which leads upwards. In other words, it follows the gradations of the hierarchy of beings which is itself determined by the spiritual or esoteric function assigned to each level. 5 Cf P.

The author, a great thinker and spiritual master of fourteenth-century Iranian Shiism, was Haydar Amuli (born 720/1320, died after 78711385). Spiri­tuall y, Haydar Amuli was a disciple of the great Andalusian visionary theosopher, Ibn 'Arabi (died 638/1240), in whose volum inous work he was able to rediscover the positive elements present in Imam ite Shiism, although he maintained a spirit of great critical freedom with regard to Ibn 'Arabi's own Imamology. As a result, Haydar Amuli's writings are of great significance in the relationship between Shiism and Sufism. This considerable work, written partly in Persian and partly in Arabic, had for long remained unpublished; it was only a few years ago that we were able to make a start on its reconstruction and publication7 In this study, we will analyse seve ral chapters of one of his works written in Arabic. It is entitled \"The Text of Texts\", and is an immense commentary on the Fusus al-hikam (The Gems ofthe Wisdom ofthe Prophets), a book in which Ibn 'Arabi had condensed the doctrines spread over the tens ofthousands of pages in his other writings. 8 The prolegomena to this \"Text ofT exts\" are characterized by, among other things, a large number of diagrams (twenty-eight, to be precise), ingeniously constructed by the author. The purpose of these diagrams is to make the structure ofthe spiritual worlds perceptible on the level ofthe imaginal, which is intermediary between sensible perception and intellective intuition. They thus possess the virtue ofbeing experim ental verification sui generis of metaphysical exploration . The function they fulfil in the work ofHaydar Amuli is the same as that fulfilled by the \"Book ofFigures\" in the work of Joachim of Fiore.

They can do this because the figures and personages distributed respectively within the circles do not constitute the historical causes oftheir succession to one another, but are the homologues of each other and assume a permanent function according to their resp ective places and ranks. Only this mode of perception effectively makes possible something like a science of correspondences. Still speaking in general terms, we could say that Haydar Amuli's subject-matter weighs three great books \"in the balance\" .10 By virtue of a Koranic verse (41:53). he calls one ofthese books the \"Book ofHorizons\" or ofthe macrocosm (Ki tab afaqi); then there is the \"Book ofSouls\", the book of the microcosm or the world of man (Kitab anfusi).

Finally, there is the third book, which is the revealed book, the Koran. When the science ofthe Balance is applied to the homologous figures that correspond with each other in the three books, it formulates not \"mathematical laws\" as we understand them today, but arithmological relationships, which alone are able to \"measure\" the place and function of these homologous figures. We shall examine, in succession, the \"Balance of the Seven and the Twelve\" (the correspondences between the astronomy ofthe visible Heaven and that of the spiritual Heaven, between the esoteric hierarchy and its cosmic correspondences); the \"Balance of the Nineteen\", which \"meas­ures\" the epic of divine Mercy descending and ascending from world to world; and the \"Balance ofthe Twenty-Eight\", which is an aspect ofthe balance of sacred history.

II. The Balance of the Seven and the Twelve The different applications ofthe science ofthe Balance induce us to study six of the great diagrams constructed by Haydar Amuli. Each of these presupposes an entire preliminary study with the diagram presented at the end of it, because it is only then that its purpose and structure become comprehensible. The first two bring into operation the Balance of the Seven and the Twelve, illustrating, as we have just seen, the theme ofthe esoteric hierarchies and their cosmic correspondences. Such a theme requires that we bear in mind the inspired hadith in which God declares in person: \"My Friends are beneath my tabernacles (or beneath my cupolas). No one knows them, other than myself. \" In addition, then, to acknowledg­ing the existence ofthese mysterious personages whom eighteenth-century occidental esotericism designated as the \"unknown Superiors\", such a hadith tells us that their function and qualification are purely spiritual. It follows, too, that one speaks only of categories of persons, without being permit ted to apply the hadith to any particular individual currently known among men in this world. Hence we should not expect the schemas outlining the hierarchy of these \"Friends of God\" to be as precise and uniform as an administrative blue-print. Besides, there are many points on which all the Shiite and Sufi writers on this subject differ considerably.11 An entire book would be needed to expound these variants and to co­ordinate them. In addition to his personal inspiration, Haydar Amuli is guided on this point mainly by two great masters, Ibn 'Arabi and Sa'duddin Hamuyah (died 1252 A.D.). The first question to be posed is one of vocabulary, that is, ofthe meaning ofthe terms used to indicate the degrees ofthe esoteric hierarchy. As all its members are called the \"Friends ofGod\" (in Persian, Awliya-yi Khuda, Dustan-i Haqq, a term found among the Gottesfre unde of the Rhenish mystical school, as I have remarked elsewhere), what in the first place is the exact significance ofthe term wan pi. awliya'? It has most commonly, and totally inadequately, been translated by the 11 For a brief SUIVey of these variants, see my En Islam iranien ... op. cit., I, pp. 120-127; IV, pp. 280 ff; index, s.v. hierarchies. 60"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE term \"saint\", a translation that opens the door to endless confusion and ambiguity, so much so that when the word is applied to God it is frequently translated as \"protector\".

Hence the definition given by Hay dar Arnuli: the wall is \"he whose case God takes up in friendship\".12 A Koranic verse (7:196), for example, declares: \"My Friend is God ... He befriends the just.\" The idea of protection simply derives from this divine dilection. The walayah, as a spiritual qualification established by this act of predilection, is the equivalent of the term mahabbah, meaning love or friendship. It is present in the wall under a double aspect. When the wall is regarded as the object of divine love (the mahbub, the beloved of God, he whom God has chosen to be his friend), 13 his walayah is ne ither something he has acquired by himself, nor is it instigated by his own efforts. It is pre­eternal, being a gift of pure divine grace, in the sense that the first Imam­the Seal ofthe Awliya '-was able to say: \"I was already a wall (a beloved of God) when Adam was still between water and clay\" (that is to say, did not yet exist). When the wall is regarded as the subject oflove, as he who loves (the muhibb, he who chooses God to be his friend), 14 he is obliged to \"model the whole pattern of his behaviour (his ethos) on the divine pattern\" {al-takhalluqbi-a khlaqAllah). It is on this condition alone that he can be called a friend in the true sense. The walayah, then, consists in the servant ('abd), the man, assuming the divine condition by ceasing to exist himself in order to arise again and exist in God; and he does this precisely \"because God has chosen him to be his friend\" .15 There is thus a distinct Johannine reminiscence in the spirituality oflslamic gnosis, which echoes 12 N al-N, § 606. 13 This is the state designated by the term mahhubiyah, an abstract noun formed from the word mahhub; it is the condition of the beloved, or al-maqam al-mahhubi, the mahbubiyah as a mystical station or dwelling (maqam) . 14 This is designated by the term muhibbiyah, an abstract noun fo rmed from the word muhibb: al-maqam al-muhibbi, the condition of the lover as a mystical station or dwelling. 15 Hence the reply of the Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq to the impertinent man who wished to accuse him of pride: \"Not at all! I am not proud, but since my own qualities have been obliterated by those of God, His greatness has banished mine and has taken its place.\" Cf.

It is as though this reminiscence disclosed the secret tradition transmitted at the very origins of Islam by Khadijah, the Prophet's wife, and the monk Waraqah, her initiator. It is by virtue ofpurely spiritual criteria which exceed the competence of men that the esoteric hierarchy is constituted within the entirety of these \"Friends and Loved ones of God\". At each period of the cycle of prophecy, the prophet, the Nabi, is at the summit ofthis hierarchy. He is the man who is \"raised up (m ab 'uth) by God for men in order to call them to God and deliver them from the darkness of ignorance\". The prophetic mission takes two forms: there is the prophecy of instruction (n ubuwwat al­ta'nj), which consists in the initiation into the gnosis ofthe divine Essence, the divine Attributes and the divine Operations; and there is legislative prophecy (n ubuwwat al-tashri') which, in addition to this, comprises the mission of reforming morals and of communicating a divine command. That is why we have, first the Nabi pure and simple (the equivalent, in the early periods ofprophecy, ofthe wall ofthe Muhammadan period); then the Nabi-mursal (sent to a people, a town or a family); and above all, the Nabl-rasuL the Envoy charged with the mission of revealing a new Law (sh ari'ah). For each nabi, the walayah is the presupposition ofhis prophetic char­isma, since without it there would be no grounds for seeing in him a manifestation of the Perfect Man. It is by virtue of this walayah that his heir and successor, the Imam, may be regarded in his turn as a manifes­tation ofthe Perfect Man, and it is equally the intervention ofthe walayah which marks the difference between the Shiite and the Sunnite conception of the Imam. The idea ofthe Imam (the \"Guide\" or hegoumenos) com­prises eo ipso that of Caliph (khalifah, a vicar, successor). This word may be understood to signify a succession from the Prophet in accordance with an order that is purely exoteric. In this case, the Caliph's mission is essentially the social and political one of a temporal leader, and it excludes any notion ofthe walayah This is the Sunnite conception. It is also possible, however, to understand the Caliph's function according to the sense in which it is said that Man, the Anthropos, is God's Caliph on Earth. Thus it was for the seven great legislative prophets, from Adam to Muhammad, and thus it was, too, for the Imams of each of the periods of the prophetic cycle.

Hence every Imam, like the Prophet whose successor he is, must be impeccable and immaculate (a notion that corresponds to the idea of the anamartetos in Judaeo-Christian prophetology). This is the Shiite conception.16 As we can see, this Shiite conception is not to be reduced to the idea of a fleshly descent or a political legitimacy. That is why it does not need any official acknowledgement on the part of men: the Imam is the Imam, even if confined to secrecy. If-like every previous prophet-the prophet of Islam (according to Twelver Shiism) had twelve Imams as successors, this is because together they form the eternal, metaphysical Muhammadan Essence (the Haqiqah muhammadiyah); the only meaning, function and basis of their earthly parentage, by fleshly descent, is the manifestation of their pleromatic and pre-eternal union. Consequently, it does not spring from the juridical or political contingencies of dynastic histories. Just now we mentioned the term \"pole\" (q utb). The notion is fundamen­tal to the esoteric hierarchy, the keystone ofthe arch� and it dominates all attempts to establish correspondences. It is indeed possible to say, with Ruzbihan Baqli of Shiraz, for example, that the Awliya' are the eyes through which God looks at the world� and that consequently they are the mystical guarantors thanks to whom, unbeknown to men, our world can continue to be. The pole dominates their entire hierarchy� it is par excellence that on which the gaze of God rests in looking at the world, in every epoch� and therefore the pole, from which the whole esoteric hierarchy depends, is secretly but absolutely necessary in preserving the existence of the world. If it ceased for one instant to exist, our entire world would crumble. This is why it is homologous with the archangel Seraphiel who, in the archangelic tetrad which supports the cosmic Throne, possesses the func­tion ofmaintaining life in general, the life ofthe cosmos. The pole has the task ofmaintaining life in the interior, spiritual sense, life in the true sense for man. This is the life which is henceforth invulnerable to the peril ofthe 16 This is why the Imamate is both a necessity and a divine grace, on the model of what is implied by the verse: \"To Himselfhas your Lord prescribed Mercy\" (6: 54).

In short, \"the pole is the cause of life-life in the true sense-for the men who people this world; it is the place where God looks for the vision that God has of the beings belonging to the visible and invisible worlds.\" This polar function culminates in that of the major Pole, the major polar function (qutbiyah kubra) of the \"pole of poles\". This is the esoteric dimension of prophecy, and as such it can belong only to the Imam . Every Imam of each of the great prophets has had his turn at being the pole of poles. In the present, post-Muhammadan period, the qualification belongs to him who, as the esoteric dimension of the Seal of the prophets, is the Seal of all the Friends of God: the twelfth Imam, at present occulted, invisibly present to this world until the day ofhis advent. It is certainly on this point that the Shiite and Sufi conceptions of the esoteric hierarchy differ from each other, for the non-Shiite Sufis have separated the two notions, transferring to their idea of the pole the function originally reserved by Shiism to the Imam. Sunnite Sufism has thus managed somehow to found an Imamology without an Imam, something which would be akin to Christianity founding a Christology without Christ. As a result, there is a certain ambig uity at the summit of the esoteric hierarchy. For example, Sufism refers to a personage below the major pole who is designated as al-ghawth (the help or aid), and we are told that he is the pole for so long as one looks to him for refuge and receives help from him . He is assisted by two Imams: one on his right whose gaze remains fixed on the Malakut (the spiritual world), and the other on his left, whose gaze is fixed on the Mulk (the visible, phenomenal world), and who is called upon to succeed the ghawth. It is hard to see how these two Imams could belong to the prophetic pleroma of the Twelve. Moreover, one might well ask oneself what exactly is the relationship between the pole called ghawth and the major pole. Haydar Amuli hints at least at the answers to these questions. It is understood that supposing there has been a pole in correspondence with each of the seven great prophets, then the seventh pole is the \"pole of poles\", the most eminent and perfect of them all. At present he is the Muhammadan Seal of the Friends of God, the twelfth Imam, the Mahdi to come, announced by the Prophet when he said, \"If there were only one day left to the world, God would prolong that day 64"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"TI-IE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE until the appearance of a man of my lineage, whose name will be my name and who will fill the earth with peace andjustice,just as until then it had been filled with violence and tyranny.\" We are told that the nearer someone approaches to this pole ofpoles, the greater is his authority, and such is the case with regard to the pole calledghawth and its two Imams. It is as if Shiism were to integrate to its own esoteric hierarchy this triad composed of the ghawth (temporarily called pole) and its two Imams, subordinating it to him who, mysteriously and invisibly present, remains until the end of our cycle the \"pole of poles\", the twelfth Imam .17 The other members ofthe esoteric hierarchy may now be distinguished. There are the four Awtad (plural of watad), the four pillars or cosmic \"tent­posts\", who stand at the four cardinal points ofthe world and on whom rests God's gaze when he looks at the world. Their persons are the centre ofa whole network of correspondences which \"balance\" the symbolism of the cosmic Temple and that ofthe Temple ofthe Ka'bah transfigured into a spiritual temple. These four awtad in fact correspond to the four arch­angels who support the cosmic Throne or Temple: Seraphiel, Michael, Gabriel and Azrael. In the same order, each ofthem corresponds to the heart of one of the four great prophets, Adam, Abraham, Jesus and Muhammad. Each represents one ofthe four corners (or pillars, arkan) of the Temple ofthe Ka'bah: the Syrian, the Occidental, the Yemenite and the Iraqi, in which the Black Stone is set.18 There are the seven AbdaL literally the \"substitutes\", \"those who per­mute\". They are called this for several reasons: first because they are the \"substitutes\" of the poles of the seven climes; then because, withdrawn into their subtle bodies, they can abandon their physical bodies whenever they wish, without anyone noticing their absence or the fact that that physical body is merely a substitute far their real presence; or, again, because as one of them is recalled to the superior worlds, a member from the rank below takes his place, or is substituted for him.19 All this hierarchy is thus penetrated by a continuous ascending movement. 17 Cf. N. al-N., §§ 612, 626-627. On the \"pole of poles\", see En Islam iranien ... op. cit., IV, book VII: 'Le XII • Imam et Ia cheval erie spirituelle'. 18 N. al-N., §§ 612-618.

As we must confine ourselves here to a brief exposition, without going into the details of the many variants, I will only call attention to the schema ofthe esoteric hierarchy establ ished by a great Iranian Sufi Shiite of the thirteenth century, Sa'duddin Hamuyah, as reported by Haydar Amuli. This hierarchy of Awliya ' or Friends of God comprises seven degrees: i. The group ofthree hundred Nuqaba� men of God who, like all the Awliya� remain incognito for the majority of men. 2. The group of forty Nujaba'. 3. The sevenAbdal. 4. A group with five members, of whom we are told simply that they assure the continuity ofbeing. 5. The four Awtad 6. The triad formed by the ghawth and its two auxiliary Imams. 7. The supreme pole or pole of poles. The total gives the figure of 360, which corresponds to the 360 degrees ofthe celestial Sphere. This hierarchy of seven ranks is the support of multiple correspondences: 1. The supreme Pole, being the first theophanic manifestation {m azhar), corresponds to the First Essence of the spiritual world which is the First Intelligence. 2. The triad of the ghawth and its two Imams corresponds to Nature, the Materia Prima, and the body; while its two Imams, considered separately, are set in correspondence with the Spirit and Soul ofthe world. 3. The correspondences ofthe four Awtad were noted above. 4. The group of five symbolize respectively those unities of the universe constituted by the Jabarut (the world of the archangelic Intelligences); the Malakut (the world ofheavenly Souls); the Mu lk (the world of phenomena); the mundus imaginalis{'alam al-mithal) or world of absolute Imagination{'alam al-khayal al-mutlaq); and finally, the Perfect Man. 5. The sevenAbdal correspond to the seven stars and other heptads. 6. The forty Nujaba' correspond to the \"forty dawns during which the clay ofAdam was fermenting\". 7. The 300 Nu qaba' correspond to the 300 remaining degrees of the Sphere, the 300 days of the year.20 But in fact Haydar Amuli, with Shiite inspiration, prefers to think that the entirety of these hierarchical degrees can be reduced to two groups: 20 Ibid., §§ 622-623, 628. 66"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE one of seven, which is the number of the great prophets, and one of twelve, the number of the twelve Imams, the Awliya' par excellence, who, as all initiates {khassah) know, are the causes of the persistence and order of the spiritual world21 Moreover, this schematization facilitates an application ofthe science ofthe Balance that enables us to establish more rigorously a system of correspondences which are not simply metaphors. Indeed, just as the order and persistence ofthe exterior world or \"exterior Heaven\" are due to the seven wandering stars, or planets, and the twelve fortified castles (bury· = m1p')'O<;, a high tower) or signs of the zodiac, so the persistence and order of the spiritual world or \"interior Heaven\" rest on the seven prophets and the twelve Friends of God par excellence. This rhythm of seven and twelve, heptad and dodecad, is expressive of a fundamental law of being, the very \"balance\" ofbeing. Thus, as the planets have their \"houses\" in the twelve zodiacal constellations, each prophet had his twelve Imams, spiritual dwellings of the religion revealed by him .Z2 While he follows his master Ibn 'Arabi very closely, Haydar Amuli nevertheless tends to lay an emphasis of his own on the correspondences of these hierarchies. Both ofthem, however, agree in placing at the origin of the group of seven the \"seven Angels ecstatic with love\" (al-Mala'ikah al­muhayyamah al-sab'ah) whom God created in the eighth Heaven. These seven Angels are the theophanic forms ofthe seven divine Names, called the \"seven Imams of the Names\", of which the seven great prophets were also, in virtue of their high level ofknowledge, the forms ofm anifestation (m azahir) in this world, just as the seven climes receive from the seven planets the influx and signatures that they communicate to their inhabi­tants. On the other hand, at the origin of the group of twelve are twelve Angels whom God created in the ninth Heaven, the unconstellated Sphere (the Heaven Atlas), and of whom the signs of the zodiac in the eighth Heaven or Heaven of the Fixed Stars constitute not the effigies, but the forms of manifestation, or dwellings. It is from these twelve Angels that the twelve Friends of God par excellence-that is to say, the group oftwelve Imams-receive the higher knowledge which they transmit to men, in the same way that the twelve zodiacal signs communicate to the inhabitants of the different climes the influx and energy they receive from the twelve angelic entities of the ninth Heaven. 23 21 Ibid., § 629. 23 Ibid., § 630. 23 Ibid., §§ 631, 637."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE When the science of the Balance is applied to prophetology, it necessi­tates in this way the interiorization of angelology and astronomy. Yet the identical rhythm disclosed by these exalted sciences proceeds from the very mystery of the theophany, and this is the point emphasized by Haydar Amuli. In the case of the group of Seven, we have to take into account the following. To re-ascend to the mystery ofthe theophany is to re-ascend to the secret of the pluralization of the unique Essence into multiple form s of manifestation or multiple theophanies. The sacrosanct divine Essence-true Being in its true abscondence-has \"infinite perfec­tions of essence; by virtue of each perfection it has an Attribute or qualification; by virtue of each Attribute, it has a Name; by virtue of each Name it has an Operation (determined and determining); by virtue of each Operation, it assumes a particular theophanic form (m azhar); by virtue of each theophanic form, it conceals a certain esoteric secret (sirr) ; by virtue of each esoteric secret there is a certain science which corresponds to it; by virtue of each science there is a certain wisdom (hikmah theos­ophia) which corresponds to it; by virtue of each wisdom there is a certain statute (hukm) known to the divine Essence alone.\" This is why a Koranic verse declares, \"He gives wisdom to whom he pleases. He who has been given wisdom has been given an immense good. But only those gifted with intelligence give thought to it\" (2:269). Those \"gifted with intelligence\" are the Nabis, the Imams, the whole assembly ofthe Awliya� the gnostics­in short, humanity's spiritual elite.24 The divine Names and Attributes form, therefore, a hierarchy which corresponds to the perfections of the divine Essence; and although they are infinite, their sources are determined. These consist of seven funda­mental divine Attributes: Life (hayah), Knowledge ('ilm), Power (q udrah), Will (iradah), Speech (kalam), Hearing (s am'), and Sight (basar). These Attributes postulate seven Names: the Living (hayy), the Knowing ('alim), the Powerful (q adir), the Willing (m uriel), the Speaking (m utakallim), the Hearing (s ami'), the Seeing (basir). These seven Names are what are called the \"seven Imams of the divine Names\", and are so many major theo­phanic modes in the spiritual and exterior worlds.

In the spiritual world, these epiphanic forms are the seven great prophets: Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus and Muhammad. In the exterior world, and corresponding to the \"seven Angels ecstatic with love\" ofwhom the seven prophets are the forms of manifestation, there are the seven planets: the Sun, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, Mercury and the Moon. There are also the seven climes, corresponding to the order of the seven planets; the seven Earths and the people who inhabit them; the seven degrees of hell (see below, section IV); the seven days of the week, and various other heptads. On the one hand, then, there are the seven great prophets, whose mission is to reveal a Book, and who correspond to the seven Imams among the divine Names: 1.

On the other hand, says Haydar Amuli, \"if you have studied this deeply, you will have understood that each of the seven celestial Spheres is equally the form of manifestation of a divine Name\", and that together they manifest seven divine Names which, with one exception-the Knowing-are different from the seven Imams named above. 1.

In assoc iating pro­phetology and astronomy, our author's profound conception is that ifthe order and system ofthe universe are regulated by the course ofthe seven planets through their zodiacal houses, then the order and system ofthe spiritual world rest on the seven prophets, whose twelve Awliya'-those called the Imams, poles, or heirs (awsiyaJ-are the stages in the course of its religion.

Thus, having presented his own point of view with regard to the system ofseven, Haydar Amuli limits himselfto mentioning a schema proposed by Ibn 'Arabi and based on the sevenAbdal. These are the seven mysterious personages committed respectively to the safeguard­ing of the seven climes. They are assisted by the angelic being that rules over each of the seven Heavens, and they receive the influx of spiritual energy emanating respectively from each of the prophets who, according to the recital ofthe Mi'rqj (the Prophet's heavenly ascent during a night of ecstasy), dwell in each ofthese Heavens. Here, Abraham, Moses, Aaron, Idris (identified with Enoch and Hermes), Joseph, Jesus and Adam are named. In the heart of each of the seven Abdai, each day and each hour, there occurs a theophany which is determined according to the patron saint of that hour and day, that is, according to the esoteric secrets concealed in the movements ofthe seven Heavens, and their assignment to their respective prophet. 30 This would seem to indicate something in the nature of an hourbook or an esoteric liturgical calendar. This, broadly speaking, is what Haydar Amuli has to teach us about the Balance ofthe Seven. Where the Balance ofthe Twelve is concerned, he proceeds in the same way, starting with his own point of view, and continuing with an exposition of an extremely complex system of angelo­logic astronomy to be found in the writings oflbn 'Arabi. He has already shown us how the Twelve originate in the twelve angels created primor­dially in the ninth Heaven or aJiar Heaven. 31 These angels receive the spiritual influx from, and thus correspond to, both the twelve Friends of God who are the twelve Imams, and the twelve signs ofthe zodiac. This dodecad marks the equilibrium and equity which conform to a primordial divine ordinance: it is the very balance ofbeing. One finds it again in the 29 Ibid., § 635. 30 Ibid., § 636. 31 The root tis connotes the idea of erasing (writing for example); the word tils signifies a page from which the writing has been erased; atlas means that which is totally bare, glabrous, like the ninth Sphere which is non-constellated."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE number twelve of the leaders {nuqaba1 of the tribes of Israel,32 in the twelve springs which gushed from the rock of Horeb when it was struck by Moses' ro d. It is also the reason why each ofthe great legislative prophets was succeeded by twelve heirs (sing wasi) or Imams. Adam, Noah, Abra­ham, Moses, Dav id, Jesus and Muhammad each had their twelve Imams -the list of them, already established by Mas'udi, 33 is well-known in Twelv er Shiism. Unfortunately, even though the names of the twelve Imams ofthe Seal ofthe prophets are well-known, the names ofthe others have largely been disfigured by the copyists and can be recognized only with difficulty. Nonetheless, it is possible, Bible in hand, to identify some ofthem. And it is this which is disconcerting. For it is hard to believ e that our Shiite gnostics could have invented this altogether; they must in this respect have been heirs to aJudaeo-Christian gnostic tradition, passed on by the Prophet himself, and which as yet we have been unable to trace.34 Thus, each of the seven legislative prophe ts had the duty of prepar ing and educating a spiritual heir {wasi) or Imam, to whom he would confide the esoteric secrets ofhis prophecy, ofthe Book which had been revealed to him. In this way the heir would succeed him as a witness and a guarantor (hujjah) before his people, and his community would not dispose arbitrarily, at the whim of each man's caprice and fantasy, of the Book and its hermeneutic. (As a Shiite, Haydar Amuli holds that it was the rejection of the Imam by an entire section of the community which has unfortunately brought on the confus ion and corruption reigning in Islam.) The twelve heirs (Awsiya1 or Imams (guides) of each prophet had thus to preserve his Word, his Logos, and to keep alive his shari'ah for the entire cycle during which his da'wah (his call, kerygma) prevailed, until the coming of a new prophet or, in the case of the twelve heirs of the 32 Cf the verses 5: 12: \"God received the promise of the children oflsrael.

Needless to say, this transmission of every prophet's heritage (wasiyah} through the medium of twelve Imams must not be confused with the Prophet's ancestry back to Adam, and the transmission of the \"Muhammadan Light\" from prophet to prophet. The question of Judaeo-Christian antecedents has been reappraised in new terms in Jean-Claude Vadet's 'Les Hamfs, \"La plus grande Loi de Moise\", les Saintes Myriades et la naissance de l'exegese islamique', in Revue des Etudesjuives (April-December 197 1), pp. 165---182. 72"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE Muhammadan period, until the final appearance ofthe twelfth ofthem.

Hay dar Amuli goes on to show us how it is us ed by Ibn 'Arabi, in the deployment of his angelologic astronomy. In the beginning the Most-High God established an archangelic heptad, known as that ofthe \"Angels ecstatic with love\", who are appar­ently identical to the Cherubim (Karubiyun). He appointed one of these Cherubim to be a chamberlain, and confided to him the whole science of his Creation. This Angel is the epiphany of this very science. One is inevitably reminded here of the \"Cherub on the Throne\" in Hebraic Gnosis, called also Metatron, Y ahohel. 37 Here the Cherub, prince of the celestial Court, is designated, by a letter of the Arabic alphabet, as the Angel Nun, in reference to the Koranic vers e 68:1 which contains the adjuration: \"By the Nun and by the Pen, and by that which they write.\" In fact, appo inted to th is Angel, God has established beneath him another Angel, the Pen (qalam) or Scribe (katib), who receives the epiphany of divine science through the mediation of the Angel Nun. In its transmission from one Angel to the other, the divine science becomes more limited: it passes from a state of knowledge that is global and synthetic to an order of analytical understanding concerned with the details of beings. Whereas for the Angel Nun the div ine epiphany is brought about by the N arne \"the 35 The ulu'/-amr, in preference to the banal translation \"the holders ofauthority\" .

In fact, as one descends in the hierarchy ofthe Intelli­gences, the number oftheophanies is mutliplied, uniqueness being a sign of ontological superiority. The Angel who is the Pen or Scribe is appointed to compile and write the great Book ofbeing. A sacrosanct Tablet {L awh) has been prepared for him, on which he has to write all that will come to pass, up till the day ofthe Resurrection. Elsewhere, Ibn 'Arabi says that the sacrosanct Tablet bears the same relation to the Intelligence called the Scribe as Eve bore to Adam.38 The number ofthe forms ofknowledge and science that the Angel scribe is commanded to write correspond to the figure of the 360 degrees of the celestial Sphere multiplied by itself?9 Next, God has established twelve governors of his Creation, whom he impelled to descend from the supreme Sphere (the ninth Heaven), giving them as dwelling-places twelve fortified castles similar to the tall towers built onto the ramparts of a city. These castles are the twelve zodiacal constellations in the eighth Heaven. He removed all the veils between them and the \"sacrosanct Tablet\", so that they are able to see, written on the Tablet, their names and respective ranks; just as they are able to see, written in th emselves, all the events to come until the day of the Resur-40 rection. Below these twelve governors dwelling in the supreme 'Heaven are established twenty-eight chamberlains who are in their service. Their respe ctive dwellings are the twenty-eight stations occu pied successively by the Moon in the course of each lunar month. Their number corresponds to the number of letters in the Arabic alphabet, and it will of course recur later in the \"balance of the twenty-eight\" .41 The twelve chamberlains, in their turn, have established their delegates, who are seven nuqaba' (or spiritual leaders) in the seven Heavens (the moving Intelligences or Souls of the seven Heavens). These nuqaba'-a term we have already encoun­tered in the nomenclature of the esoteric hierarchy-have the task of extracting and actualizing that which is potential in the twelve governors. Also in the service of the latter are those whom Ibn 'Arabi calls the 38 Cf Kleinere Schriften ... , op . cit., p. 49 (on the Arwah muhayyamah, the Spirits ecstatic with love) and p. 55 ofthe Arabic text. 39 N ai-N, §§ 651---652. 40 Ibid., § 653. 41 Ibid., § 654. 74."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE \"guardians ofthe Temple\" or \"templars\" (sadanah) ,42 in addition to myr­iads of auxiliaries comprising twelve categories which correspond to the twelve governors. Their names appear in the Koran, and Ibn 'Arabi is thus in a position to systematize Koranic angelology for the first time. The names of the twelve categories of angelic beings are as follows. There are \"those who repulse\" (37:2); \"those who recite\" (37:3); \"those who distri­bute\" (51 :4); \"those who are sent\" (77:1); \"those who disperse\" (77:3); \"those who seize\" (79:1); \"those who extract gently\" (79:2); \"those who precede\" (79:4); \"those who swim\" or \"float\" (79:3); \"those who deliver the word\" (77:5); \"those who conduct the affairs ofthe universe\" (79:5); \"those who are ranged in order\" (37:i)43 The idea is, then, that everything inscribed on the \"sacrosanct Tablet\" requires the intervention ofthese angelic hierarchies in order to pass into a state of actualization in this world. It is they who are responsible for the penetration into this world ofthe dispositions ofthe \"decree\" (qazda� and the \"destiny\" (qadar) inscribed on the sacrosanct Tablet, but they have no power to allow the penetration of anything which is not written on this Tablet. All these hierarchies are subordinate to the twelve chamberlains, excepting, of course, the \"Seven Spirits ecstatic with love\", who are God's intimates. The majority ofmen sees only the dwellings ofthese intermedi­aries; but, says Ibn 'Arabi, it is given to the spiritual elite to see them in their dwellings, in the same way that most men see the heavenly bodies without seeing either the persons of the chamberlains or the nuqaba'. 44 42 On this tenn sadanah (templars), cf Kleinere Schr{ften ... , op. cit., p. 74, and pp. 36-38 of the Arabic text. 43 N al-N, § 658. Nevertheless, Hay dar Arnuli cuts short the quote from Ibn 'Arabi and does not go into detail in naming the twelve categories of Angels. This does not make it less important to know their names in order to understand diagram no. 8 (here, fig. 1). The quote is taken from Ibn 'Arabi's Futuhat I, p. 296. \"There are those who, day and night, each morning and evening, rise up from God and from us to God, and speak only good about us . There are those who intercede for whoever is on Earth, and there are those who only intercede for believers, because they are filled with divine zeal (or divinejealousy),just as those who intercede fo r anyone on Earth are filled with mercy( ... ).

He is now in a position to construct a first diagram (fig. i = diagram no. 8; cf. below, the detailed description in the Appendix), in which he brings the spiritual world ofthe seven prophets and the twelve Imams into correspondence with the heptads and do de cads of the exterior world. The following is a very brief description of this first diagram. 45 Beginning at the top and reading from right to left, we read in sequence, in the twelve small circles inscribed on the circumferent ring, the names of the twelve Signs of the Zodiac-the respective dwellings of the twelve Angel-gover­nors-entered in the exterior hemicycle of each circle (the Ram, the Bull, the Twins, and so on). In the interior hemicycle of each little circle are the names ofthe twelve angelic categories in the service ofthe twelve Angel­governors who dwell in the twelve signs ofthe zodiac (those who repulse, those who recite, those who distribute, and so on). The twelve are arranged in groups of three. On the outer part of the ring, between each triad, is inscribed one triad from among the twelve months ofthe year. At the top on the right are Muharram, Safar, Rabi' I, etc. On the inside ofthe ring are four of the divine Names: the First, the Last, the Revealed, the Hidden. In the centre is a double circle also forming a ring, with seven small circles inside it. In .the outer hemicycle of each small circle are the names of the seven planets. Beginning from the top, these are: the Sun, Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, Mars, Saturn. In correspondence with these, with their names inscribed in the inner hemicycle, are the Intelligence, the Soul, Nature, the Materia Prima, the body, the Throne, the Firmament. At the centre is a little circle bearing the inscription: the manifested world (whose system of correspo ndences is represented by the diagram). To the side, in the comers of the figure, arc four circles, each with a double inscription: i. The Intelligence. Man. 2. The Soul. The Angel. 3. Nature. The Genie (Dj inn). 4. The body.

Like our authors Haydar Amuli and Ibn 'Arabi, we must bear in mind the idea which in Islamic theosophy corresponds to the idea of the pre­existence of the Logos in Christian theology. Here, this pre-existing Logos is called the Haqiqahmuhammadiyah, the eternal Muhammadan Reality, Logos, Light and Holy Spirit of Muhammadan prophecy (in the Shiite perspective, it is composed of Fourteen Aeons of light: those of the prophet, of his daughter Fatimah, and of the Twelve Imams). This Muhammadan Spirit, designated as the Sp iritus Rector (al-Ruh al-mudabbir), pre-exists in the world ofMystery {'alam al-ghayb), the non-manifested spiritual world; and this was the Prophet's meaning when he said: \"I was already a prophet when Adam was still between water and clay [did not yet exist].\" This idea imposes another: that of the reversal of time, which itself presupposes that the form oftime is cyclical. A first cycle runs its course bearing the Name \"the Hidden\" {al-Batin: the Hidden in relation to us), in the sense that the prophetic Muhammadan Reality or Essence is present in an occult, secret and esoteric way in the mission of all the prophets of the \"religions ofthe Book\" who preceded the manifestation ofMuhammad. This can be seen as an exemplification of the motif of the Ve rus Propheta in Judaeo-Christian prophetology. In saying \"I was already a prophet before Adam was created\", not simply a \"man\" or a \"being\", the Prophet meant that he was already the holder of the prophetic charisma before all the prophets who were, respectively, so many \"forms of manifestation or epiphany\" (m azahir) within which the eternal Prophet, the Ve rus Propheta, was secretly hidden This cycle is fulfilled with his corporeal manifestation in this world. There then comes about a reversal oftime with the inaugur­ation of a new cycle, that of the Name \"the Manifested\" (a l-Zahir. the Manifested in relation to us). If the Prophet himself has declared that \"time has a cy clical form \" {istiddrat al-zaman), it is in order to denote that at the moment of his terrestrial epiphany, time returned to its original condition, as it was when God created it (this relates to the idea of the thema mundi). The metaphysical Muhammadan Essence was at the origin 46 Ibid, §§ 663-665. 77"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"TilE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE of the mission of the prophets, and in its earthly epiphany it is the final Seal ofboth prophecy and the prophets. The point which is simultaneously the final point of the cycle of prophecy, where Muhammadan prophecy remains occulted, and the initial point of the cycle of its manifestation, marks a moment of privileged equilibrium between the Hidden and the Manifest. This idea of a point which is at once both initial and final, and which as such involves the idea of a return to equilibrium by means of the move­ment oftime conceived as cyclical-this idea orients the analysis towards a perspective within which, under the notion of time {zaman), is seen to lie that ofthe balance {mizan). The analysis is facilitated by a process made possible by philosophical algebra, or the philosophical science of letters {'ilm al-huruj) -a process equally familiar to the Jewish Cabbalists. In effect, there is scope for the consideration that the consonants forming the word ZaMaN (time) are exactly the same as those forming the word MiZaN (balance). Now, the value of a word does not alter when one inverts the order ofthe consonants ofwhich it is composed. In this case, the equivalence thus found between the concept of time and that of balance is corroborated by many Koranic verses where allusion is made to the Balance and the eschatological significance of the Balance.47 The con­clusion is that the beginning and the end of time relate to the zodiacal sign of the Balance. \"Every cycle of time ends in the Balance\" ; and it is from the Balance that the other Signs are manifested. The Balance is the sign of the harmony of things and of divine equity, the notions of equilibrium and 47 Ibid., § 665. Ibn 'Arabi, in the context quoted by Haydar Amuli, introduces the Koranic verses as fol lows: \"The prophet has said: I and the final hour are like these two (fingers). And God himselfhas said: We will establish the balances in equilibrium on the day ofthe Resurrection (2 1:47). And we are told: Weighjustly, and do not lhlsifY the balance (55:9). And again: He has raised the Heavens and established the balance (5 5:7). Thus, by means of the balance, God has revealed in each heaven the fi.mction of that heaven (4 1:12). And by means of the balance he has distributed proportionately over the earth the fo ods that the earth produces (4 1:10). And God Most High has set up a balance in the universe for each thing: a spiritual balance and a material balance. The balance never errs. In this way the Balance enters into speech and into all the arts whose object is perceived by the senses. In the same way, it enters into Ideas, for the primary origin of terrestrial bodies and celestial bodies, and ofthe Ideas which they support, is found in the law ofthe Balance. Similarly, the existence oftime and ofthat which is above time proceeds from the Mensura divina (al-wazn al-ilahi) to which the Name the Wise {hakim) aspires, and which is made manifest by the equitable Judge. After the Balance Scorpio is manifested, together with the res divina which God has placed in it. Then come Sagittarius, Capricorn, and so on.\" 78"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE equity being two aspects of the Balance. It might seem that Haydar Amuli ought to have constructed his diagrams in terms of the primary role played by the Balance. If he has not done so, it is because in reality, in this context, the Balance is more than a zodiacal sign. It is that metaphysical principle ofwhich we spoke at the start, and which as such organizes the totality of the diagram and establishes the system of correspondences. We can, in fact, read the next diagram without difficulty (fig. 2 = diagram no. 9, cf Appendix). In the preceding diagram, we had the names of the twelve Signs of the zodiac (the dwellings of the twelve Angel­governors in the ninth Heaven), and in the little circles inscribed on the circumferent ring these were coupled with the names of the twelve cat­egories of angelic beings in their service. Here, corresponding to them, and distributed in four triads, are the names ofthe twelve Imams ofthe period of Adam (Seth, Abel, Gainan, etc.; the other names, apart from Idris and Enoch, have suffered such mutilation graphically that we will not go into them here; see Appendix). Corresponding to these twelve Adamic Imams are the twelve Muhammadan Imams, from 'Ali al-Mur­tada, the first Imam, to the twelfth who is at present hidden: Muhammad al-Mahdi. Also in the circumferent ring, grouped into four intercalary triads and inscribed both above and below the line, are the twelve Imams of the Mosaic period and those of the period of Jesus. We pass now to the central circle. In the preceding diagram, the seven planets were brought into correspondence with the seven unities of the universe or the universe-principles: the Intelligence, the Soul, Nature, etc. Here, we find the seven great prophets sent to reveal a Book. Each of them is doubled by the mention of whoever was the \"pole\" (qutb) ofhis period; the seventh pole is the \"pole ofpoles\", the twelfth Imam ofthe Muham­madan period. The arrangement is slightly different from that of the central circle in the previous diagram. The little circle in the middle ofthis central circle bears the name of the prophet Muhammad, and the six others are grouped all around. This is because-as announced by the small tangential circle above-we are dealing with the spiritual world {'alam ma'nawi). The position ofMuhammad is right at the centre ofthe prophets, because throughout the cycle dominated by the name \"the Hidden\", these prophets were his epiphanic forms {mazahir). Thus this position is intended to suggest to us that in spiritual circles the centre has the virtue of being the circumference as well (this ts a 79"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE peculiarity affirmed in the Theology attributed to Aristotle, and one whose consequences our spiritual masters have explored to the full) .4 8 Like the seven planets ofthe astronomical Heaven, the seven prophets are in some sense the \"motive fo rces\" in the spiritual Heaven, by means ofwhich the spiritual being (rnhaniyah) ofthe Vems Propheta continues to grow until the moment of his plenary terrestrial manifestation in the person of Muham­mad49 Nevertheless, the rhythm of the prophetic periods, and hence the limits which, by marking the beginning and the end of each, di stinguish the one from the other, are conditioned by the twelve Imams who consti­tute the pleroma ofeach period ofprophecy. Thus the same science ofthe Bal ance enables us to grasp the correspondences between the function of the seven and the twelve in the astronomical Heaven (fig. i) and in the spiritual Heaven of prophecy (fig. 2) . We grasp eo ip so the consequences and potentialities that arise in this way fr om th e conjun ction ofthe concept of time and the idea of the balance. In effect, it is the idea of the balance which gives ti me its cyclical fo rm. The balance returns to equilibrium at the end of the cycle, and this equi librium is the return oftime to the starting point which th en becomes once more the starting point ofa new cycle . We said at the outset that the science of the Bal ance is the very foundation of the corresp ondences between the worlds: without the idea ofthe balance, there can be no worlds in correspondence with each other . The correspondences established by our authors woul d be impossible if the only image they possessed was of ti me as rectilinear and unlimited, like that of present-day ev olutionism. Thanks to the Balance, it is possible to set in correspondence th e figures whi ch are found in every cycle, fo r they are then seen to be homologous. Our current schema of history possibly permits certain analogies to be made, but these in fa ct remain metaphorical because they lack both what establishes and what permits the science of the Balance. Moreov er, it is not enough to substitute (as did Oswald Spengler) the schema of a cyclical conception of hi story for the perspective of a linear evoluti on-the schema of a continual genesi s, regulated by a hi storical causality immanent in the uninterrupted succession of phenomena. For then the question arises: how is understanding (the act ofunderstanding) 48 Cf the last part of my article, 'Le Motifdu voyage et du messager en gnose irano­islamique' (unpublished). 49 N al-N, § 666. 80"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE possible from one cycle to another, if each cycle is self-contained? The science ofthe Balance permits an understanding which effects the passage from one cycle to the next; and it does so by stabilizing the flux ofHistory and by establishing, through the system of correspondences that it equili­brates, a level oftranshistorical permanence between homologous dramatis personae. The science ofthe Balance spatializes the succession oftime by substituting for the order of succession the order of simultaneity, the unity ofthe \"cupolas\" ofwhich we spoke at the start. It is this that makes the diagrams constructed by Hay dar Amuli, as well as the correspondences inscribed on them in the form of homologous figures, perceptible to us on the level of the imaginal. Thus, too, is revealed the eschatological significance of the Balance. In effect, it returns time to its origin, to that origin, we were told, which it is itself It brings about a reversal of time, and hence there is nothing that is \"irreversible\" (that word which has been so abused in our day!). The science ofthe Balance does not, to be sure, permit a philosophy of history, because a philosophy of history can be perfectly agnostic and its mode of perception may stem from brute realism. On the other hand, it permits a historiosophy which is eo ipso a gnosis, and whose mode of perception is essentially a visionary one. If our authors speak of the growth of the \"spiritual being\" of Muhammadr in other words, of the Verus Propheta, this growth is operative and percep­tible not on the level of common historical reality, but on the level with reference to which early primitive Christologies spoke of Christos Angelos. This, broadly speaking, is what is suggested by the balance ofthe seven and the twelve, applied to the manifested world and the spiritual world, to the astronomical Heaven and the interior Heaven. Tog ether they total nineteen, and it is on this number that the two universes are constructed, as Haydar Amuli will now attempt to show by deploying the \"balance ofthe nineteen\". III. The Balance ofthe Nineteen The deployment ofthe \"balance ofthe nineteen\" comprises three stages, traversing the \"three Books\" ofwhich we spoke in the opening section of this chapter. A In the first of these stages, the science of the Balance brings the \"Book of Horizons\" into correspondence with the \"Book of Souls\". B. In the second stage, the science of the Balance clarifies the 81"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE corresponding structure ofthe third Book, the revealed Book: the Koran. C. During the third stage, the science of the Bala nce brings the structure ofthe interior Paradise into correspondence with that ofthe interior Hell. A Like the \"Book ofthe Koran\" (a l-Kitab al-Qur'ani), both the \"Book of Horizons\" (Kitab afa qi) and the \"Book of Souls\" (Kitab anfosi, cf Koran 41'53)-in Paracelsian terms the \"interior Heaven\" and the \"exterior Heaven\" -are each seen to possess a numerical structure based on the number nineteen. Thus the hermeneu tic of all three Books will among other things be directed towards establishing their correspondences with regard to the three numbers involved in their respective structures. 50 True, these three Books were written by the Angel who is the Scribe, at the dictation of the Angel Nun, the \"Cherub on the Throne\"; but it goes without saying that our author considers their structure to be based on the actual nature ofthe numbers, and for this reason he refers at some length to the arithmosophy ofPythagoras, as expo unded in the celebrated Encyc­lopaedia of the \"Brothers of the pure heart\" (Ikhwan al-Safa�. 51 \"Know,\" he writes, \"that the wise Pythagoras was the first to discourse on the nature of number. He said beings come into existence in conformity with the nature ofnumber. Consequently, he who understands the nature of number, its species and properties, is in a position to know the various genera and species ofbeings.\" Necessarily , things are one with respect to Matter (hayuli) and multiple with respect to Form (surah). There must be dyads (matter and form, the subtle and the gross, the luminous and the dark, etc.); triads (surface, line and volume; past, future and present, etc.); tetrads (the four natures, the four Elements, the four awtadorpillars ofthe cosmic tent); there must be pentads, hexads, heptads, decads, etc. Unfortunately, the dualists were fascinated by the dyad; Christians by the triad; natural philosophers by the tetrad; and so on. Pythagoras and his followers, on the other hand, dispensed justice where justice was due. They saw very clearly that the One is the cause ofnumber, and that all numbers, small or big, even or odd, are constituted by the One. The One gives its name to every number; number persists because the One persists; number grows and augments by the repetition ofthe One. It is because a 50 Ibid., §§ 669, 688, 736. Haydar Amuli is referring here (§ 669) to his Ta'wilat, fur which he made nineteen diagrams. I believe him to mean his great spiritual commentary on the Koran (al-Muhit a/-a'zam); cf my introduction ill La Philosophic Shi'ite ... , op. cit., pp. 46 ff 51 Ibid., §§ 670-674. 82"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE dyad is a dyadic unity, for example, that it is different from a triadic unity, and so on. We find here, therefore, a reaffirmation ofthe old saying, Ens et Unum convertuntur: the concept of being and the concept of One are reciprocal, for each being only comes into being because it is one being. This ontological unity is invariable and has no second; the formula which expresses it is 1 X 1. Consequently, it makes possible the series of arithmetical unities which are constituted into unities subsequent to the arithmetical unity of the number One-that is to say, 1 + n. Thus, explains our author, two is the number of the First Intelligence (as the second existence); th ree is the number of the universal Soul; four is the number ofNature; five, the number ofthe Materia prima; six, that of corporeal volume; seven, that of the Celestial Sphere; eight, that of the Elements; nine, that of the three natural kingdoms, that is to say, the mineral world (corresponding to the order of tens), the vegetable world (corresponding to the order of hundreds), and the animal world (corre­sponding to the order ofthousands). We can now grasp the full significance of the statement that \"every number contains in itself an esoteric secret which is not to be found in any other number '' Now, the system ofthe World is ordered according to the number nineteen. When the theosopher ponders on the esoteric secret ofthe number nineteen, he discovers that if this number regulates the structure of the world, it is because the entire universe is in the image ofGod ('ala surat al-Haqq, secundum Formam Dei). It is in the justification ofthis concept of the universe as Imago Dei that the secret of the number nineteen resides, as it is also in the same justification that there resides the secret of the law of correspondence between the three great Books written at the dictation of the \"Cherub on the Throne\", in other words, the Balance of a hermeneutic which is common to all three Books. For our author, Haydar Amuli, it is evident that when the prophetic tradition states that \"God created Adam in His image\", one should understand Adam to mean the universe, the cosmos in its entirety, the Makranthropos (al-Insan al-Kabir, Homo Maximus), that is counterbalanced by earthly Man as the microcosm. Since the cosmos itselfis in the form of Man-of the Anthropos-and since Man is himself a universe, the Imago Dei must have reference to both: they are two homologous forms of the same theophany. 83"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE At this point, Haydar Arnuli provides an excellent hermeneutic ofthe Koranic verse 41:53, where God declares: \"We will show them our Signs on the horizons and within their souls, so that it will be clear to them that He is Being.\" It is a hermeneutic which, on the initiative ofthe verse, he puts forward in the first person52 \"This verse,\" he says, \"alludes to the two forms of the theophany (zuhur Allah). Its esoteric meaning is the following: We will show th em our Signs, that is to say, our tokens and emblems which, in the world above and in the world below, together constitute the horizons, and which in the human world constitute the world of souls. Un til it is clear to them that being in its entirety is composed ofthe epiphanic forms ofmy Essence, my Names and my Operations; and that in reality there can be nothing other than Myself, or, rather, that the Other does not possess being in reality, because the Other signifies, precisely, my own individualized and particularized theophanic forms, which subsist by virtue of my real, universal and absolute being, in the same way as what is limited subsists by virtue ofthe absolute, as the shadow subsists by virtue ofthe sun, and as the form ofmanifestation subsists by virtue of that which it manifests. For this reason I have said: He is the First and the Last, the Manifestedandthe Hidde n (57:3). And I have said: Wh ichever way you turn, there is the Face of God (2: 115). And I have also said: All things are perishable except his Face ... and it is to him thatyou return (28:88). This is why the gnostics have said: Only God is able to be-God, his Names, Attributes and Operations.\" And here Hay dar Amuli cites two well-known quat­rains: \"My Beloved has shown himselfto me in every aspect I Thus I have contemplated him in every Idea and in every form I He said to me: Thus it is good. But when I Things are contemplated by me, it is you who are a copy ofme.\" \"Glory be to him who has manifested his humanity I Like a hidden secret of the brilliance of his resplendent divinity I And who has then appeared to us in the manifest state in his creation I In the form of someone who eats and drinks.\" 53 52 Ibid., §§ 675-676. 53 . L. Massignon attributes this quatrain to Hallaj, but neither Ruzbihan nor Haydar Arnuli confirms this. It is not necessary to read a Christian meaning into the quatrain, although of course a Christi an is at liberty to do so . It is even more permissible for a Shiite thinker to see in it an obvious allusion to the Imam, or else as envisioning the secret of divinity manifested in the beauty of ephemeral human beings (which is how Haydar Arnuli understands it); for that is the secret of their \"imperishable Face\" (28:88), in virtue ofwhich they are the epiphanic fo rms of divinity. 84"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE What is the reason for all this? Why this apparent digression? Haydar Amuli anticipates the reproach: the point of it all is that what is de sig­nated on the one hand as the universe, the cosmos, and on the other hand as Man, fo rms a Whole which is one and the same, constituted ofall the theophani c fo rms. The supreme secret (al-si1r al-a'zam) is that the universe is \"in the image ofGod\" and that, for the gnostic, the Whole fr om one point of view is the di vine Being, and fr om another point of view is the cosmic Adam or Anthropos, because the Whole reflects the Image of the hi dden Treasure that created the world because it aspired to be known­to know itselfin the mirror ofcreation. This is the secret ofthe fi rst two Books, th e \"Book of Horizons\" and the \"Book of Souls\" .54 The science of the Balance can then effect a detailed proof of this. The exterior or manifeste d world obeys the rhythm ofthe number nineteen; it is in fact constituted by the Intelligence of the universe, the Soul of the universe, the 9 Celestial Spheres, the 4 Elements, the 3 natural kingdoms and, fi nally, Man. The total gives 19. Or again, as we saw earlier, it is constituted by the 7 planets and the 12 signs of the Zodiac, which also total 19. This fi gure is also the number ofman, ofanthropology. Man is constituted by hi s personal intellect, hi s personal soul , ten faculties de sig­nated as the five external senses and the fi ve internal senses, four soul s­designated in Koranic terminology as \"the soul which orders (evil)\" (al­nafs al-ammarah), \"the soul which censures\" (al-lawwamah, the cons cience), \"the inspired soul \" (al-mulhamah), \"the pacified soul \" (m utma'annah)-and lastly, three pneumas or spirits: vegetative (rnh nabatiyah), vital (r. hayawa­niyah), and psychic (r. nafsaniyah). The total is nineteen. In the same way, the spiritual world is constituted by the seven great prophets and their twelve Imams, that is to say, ... by the seven poles and the twelve Awliya' or Friends ofGod. The total is again 19.55 The correspondence between the world as Homo maximus and man as microcosm justifies the attribution to both of the Im ago Dei, mani fested respectively in their two theophani c fo rms. This correspondence is further expressed by the fa ct that the cosmos can be designated as God's major caliph, and man, the Anthropos, as the minor caliph. The inverse is equally true: man's caliphate fu nction also embraces the universe, since the latter is manifested to and for man.

These invisible pillars are an allusion to the Perfect Man as the cosmic Anthropos, through whom the celestial Spheres subsist together with the Angels who are their moving Souls, like the visible pillars upholding a palace or a dome. As for the invisible pillars which support the spiritual Heaven, they are to be understood as that which constitutes the Spirit, the Heart and the Soul of the world, that is to say, the metaphysical reality of that Perfect Man who is unknown to all save God, since \"My friends are beneath my tabernacles (my cupolas, my domes). No-one knows them except myself.\" This hadith again affirms itself here in order to remind us that the Perfect Man is exemplified at all the various levels of the esoteric hierarchy, which are these invisible pillars supporting the spiritual Heaven. We noted at the beginning ofthis study the terms by which they are designated. They are the prophets (Nabi), the Messengers (n abi-mursal), the Friends of God, the Imams, the poles, the caliphs, the pillars (awtad), the abdaL and so on. But it is understood that the most eminent among them, those who determine the others, are the nineteen already mentioned-the seven prophets and the twelve Imams-who correspond to the nineteen ofthe external world, and on whom ultimately depends the movement of the periods which articulate a cycle; for this movement is the movement ofthe Bala nce brought back to the initial equilibri urn. 56 This, broadly speaking, is the \"Balance ofthe nineteen\" as a hermeneu­tic which brings into correspondence the two first Books: the \"Book of Horizons\" and the \"Book of Souls\". We must now apply it to the third Book, which is the revealed Book-the \"Book of the Koran\" ; and we will see how the hermeneutic brings it into correspondence with the first two Books by means of the secret of the same number, 19.

It is this number that regulates the structure of being wi th regard to both the esoteric and the exoteric, the visible world, or Mu lk, and the world ofthe Soul, or Ma lakut.

And this is what the theos­ophers mean when they speak of 18,000 worlds (a figure, moreover, as well-known in Ismaili gnosis as in the Jewish Cabbalah.)58 Indeed, for Haydar Amuli the number 18 designates the \"unities of the universe\" or universe-principl es, the order ofthousands, symbolizing the multitude of parts which make up each one. When the Perfect Man is added to the number 18, the total figur e of 19 is obtained. We are led to the same conclusion when we analyse the hexaemeron, the six days ofCreation, taking into account the Koranic verses: \"One day for your Lord is like one thousand years in your reckoning\" (22:47); and: \"It is He who created the Heavens and the Earth and that which is between them, in six days\" (25:60). The Heavens are the world oftheJa barut (the world ofthe Intelligences and the di vine Names). The Earth is the Mulk, the world ofvisible things.

Here, Haydar Amuli observes that being (kawn), in relation to the nine levels deduced from it, is homologous to unity in rel ation to numbers (from one to ten, the progression starting again ab initio after ten), or to substance in relation to the nine accidents. Each time we have ten plus the nine levels, giving a total of 19. Thus, we have the First Intel ligence and the nine celestial Spheres, making up 10, to which are added nine levels-the nine Intelligences which govern the Spheres­giving a total ofl9. Or again, we have the ten Intelligences, together with the nine celestial Souls that move the nine Spheres in an act of love towards the Intelligences from which they proceed; and here the total is again 19. Now it is on the basis ofthis same number-19-that, in correspondence with the \"Book of Horizons\" and the \"Book of Souls\", the \"Book of the Koran\" {al-Kitab al-Qur'ani) is constructed. It is true that the letters of its script num her twenty-eight (the letters in the Arabic alphabet). Neverthe­less, 14 ofthese (halfofthem, that is) belong to the world ofthe Mulk, the disposed (Heaven) into seven heavens (in the space d) two days, and he revealed to each heaven its fimction .. .' (41:9--12). The questioner may now say triumphantly: \"So God created Heaven and Earth in eight days (2 + 4+ 2), not in six! \" But he has his answer ready: \"Your conclusion is without value. The four days refer only to a complementary and supplementary creation, the creation of material substances. The separate spiritual substances transcend such measures.\" And this, fur him, is the heart of the matter: where is the sense in taking these days to mean what the literalist commentators take them to mean, since \"when\" the Creation took place, neither day nor time existed? It is more to the point to understand the six days as six stages: mineral, vegetable, animal, man, genie, Angel; or, the Jabamt, the Malakut, the Mulk, the Living, the Genie, the Angel; or again: the Intelligence, the World­Soul, Nature, Matter, the Body, the Elements. The whole question, moreover, is dominated by the meaning ofthe word day. This can only mean the \"divine day\", which possesses two aspects: the days of lordship (ayyam al-rububiyah), and the days of divinity (ayyam al-uluhiyah). Divinity is God's link with the man whose God He is in the spiritual order of things (ma'nan). Lordship is God's link with the man whose Lord (r abb) he is in the manifested (suratan) order of things . That is why the gnostics say: lordship has a secret (sirr); if this secret were made manifest (and thus abolished), the relationship of lordship would be destroyed. Now the \"day of lordship\" is the day which, according to the verse 22:47, is equal to a thousand years in our reckoning, so each day ofthe hexaemeron can be reckoned as a millenium of lordship; while the \"day of divinity\" is equal to 50,000 years, which is the figure of a total cycle in Ismaili gnosis as well. This is attested by the verse: \"The Angels and the Spirit ascend towards him in a day whose measure is 50,000 years\" (70:4). §§ 722-725.

The remaining 14 belong to the world of the Malakut; they are without diacriti­cal marks and are the original letters.

There are thus five grades which, added to fourteen, give a system of 19 grades of letters. Such is the system of letters in the Arabic script in which the Koran is written. But this is not all. Each surah is headed by a set phrase-the same phrase which is repeated by the believer before any undertaking: Bism Allah al-Rahman al-Rahim: in the name of God the Compassionate, the All­merciful. This phrase is regarded as a recapitulation of the entire Koran. Now, in the Arabic script, it comprises 19 letters. Philosophical algebra sees in each of these letters the symbol of a stage in the descent of divine Mercy from one level ofbeing to another. When added together, the seven and the twelve which we encountered in the preceding diagrams thus confirm the properties of their correspondences. A rigorous transliteration of the nineteen letters of the Arabic script which constitute the Basmallah gives the following: BSM ALLH AL­RHMN AL-RHIM. The Prophet expressed himself in a striking manner on the virtues of this invocation: \"He who desires immunity from the 19 henchmen ofHell needs to recite the Basmallah; for on the day ofthe Resurrection, God will make a paradise out of each of its constituent letters.\" Shortly, we will examine the practical implications ofthis statement. For this invocation does indeed recapitulate the entire Koran, and the first of its letters, B (the Arabic ba� is itself the recapitulation of the Basmallah. Again, as the Prophet said: \"God has made one hundred and four books descend from Heaven. The knowledge contained in one hundred of these books he stored in four of them: the Torah, the Psalms, the Gospel, and the Koran. The know ledge contained in the first three of these four books, he set down in the fourth, the Koran. He set down this knowledge in the Mufassal (the part from surah 49 to the end). This he set down in the Fatihah (the first, \"opening\" surah of the Koran). Lastly, he set this down in the ba' (B) of the Basmallah.\" Thus, the letter ba' recapitulates (totalizes) all that is in the Koran and in all the revealed celestial books.

To quote the first Imam once more: \"I am the dot beneath the letter ba'. \"60 The letter ba' comes at the origin ofbeing, and its esoteric secret makes it a symbol ofthe First Existence, designated as the First Intelligence, the Reality ofRealities (Haqiqat al-Haqa'iq), the Supreme Spirit. Whereas the letter alif (which consists of a simple vertical stroke, with no ensuing ligature possible) symbolizes the unique divine Essence, alone and un­seconded, the letter ba' symbolizes the primary Unity of all subsequent unities.61 In the same way, each letter ofthe Basmallah gives its name to one ofthe existences ofthe higher and lower worlds. Haydar Amuli refers here to the long khutbah (homily) with which he opens his vast spiritual commentary on the Koran, a homily which is a typical example of\"narra­tive theosophy\" . It begins as follows:62 \"Glory be to him who has made the letter alif, alone, the origin of All and the symbol ofthe pure and absolute Essence; who has made the letter ba' the cipher of the First Determination, the First of all limited beings beneath absolute being, the first ofits epiphanies; and who has made the other letters the symbols, respectively, of the other existences.

He has given the name of The Mother of the Book (the archetype of archetypes) to the letters of the eternal 60 N. al-N., §§ 689-690. 61 There is a serious problem implicit here. The first Intelligence is designated as the \"Primary Existence\", and as such is symbolized by the letter ba'. The pure divine Essence as the source of being, symbolized here by the letter a/if, is thus beyond being, hyp erousion. Elsewhere, as in the writings of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i for ex­ample, this state ofthings makes the letter a/if, precisely, the symbol ofthe initial Determination, which is the Intelligence.

In other words, we are shown the correspondences between the \"exterior Heaven\" and the \"interior Heaven\", between physical astronomy and spiritual astronomy, the \"Book of Horizons\" and the \"Book of Souls\" . It is worth recalling at this point a statement by Paracelsus such as the following: \"Should you wish to investigate the composition of man in its entirety, then you must realize that the bodies of the firmament are contained in the body of the microcosm. For the stars in the body of man, like the external stars, possess their properties, natures, courses and situs, and differ from them only in the substance of their form \"66 Similarly, the great mystical theosopher Simnani spoke of the \"prophets of your being\" .67 It is the nineteen letters ofthe Basmallah that enable Haydar Amuli to effect the correspondences between the Heavens of cosmology and the Heavens of prophetology, since they recapitulate both the manifested and the spiritual universes. If the Basmallah is here the Balance which verifies this correspondence, it is because the secret ofthe theophanies, the secret of the manifestations of the pure Essence (which, as we saw, is symbolized by the letter alif, there being no ensuing ligature possible), is ultimately identical with the secret of the manifestations, in the other letters, of this same alif. Haydar Amuli subjects this fundamental and original correspondence to an analysis of great subtlety, based on the Arabic spelling of the three words bism, Allah and Rahman, in which three alifs are in fact occulted or disguised. 68 If we consider the Arabic sp elling which is transliterated by BSM ALLH AL-RH1-1N, we will realize that between the B and the S (the ba' 66 Cf.

These three occulted alifs symbolize respectively the pure divine Essence, the divine Attributes, and the divine Operations. This same Essence is the cause of three levels: 1) the Unitude {ahadiyah) of absolute, unseconded being; 2) the Unity {wahidiyah) which is the first in the series of unities and which marks the first limitation ofbeing; this is the median level ofthe First Intelligence as the second hypostasis; 3) the limitation of the terminal being, which corresponds to the third hypostasis, the Soul, the level of the divine Operations designated as the level of the rububiyah or lordship. On this level is established the reciprocal relationship between the personal God or lord {rabb) and his vassal {marbub), a relationship which renders them interdependent; it is the level of the \"God created in the faiths\" .69 How, then, in the three words Bism, Allah and Rahman, is the letter alif able to \"symbolize\" with the theophanies? It is in this way. Divine Being manifests itself in the multitude of its theophanies {mazahir). But this multiplicity is only such in virtue of the relationships and additions which are precisely what one eliminates when one affirms the esoteric or ontological tawhid, in other words when one affixms that divine Being alone is, in the true sense of the word. At the level of the theophanies, there is multiplicity and the Other, there is the relationship between the personal lord and his vassal-a relationship typified in the traditional words: \"I was a hidden Treasure. I desired to be known, therefore I created Creation.\" At the same time, the essential, absolute occultation and secrecy of divine Being are affirmed in the verse: \"God can dispense with [both] the universes\" (29:6); and it is here that the symbolic pre-eminence of the letter alifbecomes evident.

This implies the establishing of a relationship which, in its turn, entails both a multiplication and the fact that there are letters other than the letter alif. There is thus a perfect correspondence between the manifestation of divine Being in its theophanic forms and the manifes­tation of the letter alifin the diversified forms of the other letters. Conse­quently, every existing thing can be defined according to its correspon­dence with one ofthe letters: one may be designated by the ba', another by the jim, another by the dal, and so on. The divine Essence (dhat ilahiyah, the divine Ipseity) is brought into relationship with each existing thing, and from this bringing into relationship arise the multiplication and the de­nomination of divine Being by the name of each existing thing (the name ofthe first Intelligence, the name ofthe Soul ofthe World, and so on). In the same way, a relationship is established between the letter alif, and each ofthe other letters, resulting in the multiplicity ofthe ABJAD (a, b, c, d), and in the denomination of the alifby the name of every letter (the ba: the jim, the dal and so on are the names of the alifs forms of manifes­tation).

In virtue of the Balance which requires equilibrium between the hidden or esoteric (batin) and the manifest or exoteric (zahir), we should also take into account the three levels in the world ofintelligences (Jabarut), the world of Souls (Malakut), and the world of material bodies (Mulk). Here, once again, 9 + 9 = 18. When man's own universe is added, we have a total of In short, Hay dar Amuli is of the opinion that the totality of worlds, from whatever angle and in whatever mode it is viewed, is 19, including Man. And he is fully aware of disclosing in this way the most extraordinary meanings (m a'ani, ideas), \"inspired by the Invisible, and for which there exists no precedent among the Ancients\"72 This is also the dominating sentiment in the third deployment ofthe \"Balance ofthe nineteen\", which equilibrates the levels of the interior paradise and the interior hell. C. We have read, above, the advice of the Prophet: \"He who desires immunity against the 19 henchmen ofHell needs to recite the Basmallah.\" This is an allusion to the Koranic verse 74:30, which says that \"above Gehenna stand nineteen [guards].\" Haydar Amuli meditated at length on this verse, with regard to which two questions immediately arise: I. What are these henchmen of Hell? 2. Why is their number limited to 19? I. In order to reply to the first question, one must bear in mind the correspondence between the exterior Heaven and the interior Heaven, and hence between the exterior paradise and hell on the one hand, and the interior paradise and hell on the other; for it is in the inner meaning of paradise and hell as internal states of man that the answer will be found. It depends on man whether the Angels ofhis paradise are changed into the demons ofhis hell. All connection and attachment engender a perma-71 N al-N, § 703. The Koranic verse 27:12, which commands Moses: \"Put your hand inside your breast, and you will take it out all white without its being diseased; this will be one of the nine signs\", is interpreted as referring to the nine exterior corporeal worlds, and the nine hidden spiritual worlds whereby Moses exercises his miracle-working powers over the fo rmer. § 704. 72 Ibid., § 705. 97"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE nent disposition or habitus (m alakah, i'� �o;;) which \"possesses\" {m ilk) his interior being and becomes its \"dominant\" . Theology calls these habitus by the name of \"Angels\". But there are habitus which are excellent, valiant and beautiful, and it is these which are properly called \"Angels\"; and there are habitus that are vicious, craven and ugly. These go by the name of \"henchmen\" (z abaniyah) of hell, while the former are called by one of the names of Paradise-Ridvan whose Angels they are. The correspondence between the two worlds is clear. The Angels signify the Powers (a l-quwa or al-quwwat, &uv<if.Luo;;) who are active both in the macrocosm and in the microcosm. As Ibn 'Arabi puts it, the Angels are the Powers ofthe makranthropos, ofthis \"Great Man\" (insan kabir) who is the universe, just as in the microcosm, in the interior Heaven, the spiritual and psychic Powers are the Angels of man's existence; for within man the Powers ofthe cosmos are assembled and recapitulated in a condensed manner. It is with respect to these Powers that the habitus, the permanent dispositions of man, are ordered. The more a man is attached to this world, the more vicious and vile is his ethos or inner state. The less his attachment to this world, the more beautiful, strong and subtle his inner state. Why, then, is mention made of 19 connections and 19 habitus, based on the number of Angels who guard the threshold of paradise and the number of henchmen who are the guardians of hell? It is because the interior paradise and hell; precisely because of the correspondence between the exterior Heaven and the interior Heaven, are not extrinsic to this world. As the Prophet reminds us: \"Paradise and hell are closer to each one of you than the clasp of his sandals.\" Inevitably, therefore, there is a correspondence between this paradise and this hell and the \"nineteen\" ofthe exterior Heaven, that is to say, the 12 signs of the zodiac and the 7 wandering stars. Our author stresses that this is clearly what astrology teaches when it relates man's atta chments and his permanent dispositions to the signs ofthe zodiac. This is why, in one case as in the other, the whole complex forms a series of nineteen. The object of the mission of all the prophets, as of the contents of all the sacred Books revealed by Heaven, is the same: to induce man to free himself, to break all links with the nineteen. This was the meaning ofthe Prophet's utterance recommending the recitation ofthe Basmallah with its nineteen letters, so 73 Ibid \"§§ 706-707. 98"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE that each of these letters might become a paradise for man on the day of his resurrection. Once he has broken his attachments, he escapes the nineteen henchm en who are hell and rejoins the nineteen Angels who are paradise. 74 All worldly links must be severed in the name ofan exclusive devotion to the service of the divine. Here indeed may be understood the traditional teaching of the mystics which originates in the utterance of the Prophet: \"Die before you die.\" This mystical anticipation of death, this \"death before death\", is rooted in the idea that at the outset man's natural life is not, in this world, the life ofhis true nature. In order to live according to his true nature, he must undergo this voluntary mystical death, which is actually his second birth. Another utterance ofthe Prophet's states: \"Hu­man beings are asleep; it is when they die that they awaken.\" By means of this same utterance, Ibn 'Arabi (see below, section V) will finally offer us a dazzling insight into the meaning of the \"science of correspondences\". Here, sleep is ignorance and unawareness. Wakefulness is gnosis, the awareness of being awake;75 it is to be an Egregoros. A Koranic verse refers to this: \"He who was dead and to whom we gave life, and whom we have set as a Light, so that he should walk with it among men-is this man like him who walks in darkness, and who will never emerge from it?\" (6:123). Haydar Amuli comments on this: \"He who has undergone the voluntary death of mystical initiation, whom we have made alive with the true life which is knowledge, gn osis, visionary power (m ushahadah), and whom we have set among men as someone who possesses knowledge, as a gnostic, as someone who sees (m ushdhid)-is he like the man who is no more than a corpse amid the darkness of ignor­ance?\" Life in the true and authentic sense is not life in the biological sense; it is Light, the Light which in the Koran always signifies knowledge, life, being. Light is Being itself, and as such it is invulnerable to darkness and death. In order to liberate this Light and restore it to its invulnerability, it 74 Ibid., § 708. 75 Yaqcrzah.

No! they are living with their Lord; from him they receive their subsistence, and are fi lled with joy by the fa vour with which God overwhelms them.\" Thus, according to the ta'wil, death is to be underst ood in a spiritual sense: one di es to the darkne ss and hence to death itself, in the natural sense, for this mystical death leads to a hi gher form of existence, to the immortal life which is maintai ned by the spiritual nourishment ofknowledge, gnosis, inner revelation {kashf) .t This is the signi ficance that Haydar Amuli gives here to the \"martyr s\" fallen on the pathway of God; and in so doing he is perhaps close to the meaning ascribed to \"martyrs\" by a hermetic alchemist such as Zosimus, who was well aware that the birth and growth ofthe subtle body-ofthe body of resurrection within man-presupposes that the \"martyr \" passes through the di ssolution represented by the stag e ofnigredo. This dissolution is here that ofthe many connections concealed in the ni neteen. Hence the conclusion: \"He who in this world does not dissolve the ties resulting fr om hi s dependence on the twelve signs of the zodiac and the seven planets, remains, after hi s physical exitus, in the power ofthe habitus produced in him by those attachments which are designated as the nineteen henchmen of hell. \"77 2. Our fi rst question has been answered by these considerati ons. It may appear that, because ofthe correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm, we have at the same time received the answer to our second question, as well: why is the number ofthese henchmen limited to 19? But in fa ct the question is one offar greater complexity, and there might even be something ridiculous in limiting these habitus to 19. In limiting the number ofthe habitus ofman's inner being-that is to say, the Angels of his paradise or the henchmen ofhis hell-to 19, one is taking into account only global categories, the \"unities ofthe universe\" (as is the case when one speaks of the Jabarut or the Malakut); but when it comes to going into detail, and to visualizing particular thing s in all their singularity, only God knows their number and limits.

The object of carrying out his enquiry into the number 19, encountered in the three great Books, is suggested to him by two references. One of these, in the Koran (69:32), alludes to a chain of 70 cubits; the other is contained in this utterance ofthe Prophet: \"God has 70,000 Veils of light and darkness; if He were to raise them, the splendours of His Face would set alight any creature who met His gaze. \"78 Are not this chain and these Veils related in some way to the 19, and especially to the 19 demons of hell, against whom one must guard by the recitation of the Basmallah and by substituting for them the 19 Angels ofparadise? Our author observes, firstly, that if the 19 letters of the Basmallah are, as the preceding diagrams have illustrated, an adequate cipher ofthe gradu­ation of the system of the worlds-the manifest world and the spiritual world-a detailed realization of them is only achieved according to the system of the letters as a whole. He has already alluded to this when he recalled that of the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet, the fourteen undotted letters relate to the Malakut or spiritual world, while the other fourteen, which are furnished with diacritical marks, relate to the Mulk or manifest world. This is the system that we will be considering in conclusion, when we examine the \"Balance of the twenty-eight\". The theme of the 70,000 Veils oflight and darkness has promoted a considemble body ofli terature among the mystical theosophers. What Haydar Amuli wishes to envisage here is the idea that both chain and veil denote all connection and attachment to this world, ofwhich man must be free before his exitus. He considers that his great forbears, such as Ghazali, Fakhruddin Razi, Najmuddin Kubra, Najmuddin Dayah Razi, and Fakhruddin 'lraqi79 were not able, in spite oftheir efforts, to explain the figure 70. By contrast, he says, \"it happened that God opened the eye of our inner vision ... so that we discovered and contemplated the state ofthings as it is in reality, and wrote a treatise in Arabic and a treatise in Persian on the subject, in which we explained it in various ways. \"80 78 Ibid., §§ 714-715. 79 On all these figures, see my Histoire de Ia philosophie islamique, part II: 'Depuis Ia mort d' Averroes jusqu' a nos j ours'.

He recalls how one arrives at the total of 18 levels of cosmology (18 or 18,000 worlds), and how by adding the world ofthe Perfect Man one obtains the total of 19. Needless to say, as the science of the Balance demands, it must be understood that these 18 \"unities of the universe\" each comprises an exoteric and an esoteric dimension, that is to say, one aspect which pertains to the Mulk, the world manifest to the senses, and a counterpart which pertains to the spiritual world or Malakut When their double aspect is taken into account, the 18 \"unities ofthe universe\" give a total of36. In accordance with the preceding method of calculation, these 36 \"unities of the universe\" are to be added to man's own universe, since this latter was added to the 18 levels of cosmology to give 18 + 1 = 19. Here, if we understand him correctly, Haydar Amuli proceeds by another course, inverse and complementary. The 18 universes are regarded as being the chains and the veils in relation to man, and it is with man that they become 19. Now, however, it is a question not of adding man to the sum of these universes, but of extracting him from it. To extract man from these universes so that he may constitute his own universe, free of chains and veils, amounts then, from the point ofview here envisaged, to subtracting him from their totality. This gives 3 6-1 = 35.81 These 35 are to be taken into account both in the \"Book of Horizons\" and the \"Book of Souls\", and this gives us the figure of7 0-that is to say: 70 worlds, 70 veils, 70 chains, with respect to the global unities, but 70,000 Veils and 70,000 chains with respect to the detail symbolized, as before, by the order of thousands. Quod erat demonstrandum.82 This, broadly speaking, is how the \"balance ofthe nineteen\" is elabor­ated, verified as it is in the correspondence between the \"Book ofHorizons\", the \"Book of Souls\" and the \"Book of the Koran\". Our author has indicated in passing how the 28 letters ofthe Arabic alphabet are linked to the 19 letters ofthe Basmallah, thus \"ciphering\" the genesis ofthe worlds. We will encounter this number 28 again in connection with the way in 81 If this were not so, it would be hard to see how, since mm is not included in the 18 (he is added to make the 19th), the author could subtract him from the 36 (= 18 X 2) to get 35 . Ifhe is not there, how can he be subtracted?

But in Hay dar Amuli, the \"balance of the twenty-eight\" fits into a vast whole which is one ofthe culminations ofhis prophetic historiosophy. Another culmination is the \"balance of the seventy-two\", which embraces the totality of the history of religion, both before and after Islam, in an inspired and grandiose perspective. Unfortunately, we have no room to describe it here. iv. The Balance of the Twenty-Eight The \"balance ofthe twenty-eight\" could be said in some sense to function at the heart of prophetology in general. It aims particularly at manifesting the pleroma constituted by the Muhammadan period of the prophetic cycle, and it does this by distinguishing the ideal topological correspon­dence between the levels that denote, respectively, the ancestors and the descendants of the Prophet ofislam . The undertaking is something quite different from that of a linear construction, vector of a philosophy of history that envisages either a necessary causality immanent in facts, or a purely contingent succession ofthese facts. In our case, \"facts\" are envis­aged as ordered and dominated by a transcendental law, the superior law of a structure which determines things in the form of cycles (or \"cupolas\", as we said before). A homology exists between the respective stages of each cycle, and this makes it possible to bring the personages they locate into correspondence with each other. In conformity with a distinction which we have already established, the law itself, transcendental and transhistorical, is that of a historiosophy, not of a simple philosophy of history. Prophetology in general acknowledges the existence of 124,000 prophets: not Nabis who perforce have possessed the quality of Messengers, but Nabis pure and simple. For each ofthese Nabis there was a Friend of God (a wall) who was his spiritual heir (his wasi). According to this order of things, there were 124,000 Awliya' corresponding to the 124,000 Nabis. But, as we already know, prophetology proper sees the seven great legisla­tive prophets as occupying an incomparable rank. As we also know, each of them was succeeded by twelve Imams who were their spiritual heirs until the coming of a new prophet83 This applied also to the prophet of 83 Ibid., § 731. 103"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE Islam who, unlike previous prophets, was the Seal of prophecy and of prophetology, and whose twelfth Imam was and will be the \"Seal ofthe Awliya\"' of his period. If this is the case, how is the Balance which equilibrates the ancestry and descendancy of the last of the legislati ve prophets to be established? Our authors applied themselves to reconstructing the fa mily tree ofthe prophet Muhammad back to Adam. Altogether it fo rms a chain of 51 links. Prominent positions are occupied by 'Abdul-Muttalib, common ancestor ofthe Prophet and the first Imam; by al-Nadr ibn Kinanah, fr om whom originated the tribe of the Qurayshites; and by Ishmael, son of Abraham, through whom we go back to Arphaxad, of the line of Shem. After this, it only remains to identify, beneath an orthography that is more or less accurate, the names which occur in the book of Genesis. 84 Hay dar Amuli observes that of these 51 ancestors, 17 were prophets, 17 others were kings, and 17 more were Awliyaff-a remark bearing witness to the perpetuation in Islamic gnosis ofthe arithmologi cal virtues ofthe number 51, considered as a multiple of 17 (17 X 3) . The famous al chemistJabir ibn Hayyan already regarded the corporeal worl d as \"governed by the num­ber 17, which is supposed to reproduce here below the image, admittedly di storted, of the celestial man\". 86 There are two further things to be noted, a) The ancestry ofthe prophet traced through the male line, fr om fa ther to gr andfather, is still an exot eric one; it leaves untouched the probl em ofhis esoteri c ance stry through the line ofKhadijah, his wife, and ofher cousin the Christian monk Waraqah, 84 Ibid., § 732. In fuct, although 51 names are mentioned, Haydar Amuli lists only 46 of them. After the line of ascent from Ishmael to Arphaxad, the list accords with the Book of Genesis n: 10---32. 85 Ibid., § 733. 86 Cf Paul Kraus, Jah ir ibn Hayyan, op. cit., II, pp. 216-217, 222-223, who has gathered together some suggestive comparisons. In the Nusayri tradition, 51 (= 3 X 17) dignitaries stand at the gates of the town of Harran (the town of the Sabian hetmeticists, described in the manner of the heavenly Jerusalem) to receive the just who will inhabit Heaven (cf the Revelation of John, 21:10 ft). According to certain Jewish gnostics, there are 17 primordial Beings. According to the Shiite gnostic Mughirah ibn Sa'id (died 119/737), 17 is the number of people who will be resurrected at the appearance ofthe Mahdi, \"and each of them will be given one of the letters of the alphabet composing the supreme Name of God\". In the 153 fishes of the miraculous draught offish (John 21:11), St. Augustine discerns a triangular number whose base is 17. The number 51 is the number of daily prayers said by the first Imam; it is also the number of treatises (17 of them on physics) in the Ismaili Encyclopaedia of the \"Brothers of the pure he art\" (Ikhwan al-Safa'), and so on. 104"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE who initiated Muhammad into the meaning of his first vision, b) It is important to emphasize the position occupied by al-Nadr, first ancestor of the Qurayshites; he is fourteenth in line, a position that will make it possible to establish, on the basis ofthe figure 28, the balance between the Prophet's exoteric ancestry and his esoteric descendancy in the person ofthe Imams. Because the male ancestry described above is still exoteric, it does no more than retraverse the line of the Muhammadan Light (Nur muhammadi) which lies at the source of Muhammad's prophetic charisma. This pre­eternal, spiritual Light was transmitted from prophet to prophet, as a single Light unique to prophecy and to the Imamate (\"I was, together with 'Ali, a single Light before God, before He created Creation\"), until, from 'Abdul Muttalib onwards, it splits into the two persons of the Prophet and the Imam . The purity of this Light excludes all tarnishing during the stages of its transmission, to such a degree that one must in passing exercise a certain precision with respect to the true identity of Abraham's father.87 The balance, then, ofthe Prophet's ancestry and descendancy is estab­lished on the basis ofthe figure 28. The importance for prophetology ofthe figure 28, already encountered in this context, is revealed at once. Indeed, the prophets mentioned in the Koran are 28 in number, and this number is eo ipso a distinguishing mark of the prophetology common to the \"religions ofthe Book\", to the Abrahamic \"ecumenism\" which covers the prophetic continuity from the Bible to the Koran. It is this continuity that permits the prophet of Islam to revive the scriptural antecedents of his own Revelation. The teachings to be inferred from the figure 28 are more easily foreseeable in that they have already been outlined. The number of prophets mentioned in the Koran conforms to the number that regulates 87 N al-N, §§ 733---734. The precision which our author brings to bear in passing is prompted by the Koranic verse 6:75, where it is said that Azar was the lather of Abraham. Azar had been a worshipper of idols before being converted by Abraham, and it is absolutely out ofthe question that the Muhanunadan Light, transmitted from prophet to prophet-which is, needless to say, a mystery deriving from subtle physiology-should reside in loins that are impure. In fuct, Azar was Abraham's uncle, and the Koranic verse, says Haydar Amuli, merely confirms the Arabic usage of calling an uncle by the name of \"father\". Actually, Abraham was the son of Terah, and on this our author is in agreement with the Bock of Genesis, 11:26. It is by virtue of the impeccability (cf the concept ofavc%JLapTTJTO� in Judaeo-Christian prophetology) required ofthe prophets and the Imams that Haydar Amuli defends the memory of Abu Talib also, who was both the father of the Imam 'Ali and the adoptive father of the Prophet. 105"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE the common structure of the three great books. The \"Book of Horizons\" comprises 14 levels: the 1st Intelligence, the 9 celestial Spheres, and the 4 Elements. Taking into consideration both the exoteric and the esoteric aspects, at the level of the Mulk and the Malakut the total obtained is 28. The same is true ofthe \"Book ofSouls\" and ofthe \"Book ofthe Koran\", which consists ofthe 28 letters. Equally, when one considers the 7 prophets in the \"world ofhorizons\" and in the \"world of souls\", taking into account both their metaphysical and their manifested aspects, the total obtained is again 28 (7 X 4 ). 88 There is more than this. We have noted that the 19 henchmen ofhell mentioned in the Koran had to be counterbalanced by the 19 Angels of paradise. In a similar manner, Ibn 'Arabi (whom Haydar Amuli quotes again at this point) saw a structure ofhell counterbalanced by the structure ofparadise organized in terms ofthe figure 28. The inhabitants ofhell fall into four categories, for Iblis-Satan's strategy is to assail men \"from before and from behind, from their right and their left\" (7: 17). 89 Moreover, Gehenna is said (15:44) to have \"seven gates\", seven levels or circles, among which are distributed the four categories of \"infernals\". When this number (4) is multiplied by the number of circles (7), the result is 28. Ibn 'Arabi's topography ofHell has been compared, by the great Arabist Asm Palacios, to that described by Dante. 90 These 28 infernal dwellings correspond to the 28 letters which make up the kalimat, the words whereby unbelief and faith are manifested in this world; for God speaks and addresses each man through the faith or the lack of faith which is in that man, through his sincerity or mendacity; and evidence ofGod subsists in the world in the very words men utter, even if they utter them only to deny God. We have already seen how hundreds and thousands can serve to denote-symbolically, not statistically-the plurality concealed in each \"unity of the universe\". Here, each infernal dwelling is regarded as being made up of one hundred levels, which gives 88 Ibid., §§ 736-737. 89 Ibid., §§ 738-739.

The blessed also fall into four categories: the prophet-legislators, the Nabis pure and simple, the Awliya ', and the ordi­nary believer s. Once again, the number obtained is 2,800 (700 X 4). Thus, the scales which weigh Creation in the two worlds of paradise and hell are absolutely accurate. Consequently the figure of28 prophets men­tioned in the Koran conceals a profound wisdom, the same wisdom as that which has established between the two worlds correspondences of which we know practically nothing91 There is, then, an essential connection between the science of the Balance as a science of correspondences, and the recognition of theo­phanies; for there is not a creature that is not the theophanic fonn (mazhar;) of one of the divine Names, and the science of correspondences consists in homologi sing the theophanies of a single divine Name at all levels of the universe as well as in each cycle of prophetic hierohistory. It is in this respect that the number 28 demonstrates its arithmosophical virtues, for, as well as denoting the number ofthe prophets mentioned in the Koran, it determines the structural homology between the two cycles fonned by the ancestry and the descendants of the prophet of Islam. Haydar Amuli derives inspiration here from the subtle clues provided by a thirteenth­century author, Muhammad ibn Talha92 While speaking above of the Prophet's 51 ancestors that go back to Adam, we mentioned the significance to be assigned to al-Nadr ibn Kinanah as the founder of the tribe of the Qurayshites. This is because the Prophet declared that \"the Imams who come after him shall be of the Quraysh\". Thus, the Imamate of an Imam, even though he were an Arab, would be neither legal nor legitimate ifhe were a non-Qurayshite. Such a privilege doubtless bestows an incomparable dignity and nobility on the tribe of the Qurayshites, but it means eo ipso that in the Prophet's ancestry, 91 N al-N, §§ 740-741.

Round about, and reading from right to left, are the names ofthe 12 ancestors ending with Malik al­Nadr, whose name is joined by a written stroke to the small circle at the side which bears the name of al-Nadr ibn Kinanah. 94 In its turn, the diagram schematizing the Prophet's descendants corre­sponds strictly with the preceding diagram. Here we are once again reminded ofthe reason why the number ofthe Imams is limited to twelve. This necessary limitation possesses four aspects: a) It is symbolized in the 12 letters which make up respectively the double affirmation ofthe Islamic faith: the Affirmation of the Unique (LA ILH ILA ALLH = La ilaha ilia, Allah), and the affirmation of the Prophet's mission (MHMD RSUL ALLH = Muhammad rasulAllah). Now the Imamate derives from this dual 93 On al -Nad.r ibn Kinanah, ancestor of the Qurayshite tribe, see Safinat Bihar al-arrwdr, II, p. 424, s.v. qrs. He is not to be confused with al-Nad.r ibn al -Harth, Safinat, II, p. 594, whose name is associated with a strange recurrence oflranian fe rvour. He had gone to \"Persia, and announced to the Qurayshites on his return: Muhammad told you the story of 'Ad and Tharnud; I shall tell you the story of Rustarn and Isfandyar. His audience found the story so beautiful that they ceased to listen to the Koran. It seems that he was a companion of Abu Jahl , and was killed by 'Ali after the battle ofBad.r, ibid., II, 210. 94 N al-N, §§ 747-751. The situs of the Prophet thus determines the equilibrium between his twelve Qurayshite ancestors and his twelve Imarnic descendants. In connection with this, it will be observed that the first Melchizedek, who comes into Enoch II, is preceded by 12 priests (13 counting Nir, Noah's brother), and that the second Melchizedek, king of Salem, was the originator of a line of 12 priests.

The progression oftime marked by the revolution ofthe stars, especially by the revolution of the ninth Sphere, is necessary if the benefits which result from the stars' course are to propagate themselves in the terrestrial world. The course ofthe stars is regulated with reference to the computus ofthe twelve months and the twelve hours ofthe day and ofthe night. In the same way, by virtue of the perfect correspondence between the two worlds, the invisible action of the Imams on the spiritual world is regulated with ref erence to their number, which is twelve. 96 The time {zaman) of the Imamate is the balance {mizan) which equilibrates the esoteric aspect of the Imamic lineage of the twelve Imams with the exoteric aspect of the lineage ofthe Prophet's twelve Qurayshite ancestors. When typified in the form of a cycle homologous to the preceding one, the time ofthe Imamate is to such a degree a \"liturgical time\" that each ofthe twelve hours ofthe day and of the night is under the protection of one of the Twelve. In contrast to chronological time, which flows in irreversible succession, liturgical time establishes that level of transhistorical permanence to which we referred earlier. It is perpetually there; it does not conceal a past which has passed away. Its very succession ensures not its flowing away, but its return. The present time of the Imamate is the mean-time of the hidden Imam, whose liturgical recurrences will continue until the \"Day of the Resurrection\". In this way, the structure of the diagram showing the Imamic lineage, in correspondence with the line ofQurayshite ancestry, becomes immedi-95 Ibid., §§ 753-754. \"And that is why, on the night ofthe 'Aqabah (the surrnnit of Mina where the Prophet was first acknowledged publicly), when the Messenger of God received the oath ofhis companions, he told them: Pick me out from amongst yourselves twelve leaders like the twelve leaders of the children of lsrael. Which they did. So this became a custom to fo llow and a special number. Hence this saying of the Prophet's, expressed in different ways: the Imams after me will be twelve in number. The first of them will be 'Ali; the last will be the Mahdi.\" 96 Ibid., § 755. 109"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE ately recognizable (fig. 6 = diagram no. 13; see Appendix). In the circum­ferent ring are the 12 Imams starting with the twelfth, followed by those belonging to the line ofthe 51 who make up the lineage from Muhammad to Adam. The two names at the highest point-the point of origin and return-are here no longer those of Adam and the \"Seal of the Prophets\", but of Adam and the \"Seal of the Awliya' (Khatim al-Awliya�, the twelfth Imam. In the preceding diagram, the central circle was inscribed with the names of the 14 Qurayshites-that is to say, of the twelve ancestors together with al-Nadr, their origin, and the Prophet himself in the small circle in the middle. Here, in the small central circle, is the name of Fatimah, daughter of the Prophet and origin of the line of Imams. But because Fatimah is called the \"mother ofher father\" (Umm abiha), she is the origin both of the Prophet's ancestors and of his descendants. All around the little circle with her name are distributed circles containing the names ofthe twelve Imams; reading from left to right, these go from the 12th to the 1st Imam, who rejoins their source in the person of the Prophet. The Prophet's name occupies a small circle at the side, sym­metrical to the one that in the preceding diagram contained the name of al-Nadr ibn Kinanah, origin of the Qurayshite line. On the one hand, then, there are the 12 Qurayshite ancestors, in addition to the initial figure ofal-Nadr and the final figure ofthe Prophet Muhammad. These give a total of 14. On the other hand there are the 12 Imams, together with the Prophet and his daughter Fatimah, the Imams, origin who links their line with that ofthe Qurayshites. These, too, totalJ4 (the \"Fourteen Immaculate Ones\", the Fourteen Aeons of light of the Haqiqah muhammadiyah). The balance is exact: 14 + 14 = 28. The equili­brium of the balance is established on the basis of this number, which thus authenticates itself as the esoteric number ofthe Muhammadan period of the prophetic cycle, corresponding with the 28 letters, the 28 phases of the Moon, and so on. 97 In conclusion, we will quote our author: \"The light of the Imamate guides hearts and intelligences along the way ofTruth (or the way ofGod, tariq al-Haqq), showing them clearly the goals on the road to salvation, just as the light of the Sun and the Moon guides the eyes of ere atures along the ways ofthe visible world. It shows them clearly those ways which are well-97 Ibid., § 758. 110"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE marked and easy, so that they can follow them, as well as those which are abrupt and perilous, so that they can avoid them. Both are guiding lights: one directs the eyes ofthe interior vision, and is the light ofthe Imam ate; and the other guides the eyes of the exterior vision, and is the light ofthe Sun and the Moon. Each of these two lights possesses stations for its transference, its migration. The stations of the light which directs the eyes of exterior vision are the twelve Signs of the zodiac, of which the first is Aries and the last the sign of Pisces. This light is transferred from one to another of the twelve Signs, until it reaches the last Sign, the twelfth. Similarly, the stations of the light which directs the \"eyes of the interior vision, the light of the Imamate, are also limited to twelve, and are the twelve Imams: \"We offe r these parables to men; only the Wise understand them\" (29:43)98 This Koranic verse, cited by our author in conclusion, confronts us with the ultimate question: what, basically, is this science of correspondences­correspondences which engender symbols and thus form the substance of the only true stories that are, perhaps, the parables? How is such a science of correspondences possible, and who therefore is capable of it? The answer, or at any rate an answer, to this question can be found in some extraordi­nary pages-yet are they not all extraordinary?-of the great work oflbn 'Arabi. v. The horsemen of the Invisible and the science of correspondences At this point, let us take up some of the themes left to one side in the course of this study. We have been told that throughout their life in this world, men's mode ofbeing is one ofsleep. Could they, during this sleep, perceive the meaning and have an understanding of parables which, as the Koranic verse has just told us, are only understood by the Wise Ones? Who then are these Wise Ones? They are described to us by Ibn 'Arabi, in three marvellous chapters, as the \"horsemen\" or the \"knights of the Invisible\", and it is thanks to them that there can exist in this world a \"science of correspondences\". In addition, when we made our brief survey of the esoteric hierarchy in Shiism and Sufism, we came across the categories of the Awtad, the Abdal 98 Ibid., § 757. 111"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE the Nujaba� the Nuqaba' and so on (see above, section 2). There was one category that we deliberately omitted for the time being, since the appro­priate moment to discuss it had to be deferred until now; and this, precisely, is the category designated by Ibn 'Arabi as the Rukban or Ruk­kab, the \"horsemen\" .99 Needless to say, it is a cavalry, or knighthood, whose function is strictly esoteric, a \"cavalry of the invisible worlds\" which is incognito to the eyes of men. There are two categories of these horsemen. The first is made up of those who are mounted on great contemplations and sublime visions; the second is formed ofthose mounted on great actions, great enterprises. The two categories could be said to correspond on the one hand to a speculative, contemplative knighthood, and on the other to one devoted to practical activity. The first category, composed of contemplatives, is designated as that ofthe Afrad: the Peerless, the Incomparable, the Unique. On the level of man, they correspond to those Angels who were previously described to us as the \"Angels ecstatic with love\" for the divine beauty and glory (cf supra the seven Cherubim who, in the Dionysian hierarchy, would more likely be the Seraphim; cf. also the Seven in the books of Enoch, the book of Tobias, the Apocalypse, the seven Source-Spirits inJacob Boehme, and so on). These Angels are essentially dedicated to the celestial liturgy. The second category ofknights, those devoted to practical activity, corresponds, on the level of man, to the Angels whose task it is to rule over a world and to govern the things ofthis world. As we shall see, it is thanks to them and to their equitation that something like a \"science of correspondences\" can exist. We are told that to the knights ofthe first category God has entrusted a supernatural power, 100 and that this is why they conceal themselves beneath the veil of the pavilions of the Invisible (suradiqat al-ghayb), or even beneath the veil of ways that are contrary to their state. In a sense 99 Cf. Ibn 'Arabi, Kitah al-Futuhat al-Makkiyah (The Book of the spiritual Conquests of Mecca), I, pp. 199 ff., chapters 30--- 32. The vast critical edition ofthis, undertaken by Usman Yahya, has not yet reached the passage in question. Ibn 'Arabi distin­guishes between thefwsan, the horsemen, and the rukban, those who ride on camels or, to be exact, dromedaries (hujun), a sport at which the Arabs of Arabia are expert. Their group is associated with the taste for eloquence, for heroic poetry, for genero­sity-in short, for whatever is characteristic ofthe \"chivalry ofthe desert\". This is why Ibn 'Arabi chose the name of rukhan. In fact, throughout these pages as well as in the dictionaries we are concerned simply with \"horsemen\". 100 Ibid., p. 20 1. 112"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE they are \"volunteers of disapprobation\" (m alamatiyah) should they judge it expedient in order to preserve their incognito; they are Fityan (plural form of fa ta), a term whose appearance in this context is all the more distinctive in that it designates the members of thefutuwwah-that is to say, of the Islamic equivalent of our Western phenomenon of chivalry and comradeship.101 They are men who are absolutely free (abriya'), free even of the authority of the Pole (Qutb) that is the summit of the esoteric hierarchy: they are not at the Pole's disposal. On the contrary, they are themselves designated as poles, not because they are in charge of a group and rule over it as leaders-they are too highly placed far that-but because of their mystical status and their service to the divine. They exercise no command because they achieve full realization of their being in serving the divine. They are horsemen who move without movement, carried away by the sheer spontaneous impulse of their mounts. If they cover at great speed the distances which they are ordered to cover by divine command, the credit belongs to the steed which bears them, and on which they sit motionless in their contemplation. This is expressed by the Koranic verse 8:17: \"When you shoot the arrow, it is not you, but God who shoots it.\" One cannot claim glory for something which is negative, and immobility is simply the negation ofmovement. They traverse spiritual distances, those perilous wildernesses, in their souls and by means of their souls, but they do not place their trust in their souls, far they are the Transported (majdhubun) by the divine attraction. Each night they under­go a spiritual ascension (m i'raj ruhani). Like Abraham, their vision of the Malakut!02 is direct, and it is to this that their immobility is due. They have no \"bridge\" to cross, for direct vision has no need of interpretations. We would say that they do not have to engage in \"hermeneutical rides\". These \"hermeneutical rides\" devolve upon the horsemen in the second 101 Cf Traites des compagnons-chevaliers (Rasa'il-i Javanmardan).

Cf the Koranic verse 6:76: \"This is how we caused Abraham to see the malakut ofHeaven and Earth\". There exists a famous conversation on the subject of this verse between the fifth Imam, Muhammad al-Baqir, and his disciple Jabir ibn 'Abdullah, who asked the Imam in what sense it should be understood that the ma/akut-the supra-sensible world ofHeaven and Earth-had been shown to Abraham. The Imam, by giving his disciple a brief visionary perception, caused him to see the Veils of light that are the respective spiritual universes ofthe twelve Imams. Cf my En Islam iranien . . , op. cit., IV. index, s.v. Jabir ibn 'Abdillah, Voiles de lumiere."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE category. What exactly are they? Ibn 'Arabi puts us on the right track when he expresses his admiration for a Koranic verse that he continually re-reads and meditates upon. All the creatures in the universe are so many divine Signs, and \"among these Signs\", says the verse in question, \"is your sleep during the night and during the day, and your expectation of the blessing ofthis sleep\" (30:23). Why does Ibn 'Arabi consider this verse to refer par excellence to the second category of the \"horsemen of the Invisible\"? The reason is that in addition to speaking of sleep during the night, which is natural, it speaks ofsleep during the day, excluding thereby all mention of a state of wakeful ness. Herein lies the secret of that state of things described by the Prophet when he said, in a remark already quoted: \"Human beings are plunged into sleep; it is when they die that they awaken\". Contrary to profane opinion, death is not a falling asleep but an awakening. This can apply both to death in the mystical sense and to death in the physical sense of an exilus; and, as Haydar Amuli has explained, the purpose ofthe first death is that the second one should be a resurrection. It is precisely this that is important for Ibn 'Arabi. Man's present condition in this world is such that the visions we see in sleep in the world of Night, and what we think of as our perceptions in the world of Day, are similar in that both visions and perceptions take place in a state of sleep, equally in the world ofNight and in the world ofDay. Thus both visions and perceptions, by the same token, require an interpretation, a hermen­eutic; and it is for this reason that Ibn 'Arabi views this world as a bridge, as a stage to be traversed. One Arabic root ('br) conceals in effect a valuable ambiguity. It means to cross, to traverse. In the second form (the causative, 'abbara) it means to cross a bridge, to traverse a river, for example. In designating the act of crossing over from one side to another, the same verbal noun ta 'bir designates eo ipso the act of interpreting-the hermeneutic-because the ta'bir or hermeneutic consists in making the crossing from the apparent to the hidden, from the exoteric {zahir) to the esoteric (batin). Ta 'bir al-ru'ya, the interpretation of visions and dreams, is one of the chief applications of the \"science of the Balance\". It is to make the crossing from the forms perceived in vision to the secret meaning oftheir appearance. The visions we see in sleep in the world ofNight, as well as the perceptions we have in what we call the world ofDay, require the same crossing to be made 114"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE before we can perceive their secret meaning. The reason for this is that both are motivated by a secret purpose deriving from another world. This is why our present world-the world of Night and the world of Day-is a bridge which must be crossed. A brid ge is a place of passage, not a stopping-place or a dwelling-place. One crosses over it, and it must be crossed if one is to understand the secret meaning, the invisible \"corr e­spondence\" of what \"takes place\" on this side of it. This is the task assigned to the interpreters, the hermeneutists of the esoteric who are promoted to the rank of \"horsemen of the Invisible\". Ibn 'Arabi goes on to recapitulate the situation which, in this world, keeps us in a state of slumber both at night and during the day. It may happen that someone sees visions in his sleep and dreams, still asleep, that he has woken up; and he dreams-thinking himself awake-that he is telling his dreams to someone who is also part ofhis dream . He goes on sleeping the same sleep, dreaming that he is interpreting what he has seen while asleep. Then he wakes up, and realizes that he has not ceased to be asleep, both while dreaming and while interpreting the visions of his dream . The same thing is true in the case ofthe man the eyes ofwhose inner vision are opened while he is still in this world, before his exitus. From the moment of his great awakening, he realizes that he has always been dreaming, but he thanks God for granting him this sleep, as well as for the fact that he has lived in sleep both his visions and the interpretations of these visions. This is, perhaps, what we do when, like Haydar Amuli, we construct great diagrams of worlds and intermediary worlds; yet this, precisely, is the hidden meaning of the Koranic verse which speaks of \"your expectation of the blessing of this sleep\"-To be forearmed against the decadence of dreams is to be capable of crossing the bridge with regard both to the dreams of Night and to those of the Day, since such is our condition in this world; and this crossing is effected by the \"knighthood devoted to practical activit y\", a knighthood dedicated, as Ibn 'Arabi has told us, to great actions, great enterprises. Could there, indeed, be any undertaking greater than to dedicate oneself to the search for the corre­spondences between what we see in this world and the Invisible, the ghayb, the world of Mystery? For only this search can abolish the frontier which keeps our destiny captive. Thus Ibn 'Arabi not only perceives that the Koranic verse (30:23),"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE BALANCE which speaks ofthe sleep ofthe night and the day, is a verse whose hidden purpose concerns above all the \"horsemen of the Invisible\"; he also percei ves that the lime oftheir undertaking is typified in the Koranic surah which is entitled \"Night ofDestiny\", for their undertaking is the realization ofthe hidden meaning ofthis Night. The \"Night ofDestiny\" (liturgically speaking, one of the nights in the month of Ramadan) is the night on which the sacred Book, the Koran, descended into this world: the sacred Book whose homologies and correspondences with the \"Book ofHorizons\" and the \"Book of Souls\" Haydar Amuli set out to discover. The Koran says ofthis \"Night ofDestiny\" that \"it is worth more than a thousand months . On this Night, the Angels and the Spirit descend into this world together with all things. Peace accompanies this Night until the dawn\" (97:1-5). Because the Night of Destiny is the descent of the Invisible into our world, it is during this Night, which continually recurs, that the \"horsemen of the Invisible\" ride; for it may be said that their ride is a crossing of the bridge to meet the Angels and the Spirit descending invisibly into this world. Of course, the bridge has always to be crossed again; but it is in this crossing that the \"science of correspondences\", as a hermeneutic of the Invisible, consists. 116 Paris, Saturday of Pentecost June 9, 1973"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Appendix Explanation of the diagrams The figures are numbered from 1 to 6.

The precinct wall ofthis Temple is pierced by seven gates, and it is capped with a seven-tiered dome. On the crown of this dome is set a kind of precious stone, vast in size and of a brilliance that illuminates everything within range. No one may come within ten cubits of it without falling dead; spears hurled towards the Temple turn back against the aggressor. Inside the Temple itself is a well with a heptagonal opening; anyone who leans over it is in danger of being overcome by a dizziness which drags him down into the abyss. Yet all around it runs an inscription proclaiming that the mouth ofthis well leads to the Treasury ofbooks in which are preserved the sciences ofEarth and Heaven, the chronology oftimes past and times future: \"No one may enter here or draw on these treasures,\" it is said, \"save he who is our equal in knowledge, power and wisdom.\" The Temple is built on a rock which rises out of the Earth like a high mountain. Anyone who beholds the Temple, the dome and the well is seized with a violent emotion in which impatience, sadness and an attraction that captivates the heart mingle with a fear lest something of this Temple may be destroyed or ruined.

These represent, respectively, the forms of five planets and of the two major luminaries, and each statue is made out of a substance and a colour (ruby, carnelian, emerald) that correspond to the action ofthe planet represented. All mystical and alchemical represen­tations of the Sabian Temple preserve this architectural form .4 It is in conformity with it that Suhravardi's Recital of the Occidental Exile introduces us to the mystical pilgrim who is thrown into the depths of a dark well, a well dominated by a castle whose storeys rise one above the other into the heights ofHeaven. In order to gain access to this castle, and to attain the \"smaragdine vision\" from the ramparts of the celestial City, the mystic must invert the norms ofDay and Night. In other words, the dark depths of the well are no other than the Day of common awareness. 5 The architectural form of this Temple with seven oratories and seven Images, into which one emerges out of a well of extraordinary depth, has, needless to say, been realized materially in one place or another.

How­ever, it does not greatly concern us whether or not archaeology is some­where able to identity the remains of the Temple. What is important is the ideal configuration of these ritual monuments, into whose architectural form the soul projects her imago mundi, and thence proceeds to interiorize its evety detail, assimilating it to her own substance through a meditation which thus enables her to construct her own microcosm. 6 In this sense the Sabian Temple is above all a Temple-archetype. Its ritual usage is best defined by an inscription, Platonic in tone, which in the year 332 A.H. Mas'udi was still able to read on the threshold of the great Temple of Harran: \"He who knows himself is deified. \"7 This Temple-archetype is itself a threshold, the communicating Threshold between the celestial Temple and the Temple of the soul. Inasmuch as it is a material edifice, constructed in the image ofthe star or celestial Temple, it is the passage leading to the inner spiritual edifice. Because it leads back to the source, it is par excellence the figure and support ofthatmental activity designated in Arabic by the technical term ta'wil, that is to say, an exegesis which at the same time constitutes an exodus, a going-out of the soul towards the Soul. In Islam, ta'wil, the \"exegetic leading back to the source\", answers to that law ofinteriorization, that experiential actualiz­ation of symbolic correspondences, which, being an innate and fimdamen­tal impulse of the religious Psyche, leads the Spirituals of all communities to the same goal. In Islam, ta'wil is put into operation by the Batinis, the esotericists or \"interiorizers\" of all persuasions; and as it is applied above all in alchemy, what it effects is the transmutation of external rites into the rites ofthe spiritual Temple. From a dialogue introduced into his famous work by the historian of religions Shahrastani (eleventh-twelfth centuries A.D.), it is evident that 6 Cf Mircea Eli ade, Technique du Yoga (Paris, 1949), pp 184- 186. 7 Man 'arafa nafsahu ta 'all aha (Prairies d'or,_ op . cit., vol.

It is the means whereby meditation can pass from the representation of the Temples or stars (hayakil) inscribed in the astronomical Heavens, and reproduced symbolically in the architecture ofthe earthly Temples, to the representation ofa spiritual Temple, constituted by the coalescence of souls that take the place of the stars as receptacles and icons of the pure substances of the Light. The Sabians pictured the celestial Temples as governed by the Angels to whom their cult was addressed. In order for this transmutation to take place without degrading these beings ofLight, but rather by raising the being of man to their level, the anthropomorpho­sis ofthe Temple is accompanied by a simultaneous angelomorphosis of man. In this sense, angelology represents a fundamental structure: it forms the ideal link permitting one to envisage the transition between Sabianism and Ismaili interiorism. The term 11 Sabianism 11 is employed here deliberately without any of the precautions and reservations in which it is involved by historical criticism. Historically, we ought to distinguish carefully between the very different, not to say heterogeneous, phenomena which are grouped under this denomination. But if we were to conform to the science of history we should cease to be in accord with the phenomenology of Sabianism as it was considered, approved or condemned by those souls for whom it possessed a contemporary significance. Even though it means distinguish­ing between several sects, our Arabic or Persian authors use the term to denote both the religion of the 11Sabians11 ofHarran (the ancient Carrhae in the north ofMesopotamia),8 and the religion of those who are mentioned in the Koran and in whom it has been possible to recognize those more commonly known today as Mandeans. The term even incorporates a certain religion from Southern Arabia, practised by the Arabs from the country of Saba. Nevertheless, although the discovery and consolidation of an ideal link between these religions were the task ofmeditation, a definite connexion was already present in the positive facts of history. The religion of the Sabians ofHarran was an extension ofancient Syrian or Syro-Babylonian cults, reinterpreted in the light of elements borrowed from Neoplatonic philosophy;9 and its great interest for the understanding of esoteric move-8 Zarathustra (Zoroaster) and Buddha have both been represented as 11Sabians11• 9 a in general D.

Before their conversion the Nusayris shared with the Harranians a great many religious forms, drawn from sources which were also those of ancient Gnosis.10 At the same time, they present us with the unique example of a community won over to Islam not in its orthodox, official form, but directly in its esoteric and initiatory form, Ismailism, representative par excellence of Gnosis in Islam. With regard to the Ismaili religion itself, whose articulation in the extreme form of Shiism can be traced back to the second/eighth century, we can now glimpse its supreme intellectual achievements through the publication of manuscripts which, for centuries, have been preserved over-jealously in private libraries.11 What needs emphasizing here is, of course, its constitutive principle: spiritual exegesis. Ta 'wil postulates the principle of the Imam as guardian of its secret; his person is at the origin of the entire esoteric hierarchy which constitutes the \"Ismaili Order'.',12 each level of which corresponds to a rank in the celestial hierarchies.

When subject to a rigorous esotericism, a systematic and unlimited endeavour to achieve a state of interiorization connects with the idea of the alchemical Operation, 13 and results in the creation of a third world, or mesocosm, between the classic types of macrocosm and microc osm. This sacred cosmos is the place and instrument of the spiritual Ritual; its heavens are neither the heavens of astronomy, nor yet the inner heavens of pure subjectivity, but the esoteric heavens, rising in tiers to form the dome of the ideal Temple of the Imam, and revealing at every tier their angelic archetype. The unfolding ofthese heavens is thus both our starting point and the goal of our search. In the tenth century A.D., an intellectual society which called itself by the name of \"Brothers ofPurity and Lovers of Faith\" left behind it a monument of Ismaili thought in the form of a vast encyclopaedia, consisting of 52 treatises.14 Here, the invitation to enter into the new Temple is couched in terms which make explicit mention of ideal Sabianism, for there is a reference to Agathodaimon, whom the Sabians acknowledged as their prophet: \"Will you not choose, oh my brother, to enter the Temple of Agathodaimon, in order to contemplate the heavens of which Plato spoke15 -spiritual Heavens, not the visible heavens shown by the astronomers?\"16 Thus, the themes to be meditated in order to effect such an entry are, essentially, the idea ofthe Temple, the idea ofthe Angel who governs it, and the ta 'wil or exegesis whereby one attains to the person of the Angel through the Temple. The transformation of the Ritual effected by ta 'wil culminates in an angelomorphic vision, a transfiguration ofall figures, in 13 Cf my 'Livre du Glorieux', (supra, ch.

The necessary plurality of the theophanies manifested through and in these celestial Figures does not alter the divine Unity in its essence. The Sabi an representation is as follows. The mediators between the supreme Deity and human beings can only be spiritual in nature; they could not be men, not even Prophets, for a prophet is a being of flesh like all other men, and thus a creature composed of the Elements and of Darkness.19 By contrast, Angels are Forms of pure and radiant Light,20 whose nature is both passive and active, receptive and productive, 21 and whose state is one oftotaljoy, beauty and beneficient goodness .

The relationship ofthe Angel with his Temple may be compared to that of the spirit with the body, with the difference that the Angel has total mastery over the Temple, and that this \"body\" is not his image, as the corporeal face is the image of a human being. (According to the Ismaili vision, the person of the Angel has the form of the glorified human body.)23 The Sabi an conception of the Angel's absolute precedence, even over the rank and dignity of a prophet, 24 finds confirmation in the feet that the mediating universe of the Angel is both the place of origin of the souls in the terrestrial world, and the place oftheir second birth, the place whereto they \"return\".

Consequently, the chiefconcern ofthe soul is to achieve an intimate state of concordance with its Angel and to imitate it perfectly, so as to give free passage to the protection which the Angel can bestow upon it. 26 But the most direct way of existing \"in the manner of the Angel\" is to exist in the manner of the star which is the Angel's Temple-a type of devotion which is also to be found in the precept formulated by Agrippa of Nettesheim : alicui stellae conformari. 27 Generally speaking, this precept refers to the Platonic concep­tion that souls are at first located in the stars, each of them in a different star which is its \"partner\" (O'Uwop.ov &O\"Tpov). It was this doctrine of a mysterious kinship between a particular hum an soul and a particular star that Aristotle sought to establish more firmly, by conceiving of their nature as a Fifth Nature, that of the Ether.28 For its own part, Nusayri 22 Chwolsohn, op. cit., II, 422. 23 Cf Strothmarm, Texte I, 1, pp. 6 and 7 ofthe Arabic text (cf irifi:a note 152) . 24 As determined by the Angel's subtle and immaterial nature , which is precisely one ofthe violent reproaches levelled at the Ismailis and Carmathians by the orthodox.

This is expressed in a verse oftheir sacred book: \"May God reunite us, us and you, in the Paradise among the stars of Heaven. \"29 The entire ritual, with its liturgical tones, burning of incense and perfume, and moral observances, is founded upon and directed towards this approach to the star. But these Temples in the sky are visible and invisible at different times. Thus the believer engaged in meditation must have before his eyes figures which correspond to them and which serve to support his devotion. Hence the necessity of building, here on earth, Temples whose correspondence in terms of structure, material composition and colour to the celestial Temple is guaranteed by astronomy and miner­alogy. By means of this earthly Temple, meditation gains access to the celestial Temple, thence to the Angel who is its Lord, and thence to the Lord of Lords.30 Traces of these Temples built in the image of the stars have been preserved in the traditions of historians. The Sabians would have had circular Temples, dedicated to each ofthe five supreme Principles oftheir cosmology: Demiurge, World-Soul, eternal Matter, Space, and Time.31 As fcr the temples ofthe planets, Saturn's was hexagonal in fo rm; Jupiter's, triangular; Mars's, rectangular; the Sun's, a square; Venus', a triangle within a square; Mercury's, a triangle within a rectangle; and the Moon's, an octagon. 32 Each of these Temples was used, on the day specially consecrated to the star in question, for the performance of a liturgy involving garments whose colour corresponded to the planet, during which incense was burned in conformity with the importance which Sabians attached to the rite of perfumes. (During certain festivals, the rite consisted of sniffing roses. 33) 29 Cf Dussaud, op. cit., p. 72 n. 1 (moreover, the stars were figured as bees, whence the title \"Emir of the bees\", that is to say, \"Prince ofthe stars\", in ibid., and 59 n.3). 30 Chwolsohn, op. cit., II, 440. 31 There are variants in the numbering and designation ofthe Five Principles (Mas'­udi, IV, 61, Shahrastani [in Chwolsohn, op. cit., II, 446]) that it is impossible 10 analyse here.

The first injunction is as follows: \"Ifyou wish to converse in private with one ofthe Seven Stars, puri:JY your heart of all corrupt beliefS and your vestments of all stain; render your soul limpid and clear. \"36 Next, the ritual indicates the colour of the vestments to be worn, the kind of perfume to be burnt, the two invocations (some of great length) to be chanted, the second of which addresses the Angel of the star by name. The breath of an ardent devotion is often to be felt. In the liturgy of the Sun (Shams, fe minine in Semitic languages) and its Angel, for example, the celebrant is directed to wear a robe of brocade, a diadem and a gold ring, since he must be dressed in royal fmery in order to pray to her who is the Queen; and he addresses her in terms such as the fo llowing: \"Hail to you, oh Sun, blessed Queen . . . resplendent, illuminating . . . you who concentrate in yourself all beauty, you who possess an authority over the six planets which makes them obey you as their guide and allows you to rule over them. \"37 in several works by the famous Sabian scholar Thabit ibn Qurrah (2211836-288/ 901); Barhebraeus had still been able to see some ofthose whose Syriac titles he mentions, v.g. in their Latin equivalent: Liber de lectionibus recitandis singulas septem planetas accommodatis; Liber de religione Sabiorurn; Liber de distributione dierurn hebdomadis secundum septem planetas; Liber de legibus Herrne tis et de orationibus quibus utuntur Ethnici, etc. Cf Chwolsohn, op. cit., II, 11 ff. 34 Pseudo-Magriti, Das Ziel des We is en, 1.

How, starting precisely from this point, can the transition be effected to the Angels who govern the spiritual Heavens of the esoteric Cosmos? The ideal place ofthis transition is the extraordinary dialogue instituted by Shahrastani, to which we referred earlier. This dialogue is extraordinary because it is carried on not between one group which is ardently orthodox and another of\"idolaters\", but between two groups of speakers who possess far more an archetypal significance than a concrete historical existence, and who appear to have agreed secretly beforehand on the arguments they are about to exchange. These two groups are the Hunafa ' and the Sabians. The Hunafa ' (plural of Hanif) are the represen­tatives of religion in its most initial and pure state, the pure religion of Abraham who was neither Jew nor Christian but hanif muslim: the religion created at the beginning of the world, before the Period of Adam.even,38 and which according to Ismaili eschatology will be restored by the Imam, lord of the Resurrection, when he closes the Cycle at the end of our own Period. There is also an ideal Sabianism, which Ismaili historiosophy conceives of as having been the frrst religion of \"historical\" humanity, and fe rvour that this piety was able to inspire (ibid., pp. 204-211). For the liturgy of Mars (Mirrikh), the garments must be red, a ring of copper must be worn, and the Angel invoked is Rubiyael (pp. 21 1 ff). For the liturgy of Venus (Zuhrah), one wears a sumptuous white robe and a golden ring; the Angel invoked is Bitael (pp. 219 ff. ). The liturgical colour of Mercury ('Utarid) is not indicated (in Nizami's Haft Paykar, the king that day visits the blue dome, but blue and green are often confu;ed in Persian); the Angel invoked is Haraqiel (pp. 221 ff. ). Lastly, tor the liturgy of the Moon, the liturgical garment is white and must be reminiscent of the garment of a youth; the Angel invoked is Siliyael (p. 224; the editor suggests that this is possibly a name formed from the Greek ae}\\:qJt\"q.

On the one hand, the Sabians affirm that the only mediators they acknowledge are the Dii-Angeli, or pure spiritual beings. Do they not, however, invoke the authority of Agathodaimon and Hermes (that is, we are told, of Seth and Idris or Enoch) as that of the Prophets who initiated them into their wisdom and their cult?42 On the other hand, is not the cult rendered to the star, even if it be the Temple of the Angel and the method of access to him, a sin against pure spiritual Sabianism, since what it amounts to ultimately is the attributing of a mediating role to material Figurations, instead of reserving this role foc pure spiritual beings? Con­strained by these two objections, the Sabians fm d themselves being asked a crucial question: since they admit the assumption of Hermes, 43 who was 39 Cf Kalami Pir, p. 59 (p. 64 ofthe Persian text).

However that may be, the end ofthe dialogue is, as regards this, very curious, and worthy ofattention (Kito.b al-milal, lith. Tehran, 1288, pp 151-152). This is what the author says: \"These exchanges between the two groups contain innumerable lessons. There yet remained in my thought corners which I would have liked to fill in, beneath my pen were secrets which I was on the point of revealing, but I abstained in order to speak of the sublime Hermes\", or rather to call on the witness of Hermes, acknowledged by the Sabians to be their supreme authority, and to show that he was a pure hanif whose doctrine affirms that ontological perfection resides not in the stars but in the personal human Figures (a l­arhkhds al-barhariyah), which means passing from the \"temple\" of the star (h aykal) to the human being as \"temple\". One should also note the close kinship between Shahrastani's dialogue and a whole chapter (tasawwur XXVII) of a book attri­buted to Nasiruddin Tusi, cf. The Rawda/u't-Taslim commonly called Tasawwurat ... Persian Text edited and translated into English by W. Ivanow, The Ismaili Text Society Series A, no. 4 (Leiden, 1950), pp. 175-187.

But the central difficulty is clearly formu­lated: for the Sabians, perfection resided in stripping off humanity, whereas for the Hunafa', perfection was to be achieved by putting on the human form44 Ta 'wil makes it possible to delineate a final solution to this problem. The Sabians already descend from the order of pure spiritual beings (rnhaniyun) to the material Temples (hayakil) which are their personal Figurations (ashkhas); the Hunafa' acknowledge the Temples (hayakil) of divine beings (rabbaniyun) in personal, hum an Forms (ashkhas). This serves to initiate the whole exegesis leading from the Heav en ofastral religion to the Heaven ofthe spiritual Earth, the Temple ofthe mediating Angel, and establishing the representation of the esoteric Heavens of the sacred Cosm os by the introduction ofanalogies which Shahrastani's Hunafa' are quick to put into effect45 This signals the dissolution and disappearance ofthe anthropomorphism for which the Sabians were so ready to condemn the Hunafa' : the anthropomorphosis of the Temple of the divinity is in reality made possible by an angelom orphosis ofanthropology. It also puts an end to the scandal constituted, in the eyes of a Sabian, by the current Islam ic affirmation that the prophet-in the final analysis, man-takes precedence over the Angel;46 for it is now seen that the forms ofthe human condition are themselves but one of the stages in angelology . With great pertinence, the Sabians ask about the hierarchy (maratib) ofintellects and souls; and the answer they are given refers to an adamology, a represen­taiion of Adam the true meaning ofwhich will be unveiled to us in the Ismaili exegesis explaining the identity of the \"Angels\" that were com­m anded to prostrate themselves before Adam 47 44 Lib as, an image essentially lsmaili; cf for example Kalami Pir, p. 65; Chwolsohn, op. c1t., II, 436; 11th.

The motion of these human star-temples symbolizes with the motion of the star-temples of Heaven: their institutions (shara'i') are the observance of the movements con­nected with the ta'yid ilahi (a characteristic expression in lsmaili vocabulary). 46 (If Wensinck, The Muslim Creed, pp. 200 lf 47 Shahrastani (lith. p. 142) mentions the distinction between the religion (sunnah) which issues directly from the creative Imperative (the world of 'Amr), i.e. the fitrah (cf KalamiPir, index s.v., and En Islam iranien, op. cit., vol. IV, general index s.v.), 144"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"SABlAN TEMPLE AND ISMAILISM It is for this reason that, out of all the \"Sabians\", it is the Harranians who are held in particular favour, for they proclaim both the essential divine Unity and its pluralization in epiphanic Figures, visible in the stellar Temples of the mediating Angels as well as in the human Persons who typify them. They also conceive of a cosmic alchemy that produces the Perfect Man as the epiphany ofdivinity-the same type ofalchemy as that which produces the subtle humanity (nasut) ofthe lsmaili Imam ; and so positive was this conception for them that the orthodox could hold them responsible, together with the Christians and the extremist Shiites (Ghulat) for the idea ofthe Incarnation (hulu/). 49 The notion of the human or Hanifiyah religion mediated by the Prophets, and creatural religion (khalqiyah), which issues from the world of Khalq, mediated by the Angels. The response given to the Sabian question on the hierarchy of intellects postulates an onomaturgic Adam who might be comprehended within the context of the orthodox exegesis, were it not for the density of the allusion (p. 151) where the characteristic terms Zuhur and Kashf (Unveiling, Manifestation) could refer to a concept to which the key is provided by Ismaili adamology. There is the universal Adam (Adam al-Kulli, hav6v9p!Jl'ITO<;, cf Strothmann, Texte, p. 52 s.v.), and the partial Adam, or rather a plurality of partial Adams. The first Adam inaugurated the initial cosmic Cycle of Unveiling (Zuhur, Kashf); each partial Adam, whose archetype he is, opens one of the \"hi storical\" cycles which succeeded each other. The universal Adam, or arche­type, is himself an Intelligence or Angel of the primordial angelic world ('alam al­Ibdd�; this Anthropos-Angelos (the archetype ofthe Imam-resurrector) is invested, by the tenth Archangel of the eternal Imamate, with the government of nature (cf ibid., I, 4; II, 2, p. 20; XII, 37). We can note two consequences of this: 1) The name of Adam, as the archetype Adam, already refers to an angelic essence. 2) I( at the start of our Cycle, the \"Angels\" were ordered to prostrate themselves before Adam (\"our\" Adam, Biblical as well as Koranic), then the word \"Angels\" must have a different meaning from the one currently accepted (cf infra note 67): a meaning which abolishes the opposition between prophetic and angelic mediation, as well as the question of precedence. Even if the Adam of our Cycle enjoys the precedence of an initiator, it is still the case that he had himself received the initiation of the Cycle of Unveiling which preceded the Cycle of Occultation that he inaugurated. His precedence over the \"Angels\" in his capacity as onomaturge thus calls for an exegesis other than the common Koranic one. These remarks on the subject are of course ail too brief (cf note 67). 48 a Chwolsohn, op . cit., II, 442, and Shahrastani, lith.

Ma'sum 'Ali Shah, the author of a modern Iranian encyclo­paedia of Sufism, saw in this an allusion to the doctrine of the Perfect Man (In san Kamil); cf Tara'iq al-Haqa'iq, I, pp. 159- 1 60. Here, in connection with the ideolcgy of the Temple, is the violent reproach that Abu'l-Ma'ali Muh. al-Husayam al-'Alawi directed at the Harranians, whom he speaks of as a sect of Mages, and whom he considers responsible, along with the Christians and the extremist Shiites, for the idea of an inhabitation or divine incarnation in a human \"temple\" (hulul), a unio mystica (ittihad).

Yet they are not on this account merely an allegory of subjectivity: they possess a reality of their own, of which the organ of apprehension par excellence is the metaphysical Imagination. The possibility of imagining them presupposes a modification in the structure ofthe angelology postu­lated initially by the Sabians. The celestial hierarchies are elevated by the introduction of a hierarchy of supreme Archangels, in relation to whom the Angels ofthe celestial Spheres are merely an intermediary hierarchy, 51 and who possessed a typification, which is no less perfect and legitimate, in the Angels ofthe esoteric Heavens that make up the sacred mesocosm of the Ismaili esoteric Church. The supreme archangelic universe is composed of Ten Archangels who emanate one from the other; of these, the Person of the First {Sabiq, the \"Preceding One\") is so totally the epiphany of the hidden divine Ipseity that all religious statements relating to God, to the Adored (A l-Lah), are understood as referring to this Archangel.52 Corre­sponding term for term with this hierarchy ofT en are, on the one hand, the hierarchy of the Angels who govern the heavens of our physical universe, and, on the other, the Ten levels or grades of the esoteric religious hierarchy, from the Annunciator (Natiq) of each new religion, and the Imam, guardian of its esoteric meaning {ta'wil), down to the Mustajib or new initiate, whose rank corresponds in the physical cosmos with that of the active Intelligence which governs our Earth. 53 This 50 Chwolsohn, op. cit., II, 444; lith.

More precisely, the Angel is the term and the fulfilment ofthe Anthropos. Cosmology \"re-emerges\" in a universe of archetypes, where all is the transfigured human Figure. Angelology imparts to man the knowledge of his future condition; it reveals to him the secret of initiatory birth {wiladah diniyah), of his entry into the Temple of the Imamate. By the same token, it reveals and prescribes the Ritual of this Temple, which is also the Temple of Agatho­daimon into which the Brothers ofPurity invite one to enter. This Ritual will also arise from a \"leading back to the source\" of another ritual, from a ta'wil similar to the exegesis which presides over the appearance of the physical Heavens and their Temples. The question then presents itself: whence comes the ritual which is to be transcended? In its reply to this question, angelology unveils to man his initial condition, that condition, precisely, which it invites him to regain by means of a ta'wil which is a succession of resurrections.

In the first of these, which is the first theme ofSurah 18 ofthe Koran, it is easy to re cognize the refuge where the Elect (\"who are neither Muslims nor Jews nor Christians\") sleep until the dawning ofthe Last Times. In our text the \"posterity of Adam\", who took shelter in this cave, in no way denotes humanity in general, but only a specific fraction of humanity, whose composition is determined in the light oflsmaili sacred history. At the point of its fullest speculative development, this sacred history presents a schema made up ofan innumerable succession ofCycles, in which Cycles ofUnveiling (dawr al-kashj) alternate with Cycles of Occultation (dawr al­satr). The Cycle of Unveiling marks a state of beatitude and contemplative perfection; for the human beings living in such a Cycle, True Gnosis {haqiqah) is proclaimed, directly and openly, and the prescriptions of ritual are abolished. The soul has a direct and intuitive perception of pure spiritual Realities (haqa'iq) through union with the light that flows over it from the First Archangel; the human body already enjoys certain glorious prerogatives pertaining to the \"spirit ual body\" .62 The Cycle of Occult­ation is caused by the evil Desire of individual souls, who renounce their state of angelic individuality (ashkhas ruhaniyah) through an aberrant ten­dency which leads them to don the mask of material physical in dividuality 59 To compare this concept of Namus in Ibn 'Arabi, see H.

The Great Cycle (a l- kawr al-a'zam), which includes the totality of the Cycles, and as to whose duration we are given the most dizzying figures,63 began with a Cycle of Unveiling inaugurated by the Manifestation of the universal Adam, the 1farov6pw1roc;; each Cycle in turn is inaugurated by an incomplete Adam.64 Thus the \"historical\" Adam ofour present Cycle, spoken ofin the Bible and the Koran, is far from having been the first human being on earth. At the time of the grave symptoms which marked the end of the Cycle of Unveiling that preceded our Cycle-symptoms ofthe evil Desire ofindivi­dual souls-the last Imam decided once more to impose the discipline of the Arcane, and to confer the Imamate on the young Adam whose father had himself died in the flower of his youth. Such is the extraordinary Ismaili exegesis (ta 'w il) ofthe Koranic verse 2:30 , in which God addresses the Angels and says: \"I wish to install a successor on the earth. \"65 Yetjust as-according to this exegesis-it is not the transcendent and unknowable God who speaks, but the Imam, so the Angels whom he addresses are not the spiritual Angels ofthe supreme celestial hierarchy, but the terrestrial Angels, human beings in the spiritual and glorious state of the Cycle of Unveiling; that is to say, they are the entirety ofthe hudud, dignitaries or hierarchs, major or minor, ofthe Imam, who form his Temple or mystical body,66 and whose descendants in the following Cycle will be no more than Angels, or demons, in potentiality. It is these privileged human beings, the terrestrial Angels, and they alone, who receive the command to prostrate themselves before Adam, their new Imam. 67 Their vehement protests at the announcement ofthis investiture are un­doubtedly motivated by the prospect of a state in which only symbolic Knowledge will be possible (for this is what it means \"to be on Earth\", 63 The Imam alludes to these in some passing remarks, certain of which estimate the Great Aion (al-Kawr al-a'zam) as made up of 400,000 Aions (K awr) of 400,000 cycles (dawr) each!

But an even stronger motivation, surely, is the presentiment of the catastrophe which threatens the fragility of this form of Knowledge.68 Here, we touch upon the mystery which the creative Imagination cannot fathom even were it to give shape to the most secret of psychic experiences. The attempt to attain knowledge beyond an eternal past, the memory ofwhich has been wiped out by the vertigo ofthe abyss, traces a line of force which is pursued by the metaphysical Imagination of Baader, for example, in evoking the catastrophes which have left their traces in the universe and which we are unable, perhaps, even to picture to ourselves69 The transition to the Cycle ofOccultation, marked by the investiture of Adam and the restoring of the discipline of the Arcane, also ushers in the personage who is the personification, in this Cycle, ofthe eternal Antagon­ist, that Iblis who before the beginning ofTime caused the partial obfus­cation of the Angel of Humanity, and who in the Period of Adam goes by the name of al-Harith ibn Murrah70 In fact, he is one of the surviving dignitaries of the previous Cycle ofUnveiling, one ofthe \"Angels\" ofthat period. As such, he knows that he himself is of an essence of fire. This means that he possesses a direct knowledge of the Truths of Gnosis. Adam, on the other hand, is made of clay, and this means that the knowledge assigned to him, the sole knowledge that he can and must transmit to those ofthe Cycle he inaugurates, is a hermeneutic of Symbols. Hence the refusal of al-Harith to acknowledge Adam as the Imam (to \"prostrate himselfbefore him\"), and his decision to provoke a catastrophe. This malefic initiative possesses three aspects. It aims at provoking the young Imam Adam to transgress the limits of this Land of Paradise (\"earthly Paradise\"), where symbols burgeon and in which he is still allowed to dwell by the discipline ofthe Arcane. To this end, it incites him to aspire to the Knowledge reserved to the sublime Angels ofthe highest celestial hierarchies, that is to say, to the direct Knowledge of hidden Realities which constitutes in its own right the state ofResurrection ('ilm al-Qiyamah).71 It is precisely this Knowledge whose disclosure is reserved 68 \"Will ycu place on the earth a being who will bring it into disorder and shed blood?\" (2:30). 69 Cf Eugene Susini, La Philosophie de Franz von Baader, II (Paris, 1942), p. 330. 70 a.

This Knowl­edge is the Gnosis that is Life, which is why it is represented in the Tree of immortality, whose fruit Adam is forbidden to taste-on pain of infringing the privilege of the Imam to come, and of inverting the cosmic order. Iblis, however, can only arouse personal ambition in Adam indirectly, by ap­pealing first of all to his generosity. Since the blessedness of the preceding Cycle was rooted in this disclosure ofthe Gnosis that constitutes the state of actualized Angels, this state must be restored, even if it means trans­gressing the sacrosanct Order of the necessary secret. So Adam \"breaks the fast\",72 the vow ofsilence which is the ritual prescriptionpar excellence of the esoteric Order73 \"To break the fast\" is to taste of the Tree of Knowledge that is the preserve ofthe actualized Angel. At the same time, it is to strip oneself of the protective veil of symbol; and this is how Adam appears before his own appalled dignitaries, in that state of terrifying nakedness which leaves him and his Temple of light defenceless in the face of the hate and vengeance of the Adversary. Thus all are forced to leave Paradise. Having thus betrayed the secret of the Imam of the Resurrection to come, it is, conversely, by means of a pre-recognition of the Imam that Adam is enabled to hold a \"secret conversation\" with his Lord.74 The anticipatory vision of the Epiphany to come thereby becomes the mediator for his nostalgia, for such a vision leads to the establishment of the \"potential Paradise\" (jannahfi'l-quwwah), the da 'wah (literally \"the Call\") or Ismaili esoteric Church, into which those souls that are \"angels in potentiality\" must be received, and within which they can grow.

XIII; cf also Massignon, op. cit., pp. 116-1 17: \"To be nourished solely by the divine will is not only the vow of the fast, but also the complete guarding of the mouth, the vow of silence, which alone allows the heart, preserved from (he world's tumult, to conceive the divine Word (like Mary's vow at the Temple, according to the Koran 19:27) ... it is the Flight to the desert undertaken by the first Essenian and Egyptian hermits , the Solitude of God al one: al-Ghurbah\" (cf note. 92). 73 Cf Kalami Pir, p. 96 ofthe text.

For Adam was initiated by the Angel sent to him into the arts and sciences with whose help he could cultivate an Earth on which symbols were able once more to blossom; and this blossoming has to spring from the hard soil of the letter and religious prescriptions of the Ritual: prayer at the five canonical hours, fasting, almsgiving, pilgrimage ...

They themselves describe to us the triple aspect of the Ordo of the divine service. There is the aspect which is prescribed by the religious law taken in its literal sense. There is the aspect which is practised by an ideal sect of philosophers who can be seen both as Sabians imbued with Neoplatonism and as pre-Ismaili theo­sophers. Finally, there is the Ritual as conceived and practised by the Brothers far themselves, which proclaims, in appropriate terms, the Ismaili exegesis ofthe Ritual. Both concept and practice are directed towards that metamorphosis of being which esoteric parlance designates as qiyamah, resurrection, and whose mode of knowledge and awareness will reveal itself to us as a mental vision of Person-archetypes. We will thereby be enabled to envisage the nature of the spiritual experience into which angelo logy initiates, and which it both solicits and fulfils. An initial phase of this experience is re vealed to us as an exegesis leading fium the religious Ritual to the philosophical Ritual. 4. Religious Ritual and philosophical RituaL The transition from one to the other of these is governed by the classic di stinction, in Islamic theol ogy, between Islam and Im an.78 The very word Islam connotes consecrati on and total submission to the di vine will; it also involves strict observance oftm­religious rituals (the Five pr ayers, fa sting, almsgiving and so on) which set the se al on the profession ofthe unitary faith (tawhid}, and general confor­mity of one's life to the acts of the Prophet. 79 Im an is conscious faith, the inner as sent. If Islam and !m an are the two fa ces of Religion, the Brothers of Purity are original in that they ide ntify the degree of Faith with the \"divine service of the Philosophers\" [al-'ibddah a/ fa lsafiyah), and thereby postulate positive religion-Is/am-as a necessary prerequi site of the re­ligious life: \"Know, oh my brother, that as long as you remain imperfect in the cult ofpositive religion, it is in no way proper for you to take up the phil osophical cult, for you coul d di e by doing so.\" The believer (m u'min} is a true believer only ifhe has first been a muslim. When the ti me comes for the conj unction ofthe two cults, the initiate is given this solemn warning: 78 Cf Wensinck, Th e Mu slim Creed, pp. 23 ff. , 94. 79 Rasa'il IV, pp. 301-302. 154"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"SABlAN TEMPLE AND ISMAILISM know that this is a work whose execution is extremely arduous, and which exposes the body to danger as well as demanding total renunciation ofthe soul. It involves renouncing all the facilities proffered by a world of familiar facts, in order to attain to the perception of the pure Essences, the True Realities {haqa'iq). 80 In fact, this conjunction is as yet no more than a preparation for the unfolding of the esoteric Ritual of the Brothers of Purity; it forms the first step of ta'wil, the first stage of the exegesis which conducts thither. As such, it presupposes that the initiate has completely satisfied the prescriptions of the religious Ritual. Secondly, it introduces a liturgical calendar whose time is essentially measured according to the relative increase or decrease of Night and Day, while Night and Day themselves alternate with each other as symbols of esoteric and exoteric {batin and zahir), of the discipline of the arcane and revealed Gnosis. 81 There exists a correspondence between the divisions of the nychthemeron and those of the monthly and annual cycles: their liturgical recurrence obeys a ternary rhythm, followed each time by a period of withdrawal or silence. The correspondence also extends to the phases of a Period and of a Cycle of sacred history. This law ofhomology is essential to the understanding ofthe esoteric exegesis of the Ritual performed by the Brothers of Purity, for it establishes the cycle of sacred history as a cycle of cosmic liturgy. The monthly ritual ofthe phil osopher-Sages includes the celebration of three holy nights. The duration of each night extends from the hour which would correspond to our First Vespers until the hour of Second Vespers. These three nights are the first and middle nights ofthe month, together with one that falls between the twenty-fifth day ofthe month and the first day of the following month. They correspond to the phases of the moon; and indeed the cyclic correspondence between the time ofthe neomenias and that of the full moon appears in the Ismaili exegesis ofthese \"liturgical Hours\". Each night's ritual is split up into three nocturns. The first third of the night is taken up by a meditation in the personal oratory; this prolongs and confirms the official religious ritual, \"so that there may be 80. Ibid., pp. 302 ff 81 One must also take into account the ambivalence of each symbol. Esotericism may be the night of the mystery, but the reign of the letter may be the night of unaware­ness.

The second third of the night is occupied by a meditation on the \"cosmic text\" under the starry sky, with the face turned to the Pole Star. The last third is devoted to the recital of a philosophical hymn (the \"Prayer of Plato\", the \"Orison ofldris\", that is, of Hermes, the \"Secret Psalm of Aristotle\"), whose texts we may one day be able to identify with the help of some manuscript. Finally, after the dawn prayer, the Sage invites his family and brothers to join him in celebrating agapae, and the day is passed in wise conversation.82 The choice of the Pole Star as qiblah points to the Sabianism of our Sages, 83 an impression confirmed by their annual calendar. The three periods, the three great liturgical solemnities, are astronomically deter­mined by the sun's entry into the Sign of Aries, the Sign of Cancer and the Sign of Libra; that is to say, by the successive advent of spring, summer and autumn, which are followed by the silence and desolation ofwinter. In winter the Sages observe a strict \"fast\" : it is the time during which the Elect slumber in the Cave. Here again the Sabian style ofthe ceremony is undeniable: at each festival the Sages gather in the Temple which is erected specifically for that festival, and whose architecture corresponds to the constellation reigning over that day; the colour and form of their garments conform to the same correspondence, and they eat only food that is equally appropriate to the day.84 What is revealed \"ritually\" to us here is the median and mediating position occupied by Sabian ideology; that is to say, the \"Sabian Temple\" is the ideal place where the official religious ritual is transmuted into the ritual of a cosmic liturgy, which itself serves as a prelude to the liturgy of the esoteric mesocosm ofthe Ismaili Order. On the one hand, the Brothers of Purity have no difficulty in showing the correspondence between the three great philosophical festivals and the religious solemnities: \"Ifyou meditate, oh my brother, upon the three days of the philosophic year . . . and carefully consider the festivals of the Islamic religion, you will find that they agree and correspond with each other.\" Corresponding to the festival of spring and renewal is the festival of the breaking of the fa st (which concludes the month of Ramadan). To the summer festival corresponds 82 Rasa'i/ IV, pp. 303-304. 83 Cf Chwolsohn, op . cit., II, 5, 59, 61, 222; also E. S.

The joy of this festival is quite differ­ent from that of the first festival, for it is mingled with hardship and fatique, sadness and lethargy; it is the noon hour, stifling and parched. To the autumn festival corresponds a festival not of orthodox Islam, but the festival par excellence of Shiite Islam : the solemn investiture ofthe Imam by the Prophet at Ghadlr Khumm, a testamentary act by which the Annun­ciator (Na tiq) ofthe religious Law entrusted its secret exegesis (ta 'wil) to his spiritual heir and to the Imams ofhis lineage. Corresponding to the lime of sadness and ofthe Sages' retreat is the Departure ofthe Prophet to the other world, leaving his community to grief and mourning. 85 On the other hand, one can readily perceive the hermeneutical advance towards the conception of Ismaili esotericism that is implicit in the calendar of the \"festivals of the Philosophers\"- The festival of Spring, marking the point at which the equilibrium ofDay and Night is broken in favour of Day, is celebrated by the Brothers in lyrical terms: springs gush, torrents once more fill their dry beds, sap rises to the topmost branches, the green fields are aflame with the brightness of flowers86 It is truly the time of a \"resurrection\" (q iyamah in Ismaili terminology), that is to say the initial lime of a Period in which a doctrine bursts forth, a Gnosis proclaimed by the angelic trumpets of the concert given, it is said, on this day offestival by the initiated Sages. The great festival of su mmer marks the start of Day's retreat before the encroaching Night; the joyous flowering of symbols begins to dry up on the Earth. The homily at the festival of autumn is short: \"The measure of the Gnosis revealed is no more than is appropriate to such a Time.\" From now on, the Night of esotericism becomes the refuge ofthe Call (da 'wah) to transcend the literalism ofthe Law and of all servitude to texts and men. This is the time ofwinter, which the theos­opher-Sages pass in their Cave, observing the \"strict fast\" that once was broken, prematurely, by him whose posterity they are. Thus, the \"philosophical calendar\" corresponds to the phases of ta 'wil or transcendent spiritual exegesis. The religious festivals commemorate an event. The speculative festivals bring back the Event, setting it in the present. The situa tion is actually experienced, determined by the star and the season, and projected into a Figure: the Temple, specially consecrated to 85. Ibid., p. 306. 86.

This faith has the power to actualize Events because it transmutes them into symbols, preserving only their transcendence. It does not itself return to the fa ct or try to re duce it to its causes; it takes the fa ct along with it to that which the fa ct indicates87 Its exegesis of the calendar makes of the latter itself an exegesis, for the liturgical cycle actualizes, one by one, the calendar's permanent and original Figures. When ta 'wil raises itself onto an even higher level, the festivals will no longer be celebrated in the Temples of the Sabi an theosophers. The Event will no longer be experienced merely as an event which survived or survives after people, but as being those very People. The Event, that is, is no longer simply set in the present: the soul itself becomes its presence. Thus, the lived situation will no longer be projected only into a Temple which serves as its Figure, but into the very reality of those Person-archetypes, the exegetes who effect the esoteric exegesis, and whose recurrence will be the actual cycle of the soul's calendar. By means ofa conversion and an elevation which are character­istic ofthe mental vision, these Persons, as celestial archetypes, will be the Festivals themselves \"in person\", and they themselves will be the Time and the Temple ofthe festivals.

Salman typifies the case ofthe Stranger guided from distant lands by his own personal effort, and whose exile stamps him with the seal of a purely spiritual Islam, as opposed to all the legalistic pretensions and claims resting on a right of carnal descent. Jabir, the Ismaili alchemist, transposes these same attri­butes to the mystical figure ofhim whom he calls the Glorious One, who is allied to these \"Strangers\" whose spiritual condition in this world is none other than that of the Sethian Gnostics. 93 It is with reference to this condition of being strangers seeking refuge in the Cave from a world of ignorance and violence that the Brothers say: \"This, precisely, is what we are subjected to in our time, until the hour comes of the Appearance, of free exit, of the Return after the Departure, just as the Sun, after the departure of winter, returns into the sign of Aries. \"94 The ritual that regulates the phases ofthe life ofthese Strangers offers scope for many forms of interpretation. One cannot entirely ignore the perspective it opens onto imminent contemporary events; but it would be a mistake to suppose that these events are able, by and as themselves, to exhaust the significance of what is involved here. In Ismaili historiosophy, no event is seen as affected by a contingency that lacks eternal significance.

The contexts of the events exemplify on earth the drama ofthe eternal Archetypes, and it is only the latter that can explain the liturgical cycle of the Brothers' ritual. For this reason, an interpretation which refers the phases of this ritual to a Cycle of Unveiling by no means excludes one that refers them to a Cycle of Occultation. This may be understood as follows. A Cycle of Unveiling follows on from the Great Resurrection {Qiyamat al-Qiyamat), initiated by the seventh Imam of the seventh Period and bringing to an end a Cycle of Occultation such as ours95 This Cycle of Unveiling is followed, in its turn, by a Cycle of Occultation, of which ours is an example. According to this perspective, the third or autumn festival might well correspond to the crucial moment when Night prevails over Day, the moment when, at the decline of a Cycle of paradisal innocence, the evil forces ofthe Antagonist, the eternal Iblis, begin to shake free and manifest themselves. It is, as we saw, the moment in which the dignitaries ofthe Order decide once more to impose the discipline of the arcane and the obligations of the Ritual-the moment in the Cycle immediately preced­ing ours, when the Adam of our Cycle was invested with the dignity and function of an Imam. The time which follows is not of course a day of festival, but a time of calamity and desolation, during which the Sages were obliged to take refuge in the \"Cave\". It is the time ofthe catastrophe which succeeded the day when Adam, the adolescent who in his folly broke the \"fast\", surrendered the secret and the vision of Paradise to the rage and mockery of Iblis-Ahriman. It must be admitted, nevertheless, that the conditions made possible by a Cycle of Unveiling-a mode of existence which is innocent, luminous and subtle-are totally beyond the reach, if not of our aspiration, at any rate of our actual psychical experience and, for the most part, of our boldest speculations and imaginings.96 The texts at our disposal do not throw much light on the factors which determine the number of the three Persons who, in a Cycle ofUnveiling, will succeed each other in the same 95 Needless to say, there were variations in the representations of sacred history (according to the periods of Ismailism: pre-Fatimid, Fatimid.

The events of each Cycle, and of every period of each Cycle, are respectively ho mologous with each other. There exists a homology between the Great Qiyamah, bringing to an end a Cycle of Occultation, and the lesser Qiyamah which concludes each of the Seven Periods of that Cycle, when a religion which has exhausted its \"appeal\" in its previous form \"revives\" in the new religion proclaimed by a new Annunciator (n at­iq).98 Similarly, the name of Qa'im, resurrector, is reserved par excellence for \"he who will rise up\", the Lord of the Resurrection, at the close of the final Period of our Cycle. Yet each partial Qa'im at the end of each Period of the Septenary, as well as each Imam and each member ofthe Order, is also, potentially, Lord of the Resurrection, a limb of his mystical body, an oratory in his Temple of Light. Each Period of a Cycle is homologous Jo that Cycle; each Qiyamah is in the image ofthe Great Qiyamah. Moreover, each Qiyamah, or resurrection, which is represented for each member of the Order by his elevation from one stage to another, is homologous with the Great Resurrection.\" This is why the Brothers of Purity expressly emphasize the homology of their ritual with the phases of each human existence.100 In the last analysis, all that matters is the loftiness of the horizon which the Event indicates, the Archetype which promotes the Event as such and which is exemplified in all the liturgical Cycles of events that are homologous with each other. In this sense, and to this full extent, the three Persons mentioned by the Brothers as constitutive of their own Festivals are the hom ologues of the 97 This would give us a ternary rhythm, whereas the septenary is the rhythm of the schemas of periodization in Ismaili historiosophy (particularly fo r the Cycles of occultation). But in the perspective ofprecisely such a historiosophy, this is by no means a contradiction. We should call to mind Jabir's Livre du Glorieux (op. cit., §§ 2 and 3), where the rhythm is determined by the Triad 'Ayn-Mim-Sin, completed by the person of the Glorious One. Likewise, all is here regulated by the secret intention which places the Sabian theosophers in a mediating position between positive Islam and the Ismaili exegesis of the Brothers.

These silent Imams, from the first of the first heptad to the seventh of the seventh, are the keepers of the esoteric meaning whose communication to the souls called to their Order gradually matures, according to the degree to which they are able to assimilate this meaning, the fruit of the Resurrection. One could go further and say that since each member of the Order, from the greatest to the least, merely exemplifies on earth a member ofthe celestial angelic hierarchy, these three superior dignitaries are the repre­sentatives on earth ofthe highest archangelic hypostases, to wit: the pair form ed by the First and the Second Archangels-Intelligence and Soul of the World-from whom proceeds the third Archangel, the Angelos­Anthropos ofHumanity. With him the cosmic catastrophe is precipitated, through his fatal tardiness in recognizing the divine Unitude (tawhid)-a tardiness which plunged him in darkness and which is symbolized in Suhravardi by the two wings of the Archangel Gabriel, one of light and the other of darkness. 101 This third Archangel fell to the rank of tenth in the supreme angelic hierarchy (which made him the first of our cosmos); and the entire history of our world represents the time spent in reconquer­ing his original archangelic rank, aided by each of the \"angels\" who emanate from him. The last Imam (the Qa'im) of a Cycle is his surrogate: in his Temple of Light, all the souls oflight, members of the Order who belonged to the Cycle, are led back by him to this Angel. The distance between the third fe stival or third dignitary alluded to by the Brothers, and the mom ent when they leave their cave (the Occident to which their souls have declined)-in other words, the moment of the appearance of the Qa'im (the Sun rising in the Occident)-is precisely the time during which the Redemption ofthe Angel is being accomplished through the maturing, in each soul, of an aptitude for the angelic state.

For our purposes, we should concentrate on the succession of the personages in this sacred history, in so far as this succession constitutes the liturgical ceremonial ofthe ritual; for it is this which allows us to bring out the specifically Ismaili configuration ofthe \"man and ritual\" theme. If the same archetypes are exemplified in all the Cycles; ift he Cycles and the events composing them are homologous with each other; and if these events are Persons, then all of these together must constitute and \"tem­poralize\" Time in such a way that it is by virtue ofbeing the time ofthese Persons that it also becomes, properly speaking, liturgical Time as well. Simultaneity and coincidence exist between the recurrence ofthe festivals which constitute the Cycle of liturgical Time, and the recurrence of the individual Figures whose personal presence is projected onto the Cycle. The individual Figure is no longer confined to a moment in time, and does not fade into a vanishing past, for its own individual time is also a reversible time. In this cyclical presence is revealed simultaneously both the archetype of the individual and the individual as archetype; in other words, the individual case is an archetypal case every time .103 This recurrence of archetypal cases projects the hidden significance of the Cycles of sacred history onto a plane of historical permanmce}104 By means of it we can identify, in each generation, period and cycle, down to the completion of the Cycle of Cycles, the Ot1fOKa1'<WTUO\"t...:;, the antagon­ists of the same drama: on the one hand the third Archangel in the primordial Universe ('alam al-Ibda'), the primordial Adam and all the incomplete Adams, and on the other hand Iblis and all the Iblis who came after him.

The exemplifications of the archetype do not occur in time; they themselves determine their time \"in the present\" as gauge of their relationship with each other, as token of their specific individuality, an individuality irreducible to the abstract generality of a category. 105 In the absence ofthis individuality, we would have only a banal system of rationalist propositions, propping up a philosophy of history. In com­plete contrast to this depersonalization, the ritual meaning of the gesta mundi performs, with respect to thesegesta, a ta 'wil on each occasion; that is to say, it elevates the event to the level of symbol, and there discloses the geste of the archetype. That is why the festival in the liturgical calendar docs not simply commemorate an event. It is that very event, and the Event is the Person who enacts the geste of the archetype. A striking illustration ofthis will be found below in the personalizing valorization of the Shiite Calendar. Another illustration is provided by the Mazdean calendar, where each day is called by the name of an Angel, inciting us to the discovery of what is meant by the \"day of an Angel\", that is, the day whose event is this very Angel. This meaning, in the case of the ritual as in that ofthe revealed text or of the cosmic text, very distinctly shows us how the spiritual exegesis or ta'wil brings about the \"return\" to the archetype and ofthe archetype. By the same token, the ministry of this exegesis is understood as an angelic one, personified on earth, for example, in the ' person of Salman the Persian, the Stranger whose role of companion­initiator to the Prophet106 is repeated in each relationship of initiator to initiate, which, step by step, unites one by one the members ofthe Ismaili Order to each ot her. We have already mentioned, in fact, that the ritual of the sacred mesocosm is essentially a Cycle of resurrections, homologous with the Great Qiyamah. The meaning that lies in conceiving a festival as a Person, the sense that each festival is a Person, is the promotion of that Person to a new 'resurrection', his elevation to a new heaven in the 105 Thus, something like a reversal ofthe notion ofa time which imposes its measure: in this case, it is the soul that is the measure of its time.

This is the liturgical Cycle, celebrated in the spiritual Temple which is formed by the da'wah, the Ismaili esoteric Church. What, one may ask, is the divine service par excellence, the liturgy which is celebrated by and for the \"festivals\" ofthis Cycle? The Brothers ofPurity do not fail to describe it, or rather to allude to it in veiled terms which we can, nevertheless, decipher by reference to other contexts . The sacrific e, they say, which they celebrate as sembles and contains in itself all the virtues, both of the \"religious\" and of the \"phi lo­sophical\" sacrifice.107 This is the sacrifice which was offered up by Abraham, \"the ram that was obtained for him as ransom for his son and that had grazed for fo rty autumns108 on the Earth of Paradise. If you are able to offer up in sacrifice a ram that has grazed on the Earth of Paradis e an entire lifetim e if necessary , then do so; do not relax, keep fighting for this , so that you may ultimately achieve your goal, may revive the exemplary cases and abide in the universe of God.'109 Thus the mental repetition of Abraham's sacrifice is pres ented as the act par excellence of an esoteric ritual of spiritual death and regeneration. But it is self-evident that the bent and the significance ofthis inner liturgy, which effects a transmutation of the soul, can be understood only within the context of the Ismaili exegesis . Who was the son that had to be sacrificed? What is the ram that was sacrific ed in his place? Why had it grown up on the Earth ofParadise? The Ismaili exegesis of Surah 37 refers, of course, to the order of the sacred mesocosm, established by Gnosis. The purpose ofthe usual Is lamic 107 Rasa'i/ IV, p. 309. 108 The Brothers' text (3 09 I. ii) has kharnf (forty sheep?). For this, read kharif (autumn).

The third is reached after the age of fo rty (\"Our eminent and noble Brothers\"). The fo urth level corresponds to the angelic fa culty and is the result of an inner experience which can be attained only after the age of fifty. It is to the Brothers of this level that the Koranic verse is addressed: \"Oh pacified soul, return to your Lord, pleasing and pleased\" , Koran 89:27-28,(IV, pp. 222-223). 109 Ibid., p. 309. 166"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"SABlAN TEMPLE AND ISMAILISM exegesis is to establish that the child to be sacrificed must be not Isaac but Ishmael. Yet according to the Ismaili perspective there is far more to it than this. Abraham had resolved to invest Isaac with his spiritual heritage, thereby keeping it from Ishmael, the child who by divine proclam ation (37: 101) had been characterized as the child of gentleness and patience. This is the meaning ascribed to verse 37:102: \"My child, I dream ed that I was offering you up in sacrifice.\" But then a divine command alters this mistak en predisposition and orders Abraham to transfer his heritage to Ishmael: \"And we ransomed him with a great victim\" (37: 1 07). Now this victim-traditionally this ram-is in fa ct no other than a metaphorical des ignation for Isaac himself. 11 0 What, then, is meant by the sacrifice of this Ram? Here again the whole body oflsmaili Gnosis can be taken as a guide. By this Gnosis, Ishm ael is regarded as the spiritual heir, the Imam who holds the secret of the Gnosis, while Isaac is a Veil: the veil or screen of the Letter which is placed before the Imam . The relationship between them corresponds to the fu ndamental distinction between the appointed and permanent Imam (m ustaqarr, the ordinarius), and an Imam who is merely a depositary or curator {muslawada?, established as a kind of protection during periods of danger and apparently performing the functions of the true Imam, while the latter remains hidden.111 Ishmael was the Upholder of the mystical meaning, of the esoteric science of ta 'wil, while Isaac was before him as a Veil, maintaining the science of tanzil, of the revealed Letter and of positive religion. The same relationship is perpetuated in the course oftheir respective lineages,\"2 and Ismaili historiosophy took upon itself the task of determining what the legitimate transmiss ion was for each epoch. Whereas Moses established a new Law (shari'ah), a new positive relig ion, the descendents of Ishmael continued and transmitted the esoteric message of Gnosis.113 Thus the spiritual ritual begins to as sume a specific form. The ram which must be offered up in sacrifice is Isaac. This signifies the sacrifice of external evidence and literal faith (zahir), ofthe prescriptions oflegalistic religion, of material certainties, and of the justice of the Law.

Here alone can the exoteric sense (zahir) ofreligion grow and mature, for it is given substance by the inner and esoteric sense (batin) : it may grow for an entire human lifetime until it can be sacrificed at the moment when interiority is in full flower; for the mystery of the esoteric Church is accomplished in a cycle of Resurrections. Everywhere else in the official, external religious world, the letter can never be anything but the letter, the Law remains the Law. The ritual ofthe Ismaili Brothers ofPurity thus culminates in an act of spiritual re surrection which libe rates one from this Gehenna. It may seem, perhaps, that the sacrifice of the Law's bondage is one which man would be only too happy to make. Yet it is represented by the Brothers as the culmination of an entire lifetime of effort. This is because, far from signifying an anarchic, negative freedom, obtained without any­thing being given in exchange, such a sacrifice can only be achieved at the end of a long period of inner asceticism . This is the m earring given to it by the great mystical poet 'Attar-who is suspected, moreover, of having possessed a knowledge of Ismailism-when he says: \"If you profess the religion of Abraham (and if you arc thus a pure Hanif), the sacrifice of the son is a teaching which is addressed to you.\" 115 This teaching becomes imperiously evident from the moment it is viewed within the Ismaili perspective, in which Ishmael and his line represent the spiritual heritage, the perpetuation of the esoteric Imamate, while Isaac represents carnal descent and perpetuation ofthe Law. The religion ofthe Law, the social imperative, may prescribe the sacrifice of Ishmael-the sacrifice, that is, of the universe ofthe soul and its celestial mysteries. By contrast, to sacrifice the ram which is Isaac is to sacrifice carnal desire for earthly possession and descent, in exchange for the spiritual heritage.

Thus, the ta 'wil of the ritual, like the operation of alchemy (which is an Ismaili application par excellence of the ritual), leads to the emergence of that Third World or mesocosm, born of a mediation which triumphs over contraries. All gnoses have aspired towards this world; it is proclaimed, for example, in an apocryphon of Clement of Alexandria, by Jesus, who replies to Salome's question as to when the reign of death will come to an end by saying \"When masculine and feminine are one.\" 119 If the \"angelic Form \" is the fruit of this sacred inner marriage of the masculine and feminine aspects ofthe Soul, the birth ofthat Form surely represents the passage, the exodus, leading from the Sabian ideology of the Temple to the Ismaili conception ofthe Temple ofLight.

The emergence of a new personal Form in man, \"representing\" or exemplifying an angelic­archetype, is thus seen as the element which it is essential to understand, and which at the same time allows one to understand the ultimate signifi­cance ofthe esoteric Ritual-to understand, that is, the highest develop­ment of ta'wil, the concrete transmutation effected by it. Unless we arbitrarily restrict the meaning of the word \"mystical\", it is difficult not to apply the quality of mysticism to this exegesis ofthe soul. But this mysticism differs profoundly from all mystical experiences of the annihilation of self in the divine absolute grasped directly and without mediation. In place of this abyss ofnegativity, it proffers a universe peopled with a multitude of celestial Persons, each ofwhom is a world. It differs also, and equally, from what is frequently understood as esotericism, but which is basically nothing but a rationalist tendency to substitute an abstract meaning (idea, principle, law) for all personal figures or figurations (heroes, Angels, exemplary events). Such a substi­tution contributes to the dissolution of symbols, and consequently of the beings who symbolize, in order to promote impersonal generalities: once again, the celestial universe is unpeopled. In sharp contrast to this, Ismaili ta'wil does not start with a sy mbolic personal figure and proceed to the enunciation of a general proposition. It starts with a factual reality given in physics, in hi story, in ritual or in religious prescription, in order to disclose the vision of the Person-archetype who confers stability and ontological validity on such data by elevating them to the level of symbols. Reciprocally, the mental vision of the Person -archetype presupposes the spiritual exegesis of the text, whether sacred or cosmic.121 Thus, all positive data are not done away with, but are transfigured in 120 .Rasa'i/ IV, p. 309. 121 There is something similar in Swedenborg's ta'wi/ of Scripture as the starting-point of his mental visions; cf.

It is the earthly, human person who, by grav itating towards his spiritual person (shakhs rnhani), his angel-hood (firishtagi), represents and typifies a hypostasis of the angelic world. He does not destroy this hypostasis by symbolizi ng with it; rather, he is called upon to answer for it on earth. Hum an gestures, human representations and imaginings, far fr om being abolished, are so many methods whereby man can be led to typify and exemplify in himself (tamaththul) a celestial existence . For example, ifa celestial Person is represente d by a particular gesture, or word, or phase of the ritual, then to observe these is already to exist in the manner of the transcendent Person. It is for this reason that the initiate must undertake to be faithful to these observances, at least in the Fa timid tradition of Ismailism .123 In doing so, he is also affirming in hi s person the potenti al Paradise or Earth ofParadise, this Earth on which he is able to pasture the Ram that is offered up in sacrifice at the culminating point of a human li fe.

The ablution that precedes the Prayer is the return to Know ledge of the Imam ; the water is the know ledge of Gnosis 126 which purifies one from all compromise with the literalists and the profane (Zahiri). Each gesture ofthe ablution (touching the water to head, hands, nostrils and mouth) is a reference to one of the Persons in the esoteric hierarchy or else to his celestial Archetype. Similarly, each gesture, pro­nouncement and attitude ofthe ritual Prayer (Salah) refers to one ofthese Persons. The ritual Prayer, in particular, presented a rich hermeneutical potential127 Notably, the five \"canonical Hours\" represent the first two archangelic hypostases and the first three esoteric dignitaries of a Period (Na tiq, Wasi, Imam). In the same way, in the Nusayri ritual, recitation of the Names ofthe Five Persons ofthe Prayer (ashkhas al-Salah128) is in itself a fulfilment of all the prescriptions, ablutions and recommendations at­tached to the celebration of the Prayer. With regard to the ritualfast, we have already seen that it consists in observing the discipline of the arcane, \"in keeping the secret of your Imam\", in not surrendering anything imprudent! y to enemies and to the profane. Almsgiving (zakah) is the communication of gnosis to him who is worthy ofit, the initiatory relationship which is reproduced from the top to the bottom level ofthe mystical hierarchy129 (the same ritual \"alms­giving\" is mentioned in the festivals ofthe Philosophers by the Brothers of Purity). The idea of almsgiving is linked with that of pilgrimage (haJJ), because pilgrimage is the exegesis or ta'wil par excellence, the exodus whereby the initiate gradually abandons the enslavement of primitive, literal beliefs, and progresses from the stage of Mustajib to that of Hu}J'ah 130 Thus, there is a series of Qiyamat or resurrections, proceeding from a limited-Heaven 125 On this differentiation, see Ivanow, Studies in Early Persian Jsmai/ism, The Ismaili Society Series A, no. 3 (Leiden, 1948), pp. 39-40. 126 Dailami, op. cit., p. 44, \"a/-'i/m a/-haqiqi', cf.

It is on this superior level, also, that Ismaili ecumenism becomes intelligible. There could be no conflict between the celestial Archetypes, nor between the earthly symbols which represent them. That is why Abu Ya'qub Sijistani, for example, 133 is able to detect, in the symbol of the Cross, the \"crossing\" of the negative and positive phases of the Islamic Attestation of Faith (Non Deus nisi Deus). In the same symbol, too, the invisible celestial hierarchy and the terrestrial hierarchy \"cross\" in the persons of the two supreme Archangels (Sabiq and Tali) and of their earthly typifi­cations (Natiq and Asas), who are represented respectively by the four branches ofthe Cross and also by the four words ofthe Attestation ofthe Unique.

Just as the first Person inaugurates the liturgical Cycle ofthe Brothers ofPurity, Ramadan inaugurates the year in the person of 'Abdallah ibn 'Abd al-Mutallib, father of the Prophet Muhammad or prophet-Annunciator {Na tiq) ofthe sixth Period.137 Since this is the \"month\" in which the revealed Book \"descended\" to earth, one can indeed see how its Person is the \"father\" of him who annunciated the new religion. Furthermore, each of the thirty days and each of the thirty nights of this month also have their person-archetype: thirty masculine personages for the days, and thirty feminine personages for the nights.138 Likewise, every other month is a Person of sacred history. We thus perceive how excellent an exercise in speculative meditation it would be to effect the transposition, or ta'wiL of each singular fact, in order to attain to the mental vision of the archetype.139 Of all the nights of Ramadan, there is one, called Laylat al-Qadr, the \"Night of Destiny\", which has a special dignity. During this night, the Koranic revelation is consummated, and for this very reason no one is 134 Majmu' al-A 'ydd, recently edited by R.

The asseveration is only apparently paradoxical; it concerns all those who are \"actualized\" in this Temple, and it signifies that after the Resurrection (Q iyamah) which overthrows the tyranny of the Law (Sh ari'ah), thought and imagination precede and suscitate the object that then becomes their symbol (because they already typify it within themselves), and do not merely track symbols down, as happens in the present hum an condition. Even though one hesitates to assign a place to this night in the series of Nights in the month, because it surpasses them all by so much, the person-archetype of the night, who manifests this very transcendence, is clearly recognized.

Etymologically, he is \"the Proof, the Sign\", the Imam's visible double, who may receive in his name the oath of allegiance143 Fatimah was the hujj'ah of the Prophet's Wasi, the foundation and principle of the Imamate.

We now know, thanks to L. Massignon, a Nusayri canticle (qasidah) of extraordinary spirituality, in which Fatimah is glori:fied as being In­itiation in person. Through her, the divine principle manifested in her father is manifested afresh in her sons. She unites feminine and masculine in herself: she is al-Zahra'(She who dazzles with whiteness), and she is F atir (in the masculine), Fatimah-Creator, or rather, she who \"makes visible\" the human fonn in which the divine is manifested through the Cycles.144 Because of the encolUlter to which the Ismaili exegesis of individual eschatology \"leads back\", this mental vision ofPerson-archetypes affects every existence in the profoWldest depths of its being. In this sense, eschatology is no more than the goal, the culminating point of the exegesis of the Ritual. We can recall only one version here, a version which extends the visions of a Persian proto-Ismaili text (still in use today among the Ismailis of Pamir), and in which the soul is represented as respiralling through the levels of the cosmos to reach the level of Salman and become the \"Salman ofthe microcosm\".145 As we have already seen, Salman the Persian (Salman Farsi), or Salman the Pure (SalmanPak), is the Stranger, the Exile :fium afar, regarded by a long tradition as the Prophet's initiator­companion, who helped him become aware ofthe \"exemplary cases of conscience\" of previous prophets.146 His person is the earthly typification both of the Angel Gabriel as the Angel of Revelation, and of the Angel or Spirit of exegesis. He is this Angel's earthly angel, performing, close to him whose companion he is, the angelic ministry of exegesis or ta'wil. As the Prophet manifests the Law, shari'ah, so he manifests the gnostic truth 144 Cf. L. Massignon. 'Der gnostische Kult der Fatima im schiitischen Islam', Op era minora, vol.

Another Night typifies Fatimah as the hu.ij ah ofthe Imam: the first Night ofthe month ofRajab, which comes seventh in the order of the months (Strothmann, Texte II, p. 28). Similarly, the day and the night ofthe mid-sha'ban are respec­tively the exemplification ofthe Annunciator ofthe Zahir(Taf:tw, the Koran and the Law), and of the Wasi, keeper of the ta'wil (h atin, Tcr tl'o'w, ibid., II, 8, p. 29). 145 A term employed in the Persian proto-Ismaili treatise Umm ai-Kitah; cf. my 'Livre du Glorieux', (supra, ch.

In the merging of these two aspects, the intuition, like a flash of lightning, perceives who may be the person-archetype ofthe Soul that unfolds, and in which is unfolded, this new way of being and knowing that we have seen character­ized as the disclosure of the angelic Form, whose peculiar fimction it is to typifY in itself the celestial existences, and by this perfect symbolization to exist in a state in which its wishes are totally ful:filled.

Indeed, \"Salman is the soul\" (or the life, jan) of Paradise.

And the whole ofthis abode is the kingdom ofthe angelic substances (ruhdni-yat), where, it is said, \"the stones and the clods of earth will be granted the gift ofspeech\".

This educative, \"exegetic\" role belongs to Salman as Angel-herm eneut, the angel of the Exodus out of the earthly home land of the letter. The potential Paradise in the heart of the \"hadd\" desires, with each time and gesture ofthe Ritual, the Person ofthe actual Paradise who is a new Salman. To draw back the veil of the terrestrial self so that the Person, or primordial celestial individuality, may appear, is to typify (as in the conversation with the Imam al-Baqir) the person of Salman the archetype-just as the Glori ous One, being likewise modelled on his Person, is the archetype for J abir the alchemist, 159 and as each Sabiq in his turn is the archetype for his fo llower (ralij, each \"limit\" (hadd) for that which it defines (mahdud) and attracts, and as in mysticism the Beloved is for the Lover.

It was in this manner, and with regard to this year's theme, that I found myself reacting over the winter to two works on Balzac which had just come out. For, in their respective interpretations ofthe work of our great novelist, these two books form a contrast as striking as it is instructive for what we are about to discuss. The first of these works is meant to be addressed to \"people who are human enough not to limit their attention to literature alone\"; yet it then presents us with a Balzac so dependent on nineteenth-century society that he occupies some quite minor position in it, like that of a clerk, and his society could very well have done without him . Because of his bias, the interpreter keeps us on the ground, or, more accurately, he refuses to rise, in dealing with Balzac's work, higher than the ground floor of the \"Studies of Manners\" where the archives are stored. There is no question ofgoing up to the first floor, the floor ofthe \"Philosophical Studies\", \"where one can discover a hidden order of things\", let alone of going up to the second floor, that ofthe \"Analytical Studies\", where it is possible to \"meditate on natural principles, and to see in what ways societies fall away from or approach the eternal laws of truth and goodness.\" It would be hard not to define this mutilating inter pretation as counter-sense, because-to go no further-it contradicts Balzac's express statements. By contrast, the second interpreter addresses himself to \"people who 183"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA' BAH are too human not to have been disheartened by the world\", that is to say, by what is offered to them by sociology, demography and the economy; and ifhe leads us into the \"Human comedy\" as into a walled town, it is because \"this walled town opens onto Heaven\". It is this, and this alone, which is in accordance with Balzac's statements, when he foresaw that some people, faced with his painstaking collection and depiction of facts as facts, would imagine that he belonged to the school of the sensualists or the materialists. This is so far from being the case that he refutes such a school vigorously, adding: \"I do not share the belief in the indefinite progress of societies. I believe in the progress of man over himself Those who perceive in me an intention to consider man as a finite creature are therefore strangely deluded.\" Here Balzac calls to witness his mystical masterpiece, Seraphita-\"the actualization of the doctrine of the Christian Buddha\", that is, of Sweden­borg-as a sufficient response to all attempts to diminish the meaning of his work. In short, for the first interpreter Balzac is a prisoner of nineteenth­century society. He was created by it, and is therefore contingent and superfluous. For the second interpret er Balzac is the creator, he who \"em braces within his work the society of the nineteenth century as well as that of other centuries. Society is his creation. It cannot do without him.\" 1 If my reaction to this contrast has led me to st ress it here, it is because it appears to me typical and exemplary, in the sense that it is characteristic ofthe situation we face when we try to understand what is implied by the ability to outline a spiritual world, to grasp, in a form and a figure, a world which is not within the scope of sensory perception. Indeed, for several generations Western man has exercised inexhaustible ingenuity in enclosing himself within his experience of this earthly world, carefully shutting of' all exits through which he might leave it, even though it means lamenting his solitude and the absu rdity of his condition. At the same time he persistently refuses to recognize that it is his own philosophies which have reduced him to this state. He means to stay on the ground floor, and systematically ignore the fact that there are, or might be, upper storeys. Religious fa ct in itself postulates the existence of these upper storeys-i The first interpretation (the one which refuses to ascend any higher than the ground floor) is by Andre Wurmser, La Come die inhumaine. The second is that of Maurice Bardeche, Une lecture de Balzac.

We are not less aware ofthe current peremptory assertion that the scientific study of religious fact cannot accept any appeal to a Revelation or any recourse to the intervention of a transcendent power. Obviously, it is impossible to discover in a fact something which one has started by denying it possesses. Considerable ingenuity has been employed in converting the interpretation of facts into established fa ct. For example, we have passed from evolution as an interpretation of a collection of facts to \"the fact of evolution\" (neglecting to note that the real fa ct was evolutionism). In turn, equal ingenuity has been employed in converting a fa ct into an interpretation, in order to reduce the original phenomenon (the Urphanomen) to certain elementary facts which are supposed to explain it. Religious fact, for example spiritual fact, is \"explained\" sociologically by the conditions of production and consumption, or psychologically by reference to the misfortunes of infancy and childhood, lived as a series of catastrophes. What is striking about our time is that so many people accept these explanations without noticing their ludicrous inadequacy as regards the object being explained. From the start, in effect, we are presented with unbalanced and atrociously mutilated forms, because our fundamentally agnostic science denies us recourse to a suprasensible dimension which alone makes it possible to perceive the integrality of a form. In the same way, the visible dimension of a being, its terrestrial biography, only ever reveals an infinitesimal part ofits potentialities.

Yet prevailing opinion, philosophical or profane, maintains that what is spiritual does not possess form. Form is always that which confers a figure on matter, in the sense of \"physical\" matter. In contrast to this, our first affirmation in connection with our present task must be the existence of spiritual Forms which subsist as such.

The Christian stops here, and ends by simply affirming its existence, but denies that we can know anything more about it. But many push this destructive logic a step further, and deny the existence of spirit altogether. And this is the logical result, for denial can never end in anything but negation and nothing. This is inev itable; and the Christian escapes this conclusion only by stopping before he reaches it. We must admit that there is a spiritual substance, and that this substance has form, or we must deny the existence of spirit altogether. No other conclusion is possible. \"4 What emer ges from the affirmation ofsuch an unambiguous pneumat­ological thesis is the need for a space which, while remaining space, is not the space ofthe sensible universe-that is to say, ofthe universe identified by Cartesian dualists with spatial extension.

Such a space is an existential space, whose relationship to physico-mathematical space is analogous to the relationship of existential time to the historical time of chronology. Highly instructive, also, are the changes in the feeling for and expression of space in the figurative arts of Western man. 6 The problem was how to suggest the third dimension that is lacking in a plane surface. The solution involves recourse to a certain num her of subterfuges which, as such, reveal the conscious or unconscious aspirations of those who employ them, and acquire thereby the value of \"symbolic forms\". These forms symbolize different things, the difference being perceived first of all in their arrange­ment according either to the laws of the perspectiva natura/is, codified by Euclid, or to those of the perspectiva arti.ficialis of the Italian Renaissance. Euclidian optics, on the one hand, establishes a space which is discontin­uous, in the sense that each region differs qualitatively from the other, deriving its position and qualification from the being which occupies it In its own right. An idea of this can be gleaned from the representation of landscape in some great Roman fresco or Pompeiian decorative fragment, which gives us a sense of the great mural painting of Greece. Each section of space has its own horizon, and the detail depicted there is real, as depicted,for that horizon. (In the physics corresponding to this, we have the concept of \"natural place\" as essential to all qualitative space, and which as such links up with the concept of \"existential place\".

The classical, central perspective is obtained at the price ofthis systematic optical unity. What is disturbing is that the way now lies open to all the illusions of the Baroque, to the science and ingenuity of trompe l'oeil. Disturbing, because if we set the forms of expression of space side by side with the secret sense of space corresponding to them, and expressible in pictorial form as well as in mental representation or visionary figuration, we have a comparison which begs a new question. Is not the position of the spirit ual hermeneu t, whose interpretation of Scriptural verses or of the signs and forms ofthe sensible universe goes deeper than the letter or the appearance, similar to that of the artist who is obliged to make a third dimension appear on a plane surface? The task ofthe spiritual hermeneut also involves a deepening of perspective: how, aided by the letter of the text or by sensible objects, is he to suggest their suprasensible-their \"polar\"-dimension, and thereby the integrality of their form ? But then what space must he have available so that mental representation may escape the fate of persp ectiva arti.ficialis, and so that the \"polar dimension\" may not, in the final analysis, prove to be nothing but trompe l'oeil? For many of our contemporaries, given over defencelessly t6 their agnostic reflex, any evocation of a suprasensible world, of spiritual Forms which are more substantial than material ones, is indeed no more than trompe Foeil. Yet, if it is no more than that-no more than the illusion of a reality not worthy of attention-should not the cause or symptom of it be sought first of all in the fact that, with the exception of the school of Jacob Boehme and the Cam bridge Platonists to whom Swedenborg so closely approxi­mated, Western philosophy has lost sight of that intermediary world which, following the Persian Platonists, I designate as mundus imaginalis ('alam al-mithalJ?8 For the space ofthis world is, precisely, the qualitative 8 On this theme, cf my two works Sp iritual Body and Celestial Earth, op. cit., and En Islam iranien: aspects sp irituels etphilosophiques, vol.

One must indeed be deprived ofthis mundus imaginalis to believe that \"dematerializing\" forms amounts to abolishing them. On the contrary, the world of \"subtle bodies\" conceals the true meaning of immaterialization, and restores forms and figures to their archetypal purity. For what would a world without face or features-without, that is to say, a look-actually be? (One thinks of the Islamic precept: never strike at the face!) In our day, there appears to be a tendency to think that by pushing abstraction beyond forms and figures, one is accomplishing something akin to the energy theories which, in ph ysics, transform matter into energy. But in actual fact, Islamic theosophers have always been aware of the different states of matter, culminating in a \"spiritual matter\" to which they have given the name Nafas al-Rahman (the Breath of the Merciful One). They have spoken of the mundus imaginalis, of \"subtle or imaginal corporeity\" (jismiyah mithaliyah), of spiritual matter (m addah ruhaniyah), terms which are the equivalent of the spissitudo spiritualis of the Cam bridge Platonists, or of Oetinger's Geistleiblichkeit For this reason, it was so much the less difficult for them to admit the existence of spiritual forms, and that these forms possess a face and a look. By contrast, the confusion occasioned by the absence of this subtle world engenders the need to free oneself from forms, the need for a liberation conceived as liberation with regard to the object on which classical perspective was based; for the object appears now as the stabilizing and coercive element of the space at whose centre it is.

He was born in the sacred village of Qurnm, 140 kilometres south ofTehran, in 1049/1 639. He spent most ofhis life there as a teacher, and died there in 1103/ 1691. His principal masters were Muhsin Fayd (a pupil and son-in-law ofthe great philosopher Sadra Shirazi) and Mulla Rajab 'Ali. His bibliography consists of about fifteen works, several ofwhich are considerable in length. Only a rew have been edited. He also had an excellent medical education.

Swedenborg expressed it by saying that \"each Angel carries its Heaven within itself, while our Shiite philosopher expresses it in the image of the \"Throne stabilized upon the Water\" and which stabilizes the Water the same time. In the world of spiritual forms there are as many of these centres embracing, or totalling, a universe, as there are spiritual individualities. The perspective here, prop­erly speaking, is a hermeneutical perspective; in the Middle Ages, the science ofperspective was considered fundamental for the same reason that here makes the science of perspective essentially a science of correspondences considered as a fundamental science, postulating a plurality of levels or stages of the universe which are homologous with each other.10 This science of correspondences is equivalent to that elaborated in a treatise, entitled De perspectiva, in which the laws of optics are applied esoterically, that is to say, to suprasensible forms.11 It enables us to witness the birth and amplification offorms and figures in correspondence with each other, recognizable even when they are transformed into each other, from level to level ofthe universe. To go \"beyond\" would be to pass into chaos and nothingness, to deny or violate the affirmation that all earthly things perish, whereas their Face ofLight, or divine Face, lives forever (cf Koran 28:88). Iconographically, what is implied here is a spatiality, the sense and expression ofwhich do not, it seems, figure in the evolution ofthe sense of space in the West. But I believe that I discovered recently, in a book by the Greek novelist Nikos Kazantzakis, evidence of such a figuration which is unexpected, appropriate and striking. The author tells how he once saw a Byzantine icon of St. George, in which \"the fair-haired young hero, on his white horse and with his spear raised, hurled himself at the monster. All the bodies-St. George, the horse, the monster-were compact, mus­cular, crammed with intense matter.

But in the air above this real St. George there was another St. George on the same white horse, with the same spear, against the same monster. Yet on this higher level of vision, everything was dematerialized, the bodies transparent, and through them you could see the flowering meadows and the pale blue mountains in the distance. It was a more real St. George than the real one, the astral body ofthe action, the pale and immaterial flower ofmatter.\"12 In this manner, the anonymous painter ofthe Byzantine icon spontan­eously expressed his sense of a suprasensible space, dominating and enveloping our own; a level or horizon of the universe where forms are not abolished but transfigured, every mode of representation being true for the stage or the horizon at which it appears. We are talking, therefore, about a spiritual space, where forms subsist even more substantially, and more clearly figured, than in ours, since their pure \"matter of light\" exempts them from the caducity of our own unstable and corruptible matter. Once form is transmuted into symbol, its meaning becomes trans­parent, just as the bodies in the icon have become transparent to the flowers and mountains, as if signifying that from now on it is the form which contains its universe, being itself\"a world in which our symbols are ... taken literally\".13 What the painter of the St. George icon expresses here is the intimate sense that the figure, the object, far from being a \"coercion\", liberates him who Contemplates it and meditates on it to a higher state of being, by opening up to him the new space which corre­sponds to such a state. This sense of an object which, when contemplated on a higher plane, \"a higher level of vision\", liberates its own space and transfigures its own form, is to be found, I think, wherever in one way or another access has been left open to the mundus imaginalis. For example, the manner in which our Shiite philosopher, Qadi Sa'id Qummi, exhorts us to meditate on the form ofthe Temple of the Ka'b ah will prove a convincing illustration of this fact. First and foremost, however, it is important to bear in mind the premisses ofthisfigurationofthe Temple, a figuration which contains in itself the whole secret of the spiritual life, because it figures the stages of the mystical journey. 12 Nikos Kazantzakis, Le jarclin des Rochers (Paris, 1959); tr.

This is exactly the cosmological configuration which is to be found in all Islamic theo­sophical tradition. In the work of the Shiite philosopher Qadi Sa'id Qummi, who, as we shall see, applies this figuration to the esoteric meaning ofthe form ofthe Temple ofthe Ka'bah and the rites ofpilgrim­age, this is the traditional schema employed, but with a few original details. There are three categories ofuniverse. First, there is the phenom­enal world ('alam al-shahadah), a realm where things are perceptible to the senses {'alam al-mulk). Then there is the suprasensible world (g hayb), the world of the Soul or Angel-Souls, commonly designated malakut: the \"place\" of the mundus imaginalis, whose organ of perception is cognitive imagination. And there is the intelligible world ofthe pure Intelligences or Angel-Intelligences, commonly designatedJabarut; whose organ of percep­tion is the intuitive intellect. Our philosopher relates these three categories of universe to three categories of space and three of time. There is the obscure, dense time (z aman kathi.f) of the sensible world; the subtle time (z aman latij) of the imaginal world ofthe malakut; and the even more subtle time, the absol­utely subtle time {zaman altai) of the world of the Intelligence. The differentiation of these categories of space and time originates in as many specific differentiations of motion, from the motion of natural things in the process of becoming, to pure spiritual motion (harakah ma'nawiyah). The differentiated spaces are themselves subsumed in the concept of an initial energy whose motion engenders the spatial form which is the origin of everything that assumes form in the world ofbeing, whether spiritual or material. This energy is designated sometimes as Nafa s al-Rahman (the Breath of the Merciful One), and sometimes as the primordial Cloud ('ama').14 Having established this initial schema, our philosopher is now 14 These themes are fully developed by Qadi Sa'id Qummi in the monumental commentary he devoted to the Kitab al-Tawhid by Ibn Babuyah (died 381 /992), one of the great classics of Shiite theology. I myself devoted a full year of courses to this commentary; cf the report in Annuaire de l'Ecole pratique des Hautes-fitudes (Sorbonne), Section des Sciences religieuses (1965-1 966). The theme oftime is elaborated in the commentary on the 2nd hadith of chapter II of the book (S harh Kitab al-Tawhid, Persian ms. fo l. 30 ff; see En Islam iranien, op. cit., vol. I, pp. 179 ff).

There exists between these three categories of universe a certain number of essential relationships, in that each higher universe is the cause ofthe one below it, and contains, in a manner more subtle and elevated, the totality ofuniverses below it. Moreover, while thus containing and enveloping the totality of the universes below it, each higher universe is also the esoteric aspect {batin) of this totality, its hidden, inner aspect or centre. Hence each being of the mulk has its own particular malakut which governs and surrounds it, and which is at the same time within it (its \"esoteric\" aspect), just as each being of the malakut has, in its turn, aJabarut which dominates and surrounds it (envelops and contains it). In other words, each being has a res divina {amr rabbani), a divine Word {Kalimah ilahiyah) that is its own malakut, its \"esoteric aspect\", the inner Man or secret archetypal reality, and that is simultaneously its Watchman or Guardian in that it is the cause which contains and encloses it.15 As we will see shortly, this is the secret of the Pearl evoked by a Shiite hadith which accords strikingly with the celebrated hymn in the Acts of Thomas (see below, III, 2). One must be aware of all this in order to know a human being in his \"integral\" fonn (as opposed to that mutilated form of which I cited an example when speaking of Balzac at the beginning of this study). For these three worlds, or three categories of universe, are invested in the human being. Both the Jabarut and the malakut are to be found in man; they constitute his essential, his real, his inner being, so that even when he withdraws from the phenomenal world which envelops him, he does not and which have an exact correspondence in the cosmology of ancient Iran.

It is perfectly existent (m awjud), and has its own real joys and griefs. It is the imaginal world {m ithali).

And in order to comprehend form in this way, we must envisage it in the dimension which, according to all our thinkers, situates man \"in his Truth\" , his inalienable Truth or eschatological dimension. Indeed, it is astonishing to note the way in which Qadi Sa'id Qummi and his colleagues understand the \"tomb\", when Islamic eschatology speaks of it as spacious or narrow. We are not dealing here with the macabre: this \"tomb\" is not in a cemetery. It is what our philosophers conceive as the subtle body which is the malakut within man, and with which man, after his exitus from the physical world, resurrects to this malakut; for from this \"tomb\" he will resurrect yet again, at the time ofthe Great Resurrection, in order to rise to a higher level in the spiritual worlds. Such is the theosophical meaning, in Islamic eschatology, ofthe term barzakh (in-between, intermediary), as the state ofthe essential inner man who is separated from the elemental body that envelops him, and returns to his world, to which he is introduced in the state ofhis essential body (/ism haqiqi). The latter is designated as the essential body of light (jism haqiqi nuri) or imaginal body (jism mithali)-although this, to be sure, is not in the least \"imaginary\" l6 The imaginal body of light is the malakut of the physical body; and the totality of all the incorruptible and permanent corporeity oflight (jismiyah nuriyah) makes up the malakut of the corrupt­ible, material bodies of humanity.

Its substance derives fr om all the soul's movements, that is to say fr om its habits and ways of being, its affections and behaviour, knowledge and wishes, aspirations, emotions, nostalgias and ardent desires. It is the body that the soul itself has formed and acquired for itself; it may be a body of dazzling light or of darkened light, a garden among the gardens of Paradise or a pit among the pits ofHell.

The idea would not even occur to him who has understood that it is not a question ofsuch tombs or ofsuch remains, but ofthe \"body oflight\", and that the Heaven in question, as Qadi Sa'id Qummi says, \"is not the astronomical heaven over our heads\" .18 This imaginal body {jism mithali), then, is as the soul has configured it.

This, for our theosophers, is a conspicu­ous illustration of the concrete and formidable power of intervention which is described as the soul's configurative power--concrete and formi­dable because the eschatological dimension ofthe real man is dependent on it. We shall see how Qadi Sa'i d Qummi envisions the malalcut of the earthly Temple ofthe Ka'bah; and, since this malalcut is the configuration itselfofthe inner man, the esoteric meaning ofthe origins and ofthe rites of pilgrimage to this Temple must ultimately be sought in the direct configurative action exercised by man on his own malakut.

We are confronted not merely with a conceptual representation, but with both a vision and a configuration ofthe malalcut, all the more \"objectively real\", it must be said, in that they are realized in the world of the Soul. For example, we can speak with our theosophers ofa \"cycle ofprophecy\". This is a clear and rational concept, even though it envisages sacred history. But for them it is configurated and visualized in a real sense in the form of a Temple, homologous with the form ofthe earthly Temple, because this vision \"takes place\" in the malakut, in the spiritual world of the Soul.

Where we see a gathering of sages in meditation, the visionary perceives chariots and knights of fire-in short, everything that in the spiritual world is a representative correspondence. This, ultimately, is the whole difference between the phenomenology of the Spirit in Hegel and the visions in Swedenborg's Diarium sp irituale. The visionary of the malakut perceives the things of this world, but he perceives them as they are in the malakut; he perceives them, that is to say, as men desire and configurate them in their secret reality, which is inaccessible to sensible perception but open to visionary perception. We should not be surprised, for example, by Swedenborg's concise description of a stroll through the stre ets of Stockholm as this town exists in the mWldus sp irituum, \"in its Truth\", which of necessity escapes sensible perception and rational understanding, for these are aware only ofthe hectic bustle of a city ofthis world. By contrast, its real state in the spiritual world inspires a dreary horror: most ofthe houses are shut up and silent, with lightless windows, because their owners are sp iritually dead. Such is the real state of things, which \"trans-appears\" on the \"upper storey\" of vision. Going back to the Byzantine icon of St. George described above, we recall that the reality of the young hero and his com bat was shown to us on this upper storey of vision, as it \"trans-appears\" for the beings of light who people the malakut. In short, if we are to achieve a phenomenology which is integrally true, we must see things and perceive each other as we would ifwe were \"decorporized\", at least momentarily, so that the appearance would actually be the apparition of what is in reality, with nothing external to misrepresent what is inward.19 This is what our 19 One could go in depth into what there is in common between the malakut and the first degree ofthe spiritual world in Swedenborg.

Our goal could be defined as an application of the phenomenology of fo rm (in the sense of the German Gestalt) to the traditional science of correspondences practised by all esoteri­cists, from our Shiite theosophers, and their ta'wiL to a Swedenborg.22 The notion of a \"field of perception\" should be extended, and its objectivity established, so that it includes the notion of a \"field of visionary percep­tion\". Imaginative perception could then be envisaged as laying hold of realities and events, both ofthis world and ofhigher worlds, in the forms which represent them in the intermediary world or mundus imaginalis. To start with, a number of premisses must be established, i. First and foremost, the notion of form corresponds less to a given configuration which is the attribute of a thing, than to a functional definition of the Gestalt understood as a configurative ability or organizing principle, vis corifiguratrix. 2. It must be recognized that both notion and principle have their applicati on well beyond the limits of sensory experience. 3. The \"principle of transposition\" must be acknowledged as fundamental, so that in passing from one level ofthe universe to another, the forms behave like a melody whose structure remains identical and recognizable when transposed into different keys.23 4. This is because the inner relationships of each whole, and the relationships between the wholes, are essentially functional relationships, so that geometrical relationships of the kind proposed by Qadi Sa'id Qummi-for the engendering ofthe cubic form of the Ka'bah-are, essentially, functional relationships enabling us to move Symbol und Wirklichkeit in derislamischen Mystik', Eranos-Jahrbuch XI (1944), pp. 187 ff.

Especially typical is the way in which the Shiite theosopher Qadi Sa'id Qummi, in the course of a monumental work which has hitherto remained in manuscript form, is led to envisage the causes and the engendering of the cubic form ofthe Ka'bah (the Arabic word ka'b denotes a cube). Our author is a Twelver Shiite, not an Ismaili Shiite. And among the traditional texts of Twelver Shiism that he commentates-among those of the hadith that go back to the prophet oflslam-there are certain traditions which limit the number oflmams to twelve only. These Imams are the spiritual Guides who, coming after the Prophet, were to be the \"Preservers\" ofthe sacred Book and ofthe esoteric meaning ofthe Revelations. The limiting oftheir number to twelve, as we have observed elsewhere, eo ipso implies that the twelfth Imam, the Imam of the present time, is the \"hidden Imam\", the \"awaited Imam\". Our author undertakes to discover, in the structures themselves of the cosmos-that is to say, by a detailed im­plementation of the science of correspondences-the necessity for this specific number of twelve Imams. To his first attestation in this respect he gives the name \"proofofthe Throne\" (burhan 'arshi). Later on, we will see that the figure ofthe Throne is equivalent to that of the Temple. Here we must note the following:25 The first being in the higher universe to emanate from the supreme Principle is a Light which contains all light (because all light is created from it). This Light of lights is described as the Throne ('Arsh), the Intelligence ('Aql, the Nous), Muhammadan Light {NUR muhammadi), be-24 Cf Wolfgang Kohler, Psycho/ogie de /aforme, Collection Ide'es, no . 60 (Par mard, 1964); trans .

The first being to emanate in the lower world is named the primordial Water, understood as onto­logically prior to Water as one ofthe four Elements of our physical world. This primordial Water signifies the entirety of spiritual and material creatures, inasmuch as they are the contents ofthe intellection (ma1umat) ofthe Intelligence. Further, by reason ofthe unity sui generis formed by the Intelligence and the object ofits intellection, this Water is likewise known as the Throne. Now, if it is correct to picture the Intelligence as sW'rounded by its objects ofintellection, with itselfas their centre, it is no less true to say that it surrounds, contains and envelops them. Here the difference about which our author is so insistent, and which he ponders with the aid ofthe Theology attributed to Aristotle, makes its appearance: the differ­ence between the material orbs whose centre is sW'roundedby their periphery, and the spiritual orbs whose centre, paradoxically, has the property of being \"that which surrounds\" (muhit). The Intelligence is the Light, the Throne, the centre, knowledge as a unique, unquantifiable point, and at the same time it is also Water, the peripheral whole of all the objects of its intellection. The relationship of the Intelligence, as centre, with itself as the periphery surrounding and enveloping all the objects of its intellection, is expressed in the phrase \"the Throne rests on the Water\"; and this relationship is consolidated by twelve functional relationships which determine the cubic form which is both the imaginal form of the cosmic Temple and the sensible form of the earthly Temple ofthe Ka'bah. In other words: for the Throne, the Muhammadan Light, to be both the centre ofthe universe and the periphery containing it-in order, that is to say, fer \"the Throne to rest upon the Water\" which it also stabilizes-these twelve functional relationships must exist; and their existence, as we will see, is assured by twelve human creatures of light (basht:u nuri), twelve sacrosanct persons of a superior humanity, namely the twelve Imams. Twelver Shiite lmamology is thus the form or vis configuratrix organizing the universe whose constitutive factors are rep­resented by the two symbols of Light and Water. We can now examine in detail the method whereby we proceed from the figuration of the orb of the Throne to the figuration of the cube. In considering the figure of a circle as it presents itself to our sensible 200"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA' BAH perception, we see that several diversified aspects, or dimensions, appear as soon as we draw lines out frcm the centre to the periphery. Four of these aspects are essential, and result frcm the intersection of two lines that pass through the centre and are perpendicular to each other. They are essential because they divide the circle into four semi-diameters, and represent thereby the four metaphysical limits inherent in all creation, beginning with the Throne itself The Throne is surrounded in this way by jour limits that face each other, since it has a beginning (a wmzP and an end (akhir), an inner or esoteric aspect (batin) and an external or exoteric aspect (zahir). The first two limits are understood from the extension of its total time (the Aion, dahr, \"time of times\"), and the second two frcm the extension ofits total space (\"sp ace ofspaces\"). Thus the original point of Knowledge, ofthe Throne, ends in four points which are designated as the supports of the Throne (cf. fig. i). 26 It is commonly said that the supports or bearers of the Throne Artjour in number, and in certain Shiite traditions they are signified or represented as lights, the \"four lights of the Throne\", whose colours indicate that they are, respectively, the origin of each region ofbeing which is symbolically linked to this colour: red light, green light, Fig. I.

This is one of the great themes of Shiite theosophy.27 Let us join up these four points by the chords underlying the arcs ofthe respective circles, and follow the three phases of the mental operation whereby Qadi Sa'id Qummi brings out the cubic form of the Throne or Temple. This operation is based on the principle that everything in the lower world is an image and a projection of something in the higher world, and that consequently the four limits are manifested in the suprasensible world before being manifested in the sensible world, in virtue of the correspondence establishing the \"principle oftransposition\". Let us imagine that the square inscribed within the circle in fig. i (defined by the points ABCD), representing the suprasensible world (ghayb), accomplishes a \"descent\" (tanazzul) through a projection of itself onto the lower level which represents the world of sensible phenomena ('alam al-shahadah), and which is defmed by the points A'B'C'D'. Four straight lines (AA', BB', C C, DD') join up, respectively, the four angles of the higher level with the four angles ofthe lower (cf fig. 2). At this point the supports of the Throne which is Knowledge are doubled from four to eight, as alluded to in the Koranic verse 69:17: \"On that day, eight bear the Throne ofyour Lord.\" Secondly, we must note the four straight lines (AB, BD, AC, CD) that interconnect the four limits ofthe suprasensible world and mark the unity and coherence ofthe spiritual world, thus permitting the coherent procession ofthe multiple ofthe lower world from the unity ofthe higher. Thirdly we must take into account the four straight lines on the lower level (A'B', B'D', A'C, CD') which interconnect the four limits ofthe world below and mark thereby its organization and coherence. This threefold operation gives us the eight angles that are the \"supports ofthe Throne\", plus twelve lines and six surfaces contained between each pair of lines. Qadi Sa'id Qummi observes that the four points or meta­physical limits, the four lights, arising from the central point, must there­fore be at the origin of the cubic form of the Throne or Temple (usul al-27 On these four lights or pillars of the Throne, see my work on Ibn 'Arabi, Creative Im aginatwn ... , op. cit., pp. 373-37 4.

B A n c 8' A' D' C' Fig 2 The cube Ofwhat specific structures are we made conscious by this geometrical elaboration? Or, in Shiite terminology, what is here the consummation of the ta'wil, ofthe symbolic hermeneutic? Our author suggests the answer straightaway when he invites us to consider the cubic form of the Temple, which totalizes and interconnects spiritual and material realities, as a unique Emanation proceeding from the supreme Principle; that is to say, as a human person, as theAnthropos who is God's vicar with regard to what he envelops and contains eminently within himself In other words, the figuration of the Temple of the Ka'bah is likewise the figuration of Shiite prophetology and lmamology, beca use in both cases the same functional relationships are preserved. We should thus bear two things clearly in mind . On the one hand, we have the question: in what way is the figuration of the Temple an imitation of the structure ofthe spiritual orbs, in which the centre is also that which surrounds? On the other hand, we should remember that Shiite prophet­ology reproduces, broadly speaking, the main features of the Judaeo­Christian prophetology expressed in the idea of the Verus Pro pheta, who hastens, from prophet to prophet, towards his resting-place, a resting­place identified with the Last Legislative Prophet and the final Seal of prophecy. However, the essential and irremissible characteristic of Shiite 203"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"THE CONF1GURATION OF THE 1E:MPLE OF THE KA'BAH prophetology is that it bases the prophetic mission on the inner, esoteric meaning of the prophetic message. This is expressed in the idea of the walayah, the \"divine dilection\" that renders sacred all the \"Friends of God\" and invests the Imams as ministers of the esoteric meaning of the prophetic missions. In the case of the Nabis or prophets, the prophetic vocation (n ubuwwah) is added to the walayah from which it derives and which is superior to it because it is at the \"centre\" of each \"Friend of God\". This, broadly speaking, is the relationship between nubuwwah and walayah.28 Hence, when Qadi Sa'id Qummi invites us to reflect upon the general form ofthe Temple as the figuration of a human Person, the Anthropos or \"Perfect Man\", first divine Emanation and God's Vicar {Kh alifa t Allah) over all Creation, he specifies that by this we should understand him who was the final Seal of legislative prophecy (Khatim al-nubuwwah), and as such the plenary terrestrial manifestation {mazhar) of the Verus Propheta­o( that is, the \"Muhammadan Light\" (Nur muhammadi), Nous or Logos of the primordial Pleroma. Shiite prophetology sees the \"Seal ofProphecy\" as recapitulating and totalizing the entire body of previous prophets and their prophetic missions, because he is the Seal of the cycle of prophecy (da'irat al-nubuwwah). Hence the diagrams, as for example in Haydar Amuli, that arrange the series of prophets in the form of a circle. This, however, does no more as yet than give us the \"peripheric\" function ofthe primordial Muhammadan Light. It is the walayah inherent in it which is both the central point and the circumference of the Temple of prophecy. We must thus envisage the Muhammadan Light as essentially a hi­unity, typified in the two persons of the Prophet and the Imam. The Prophet expresses the aspect ofthis Light that is turned towards men (the prophetic mission ad extra), whereas the Imam expresses the aspect that is 28 On the relationship between nubuwwah and walayah, and in general on the prophet-ology and Imamology here presupposed, see my Histoire de Ia philosophic islamique, vol. I, Collection Idees, no. 38 (Paris, Gallimard, 1964); see also En Islam iranien, op . cit., vol. I, book 1, chapter VI. On page 259 of this work, there is a diagram constituted by three concentric circles: the circle of the walayah is in the centre, surrounded by the circles of the nuhuwwah (prophetic vocation) and the risalah (pro­phetic mission). However, since all prophetic missions and vocations have their source in the walayah, and there is no nabiwho is not first a wall (one of the \"Friends of God\"), it is equally true to say that the walayah surrounds the whole. The word walayah has a Latin equivalent in the word affi nitas. The link of sp iritual tiffmity denoted by the walayah corresponds in Shiism to the Christian notion of communio sanctorum (cf below, IV). 204"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA' BAH turned towards God (that is to say, the return to the source by means of the inner esoteric sense ofthe Revelations). The Muhammadan Light as the centre of the circle of prophecy is the esoteric aspect of all the prophecies recapitulated in the final prophecy, that of the Seal of the prophets; and this esoteric aspect is typified in the Shiite conception by the person of the Imam . In fact, the mission of each prophet includes an esoteric aspect: each legislative prophet has been followed by twelve Imams. But the Imam, or esoteric aspect, was sent only secretly to earth with each previous prophet. It is only with the final Seal of prophecy that the Imamate is made publicly manifest in the person of the twelve Imams. And it is precisely in the person ofthe twelve Imams, as constituting the centre and esoteric aspect of the final prophecy, that the Muhammadan Light is both centre and circumference ofthe Temple ofuniversal prophetic religion. The twelve Imams of the present cycle of the walayah, which succeeds the previous cycle of prophecy, 29 are in effect the link between the prophetic religion ofthe cycle previous to the Seal ofthe prophets and that of the cycle of the walayah. The Twelve Imams are the vis configuratrix that confers its form on the Temple of permanent prophetic religion, because their Imamate is the esoteric sense of all prophetic Revelations. Thus, just as we were shown, a short while back, that the point of origin, in virtue of its creatural nature, was surrounded by four meta­physical limits which it engenders (fig. 1), so here the point of origin which is the Muhammadan Light spontaneously develops four limits (aspects or dimensions,jihalj, which circumscribe the previous cycle of prophecy and are typified in four ofthe great prophets: Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. In similar fashion, it develops four limits defining the cycle ofthe Imamate inaugurated by the closing ofthe cycle ofprophecy with the Seal of the prophets. These four limits are here the Prophet himself(in his empirical person, wujud 'unsuri), together with the three first Imams: 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, Hasan ibn 'Ali, and Husayn ibn 'Ali (fig. 3).

And as the inner cohesion of the higher level, then that ofthe lower level, and lastly the interconnection between them, were seen to be assured by the twelve straight lines and six surfaces that engender the cubic form, so here the twelve Imams homologically assume the same functional relationships for the cubic form ofthe Temple of prophecy. By means of the Imamate, which is the esoteric aspect of prophecy and its heart, the Throne or Muhammadan Light is \"stabilized upon the Water\". It is impossible to ad d or to take away anything from these twelve. Finally, just as the geometric figure of a cube comprises six surfaces, the names borne by the twelve Imams are six in number: three were called Muhammad, four were called 'All two were called Harem, one Husayn, oneJaj'ar, and one MJsa (Moses).3 This, broadly speaking, is the geometric elaboration described by Qadi Sa'id Qummi as \"t he proofofthe Throne\", a proofthat brings to light a structure which shows why ofnecessity the Imamate should consist ofnot more than twelve Imams.

From the supreme Heaven among the astronomical heavens, or ninth Sphere, emanate energies which are shared out between the twelve signs of the zodiacal Heaven that lie along the course ofthe Sun and Moon ofthe sensible world. In the same way, the universal Heaven oflight ofthe higher world, which envelops the totality of intelligible and sensible Spheres and is the Throne of the essence­archetypes and of the divine Words (Kalimat ilahi.yah), must necessarily create twelve strongholds oflight, the dwelling-places or stopping-places ofthe Sun of the final prophetic mission and of the Moon ofthe esoteric aspect, or Imamate. These twelve Signs oflight are the twelve Imams, in whom is ramified the existence of the Muhammadan epiphanic form (taqasim WU)Ud al-mashhad al-muhammadl). A second point emerges when we reflect on the position ofthe Sllll in the astronomical He aven, which is the Throne in a form perceptible to the senses; when we reflect, that is to say, on the sun from the- point of its rising at the time ofthe spring equinox to the point at which it terminates a twelve-month course-the Moon, on the other hand, co mpletes its course in the space of one month. Similarly, the Sllll of the final prophecy progresses and is made manifest by the twelve months which are the twelve Imams. Each Imam, therefore, corresponds to a lunar month, because the Imamate is the night of esotericism; and the Imam is a Moon in the heaven ofthe walayah, that is, the nocturnal heaven which is the esoteric aspect ofprophecy (baiin ai-nubuwwah). Thus, through the projection of a hermeneutical perspective-that is to say, of a disposition of correspondences, a field of vision arising no longer are the second Imam (Hasan al-Mujtaba, ctied 49/669), and the eleventh Imam (Hasan al-'Askari, ctied 260/874).

We are induced to meditate upon the manner in which the functional relationships are preserved when one moves from the geometrical structure of the cube to the relationship of prophecy with the Imamate, which together make up the Temple of prophetic religion; or when one moves from the relationship of prophecy with the Imamate to the relationship of the supreme Heaven with the signs of the zodiac, or else to the relationship of the year with its twelve •months. These last confer on Shiite Imamology the traits of what the history of religions designates elsewhere as \"theology of the Aion'� The spirit of Shiite theosophy is characterized, one might say, by a remarkable configurative power. This power reveals figurations and correspondences which we merely mention here, since to do anything more we would have to study them in the light of a phenomenology of Form (Gestalt), and for this purpose we would have to renew the traditional science of correspon­dences. We can now anticipate the esoteric significance ofthe pilgrimage to the Temple of the Ka'bah as the centre of the terrestrial world, containing, homologically, all of creation. The form of the Ka'bah is the very form of the cosmic Throne or Temple, as it is also the form of the Imamate or malakut of this world, of its esoteric or suprasensible aspect. For the mystical pilgrim, the pilgrimage and the rites of pilgrimage performed at the Temple of the Ka'bah have a direct configurative action on the formation of his body of light, on his body's malakut-that is to say, on the attainment of his total form, in the sense that his body of light becomes simultaneously centre and periphery of his essential, total being. We must, therefore, go on to consider the plan and the construction of the Ka'bah. 2. The Plan of the Temple of the Ka'bah. Qadi Sa'id Qummi reflects on this plan in the course of some densely-packed pages of the same great work we referred to above, pages which follow those that we have already drawn from, and in which is re vealed the totality of esoteric meanings of the pilgrimage to the Temple ofthe Ka'bah in Mecca.32 In the preceding 32 We explained above (note 25) how the hadith is introduced which is commentated here by Qadi Sa'id QUmmi.

In the same way, while retaining the same figurations and functional relationships, we now move from the structure constituted by the archetypal figures of cosmogony to the plan of the earthly Temple of the Ka'bah, 33 thus dis­covering why this Temple takes on a cubic form, as indicated by its Arabic name. It is always the same principle that is called into play: the forms of light (su war nuriyah), the higher figures, are imprinted on the realities below, which mirror them. (VVe should note that, geometrically speaking, the considerations here adduced would remain valid even if the object of meditation was the form of a Greek temple.) On the higher plane of Reality-archetypes, which together constitute Nature-not, as yet, the specific Nature of our terrestrial world, but Nature as the epiphanic form of the divine Will of manifestation-we encounter four limits that correspond to the four metaphysical limits referred to above (fig. 1). Here these limits are named respectively univer­sal Intelligence, universal Soul, universal Nature, and universal Matter (Matter which is not as yet that of our physical world, but which embraces all the subtle and \"spiritual\" states of the Materia prima). \"When, \" says our author, \"these aspects or dimensions ofthe higher Lights are reflected to the Imam, and the explanation given by the latter, naturally lead the conversation round to the five fundamental religious practices of Islam: Prayer, Almsgiving, Pilgrimage, Fasting, and the Jihad as spiritual combat. On each of these articles Qadi Sa'id, in his role as commentator, has written a veritable treatise explaining the asrar, that is to say, the spiritual, inner and esoteric meaning. Together these five treatises foon as it were a book which can be considered separately, and which has even been edited recently as such by M. Sayyid Muh. Baqir Sabzavari with the title Asrar al- 'ibadat wa haqiqat al-Salal (Tehran, 1339 A.H.). We have given particular emphasis (see above, note 14) to the study of the third of these treatises, the Kitab asrar al-Hqjj, or \"The Book of the esoteric meaning of Pilgrimage\", which contains seven chapters. For the study ofthe first chapter which fo llows, cf ms. fo l. l 77-179. 33 Let us call to mind the Koranic verses concerning the Ka'bah, which our author does not fail to mention at the beginning of his elucidation. \"The first Temple to be founded fur men is that which is Bakkah, the blessed Temple\" (3:96) (Bakkah is another name for Mecca). \"God has made the Ka'bah into the sacred House, to be a station fcr men\" (5: 1 00). \"Pilgrimage is incumbent upon man as an obligation towards God\" (3 :97) \"Perform the circumambulation around the antique Temple\" (2 2:29). And a remark made by the Imam Rida: \"The Temple was founded as the centre of the terrestrial world, beneath which the Earth is spread like a carpet. Every wind that blows in this world comes from the Syrian corner of the Temple. It is the first demarcated field to be established on Earth; because it is the centre, the obligation to be fulfilled is equal for Orientals and Occidentals.\" 209"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA' BAH on the Earth of receptiveness (a rd al-qabiliyah) for the manifestation (z uhur) of the divine Lights, then the four corners of the blessed Temple of the earthly Ka'bah take form .\" Furthermore, two of these four divine reality-archetypes (haqa'iq muta'­assilah ilahiyah)-namely, the Intelligence ofthe universe and the Soul of the universe (fig. 4)-are on the oriental side of the ideal Reality (m ashriq al­haqiqah), \"because they both belong to the horizon of the world of pure Lights, and are the Orient in which the Sun ofthe esoteric spiritual senses (shams al-asrar) arises\"-The two others-universal Nature and universal Matter-are on the occidental side. The Light rises with the first two­Intelligence and Soul-which are its Orient, the divine Day; and wanes, sets and is hidden in the last two quarters ofthe cycle-universal Nature and universal Matter-which are its Occident and correspond to the Night. The four limits together form the nycthemeron of cosmogony. Out of this night, from the occidental horizon, the Light will rise in a new dawn, when the \"dense and obscure time\" (z aman kathif) of our world comes to an end.34 When the Koranic verse 55:17 speaks of the \"Lord of the two orients and the two Occidents\", it refers to these two oriental and two occidental horizons. Thus, the strict law of correspondences requires that, in the plan of the terrestrial Ka'bah, the corners should be arranged in accordance with the same order of relationships: two of them--namely the Iraqi corner, in which the Black Stone is embedded, and the Yemenite corner-are on the oriental side, and two ofthem-the Occidental corner and the Syrian corner-are on the occidental side (fig. 5). We will now go through the same process as before (fig. 2), and be mental witnesses of the \"descent\" (tanazzul), or rather of the \"projection\", ofthe Reality-archetypes onto the earthly plan ofthe Ka'bah. Each comer of the higher plan enters into correspondence with a corner of the lower terrestrial plan by means of a straight line which represents one of the Elements. These straight lines (or pillars, arkan) themselves define the sides of an ideal Temple whose height, for the imaginative perception, enables Heaven and Earth to communicate with each other. A Let us picture the Temple of the Ka'bah as a person facing the pilgrim who approaches it from the north side (we have just been asked to think ofthe Temple as the theophanic person ofthe Seal ofprophecy). It 34 On the symbol of the sun rising in the West, see Paul Kraus, Jabir ibn Hayycn, vol. I, in Memories de l'lnstitutd'Egypte, vv. 44-45 (Cairo, 1943), p.

With regard to its position in the Temple building, it is said that the Black Stone is \"God's right hand\". On this corner rests the dimension which establishes a correspon­dence between Nature, meaning here our earthly physical world, and the Intelligence ofthe universe (fig. 6). We have already seen that the primor­dial Water symbolizes the obj ects of intellection of the Intelligence, the lights of this Light. It follows therefore that among the four Elements of our physical world, the element of Water is born of the dimension which links Nature imaginally with the Intelligence; and the vertical line that represents it in the cubic form of the Temple typifies this functional relationship (the Arabic word rukn, pi. arkan, serves to designate the stone as well as the column, or pillar, and each of the four Elements). In addition, it is beneath this corner that the living water rises up out ofthe well called zamzam. 35 B. Also to the right ofthe Temple, that is to say on the oriental side towards the south (the \"back\" ofthe Temple, envisaged as a person facing the pilgrim approaching it) is the Yemenite comer (or pillar) (fig. 6), corresponding to the dimension that links Nature with the Soul of the world or Spirit of the universe. It is situated at the end of the side contiguous with the comer of the Black Stone, which corresponds to the Intelligence, for it is through the \"divine dimension\" ofthe Intelligence that the Soul proceeds from it. 36 Thus the Yemeni te corner (rukn yam ani) is 35 The designation ofthis corner as Iraqi should be understood in a vezy broad sense, as encompassing not only Arab Iraq and Persian Iraq ('Iraq 'ajami}, but extending the latter as fur as the province of Fars (Persia).

The first Intelligence (and after it each ofthe others) performs an act of triple contemplation. From the contemplation of its Principle there proceeds another Intelligence.

C. The Syricm corner on the occidental side, to the left of the Temple envisaged as a person fa cing the pilgrim, but to the latter's right when facing the Temple facade (fig. 6), corresponds to the dimension linking the Nature of our physical world to universal Matter; for this universal Matter, which embraces all creation both spiritual and material, proceeds from the Intelligence through its \"creatural dimension\" (in the way that the Soul proceeds from the Intelligence, as we saw, through the \"divine dimension\" of the latter). Now the principle of the Earth, the element Earth, is produced in our physical world by the relationship ofNature to universal Matter; indeed, this relationship engenders that which is most able, in our physical world, to manifest the Reality-archetypes with stability. It is typified by the Syrian pillar ofthe Temple. D. There remains the occidental corner at the back and to the left ofthe Temp le (still envisaged as a person facing the pilgrim). This comer corresponds to the dimension linking the Nature of our physical universe with itselfas universal Nature, on the level ofthe Reality-archetypes.

Nature and universal Matter is established, and the Y emenite corner, where the relationship between terrestrial Nature and the Soul or Spirit of the universe is established. This is so because what we call Nature in our world results from the breathing into universal Matter of the Soul or Spirit of the world. Thus the element Air is born of the relationship of earthly Nature with itself as universal Nature; at the same time, given that the manifestation (the vestigia, aJhar, active traces) of Nature is produced in Matter, the effect of this relationship is made manifest in the Syrian comer.

These correspondences can be perceived with the help of a geometrical elaboration whose basis is the cubic form of the Temple of the Ka'bah, and which, according to Qadi Sa'id Qumm i, is eo ipso the explanation ofthis Temple38 3. The Celestial Archetype of the Temple. In spite of all that we have already written, the mystical phenomenology of the form ofthe Temple is far from complete. We have been enabled to perceive the cubic form ofthe Temple of the Ka'bah, but a more difficult problem remains. This is the corre­spondence of the earthly Temple of the Ka'bah with its celestial archetype, the spiritual Temple in the spiritual universe. Qadi Sa'id Qummi knows that here he must deploy the powers of a form of thought that is essentially intuitive39 The problem is this: although unquestionably there are spiritual forms more real and more substantial than the material forms perceptible to the senses, how are their structures to be homologized with each other, given the difference between them, of which, as we saw, our author is so aware? In effect, the characteristic of spiritual forms is that their centre is both that which is surrounded and that which surrounds, that which is 38 Continuing to apply the principle that everything in the sensible world is a.form (s urah) belonging to the higher universes, Qadi Sa'id elucidates yet more traditional homologies. The Temple on earth corresponds to the Temple in the fo urth Heaven (a l-Bayt al-ma'mur, Koran 52:4), and it is square in fo rm (murahba') becaus e the words on which Islam is fo unded are four in number, the four tasbihat or fo rmulas of glorification (tahlil, takbir, tasbih, tahmid). The three dimensions ofthe cube are likewise homologized with the three aspects ofthe Tawhid: the aspect ofthe Essence (tawhid dhati), the aspect of the Attributes (tawhid sifati), and the aspect of the Operations (tawhid fi'li.

According to the long title he gives to the chapter, Qadi Sa'id is well aware ofhis change of level. In all that fo llows, he will henceforth address himself to the intuition, through a method of exposition \"foreign to rational understanding\". The reflections which fill these chapters are \"modest virgins, in no way suited to the vigorous maleness ofmen with rational knowledge\". 214"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA' BAH contained and that which contains, whereas in the case of material forms, the centre is purely and simply that which is surrounded The form of the earthly Temple must, therefore, conform finally to this ambiguity of the centre in the spiritual forms; for only then can the material form be elucidated in a spiritual form, and the earthly Temple of stone be trans­figured into a spiritual Temple of faith. Apart from other sources, the celestial archetype of the Temple of the Ka'bah is to be found in traditions that go back to the Shiite Imams. Two motifs represent it: the Tent descended from Heaven, and the white Cloud. A tradition going back to the fifth Imam, Muhammad al-Baqir, re­counts how when Adam fell from Paradise, he complained to God about the solitude and wildness of the places in which he found himself. God then caused a pavilion to descend, a single tent from among the tents of Paradise. The angel Gabriel set up this tent upon the site which was to be that ofthe Temple of the Ka'bah. The surface ofthe Tent exactly covered the area to be covered by the future Temple, and the corners ofthe Tent coincided with those of the Temple. The central pillar of this heavenly Tent was a rod of redhyacinth. The four tent-pegs were ofpure gold, and were yellow. The ropes were woven of threads as silky as hair, and were violet. Here traditions vary. Sometimes it is the Angels who build the Temple of the Ka'bah in imitation of the celestial Tent. Sometimes it is God himself who builds it so that Adam, together with the seventy thousand Angels commanded by God to bear Adam company, might process around it. In any case, at the four corners ofthe earthly Temple were placed four foundation stones, originating respectively from Safa, Mount Sinai, Salem or Kufah, and Abu Qubays (the place where Adam halted on arriving in Arabia). We will shortly see how these four stones possess a decisive significance for the spiritual form of the Temple. Another tradition, going back to the sixth Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq, re­counts how when Adam was \"reconverted\" to God, the angel Gabriel came to him and took him to the future site ofthe Temple. Here a white Cloud (ghamdmah) descended and overshadowed them. The angel ordered Adam to trace with his foot a groove outlining on the earth the exact area covered by the shadow ofthe white cloud. This was to be the perimeter of the Temple of the Ka'bah. We will encounter the context of this hadith later on, in the elucidation ofthe esoteric meaning ofthe rites of pilgrimage. 215"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA 'BAH As for the traditions which contain a reference to the secret ofthe Black Stone embedded in one corner of the Ka'bah, these likewise assume significance in the context of the first pilgrimage undertaken by Adam in the company of the angel Gabriel.40 \"In all this,\" declares our author, \"there are mystical secrets, access to which is denied to the best-trained intelligences, let alone to those minds which delight in placid torpor. As regards us,\" he adds, \"we will show here, with divine help, a ray ofthat light, fcr the benefit of him who decides to attempt the ascent of this mountain and to reach its lofty summit.\" It is from this summit that one may discern how it is possible to establish the correspondence, or homology, between the forms of spiritual things or beings and the forms ofmaterial things or beings. The starting­point, says Qadi Sa'id Qummi, is the most perfect and stable form of all: the sphere. Let us at once observe with our author that in the present case we do not move from one category to another in moving from the spherical to the cubic form, because the latter simply locates certain functional relation­ships whose supports are inscribed within the sphere. In particular, in this respect, one must make no mistake when the spherical form is attributed to spiritual beings: what is being expressed in this manner is not a geometrical relationship as such, but a functional one. This is not to say that spiritual beings have the form of a ball with a certain diameter. It means that each Angel, or each human form oflight, or the subtle imaginal body, is not \"in Heaven\" but carries its Heaven within itself, just as each demonic entity carries its Hell within itself.41 Qadi Sa'id Qummi is insistent upon this point: the spherical form, roundness, is not one which pre-exists and is imposed on spiritual beings. The spherical form which 40 We will find the context ofthis hadith below, section III, § 3. The author cites here two other traditions in which\" the symbol ofthe red hyacinth is substituted for that of the white Pearl (he himselfremarks on their identity ofmeaning). According to one tradition: \"The Black Stone has two eyes, two ears, a mouth and a tongue (which is why the Black Stone is witness to the \"judgem ent\" ofman) . It happene d that as Adam passed by it in Paradise, he struck it with his fo ot When he was fo rced to descend, as it was of gleaming red hyacinth, he kissed it This is why the pilgrims today kiss the Stone as they pass it. \" According to the other tradition: \"When Adam had descended close to the mountain of Abu Qubays, he complained to God about the wildness of the places in which he fo und himself, and that he no longer understood what he used to un derstand in Paradise. Then God caused a red hyacinth to descend. He placed it on the site ofthe Temple, and Adam walked around it Its radiance was such that signals (or emblems) were made in its fo rm, and it became a sacred object. \" Sharh, 179b. 41 Cf. my Hermeneutique spirituelle comparee, op. cit. 216"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA'BAH we perceive here below-the sphericity ofthe universe in its totality and ofthe heavens that compose it-is a form derived from spiritual beings, a form which is the manifestation in our own space of the intimate law of their being. This being said, it may further be specified that ifthe most perfect and stable of forms is sphericity, this is because the relationship between spheres consists in the fact that they surround each other: the spheres of our universe (Heaven and Elements) are englobed by and encased in each other. Otherwise-if, for example, they were juxtaposed-there would either have to be another body between them or else a void, a hypothesis excluded by traditional physics. Furthermore, each ofthese spheres which are encased in each other possesses a superior degree of subtlety and light in relation to those below it and which it envelops; each sphere is duller and more opaque than the one within which it is encased. The truth of this law is made evident as one descends from the supreme Sphere, the manifested Throne of the Reality-archetypes-so pure that it is not even constellated-to the immense Heaven ofthe Fixed Stars (which contains, besides the mass of constellations, everything that we nowadays call the galactic universes), and then from planetary Heaven to Heaven until one reaches the elementary Spheres that surround the Earth.42 In the spiritual world also there are ideal Spheres that surround each other, in the sense that the cause completely surrounds that ofwhich it is the cause43 \"Down below\" likewise, what is inferior has a lesser light, and appears duller in relation to what is spiritually superior. Here we are faced with the question whose terms we defmed above: in what sense can one speak of a correspondence or homology between the centres of the spiritual Spheres and the centres of the material Spheres, when in the spiritual Spheres the centre is both that which is surrounded and 42 Qadi Sa'id observes here that the Prophet never uses the word Heaven (s ama? to designate the Spheres (sing. Kursi, 'Arsh), which are outside and above the planetary Spheres that fonn our solar system; Shark, 179b. 43 All this accords perfectly with the Theology said to be by Aristotle and with Avicenna's commentaries. Cf G. Vajda, 'Les Notes d'Avicenne sur la \"Theologie d'Aristote\"', in Revue thomiste II (1 951); see also my Avicenna and the Visionary Recital, op. cit., p. 54. See also En Is lam iranien, op. cit., vol. IV, general index s.v. Theologie dite d'Aristote.

In our world, says Qadi Sa'id Qummi, what is below (i.e. the Earth) is the centre in relation to what is above it and surrounds it. This is the reverse ofwhat happens in the world with respect to which it is \"down below\"-that is to say, the reverse of what happens in the spiritual world; for there it is what is above that is the centre, but a centre which is no less capable ofbeing that which surrounds; while what is below in the spiritual world, although in the position ofbeing that which surrounds, is as such that which is surroundEd So how is one to establish a homology of forms? The answer to this question depends on the application ofthe phenom­enology of Form to the traditional science of correspondences and, together with this, the possibility for spiritual forms to reveal themselves as such, as ofright and in the plenary reality as forms. In order for this to happen, a double correspondence must in principle be established. A A correspondence between the centre of the mate rial form and that of the spiritual form inasmuch as this is a surrounded centre; and B. a correspondence between the centre of the material form and that of the spiritual form inasmuch as this is a centre that surrounds. In order to perceive intuitively that the Ka'bah, being the centre ofthe earthly world, is also that which surrounds it (the surrounded-surrounding, the enveloped­enveloping),44 one must perceive \"imaginally\" that its structure is hom­ologous with the structure of the Temples of the spiritual world, the Temples of light. This is what the motifs of the celestial Tent and the white Cloud are intended to suggest. Finally, there enters into this very structure an element represented by the four corner-stones, an element which \"dematerializes\" and transforms the Temple of stone into a spiritual Temple of faith. The inner, spiritual form-the form of light-as the centre assembles and totalizes the \"data\" ; it is itself the \"giver of the data\", the external data surrounding the centre of the material form . It is 44 On these expressions, see my Creative Im agination in the Sufism of Ibn 'Arabi, op. cit., pp. 279 ff Like Haydar Amuli, Qadi Sa'id Qummi was steeped in the writings of Ibn 'Arabi, with whom the Shiite theosophers early discovered their affinity. Never­theless, there was one point on which they were unable to compromise and over which they were fo rced to criticize him, namely the person of the \"Seal\" of the walayah, (khatim al-walayah) who can only be the Imam.

A On the one hand, then, the material centre-the site ofthe Temple of the Ka'bah as centre of the terrestrial world and of the geocentric universe of the Spheres-by virtue of its homology with the centre of the intelligible Spheres, has the privilege of manifesting the Temple (Bayt Allah, the \"House of God\") in correspondence with the Throne of the sovereign Unity ('arsh al-wahadanyah al-kubra). This latter is the pure intelligible Temple {al-Bayt al-'aqli) around which the pure sacrosanct angelic Intelligences process (the Angeli intellectuals). B. On the other hand, this terrestrial centre of the corporeal world corresponds to the Glorious Throne ('Arsh majid) in the world ofthe Soul, that is to say, the supreme Sphere, which is the first to be affected by the action of the World-Soul. This supreme Sphere is the body which sur­rounds and envelops the universe (jism muhit bi'l-kul!J.

The homologation of category B establishes a correspondence between the centre, and the centre as surrounding (m uhit): the Sublime Throne contains the intelligible Spheres, the Glorious Throne contains the astronomical Spheres, the Temple ofthe Ka'bah contains, homologically and within its \"imaginal\" structure, the totality. Thus, says Qadi Sa'id Qummi, this double correspondence is reflected from above down to the earthly Temple; and he adds: \"All this contains a mystery about which no one up till now has, to my knowledge, said more than I have ju st said\" (and we admit to sharing this opinion, so abstruse is our author's text at this point).45 45 There are, besides, some variants between our ms. fol . 180 and the text edited by M.

The structure of the Tent which descended from Heaven, and which the angel Gabriel set up for Adam, is the structure of a spiritual form which contains its universe within itself. Our author undertakes a detailed examination of this. The hadith of the fifth Imam specified that the central pillar of the Tent that came down from Heaven was made out of red hyacinth In fact, it typified the Throne ofthe sovereign Unity, whose central pillar is the Supreme Divine Form revealed (al-uluhiyah al-kubra), which, in this context as in Ismaili theosophy, is the first Intelligence of the pleroma, the supreme No us. 46 It is by virtue of this Nous that summits and abysses, Heavens and Earths, exist, as witnesses to this Unity. It is represented by the red hyacinth because it totalizes two aspects. It is divine because it is the initial theo­phany of the Absconditum, and this divine aspect is absolute light. But at the same time it is also creatural, and every creatural aspect is Darkness. It encompasses both the aspect ofthe worshipped and that ofthe worshipper, postulated by the very concept of divinity. Ac cording to the physics of our authors, the colour red derives from the mingling of whiteness, as an aspect or dimension of the Light, with blackness, as an aspect or dimension of Darkness. This is the motifwhich Suhravardi introduces so arrestingly at the beginning of the mystical recital he entitles The Purple Archangel-that is, having the purple colour ofthe morning or evening twilight, when day is mingled with night.47 This Tent is supported and stabilized by four tent-pegs (awtad)48 typify -detailed comparison here, so I limit myself to hoping for a forthcoming critical edition of Q adi Sa'id Qummi's great work. 46 On the word uluhiyah as a designation of the divinity manifest in the first Intelli­gence of the pleroma as a support for the name Allah (D eus revelatus), see my Trilogie ismaelienne, op. cit., pp. 160-161, and my book Creative Im agination in the Sufism of Ibn 'Arabi, op. cit., pp. 112 ff. and 293-294. 47 Cf my translation ofthe 'Recit de l'archange empourpre', inL'Archange empourpre: quinze traite's etrecits mystiques, VI, Documents spirituels 14 (Paris, Fayard 1976), pp. 201-213.

This should be related to the notion ofthe procession of the Intelligences; see above, note 36. 48 The Awtad also figure in the esoteric hierarchy, whose structure probably derives from the image of the celestial Temple.

Qadi Sa'id Qummi explains that these comer­stones correspond to the four tent-pegs of the archetypal Tent, of gold in both substance and colour. They typify four lights from among the lights of the walayah (an war al-walayah). It is thanks to these lights that the universe of being ('alam al-wujud) subsists at all, for the walayah is the \"divine dilection\" which sanctifies the \"Friends of God\", those through whom God still watches over and cares for this world. The four lights in question were those of Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. In connection with this our author cites a tradition which makes its appear­ance fairly frequently in Shiite texts: \"According to the Torah, the Light came (or as one variant has it: the Lord [al-Rabb} came) from Mount Sinai. This light arose over Sa'ir. It shone from the mountain of Faran.\" It is of value to us to be able to identify in this tradition, where the proper names are simply Arabized, the exact translation of two Biblical verses (Deuteronomy 33:2-3)52 For our Shiite theosophers, this light is the light of the eternal prophetic Reality, of the Verus Propheta who found support from prophet to prophet, down to Muhammad who was the Seal ofprophecy (see above, fig. 3) . That it comes from Sinai is a reference to the mission ofMoses. Its rising over the mountain of Seir (Sa'ir) is the symbol of the mission of Jesus; its splendour shining on the top of Mount Paran (Faran) typifies the final prophetic mission ofMuhammad. It is this light, also, which confers upon the four comer-stones the mystical significance that elevates the trans­parent spiritual Temple above the fonn of the earthly one. A The epiphany ('l11hur) of the Light of prophecy began with Adam and attained perfection in Abraham, through whom the religion of the pure believers (m illah hanifiyah) was made manifest. Abraham was neither Jew nor Christian; the religion of Abraham corresponds to the fundamen­tal constitution of man as originally willed by his Creator (thefitrah). The stone in the Syrian comer comes from Safa because it was on Safa that Adam appeared to Eve (after their exile from Paradise), and because it was here too that Abraham halted at the end ofthe migration which he undertook 52 a Deuteronomy 33:2/3 (Moses' great prophetic benediction): \" ... the Lord came fian Sinai, and :rrne up ficin Seir unto them; he shined fath fun ma.mt Paran ..

The stone from Salem (Salam) symbolizes the rank and mission of Jesus. This is in the Yemenite corner, which is to the south and on the oriental side. A Koranic verse states: \"Maryam retreated from her family towards a place situated in the Orient\" (19:16), and we already know that in this retreat of Maryam's \"towards the Orient\", lsmaili gnosis sees one of the esoteric moments which are at the origin of Christ's mission.03 The Yemenite comer also suggests the reason why the mystical qualifications of \"Yemenite\" and \"Oriental\" should be bestowed on one and the same theosophy .54 Here, Twelver Shiite gnosis stresses another aspect: just as Jesus was the Seal of the walayah (divine dilection and initiation) imparted to the prophets who succeeded each other after Adam, so the first Imam, 'Ali ibn Ali-Talib, was the Seal ofthe universal walayah imparted to all the \"Friends ofGod\" (Awliya' Allah), prophets and non-prophets. Thus, he is a substitute for Jesus (Qa�m maqam, locwn tenens), he who \"answers for\" him, just as the twelflli Imam, the Imam of the Resurrection, in his tum \"answers for\" the entice li ne ofthe prophets. In other words, the Imam 'All is in the same re lation to Jesus as the twelflli Imam is to all the Imams and prophets. (Hence the names of Salem and Kufah associated in the attestation of the stone's origin.) Thus at the Yemenite comer of the Temple, on the oriental side, Shiite meditation brings about the unification of a prophetic Christianity with its own Imams, a unification also heralded in the fact that Christ's return must ofnecessity be preceded by the appear­ance ofthe twelfth Imam. Moreover, the plan of the heavenly Jerusalem with its twelve gates corresponds to that of the Temple with its twelve Imams. D. Still on the oriental side, there remains the Iraqi corner, the comer in which the Black Stone is embedded, and whose \"pillar\" typifies the relation between all earthly things and the higher world ofthe Intelligence. Since Abu Qubays was the place where Adam halted, this provenance is doubtless a reminder that the secret of the Black Stone is linked to the drama itself of Adam (see below). But Qadi Sa'id Qummi essentially 53 Onlsmaili christology, see my Hermeneutique sp irituelle comparee, op. cit., 10. 54 In virtue ofthe tradition st ating that \"faith is &om Yemen and wisdom (theosophy) is Yemenite (al-imanyamani wa'l-hikmahyamaniyah)\". Hence, for example in :Mir Damad, the notion of\"oriental theosophy\" (m ashriqiyah or ishraqiyah) coincides with that of \"Yemenite theosophy\", meaning a theosophy which is inspired: a mental vision of the beings oflight, not simply theoretical speculation. Like Maryam, the theosopher goes \"towards the Orient\", in the direction marked by the comer where the meeting takes place between Jesus and the first Imam.

The function assumed by the Iraqi corner within the Temple as a whole corres ponds in this way with that ofthe Seal ofprophecy, with whom the mission of all the previous prophets is finally completed. This is how the configuration ofthe Temple ofthe Ka'bah is shown to be homologous with that of the Temples ofthe spiritual universes. This Temple, the centre ofthe terrestrial world, is the centre surroundedby the procession ofbelievers in this world; but at the same time it is the centre which surrounds, because it is the Temple ofthe eternal prophetic Religion. From being a material form situated at the centre of our world, the Temple becomes the spiritual form that surrounds and contains our world in its totality. Its corner-stones, the four great prophets, elevate it, as the immaterial Temple of faith, above its material configuration, so that it overhangs it (as in the Byzantine icon of St. George the immaterial body of the young hero contained the whole universe of his combat). The thought of Qadi Sa'id Qummi shows a similar elan: as the material Ka'bah rests on its corner-stones, so the Throne or Temple of eternal Religion, the hierocosmos, subsists through its great prophets; and this is why the eighth Imam, 'Ali al-Rida, said: \"The divine Religion will never perish so long as the Temple ofthe Ka'bah endures\", the Temple, that is, offaith which is the religion ofthe prophets. The same statement is made in the Koranic verse 5:97: \"God established the Ka'bah as the sacred Temple to be erected in perpetuity for human beings '' The Temple of the Ka'bah, explains our author, is so perfectly the spiritual Temple of faith that it could only disappear if the Imam ceased to exist-the \"hidden Imam\", that is, who is the mystical pole of the earthly world of men, without whose existence humanity would not even be able to keep itself in being; for the hidden Imam is the pole that invisibly gathers around himself those through whom God still \"cares for\" this world55 This precisely is the spiritual Temple which remains forever in this world, by virtue of the invisible presence of the hidden Imam. Here par excellence it is proper to speak of the \"Cloud over the sanctuary\" 55 Cf En Islam iranien, op. cit., vol. IV, Book 7. The existence of the invisible Imam as the mystical pole of humanity is absolutely necessary ifhumanity is to continue to exist.

The area sutraunding the Temple: the \"stations\" of the angel Gabriel and of Abraham. The little plan drawn by Qadi Sa'id Qummi (see above, fi g. 5) contains three hi therto unremarked attestations. 56 To the left of the Temple when fa cing it, and thus to the right ofthe Temple envisaged as a person fa cing the pilgrim-in the oriental part of it, therefore-just beside the threshol d, is a site marked by the letter G. This is the pl ace or \"stati on\" (m aqam) ofthe angel Gabriel. In the occidental part of the Temple, to the left ofthe \"person\" ofthe Temple (but to the right ofthe person fa cing it), in front of the Syrian corner, is a site marked by the letter A. This is the place or \"station\" of Abraham. Finally, still in the occidental part, is a site marked by the letter H. This is the hijr oflshmael, or the house oflshmael {B ayt Ism a'il), where he buried his mother Hagar and where he himselfis buried. 57 These three sites possess an outstanding significance in connec­ti on with the structure and fu nction ofthe Temple ofthe Ka'bah as a spiritual Temple, that is to say, as a Form whereby the mystic attains to the fullness ofhis being. Our author consequently sets about di scovering the reason for their respective situs. The pl ace of the angel Gabriel is explained by the prominent part playe d by this Angel with respect to Adam, when, after hi s exile fr om Paradise, Adam di scovered the secret ofthe Black Stone (cf below, III, 2). The Stone is embedded exactly there, in the pillar establishing a communication between the earthl y Temple and the world ofthe Intelli­gences (fig. 6) whose most eminent fi gure is the angel or archangel Gabriel. As the initi ating angel of the prophets in general , and particularly of the Seal ofthe prophets to whom he transmits or di ctates the text ofthe Holy Book, the angel Gabriel fi gures largely in the writings of Islamic theologi ans and phil osophers. He is both the angel ofKnowledge and of Revelation, Holy Spirit and active Intelligence. 58 It fo llows that his place 56 Here begins the third chapter of Kitab asrar al-Hajj, op. cit., fol . 181-182. 57 Cf SafinatBihar al-Anwar I, p. 225. 58 One could write a sizeable monograph on the figure and role of the angel Gabriel in the theology, philosophy and theosophy of lslam, as well as in Islamic spiritual lite 227"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA'BAH should be at the threshold ofthe Temple, on the oriental side, by the pillar of the Black Stone, because, explains Qadi Sa'id Qummi, it is he who receives the mystical pilgrims on their arrival there. \"He makes their perfect spirits mount up to the world ofthe beings ofpure light, he brings them into the presence of the Master of the house.\" He it is who brings them \"into the neighbourhood ofthe Temple ofGod which is in the world of the Intelligence (see above, II. 3) ... Those who take refuge in the Temple enclosure the Angel leads into delicious shade (Koran 4:57), into a place of safety ( 44:51). On those that possess the aptitude for it he sheds knowledge which derives from the Principle who is the source of all Emanation (al-Mabda' al-fayyad). He leads those who thirst after high spiritual knowledge (m a'arifhaqiqiyah) to the wells of sweet clear Water, to the living waters of the Kawthar (1 08:1 )\". Furthermore, on the occidental side of the Temple is the house oflshmael. Our author sees this as a symbol of what is frequently expressed in Arabic by saying that the son is the secret (sirr, the esoteric meaning) of his father. This is how the person of Abraham is to be approached in order to understand his place and function on the occidental side ofthe Temple of the Ka'bah, in front of the Syrian corner or \"pillar\". It is here that the symbolicjustification ofthis \"station\" of Abraham's leads our author into a full-scale recapitulation of the homologies whereby the visible and invisible universes symbolize with each other, in the course ofwhich the supports or \"bearers\" of each of these \"Thrones\" are also homologized with each other. The nomenclature differs somewhat from the previous one (see above, II, 3), but the correspondence is easily established. 1. There is what Qadi Sa'id Qummi here calls 'Arsh al-Sarir, and which is identifiable without difficulty as the eighth Heaven, the immense heaven of the Fixed Stars (the Kursi or Firmamentum). This is the \"Throne in the firmament\" where the constellations ofthe zodiac are distributed. Further­more, and most remarkably, we see the reappearance here, in our Shiite theosophers, of explicit traces of Ezekiel's fam ous vision. Mulla Sadra Shirazi, for his part, has preserved a tradition explaining the division of the signs ofthe zodiac by the four figures ofEzekiel's vision.59 These four in general. In the Diarium sp irituale where Ruzbihan Baqli described his visions, this figure often recurs, entrancing the visionary with the be auty ofhis fe atures. Cf En Islam iranien, op . cit., vol. Ill, pp. 47, 48, 50-52 and 63. 59 Cf Ezekiel. 1:10 and Revelation 4: 7 (the vision ofthe four \"living creatures\", hayyoth) . 228"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"THE CONFI GURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA'BAH figures-Man, Lion, Eagle, and Ox or Bull-are here the four supports of the Throne or Temple of the firmament (fig. 8). 2. There is the Throne or Temple ofthe visible cosmos ('Arsh al-Mulk), the Throne in the Sphere of Spheres or supreme Sphere, which englobes the totality ofthe universes that are manifest to the senses. We may recall that this universe is defmed by four limits (fig. 1, the limits which engender the cubic form). These four limits, which apply to all beings, are respec­tively designated here as the volume of a being (jism, or its configuration, surah); its spirit (ruh); its nourishment and growth; and its level of realization. These are the four comers of the Temple or Throne of the Mulk. Their homologues and also their supports are an archangelic tetrad and a tetrad of prophets (that is, in the malakut and also in the hierocos­mos): a. Adam and the archangel Seraphiel are the supports ofthe forms ofbeings at the moment when the spirit is breathed into them; b. Muham­mad and Gabriel are the supports ofthe spirits and oftheir realization; c. Abraham and Michael ensure the subsistence ofbeings; d. the Imam 'Ali and Azrael determine eschatologically their final level of realization.60 There are eight supports, therefore, for the 'Arsh al-Mulk (fig. 8). 3. There is the Throne of Knowledge and Religion ('Arsh al-'Ilm wa'l­Din) which, as we already know, also possesses eight supports (see above, fig. 3). These are four great prophets from among the ancients-Noah, Sadra Shirazi develops this theme at length in his monumental commentary on Kulayni's Usul mina't-Kafi, in cormection with the verse oftheTlrrone (Ayat al-Kursi} referred to in the hadith ofthe Imams (cf Kafi, K. al-Tawhid, chapter XX, on the 'Arsh and the Kursi, and Sadra Shirazi's commentary, lith. Tehran n.d., pp. 309 ff, 314 ff). It is evident that Qadi Sa'id Qtunmi, fo l. 181b, was familiar with this commentary. A comparison should one day be made between all that has been written in Islamic theosophy about the \"Throne\" and the mystique of the \"Throne\" (theMerkabah) in Jewishgnosis. Cf Gershom G. Scholem,Les Grands Courants de Ia mystiquejuive (Paris, 1950), pp. 53 ff; tr. Major trends in Jewish mysticism (New York, Schocken, 1976). See also 5 Enoch or the Hebrew Book of Enoch, ed. and trans.

Ezekiel's vision and the vision of the Apocalypse are the source of the \"tetramorph\" in Western icono&raphy; magnificent examples of it exist in Coptic and Carolingian art, signs of a Christendom in which the initiatic tradition was still alive. 60 In order to simplify the schema, Azrael is here allotted the fimction which our author doubles in the fimctions of Ridwan and Malik. The Imam's eschatological fimction should be returned to the body of Shiite doctrine; cf fur example Abu'l Hasan Sharif Isfahani, Tafsir Mir'at al-Anwar (Tehran, 1375 A. H.), p. 9 (on this work, see my report inAnnuaire de l' Ecole pratique des Hautes-Etudes, cited in note 14 above). Shiism, as the religion of the walayah, is the religion oflove as regards the theophanic persons or forms {m azahir} who are the twelve Imams. The love or the hostility he bears them makes the paradise or the hell within man. 229"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA' BAH Abraham, Moses and Jesus-and on the other side the four Muhammadan figures: the prophet Muhammad and the first three Imams, 'Ali ibn Abi­Talib, Hasan ibn 'Ali, and Husayn ibn 'Ali61 4. There is the Throne of Sovereign Unity ('Arsh al-wahdaniyah al-ku­brd), whose supports (see abov e, fig. 6) arc four in number: Intelligence, Soul, Nature and Matter (the Intelligence or Sublime Throne is the central pillar of red hyacinth). Thus, there is symmetry between 'Arsh al-wahdaniyah and 'Arsh al-Sarir (of Ezekiel's vision), in that they each have fo ur supports, and there is symmetry between 'Arsh al-Mulk and 'Arsh al-'Ilm wa'l-Din, each ofwhich possesses eight supports. This in no way compromises the correspondences of all the Thrones or Temples amongst themselves. With this recapitulation completed, and Abraham's rank among the supports of the other Thrones or Temples specified, the meaning of his place in the area surrounding the earthly Temple ofthe Ka'bah should be quite clear. This meaning is linked essentially to the function ofthe spiritual Temple. Abraham is there first of all because the prophets and the Imams are the \"Face of God\" (Wajh Allah), and by orientating oneself towards them one turns towards God. But more precisely, Abraham's place is there on the left, on the occidental side ofthe Temple en visaged as a personfa cing the pilgrim, because this occidental situs conceals Abraham's exemplary mys­tical significance, whereby Abraham, builder of the Temple, makes the pilgrim fit to approach the Temple (p olestas clavium) and to be introduced by the angel Gabriel into the spiritual world. His place is there in front of the Syrian corner, whose stone comes, as we saw, from Safa, where Abraham dwelt in exile. He is associated \"functionally\" with the archangel Michael because, although the subsistence and growth of beings in general devolve mystically upon the archangel Michael, the subsistence and growth of believers and the children of believers devolve upon Abraham the prophet. Now, in the physiology ofthe human body, nutrition is a process pertaining to the \"left (or occidental) side\", because food travels, or \"emigrates\" {ightirab), in the person whom it nourishes, by way ofthe left side-which is the side of the heart. 61 M. Sabzavari, ed. cit., p. 184, note 1, refers, in connection with this theme, to texts by Kulayni, Nasiruddin Tusi and Ibn Abi Jumhur Ahsa'i . Unfortunately, we cannot expand on this here. 230"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA'BAH Moreover, Abraham is called the intimate Friend of God (Kh alil) be­cause the ground ofhis being is intimately in volved with his love for God and the love of his God is intimately in volved with his being,62 in an intimacy comparable to that of food when it mixes with and is assimilated into the body of him whom it nourishes. Seen in this light, Abraham's position with regard to the mystical physiology of the Temple envisaged as a person is surely on the left side, the Occident or maghrib. The maghrib is the place of setting and exile: thus, the double implication of the root of the Arabic word (gh-r-b: the setting star and the exile who emigrates) gives rise to the whole mystical meaning of the personage of Abraham. Abraham is he who goes into exile towards the \"supreme horizon\" (al-ufq al-mubin, the horizon where the Angel appeared to the Prophet, Koran 81:23); he disappears from himself and is concealed from both universes. A hadith of the sixth Imam declares \"Islam began in exile and will once more be in exile as at the beginning. Happy are the exiles!\" Abraham typifies the spiritual exile whose place is not in this world; and the spiritual exile, the stranger to this world, becomes the instrument through which God still watches over this world. As one tradition has it: \"It is through the prophets that God watches over men\", and according to an inspired (qudsi) hadith, famous among the mystics of lslam, it is ofthis exile and stranger that God said: \"I am the eye through which he sees, the hearing through which he hears, the hand with which he feels, the foot with which he walks ... \" The mystic whom Abraham typifies by the involvement ofhis intimate being with divine love is the spiritual man whose person, in concealing itself from this world, simultaneously becomes the West or Occident of the divine Light (m aghrib Nur Allah), that is to say, becomes the mystical place where this Light declines, exiles itself, and conceals itself in this world in order to dwell in this world. Thus the drama of Adam exiled into this world achieves its denouement in Abraham exiling himself from this world; for it is in Abraham exiledfrom this world and a stranger to it that the divine light will itselfbe exiled into this world. Ifthe divine Light did not thus exile itself into this world, concealed in those who exile themselves 62 On the reasons fcr associating the prophet Abraham with the archangel Michael-reasons which also make him worthy to be called an intimate :fiiend (Kh alil}, and thereby illuminating with the light of Islamic mysticism the \"philoxenia\" of Abraham in the famous icon by Andrei Rubliev-see my Creative Im agination ... , op. cit., pp. 315-316 23 1"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"THE CONF IGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA' BAH from this world in order to be, without men's knowledge, the receptacles ofthis Light, God would cease to watch over this world, to \"care for\" it.

This is what we have called the potestas clavium bestowed on the believer. From this point onwards, the mystical meaning of the pilgrimage and the rites of pilgrimage present themselves in all clarity to the inner vision. III. The esoteric meaning of the pilgrimage to the Temple of the Ka 'bah I. The procession '�n Heaven': A traditional teaching among the spiritual masters of Islam says that there are two sorts of pilgrimage: one is the pilgrimage ofthe community ofthe faithful ('awamm), who travel in order to visit the Holy Places, and the other is the pilgrimage of the initiated mystics (khawass), and is the desire for the Face ofthe divine Friend. Just as exoterically there is a Temple ofthe Ka'bah which orientates the gaze of created beings (a Ka'bah which is their Qiblah), so es oterically there is a Ka'bah which is the object of contemplation ofthe divine gaze, and this is the heart of man. The material Temple is the Ka'bah around which the pilgrims walk in procession; the Ka'bah of the heart is the place where the divine graces process. The first is the goal of pious travellers, and the second is the place where the pure Lights descend. The former is the house, the latter the Master of the house. For each of us th ere is a direction (Qiblah) towards which he orientates himself, and which is his personal Ka'bah. Whichever way he turns, he meets the face of the Friend, the Face, that is, with which the Deus absconditus is re vealed to him and becomes for him the Deus revelatus. This Face, which mysteriously reveals the Ineffable in the lineaments of the Friend, is what is known in Shiism as the Imam, and could be said to be the secret at the heart of Shiite spirituality63 -the secret that we will discover when the pilgrimage has been explained. 63 This is a faithful summary of a long Persian armotation by M. Sabzavari, op. cit., p. 184, and it testifies to the spiritual sense of a present-day Iranian theologian. The Koranic verses with which it concludes are among the most popular in Shiite 232"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA'BAH The earthly Temple ofthe Ka'bah, being a centre, is the place around which the ritual circum am bulations are performed. The Temple possesses a celestial archetype, and the ritual too possesses one, since every centre is homologous with every other, and the circumambulation is associated with the actual idea of the centre. Qadi Sa'id Qummi explains64 how around the archetypal centre, the initial Temple in the intelligible world, goes the procession, made up-as we saw above (II, 3)---of a seraphic humanity of pure Light and of the Angels of the highest hierarchies who, through unassuaged nostalgia and an ecstasy of love, encircle in their flight the area surrounding the Sublimity. In the same way, the pilgrims walk in procession around the Temple on the Earth of absence and separation, in commemoration and as a reminder of the state of this superior seraphic humanity (the Fourteen Most Pure Ones). The initial divine Intention manifests itselffrom universe to universe by manifesting eo ipso the constant correspondence between the things above and the things below. Nevertheless, between the supreme degree ofthe Temple in the world of the Intelligence and the plane ofterrestrial Nature where the Temple of the Ka'bah rises, there are many intermediate stages, and it is here that the drama is played out, the symbolic story whose denouement is the building of the earthly Ka'bah. There is a long traditional recital on this theme which goes back to the fifth Imam, Muhammad al-Baqir. The drama \"in Heaven\" begins at the moment when God announces to the Angels: \"I will install a vicar on Earth\" (2:30), thus announcing the appearance of Adam, ofthe earthly human Form, in the capacity of God's Caliph in the universe ofNature. This episode \"in Heaven\", as meditated in Ismaili gnosis, is the key to sacred history; but for Ismaili as for Twelver Shiite gnosis, the Angels to whom God makes this announcement are not the Angels of the higher hierarchies65 For Qadi Sa'id Qummi, the Angels in question are those of sp irituality: \"Everyone has a part of heaven towards which he orientates himself (� :148)., and \"Whichever way yc:u tum, there is the Face of God\" (2:11?): the Face which is the Imam, he woo guides, because in it is revealed the Friend. Herein is contained the SLnl1 of Shiite mysticism. 64 Here begins the fourth chapter ofKitah asrar al-Hajj, op . cit., fol . 182 and 182b. 65 Cf my H ermeneutique sp irituel! e comparee, op . cit., note 149, on the interpretation given by Ismaili gnosis, using the text ofthe hadith of the Imam Ja'far, of the episode \"in Heaven\", where his fa ther, the Imam Muh. al-Baqir, beside the Ka'bah itself, teaches a mysterious stranger about the Temple's celestial origin. 233"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA' BAH the physical universe (Mala'ikah tabi 'iyah), who are the malakut of our visible world-the malakut, as we said, \"where our symbols are taken literally\". These are the Angels who are seized with amazement and fear in the face ofthe divine announcement ofthe kh alifah entrusted to terres­trial Man. For it seemed to them that because ofthe purity oftheir nature there was nothing that could surpass it in nobility, and that this spiritual khalifah should have come to them. \"Will you,\" they ask, \"establish on Earth a being who will create disorder and shed blood?\" ... \"I know,\" came the reply, \"what you do not\" (2:30). Then they understood the limit of their knowledge and the insufficiency of their power. The divine reply is seen by them as the effect of a divine displeasure, as though the divine Light were being veiled from them. That is why, explains the recital of the Imam, they sought refuge close to the Throne where seventy thousand Angels come each day; they went around it in procession for seven days or seven thousand years. This variant of days or years possesses little significance when it is a question of \"subtle time\" (z aman latij); only the number seven is important, because it always symbolizes in this episode the interval oflost time to be made up, the \"lost time of eternity\" which is redeemed by the seven periods or \"millenia\" of the cycle of prophecy .66 This, explains our author, is why seven ritual circumambulations are performed around the earthly Ka'bah, one for each millenium Since the Angels are those ofthe physical universe, the Throne around which they go during this episode is the Temple of the Soul of the universe; the Temple, that is, in the world ofthe malakut, described in the form of its physical manifestation as the Glorious Throne (the ninth Sphere; see above, II, 3). Its symbolic description signals both its differ­ence from and its similarity to the Temple or Throne of the Sovereign Unity, symbolized in the Tent descended from heaven. The Throne ofthe malakut or Temple in the world of the Soul is made, explains the Imam's recital, of a marble of immaculate whiteness, exempt from all the impurities of physical material modalities (a Temple, therefore, made of the all­subtle matter ofthe mundus imaginalis).

The columns of the Temple are here made out of green emerald, because they are the traces emanating from the outpouring of the Soul of the universe over the universal body, and because the colour green is more or less the mean between white and red (as in the Temple of the Sovereign Unity the violet colour of the ropes was the mean between the yellow gold of the world of Intel ligences and the red resulting from the mingling ofthe Divine with the Creatural). Every detail, every colour, ofthe structure ofthe Temple is rich with a symbolism that should be explained with the help ofmany comparisons. We cannot do this here; we can only emphasize some suggestive points. God looked with love on the initiative taken by the Angels ofthe malakut, and commanded them to \"descend to Earth\" in order to build a Temple there which would be the image (the imitation, hikayah, the \"history\") of the Temple in the world ofthe Soul. This was the Temple around which Adam, and then his children, performed their perambulations in imitation of the Angels of the malakut. Yet at the time of the Flood, the Angels carry off this Tern ple on earth and transfer it to the fourth Heaven. The profound significance of the Flood, not as a geological event but as a spiritual cataclysm, is made apparent in this transference ofthe Temple. Brought to earth by the Angels, like the Holy Grail of our Western traditions, the Temple is swept away by the Angels from men's gaze when the latter have become incapable or unworthy of seeing it.67 Abraham, the spiritual exile, will rebuild a Temple on earth on the foundations ofthe vanished Temple. This is how the Abrahamic pilgrim, in performing the external rituals, knows that his true pilgrimage is being accomplished around an invisible Temple within the space of the malakut. 2. Th e secret of the Black Stone and the motif of the Pearl. From here we pass to the ultimate and decisive question: what is the function of the spiritual Temple with respect to the esoteric meaning of the rites of pilgrimage, when these are perceived as configurating the Temple's spiritual fonn?

He makes this journey in the company of the angel Gabriel, a fact whose significance will shortly become apparent. When he is tired by the weight ofthe Stone, the angel Gabriel relieves him ofit and takes his turn at carrying it-a magnificent symbol, seeming to say that only another Angel can momentarily relieve man ofthe burden of the Angel, that is to say of the pact that involves all his destiny with regard to the spiritual world. Each day and each night, Adam renews his mystical undertaking to this Stone that had been the testimony ofhis Paradise, and in whose company he advances until he arrives at the site ofthe Temple in Mecca. Here, as we know, in obedience to the divine command, the Angels of the malakut of our world erected a Temple in the image of the Temple that had been their refuge \"in Heaven\", and the Black Stone is embedded in the corner of the Temple whose mystical correspondences have already been pointed out to us. On this spot, the recital continues, God received the undertaking of the sons of Adam, and we are present at the repetition-or the continuation-on earth of the drama that took place \"in Heaven\". We are in agreement with Qadi Sa'id Qummi that there is no doubt that the Imam's recital explains the secret of the white Pearl (\"white\" here meaning wholly pure and splendid) by the deployment of this secret in three settings: the world ofthe Intelligence, the world ofthe Soul, and our physical world. On each level, hum an beings exist in a form whose subtlety progressively decreases; on each of these levels, they utter the triple undertaking in a language that corresponds to their modality of being on that level. On the level ofthe world ofpure angelic Intelligences, their utterance is in the language of these Intelligences. This is the first episode in our recital, where it is said that the Angel who was later to be concealed in the form of the Black Stone was the first of the Angels to reply. Next, we pass to the level on which corporeity comes into existence still in its wholly subtle form, the form of the body of light (jismiyah nuriyah) of the mundus imaginalis. The \"clay\" out of which the human creature is made on this level is the subtle clay of the \"Earth of light\" (tinah ardiyah nuriyah; cf. the Terra lucida in Manichaean gnosis). But because the cor­poreal form now exists, there is a centre which is distinguished from the surrounding periphery (cf. above, the difference between spiritual and 238"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA' BAH material orbs). This plane of subtle corporeity is symbolized in the tra­ditions by red hyacinth or white pearl, and it is one aspect of the celestial Throne or Temple (cf above, II, 3 and III, 1, on the symbolism of red hyacinth) . At this level of manifestation of the human being, the central part ofhis clay of light is precisely the Angel whom God gave to Adam to be his companion and witness, who was charged with making him remember the divine pact, and before whom he had every year to renew it \"in Paradise\"; for this was the Angel whom God had caused to absorb or swallow the pact-the Angel, in other words, to whom He had confided the pact in trust. The jewel at the centre of man, says Qadi Sa'id Qumm i, is desig­nated as the \"Angel\" (m alak), because his rank or degree of being is the esoteric and the invisible, the malakut of the world which is manifest to the senses. The jewel that utters and remembers the divine pact is the mala/ad within man, both the corner-stone of the Temple (the Black Stone em­bedded in the Iraqi corner), and the Angel concealed within man's ap­parent material form (the centre, the Earth of ligh� the Paradise within man, or else that which holds the keys to it). According to Qadi Sa'id Qummi, \"To all that is inner and esoteric pertains authority over what is outer and exoteric, to educate and direct it (whence the question asked of Adam by the Angel: Has Satan, then, triumphed within you? ... ) And by the Angel we mean that which possesses this anteriority and authority, by virtue of the fact that he is the centre of the hum an being, before the other parts were constituted according to the norms proper to them'' In Shiite terms, this centre is the Imamate within man. For this reason the jewel, as it is in itself, retains its purity, white pearl or red hyacinth, in its state as \"body of light\", unalloyed by any foreign admixture. However, we read that after Adam left Paradise, the divine mercy cast this white pearl towards him. This means that this priceless pearl descends \"from the hieratic world of the Throne and of the body of light\" into the elemental physical world. Of necessity, therefore, it puts on the \"robe\", or appearances, of the dark world into which it is cast. The earth of India where it lands has a precise significance: among all the levels of the manifestation of being, it is the level which is the Occident of spiritual entities (m aghrib al-arwah), the level where their nature of light is occulted. That is why Adam fails to recognize the pearl: on this level it is veiled, occulted, by the darkness of men's sins, by their obsessive pursuit of the 239"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA' BAH pleasures of their ephemeral, physical existence. He recognizes it only when it assumes its original form; that is to say, when he has himself stripped it, divested it of its garment of darkness, in the same way as he strips the object perceived by the senses in order to attain to the vision of the intelligible. But he is capable of this stripping off only when the Stone has prompted his remembrance. His senses merely perceive the Black Stone; it is through his imaginative spiritual perception that he attains the vision of the Angel, of the white pearl, and remembers. It would be impossible for us not to recall here a famous chapter of the Gnostic book of the Acts of Thomas, entitled The Hy mn of the Soul or The Song of the Pearl (several episodes of which have their exact equivalent in Suhravardi'sRecital of the Occidental Exile). The recital of the Imam Ja'far Sadiq is a striking example of the Pearl motif in Twelver Shiite gnosis. Without doubt this motif has characteristics peculiar to it, which a detailed comparison would reveal. The \"pearl\" in the Acts of Thomas can be seen as a symbol of the soul itself, and as a symbol of the gnosis 72 that the soul must attain and which is the soul's salvation. In our Shiite text, the \"pearl\" symbolizes man's spiritual centre, his Angel: that is, both what his remembrance must make him rediscover, and that which prompts the remembrance. The recovery of the \"pearl\" is this act of remembering. The object of the act is expressed in Shiite terms as the pact, the triple Attestation referred to earlier; but such an Attestation is the expression of a spiritual totality (see above, II, i) which, figured in the form of the Temple, possesses as its corner-stone the Black Stone-the Stone, that is to say, in which man rediscovers the jewel or Angel concealed within himself. The homology or correspondence between the configuration of the Temple and the form of the spiritual life is therefore perfect. The pilgrimage that leads Adam, in the company ofthe angel Gabriel, into Arabia and to Mecca, is the preparation for the third and final scene, in which the secret of the Black Stone is revealed on the level of our present earthly world. For an Islamic theosopher, the symbolic significance of this journey is immediately obvious, as a journey in the course of which spiritual entities finally decline in their Occident. In this theosophy, the function ofthe angel Gabriel is a primordial one. He stands, as we know, 72 a ReinholdMerkelbach,Roman undMysterium in der Antike (Munchen undBerlil?, 1962), pp. 310 ff., 315 fi See also my book The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism, op. ctt., pp. 22 ff. 240"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA' BAH at the Temple threshold, close to the corner in which the Black Stone is embedded; he is the Holy Spirit and the Angel ofhumanity; human sou1 s in this world emanate fr om hi s \"wing oflight\";73 and he is the angel of Knowledge, whose illumination projects the intelligible fo rms onto our intellects . It is thus altogether appropriate to typify, in the pilgrimage where Adam and the angel Gabriel are associated, the entire process of the descent ofthe white Pearl into this world, where it is metamorphosed into the appearance of the Black Stone-the form, that is, in which it appears to sensible perception and in which man must learn to recognize it, unless he is unfortunate enough to live hi s whol e life through without doing so. The Black Stone, says the recital, was pl aced in the corner ofthe Ka'bah (where we located it in our previous figurations) . And it was there that God re ceived the undertaki ng of the sons of Adam, \"to warn us,\" writes Qadi Sa'id Qummi, \"that all begins again fr om the beginning\". The \"drama in Heaven\" in fa ct begins over again on earth with each man: 74 his divine pact, his departure fr om Paradise, his act ofrecollection, and his search for the lost Paradise. It is the Angel within hi m that makes the undertaking, the Angel whom God caused to \"swallow\" the pact in his celestial pre-existence; and it is he, the external man, who betrays it. Each son of Adam must in hi s turn complete the pilgrimage, that is to say, he must rebuild the spiritual form ofthe Temple, in order to attain his own centre. He must rediscover the secret ofthe Black Stone which is also the secret ofthe Angel; for this Stone-which the pilgrims kiss in passing, as did Adam when he recognized it-fu1 fils the same fu nction in the material Temple of the Ka'bah as does the Angel at the centre of man. The \"functional relationship\" is identical on both sides, and permits meditation to pass sp ontaneously fr om one to the other (cf. above, II, 1). Then the Black Stone turns back into the white Pearl, the signature of Paradise, the Angel or Imamate within man. It depends on man whether 73 Cf notes 47 and 58 above. 74 This is the sense in which the Imam Ja'far's hadith should be understood, as Qadi Sa'id has fully realized (fol. 183b ). In the last part the \"terms\" are repeated, precisely because the same drama happens over again. The hadith finishes with these words: \"Because of his love for Muhammad and his people (the Imams), God chose this Angel from among all the Angels and caused him to swallow ( alqama-hu) the pact (mithaq). And this Angel will come on the day of the Resurrection; he will have a tongue which speaks, eyes which look; he will witness to those who come to him in that place and who have kept the pact.\" Sharh, fol . 183.

The arrival at this centre is the esoteric meaning ofthe rites ofpilgrimage. These are performed in the same way as the rites of an initiation mystery, at the end of which the mystic enters the Temple, because he has repossessed himself of the potestas clavium that offers him access to the lost spiritual world. 3. The esoteric meaning of the visits to the Holy Places. At the start of this recital of initiation, we are once again in the situation that arose previously (II, 3), in the recital of the white Cloud.75 It is the whole of this recital, as reported in a tradition that also goes back to the Imam Ja'far, which now makes its appearance as a recital of initiation. The moment evoked here was (in the recital of the White Cloud) that in which the angel Gabriel had led Adam to the site ofthe Temple ofthe Ka'bah, and a white Cloud above them had cast its shadow on the ground. This Cloud was the image of the Glorious Temple \"in Heaven\", and the Angel had commanded Adam to trace with his foot a gr oove which outlined on the earth the exact area covered by the shadow; the future, earthly Ka'bah would coincide with its dimensions and would thus be the image ofthe celestial Temple. The intervention of the angel Gabriel at this point is particularly signifi­cant. For all our theosophers, the drama of Adam, his \"descent\" from Paradise, is the drama itselfofKnowledge. As we recalled a moment ago, Gabriel is the angel ofKnowledge. It is his illumination {ishraq) which, when we perceive sensible objects, brings forth in the soul the intelligible form ofthese objects which is the form ofknowledge: that which we know in reality, that which is grasped by our act ofknowing. His initiatory role with regard to the Adam who has understood the secret ofthe Black Stone becomes immediately comprehensible. He initiates Adam into the esoteric meaning of the visit to the holy places which surround the site of the Temple. This visit then becomes the inner pilgrimage, the pilgrimage of 75 Here begins the seventh chapter of Kitah asrar al-Hajj, fo l. 186-1 87b. We have been nnable to include in our text the contents of chapter 6, which nevertheless comprises several most interesting points. Noteworthy among these are the question of the meaning of pre-existence, and the question of the exclamation made by the pilgrims as they enter the sacred territory: Lahbayk! Lahbqyk! (I am here! I am here! offering myselffor Thee) . Where, and in what world, does this cry resonnd? In the sensible atmosphere or in the pure spiritual air? 242"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA 'BAH the heart just referred to: the pilgrimage of an entire lifetime, whose goal is the construction ofthe Temple's spiritual form. Shiite theosophical traditions, both of Ismaili theosophy and of Twelver Shiism, are agreed that the dram a of Adam is the dram a of Know ledge. 76 Qadi Sa'id Qummi gives us the broad outlines of this drama, and we know by what has already been said that it is continuously being performed (it attains its denouement only at the end ofthe pilgrimage). The violence done by Adam to the trust reposed in him, which he wishes to lay hold of for himself; the betrayal ofthe undertaking which the Shiite terms relates to the triple Attestation: this constitutes the drama ofKnowledge. For what Adam wished to lay hold offor himselfwas Knowledge that he, Adam, was not in a position to possess, because its object was as yet not manifest on the level on which it needed to be manifest in order for the knowledge of it to be actualized. For such knowledge to be actualized, its object would have had to be manifest on a level lower than that on which it was in fact manifest. For Ismaili gnosis, Adam's act ofviolence is a wish to attain to pure esotericism without the intermediary ofsymbolic figures. For Shiism in general, what was at issue was the knowledge reserved for the seraphic humanity of the Muhammadan Imams, the eschatological secrets that could be revealed only by the twelfth and last Imam. All other objects of knowledge, all the other trees in the Garden ofKnowledge, were accessible and permit ted to Adam, except for this one forbidden Tree. When an obj ect ofknowledge is actualized for the knowing subject, it becomes a part ofhim, as food becomes part of the subject who feeds on it (as in the example ofAbraham, whose intimate being is nourished by his divine love; see above, II, 4). By \"eating\" of the forbidden knowledge, Adam becomes in some sense heavy or pregnant with the subtle realities (lata'if) ofthis knowledge; and these realities demand to be manifested by Adam, to be brought to light, as they are known by him. But this cannot happen on the level of Paradise (the mundus imaginalis), because on this 76 On the drama of Adam as the drama of Knowledge according to Ismaili gnosis, see my Henneneutique spirituelle compares, op. cit., the whole of § 8. For Twelver Shiite gnosis, see En Islam iranien, op, cit., vol. IV, general index s.v. Adam-la faute d'Adam (sens esoterique de la) selon le shi'isme. A similar conception occurs in what amounts to an entire Western theosophical tradition (van Helmont, Sweden­borg, and others). Cf van Belmont's thesis of the In tellectus adamicus (that the drama of Adam, by fo rcing knowledge to \"descend\", shattered the integrity of the soul's organs which enabled it to perceive directly the spiritual and celestial equivalents of things). 243"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA' BAH level they are the forbidden Tree. It can only happen on the level ofthe world of sensible phenomena ('alam al-shahadah). But this eo ipso presup­poses the simultaneous descent of the knowing subject, so it is in fact inadequate to say that the descent from Paradise was Adam's punishment. One should say, rather, that by \"eating\" ofthe forbidden Tree, Adam eo ipso descended from Paradise, descended, that is, into the world of ill usion and deceit (dar al-ghurur). In other words, we could say that for Adam, for man, to \"eat\" of the forbidden Tree is to perpetuate the violence that consists in naturalizing the things ofthe spirit. It is to wish to make the spiritual world knowable in the manner and on the level of natural things, to wish to possess it by force as material objects are possessed. But because the attempt is doomed to failure, man becomes in return a prey to his deep-seated agnosticism. His desire for conquest is turned against himself in the form of his doubt: does this spiritual world exist? It is thus assuredly the fundamental drama of Knowledge, its permanent drama, which can be confronted only by the witness of sp iritual forms subsisting on the level and in the world proper to them. It is thus possible to see, with our authors, a profound meaning in the Imam's recital which, on the \"morrow\" of Adam's departure from Paradise, puts him into the safekeeping of Gabriel, the angel of Knowled ge. It is also why the angel Gabriel is at the centre of so many recitals of personal spiritual initiation in Islam, for he is designated, by Qadi Sa'id Qummi and his colleagues, as \"the help ofsouls, their instructor, he who bears God's messages to their destination, the guide who leads back to Paradise\". The initiation is an initiation into the esoteric sense of pilgrimage and its rites: an initiation into the \"first\" pilgrima ge completed by the \"first\" earthly human being. We have been made aware ofthe mystical signifi­cance of the journey from India to Arabia undertaken by Adam in the company ofthe Angel, up until the moment where they are both \"in the shadow of the white Cloud\". They will travel together to the holy places around Mecca visited today by pilgrims: from Mina to al-'Arafat, from al­'Arafat to al-Muzdalifah, from al-Muzdalifah to Mina, to return to the site where the Temple will henceforth stand.

But one can only arrive at the sources ofthe arche­types through their derivatives; to approach the \"divine Face\" is to walk round about the sanctuary, to seek refuge in its enclosure . As we know, sanctuaries of God exist in every universe, and in each case their constitution is homogeneous with the universe in question. In this way, each Temple is the image-im itation (the hikayah or \"history\")'7 ofthe Temple that exists on the level of the universe superior to it: the exoteric (zahir) is always as it were the fr ontispiece or title-page ('unw an) of the esoteric. In our world, constituted by the four Elements, the Temple ofGod that corresponds to earthly needs is the Ka'bah. To go there is the equivalent ofwhat, on the level of pure knowledge, is des cribed as the initial representation of a form (tasawwur); for as long as a thing has not taken form, as long as one does not represent it to oneself, it is not possible to orientate oneself in its direction. Symmetrically, on the level of mystical vis ion (shuhud) and spiritual realiz­ation (tahaqquq), this corresponds to the entry upon the Way, the under­taking of the \"j ourney leading from God to God\" (suluk mina'llah ila'lldh).78 This is the moment, we may recall, in which there comes down over Adam and his angelic compani on the mysterious white Cloud, defined by our author as \"the Cloud ofmercy, heavy with the beneficent rain which aids 77 On the implications ofthe Arabic word hiknyah, see the prologue to Hermeneutique spirituelle comparee, op. cit. 78 The idea of this \"j ourney\" corresponds to a traditional schema. Mulla Sadra Shirazi's great philosophical and theosophical encylopaedia is entitled \"The high theosophy (or higher philosophy) concerning the fwr spiritual journeys\". These are 1) The journey from the created world towards God. 2) The journey from God towards God through (or with) God. 3) The journey from God towards the created world through (or with) God. 4) The journey from the created world towards the created world, but through (or with) God. The mystical journey to which Qadi Sa'id Qummi here refers (see also note 88 below) would correspond to the second journey in Sadra Shirazi's terminology.

In this way, the form or configuration of the Temple of God in the world of the Intelligence is imprinted onto the terrestrial world. Moreover, Adam's action in tracing the outline ofthe earthly Temple in the exact image ofthe celestial Cloud, signifies that the form of the earthly Temple must homologically en close all that is enclosed by the celestial Temple. \"Nothing in the world oflight was left out, was not configured in the most beautiful of forms.\"80 It is already being suggested here that the form ofthe Temple, as the homologue ofthe spiritual Forms, is a centre which, as such, simultaneously envelops and contains all things. Following this, on the Angel's instructions Adam traces the limits ofthe sacred territory (haram) surrounding the Temple as centre; that is to say, explains Qadi Sa'id, the limits reached by the light of the red hyacinth whose colour has been explained as a conjunction of the divine with the creatural. In fact, it is through the intermediary ofthe knowledge within man that his universe receives its light. This knowledge is the Throne and the Light within him; and it is through man as the knowing subject that the universe is felt, imagined, and becomes intelligible. It is thus through man and for man that a sacred landscape is created, whose imaginal topography is marked by the hierophanic places. And as Adam's initial action in tracing the groove corresponds to the representational knowledge ('ilm tasawwuri) through which a form comes into being, ever since then the pilgrims, on arriving at the Temple, walk around it once before visiting the places of devotion that surround it. These are the places to which the angel Gabriel takes Adam, in order to initiate him into the esoteric meaning of the rite he is made to perform. i. The Angel first took Adam to Mina (a valley near Mecca), which is the chief place of devotion. Qadi Sa'id Qummi attributes this priority to 79 The text continues: \" ... and aids the growth, out ofthe Earth ofreceptivity, ofthe plant which is man, as this Koranic verse has it: God has caused you to grow out of the Earth like a plant\" (71: 17).

Hence we learn, as a first eloquent testimonial, that what the angel Gabriel shows Adam in this place is the site ofthe mosque ofMina, because, explains our author, \"in following the road that leads to God, the first thing to manifest itself in the heart-God's 'greatest Temple' (BaytAllahi'l-akbar, Domus DeiMaxima)-is ardent desire. After that come the methods of approach and their imple­mentation\". Here, then, is Adam, or more simply man, engaged, under the Angel's guidance, \"in the heart's pilgrimage\" towards the personal, spiritual Ka'bah. And the first stage, which determines the entire subse­quent pilgrimage, is ardent desire. 2. From Mina, Adam and the Angel go to al-'Arafa t, a mountain about twelve miles from Mecca, as today's pilgrims continue to do. To go to al­' Arafat, explains our author, is to have escaped from the place and level at which one was. It signifies entry upon the Way, completion of the first step in the process of uprooting oneself from the Earth of exile, in redeem­ing the distance implied by the transgression of the undertaking. The pilgrim arrives at al-'Arafat at the hour of sW1set. Adam stands at the head of the valley, while the Angel tells him : \"Now that the sun is on the point of setting, acknowledge your fault.\" This means, explains Qadi Sa'id Qummi: \"Now that the Sun oftruth (the spiritual Sun) is veiled from your eyes because of the betrayal you have perpetrated, your own hour is the hour of the evening twilight, for the darkness of your fault is around you and your sun is on the point of disappearing in the West. Acknowledge that you are estranged from your Friend only because you considered that you yourself were yourself (that you were sufficient to yourself in order to be yourself, bi-hisabi-ka anna-ka anta). \"There is an arresting contrast here. 81 The root mna has the meaning of to determine or to test. The fifth form , tamanna, means to wish or to desire.

Because he was spiritually exiled.from this world, the divine Light exiled him to himself: he was the mystical Occ ident in which this Light was occulted and dwelt invisible. Abraham, or the mystic whom he typifies, carries this Light within him. Adam, on the other hand, was exiled into this world, because he had loved himself. Thus the Abrahamic symbol is inverted: it is no longer the divine Light which is exiled into him; it is he, Adam, man, who is exiled.from this Light, and his \"occidental exile\" will last until the \"dawn\" (the hour of Ishraq), at the end of the night of vigil which marks the next stage of the pilgrimage to al-Muzdalifah. ' First the mystical pilgrim descends from al-'Arafat; that is to say, he lea ves behind him the viewpoint at which his own self was under the illusion that it was sufficient to itself in order to be itself. He passes by a group of seven mountains, typifying for him the seven or seventy thousand veils of light or spiritual stations that remain between man and his God after he has freed himselffrom the level ofthe carnal soul and nature. On each mountain, Adam, in obedience to the angel Gabriel's instructions, utters the takbir fo ur times (the formula, that is, of Allah akbar: God is supremely great), in order to abolish the fo ur limits that determine them,82 and so that the \"Face\" ofhis Lord may reveal itselfbeyond the veils ofhis occultation. 3. The pilgrim then arrives at al-Muzdalifah Geographically speaking, this is a hill situated between al-'Arafat and Mecca, at about an equal distance from Mina and al-'Arafat, where the pilgrims go on their return from al-'Arafat to spend the night (from the 9th. to the lOth. ofthe month of pilgrimage or Dhu'l-Hijjah ), setting out again next day at dawn for Mina. A Koranic verse (2:200) expressly prescribes that the pilgrims must here perform a rite of \"recollection\" of God {dhikr). This station of the pilgrimage has several names.83 The actual root of the name al-Muzdalifah (zlf, 'zdlj} means to advance or approach. If, therefore, it is also named Jam� meaning \"reunion\", the mystic at once understands it as an allusion 82 Here one should call to mind the properties of the tetrad in the Pythagorean arithmetic known to our authors, which are such that the number fo ur determines the structure of all fo rms of being: the four supports of the Throne, the four Elements, the four natural Qualities, the four ages ofhuman life.

Qadi Sa'id also explains the name Jam' by the liturgical fact that the pilgrims here \"reunite\" two canonical Prayers, the Prayer of the sunset (maghrib) and the Prayer of the coming ofnight ('asha') (the hours corresponding to the hours ofVespers and Compline in the Christian liturgy). It is thus self-evident that the \"approach\" must take place at the station of\"reunion\". In his treatise \"on the esoteric meanings ofPrayer\"84 our author has already explained that these two Prayers are prayers of \"vigil, in the period of waiting for the spiritual Sun to rise in the Orient of proximity and conjunction\" {mashriq al-qurb wa'l-wuslah). Adam, and in his person the mystical pilgrim, spends the night ofvigil at al-Muzdalifah in waiting for this dawn, the dawn of the \"Morning ofthe Presence\" (s ubh al-hudur), rising among the glories of the \"Face\" of the divine Reality (s ubuhat wajh al-haqiqah) over the Darkness of the world of Nature. At the hour ofthe coming dawn, the Angel instructs Adam to make a sevenfold confession of his fault, in order that all trace of the Darkness that held him prisoner may disappear; and he instructs him to ask God, in a sevenfold adjuration, to \"return to him\". Each ofthese seven acts removes one of the seven veils between man and the divine Face; or it marks the symbolic completion, one by one, of each of the seven millenia or periods of the prophetic cycle, which are the measure of the \"delay of eternity\" signified by the descent from Paradise. With each of these seven acts Adam, the mystical pilgrim, ascends to a level of proximity, mounts towards the theophanic vision which blazes forth in the morning splendour of the dawn, in the spiritual \"Orient\" or Ishraq, which has become, since Suhravardi's time, the name ofmystical theosophy that deeply pervades, even today, the thought and spirituality of Islamic Persia. The denouement of the pilgrimage, as meditated by Qadi Sa'id Qum­mi, concurs with the denouement to which the meditation of Ibn 'Arabi bears equal testimony: the meeting with the divine Alte r Ego, 85 the celestial pole in the absence of which the human ego, terrestrial pole of the hi-unity, would possess neither being nor truth. This is the very bi-polarity that 84 This is the Risalah fi asrar al-Salat, the first of five treatises which together make up the Kitah asraral-'ibadat, op . cit.

Because the Pearl is the Angel within man-the Angel whom God \"caused to swallow\" the personal undertaking towards Him, and who in each man is the guardian entrusted with the divine secret concerning that man-this \"Angel\" is also the Form necessarily assumed by God in reveal­ing himself to man (which is why the Pearl is both gnosis and the Soul itself). This is the Form contemplated by the Shiite mystic as the Imam. Henceforth Adam is worthy to enter into the Temple (istahaqqa dukhul Bayt Allah) and to be perpetuated with the perpetuit y of God (al-baqa' bi­baqd'i'lldh). The secret of the Black Stone, as we said earlier, is the key to the Temple87 4. Next, the angel Gabriel, the angel of saving Knowledge or ofgnosis, takes the road to Mecca again in the company of Adam. They pass by Mina once more, for Adam has now attained the goal of his desire. The rites performed there by Adam and by the pilgrims of today are of course rites in the spiritual sense. In the valley of Mina a peregrination is accomplished, in the course of which one makes a gesture of defiance at a figure representing lblis-Satan, at which one also throws stones (a cer­emony known as the jamrah). Here it signifies that \"the arrival at the sanctuary of the divine Sublimity\" is the last moment in which lblis-Satan can try once again to triumph over the pilgrim, by making him stop at the awareness of being carried away, annihilated (fa na') to himself and per­petuated with the divine perpetuity; for to contemplate oneselfthus is still to contemplate one's self, while attributing to it the predicate of its divine 86 Cf note 80 above.

This is why the salik, or mystical pilgrim, must annihilate even his an­nihilation, meaning that he must refuse so to consolidate himself in the awareness of a Unity that he no longer keeps company with his divine Companion in the mystery oftheir bi-unity. (Ifhe did not annihilate his annihilation, the mystic would need only to consent to the exclamation of al-Hallaj : I am God!) Thus the angel Gabriel, \"helpe r of souls\", ordered Adam to stone Iblis seven times, each time pronouncing a takbir (whose esoteric meaning, as we saw earlier, has reference to the seven veils between man and God). 5. \"Then Iblis departed ... \", says the recital of the Imam Ja'far. \"And the Angel took Adam to the Temple, where he ordered him to walk around it seven ti mes.\" Our commentator explains: \"This is the journey from God in the company of God towards created beings. \"89 These final words convey to us the esoteric meaning ofthe pilgrimage. Let us observe, to start with, that the angel Gabriel and Adam had made a first visit to the future site ofthe Temple which, as another tradition informs us, was built on Earth by the Angels. Then Gabriel and Adam departed to visit the holy places, whose esoteric meaning, stage by stage, has just been imparted to us. Now, on their return, they come before a Temple, around which Adam is asked to walk seven times. This is the Temple whose future area Adam had defined by tracing with his foot a groove in the earth, which exactly outlined the shadow cast by the white Cloud. Eve rything happens, therefore, as though the time needed for the completion of the spiritual pilgrimage, the heart's pilgrimage towards the personal Ka'bah, was a measure of the time-the \"subtle time\"-during which the Angels erect the form of the Temple (see above, III, 1). The \"form as a work of the spirit\" is here the Ka'bah or Temple of the heart, invisibly built by the Angels. 88 Cf note 78 above. 89 This mystical journey would correspond to the third journey in Sadra Shirazi's terminology: see note 78 above. For the sake ofbrevity we have not mentioned the three days called A yam al-tashriq (fol. 187b and p. 229 of the printed edition). Since the word tashriq means \"to turn towards the Orient\", Qadi Sa'id's hermeneutic finds a straightforward application.

These seven circumambulations can correspond to the seven organs or subtle centres ofthe inner man as the \"greatest Temple ofGod\", the inner man being clothed successively with the seven divine Attributes whose names are the \"Imams ofthe Names\".90 Likewise, explains Qadi Sa'id Qummi, to complete these seven circumambulations is successively to put on the \"seven veils\" which, as we were told earlier, mark the distance between God and created being. Several of the previous rituals were aimed at eliminating the veils interposed by Creation between the divine Face and created being. But now that the divine Face has appeared with the \"Morning ofthe Presence\", the pilgrim puts on these same veils. What does this mean? The reply to this question lies in calling the seven circumambulations \"a journey from God, in the company of God, towards created beings\". Everything happens, in fact, as though the arrival at the centre which is the Temple were the re-entry, or at any rate the potential re-entry, into Paradise, in such a way that creation is not simply returned to its origin, but everything begins again from the beginning. 1his re­creation is the \"journey towards created beings\", 91 but this time it is creation as it would have happened if Adam, man, instead of departing from Paradise, had remained from the beginning to make this journey \"in the company of God\". 1his is why the new creation necessarily escapes men's eyes in the visible world, for it is an event that takes place in the malakut; it is the creation of spiritual forms which in essence are visible only to the eyes of the heart. Thus the pilgrim, Adam, walking round the sacrosanct pole which is the Temple, embraces in his mystical procession the totality of intelligible and sensible circles. In so doing, explains Qadi Sa'id Qummi, it is as though he had at his disposal the higher and lower universes. As our author has persistently reminded us all along, this is precisely the virtue of the centre in spiritual circles (the Throne stabilized upon the Water): in them the 90 Cf my Creative Im agination ... , op . cit., p. 387 note 20. 91 Cf note 89 above.

No one enters the Temple save he who possesses the \"power of the keys\", and this \"power of the keys\" (potestas clavium) is none other than the \"ardent desire\" typified in the station at l'vlina, the station which marked the entry upon the Way. The Way is that which leads to the truth ofthe personal theophanic vision, in the form, that is, which corresponds to the level and to the norm of the being to whom it is revealed. This is the secret of the white Pearl, the heart and centre of the personal Ka'bah, restored to the radiance of its original form after having been the Black Stone embedded in the material Temple. This is why we said that the secret ofthe Black Stone is the secret ofthe Temple as the secret of man-the secret of the Temple which man builds in building his own invisible inner form, his \"body of light\" or, in the malakut, his \"Temple oflight\". It would thus appear that, under the guidance ofQadi Sa'id Qummi, we have extracted all the substance ofthe spiritual instruction contained in the hadith of the Imam Ja'far, and have understood what is meant by pilgrimage as \"the pilgrimage ofthe heart\", whereby man attains within himself to the plenitude of his spiritual form. iv.

To sum up very briefly what is intimated, we may say that the transformation of the material Temple of the Ka'bah into a spiritual and personal Temple of the Faith; the virtue of a secret being made explicit from stage to stage and leading to the personal theophanic vision as the entry itself into the mystical Temple; the fact that this secret is also the secret ofthe \"power ofthe keys\", the keys ofthe personal, spiritual Temple-where the pilgrim penetrates only after a long Quest, which is the reconquest ofhis Paradise (and it is no mere chance that so many of the works by our authors have similar titles, 253"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE KA'BAH beginning with a Persian book by Qadi Sa'id Qummi entitled Kalid-i Bihisht, the Key ofParadise): all this ultimately delineates a Way which, as we cannot but remark, converges with that which, in Western traditions centred on the Holy Grail, has been called the Way of\" the secret Church\", in the sense of the Church concealed in the \"secret shrine\" of the soul.92 In the work of our Shiite theosopher we have likewise encountered the idea of the secret Temple, to which all mystical pilgrims make a pilgrimage-all who together form the corpus mysticum of the walayah (Ismaili gnosis sp eaks of the \"Temple oflight\" of the Imamate), that is to sa y, all the \"Friends of God\" {Awliyd' Allah), all the prophets, all the Imams and all their \"frie­nds\". The uninterrupted succession of this mystical Assembly is still described as silsilat al-'iifan, the \"affiliation of gnosis\". To be sure, neither the \"Secret Church\" nor the silsilat al-'irfan denotes a constituted body or a form ofsocial institution, with offices and archives, registers and degrees. In one of its aspects, the Shiite concept of the walayah corresponds to the idea of the \"communion of saints\" in Christian­ity. Affiliation to this mystical body presupposes neither ritual nor in­itiation ceremony. It is in fact the \"candidate\" who commits himself, as people once committed themselves to the quest for the Grail, or the pilgrim Adam formulated and renewed his undertaking to the \"Angel\", the secret ofthe Black Stone that he carried with him. The reality ofthe heart's pilgrimage is realized invisibly, in the malakut. Its effects are realized in the formation of the jism mithali or imaginal body, and all these \"bodies of light\" together make up the invisible brotherhood. This brother­hood possesses a form, and even an organization and a structure, but all in the malakut: the members of the esoteric hierarchy spoken of in Shiite theosophy are known to God alone. It has been said of this invisible Church, the Ecclesia spiritualis, that \"the powers of Hell will not prevail against it\", and Qadi Sa'id Qummi, in a similar vein, reminds us of the words ofthe Imam al-Rida: \"Divine Religion will not perish so long as the Temple ofthe Ka'bah endures\"-words referring to the immaterial Temple offaith, whose guarantor and guardian is the twelfth Imam, the Hidden Imam. Guardian ofthis Temple, he is concealed from the eyes ofmen, as is the Holy Grail since its disappearance in the spiritual city of\" Sarras\", on the border, that is, between the malakut and our world.

In both cases, there is the same invitation to ponder on an occultation that bears upon the actual situation of our world. In the present context, what is in question is a world in which the awareness it is possible to have ofspiritual Forms subsisting in a spiritual universe, and preserved from the vicissitudes of our changing fashions, has been so ravaged, devastated, even annihilated, that there is scarcely any point even in wondering whether the Byzantine icon of St. George, mentioned at the beginning ofthis study, can still possess a meaning for it, or whether this meaning could be the troe meaning. For it is possible currently to re ad certain phrases alluding to \"the fires of the spirit which today illuminate only an empty Heaven\", or referring to the Paradise whose meaning Qadi Sa'id Qummi has just revealed to us as something \"in which the Church no longer believes, and of which she no longer dares to speak\". I quote from memory and without references, but only because these statements, gathered at random, also lacked them. And it is sympto­matic of our world that statements such as these should merely register the facts accepted by the common consciousness. How can one propose, to a world which has lost all sense of the malakut and for which the mundus imaginalis is no more than imaginary, that it should meditate on the configuration of the Temple under the guidance of Qadi Sa'id Qummi, seeing that for such a world there is no longer even a Temple upon which to meditate? This is the reason why, also at the beginning of this study, I spoke ofthe mutilation inflicted by a recent interpretation on the work of Balzac, because it was peculiarly symptomatic ofthe ravages which have annihilated in our consciousness all traces of a spiritual universe. For this reason, the theme ofthe \"power ofthe keys\"-the keys which would enable man to open up the way to himself once more-confronts us with ever-increasing urgency, as does the true meaning of what Qadi Sa'id has shown to be the esoteric meaning ofpilgrimage. This pilgrimage becomes identified with life itself once it is understood that the secret of the Temple and of the Temple's form is the secret of man: of the inner man, that is, or spiritual individuality, the goal of whose quest is the attainment of his Truth, of the theophany that corresponds with his being, when the dawn of the spiritual Sun rises over al-Muzdalifah.

Thus, where sociology envisages and analyses only the collective rite of a social religion, drawing crowds of pilgrims to Mecca each year, the Shiite mystic perceives the invisible reality of an altogether different pilgrimage. This is the return of Adam to his Paradise, by means of which he restores to the mala/ad all that he had forced to descend from it when he \"ate\" ofthe forbidden Tree, when, that is, he himselfdescended from the malakut What is implied here is both the re-establishment of knowledge of the spiritual world, and its re-establishment on the level proper to it. Yet instead of this, the \"descent\" is continually aggravated because all our science, all our system ofknowledge, is directed towards the unlimited exploitation ofthe Nature that \"descended\" from Paradise with man, and such an exploitation is accompanied by a radically agnostic attitude with regard to all that is signified by the malakut. The further man extends his dominion-the more his ambition seeks to deploy itself on the scale ofwhat it terms cosmos and cosmic-the more man is condemned to introduce into his own life so-called scientific rigour, with the result that the forces of collectivization and socialization exert themsel ves unopposed, and the human being is given no initiative to enter upon the quest for his spiritual individuality, for his Temple. Indeed, the very idea of such a quest is done away with, and with it all idea of a potestas clavium which would enable individual man to find a way out of the circle to whose constraint that which used to be called the soul has now succumbed. There has been no lack of warnings ov er the centuries; they form, indeed, a long Western tradition denouncing the dangers which threaten the spiritual individuality, a tradition represented by those who are known world-wide as the Spirituals of Protestantism. In the sixteenth century Maitre Valentin Weigel wrote an entire treatise on the question of potestas clavium, centred on the hermeneutic ofthe evangelical verses (Matt. 16:18-19). Weigel, too, affirmed that the inner man, the new creature, is himself the Tabernacle or Temple, and that every believer, by virtue of the faith in his heart, possesses the potestas clavium. This is because the key of the kingdom is the Holy Spirit, which is granted to all believers, and the key is eo ipso given to all those who possess the faith typified by the Apostle Peter. Thus the words addressed to Peter are addressed in his person to all who have such a faith, since every believer, through his faith, is Peter.93 93 Gf.

This is so because what the person ofPeter represents and typifies is the faith that proceeds from love, as the Truth proceeds from the Good. This is the rock, the petra (let us recall the secret ofthe Stone according to the Imam). The \"power ofthe keys\" is the power of faith, because it is the faith proceeding from ardent desire that opens the kingdom. This faith is designated by the Latin wordfervor, fervour.

Its lack of desire so effectively prevents it from choosing the way out which ardent desire for the kingdom {malakut) could alone open for it, that what it increasingly manifests seems to be less the \"nostalgia for Paradise\" explored by Mircea Eliade, as a scornful aversion to the whole idea of it. This aversion is expressed, among other things, in the \"agnostic reflex\", so deeply rooted in Western man that it has overcome even present-day theologians, and has largely contaminated Oriental man. If Qadi Sa'id Qummi and his Shiite colleagues saw the dram a of Adam as the dram a of Know ledge, is it not in fact the dram a that is acted out when the only goal envisaged by knowledge is power, and when the so-called \"human\" sciences are en­visaged as \"techniques of man\", regulating every detail of his life? In our time the Grand Inquisitor has been secularized; he no longer speaks like a theologian, in the name of a transcendent God and of a magisterium whose power extends to the beyond. He speaks like a soci­ologist and a technoc rat, in the name of collective norms, limiting all finality to this world. And by the same token, something has grown worse since the time of Weigel, of Swedenborg, of Dostoevsky even.

But today it is this very knowledge that lies in ruins. Once, one fought against the Grand Inquisitor with the superior weapon of personal faith. How can the man disarmed by agnosticism fight against a Grand Inquisitor who is both secularized and a sociologist? This is the tragedy of our times, and it makes what we read in the works of a Shiite theosopher such as Qadi Sa'id Qummi eminently pertinent. It is a tragedy so fundamental that the opposing forces are symbolized quite spontaneously in the consciousness ofthe most clear-sighted among us. In conclusion, I will call on the witness of one of those exceptional books which have scarcely appeared before they are forgotten, and which must then be given into your hands by a friend. I allude to the book by Hans Schmid-Guisan, the French translation ofwhich appeared shortly before the war with the title Comme lejour et la nuit 95 It cannot be summarized here; the main theme only can be indicated. From beginning to end, this book is permeated by a spirit possessing a rare power to configurate symbols. In it, the opposing forces ofwhich we are speaking are grouped and confront each other under their resp ective symbols: Collectivopolis and In dividua. There is an island, somewhere in an unnamed sea, divided into two halves by a mysterious high wall. On one side is Collectivopolis, whose strictly geometrical layout gives an impression of coldness and force. On the other side is Individua, looking not so much like a virgin forest as a huge abandoned park-something like a sacred wood. For a long time the island was governed by two kings, brothers who resembled each other so closely in physical appearance that their subjects believed they were serving under one and the same king. Then a terrible revolution made it manifestly impossible to maintain the condominium. Henceforth, one brother reigns over Collectivopolis, where the life of the individual has no other goal or raison d'etre than to serve the good of the collectivity. The 95 This is a posthumous publication: Hans Sclunid-Guisan, Comme le jour et Ia nuit, a translation ofTag undNacht, with a foreword by C.-G.Jung (Paris, Denoel, n.d.).

Henceforth, too, the great majority of the population leads a double life, divided between the two provinces of the island. At different points in the high wall are secret doors, heavily bolted, through which one passes from one province to the other: one finds them disguised behind a chapel altar, in a hospital room, even in the office of the sovereign of Collectivopolis. This is because there are very few people who can abstain from leading a double existence and can spend their life in one half of the island. But the most difficult thing to decide is the appropriate moment for passing from one half to the other. For he who lives as a free man in the town of Collectivopolis is a slave in Individua. Conversely, he who has gained his freedom in the country beyond the wall is reduced in Collectivopolis to a state of slavery. These are the broad outlines of something that cannot be summarized, and they speak sufficiently for themselves. Their inner meaning is no less clearly signified by the symbolic forms which delineate the topography of each half of the island, as well as the beings who inhabit them or who pass secretly from one to the other: pass from the world ofDay and the norms of consciousness to the world of Night, where these norms are abolished by the passionate pressure of the forebodings of the unconscious. For twelve days and twelve nights, the narrator takes us on a journey like that of Dante. We have not the time here to go with him on this twofold and fearful excursion, nor to explain the symbols inspired by his genius. I retain only the final scene, which is played out on the highest peak of Individua, whence one can survey all the symbolic landscapes at a glance. We are on the edge of the crater of a still-active volcano, whose full extent we are prevented from taking in by the swirling smoke that rises from the furnace. And yet the road of Individua goes up to it, goes through it and beyond. On the approaches to the crater one comes across people lying here and there in exhaustion, people who had not the strength to stand Collectivopolis, but who for all that have not succeeded in gaining total freedom in Individua. Here is an apparently resolute man who has got as far as the crater. In spite ofthe solemn command whose echo resounds through the rocky hollow, he throws himself into the furnace and is swallowed up. Is this, then, to be the sole ending reserved for the supreme effort of those who have arrived at the highest peak of Individua? Not so; but he alone will cross the abyss whose firm resolution is not the illusion of 259"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"THE CONFIGURATION OF THE TEJ\\IIPLE OF THE KA'BAH despair. And this is the ultimate lesson that the book has to teach us. Once again a man is advancing towards the furnace. His moving dialogue with the voice of the Invisible enjoining him to stop is evidence of supreme renouncement and of a supreme act of love. While the narrator, seized with giddiness, turns away his eyes, his guide tells him : \"Look!\" And indeed, \"the man is not swallowed up. His foot rests upon a miraculous bridge thrown over the furnace.\" Where is he going? The narrator may not follow him, for he is told: \"It is forbidden to anyone who-like you, and like the gentle reader-has only followed this road as a disinterested observer, to go any further along it. \" If only his guide would at least explain to him where this bridge leads, but he is merely told: \"To a place where there is no wall to divide our lives inexorably into two opposing halves ... where harmony, triumphing over struggle and conflict, makes the heart blossom with pure joy; where at last, surmounting the darkest clouds, merciful to just and unjust alike, shines an unchanging sun.\" The whole meaning of this poignant book appears to me to lie in this bridge which is finally thrown over the abyss; and it is not by chance that this bridge should awaken in our mind the image ofthe Chinvat Bridge, as it is configured in the eschatology of ancient Zoroastrian Persia. 96 For in the image of the bridge, which takes shape spontaneously in the conscious­ness ofthe author at the end ofthe vision ofthe twelfth night, I believe we can perceive the present meaning of all that we learned from the pilgrimage of our Shiite theosopher, up until the moment when the spiritual Sun dawned over al-Muzdalifah, and the pilgrim was worthy to approach the Temple. At this point, before the bridge flung miraculously over the abyss, we must once more ask ourselves the question: will the inner man give way before he has attained his victory? Will he prefer instead the multiple disguises of the agnosticism which leaves him finally weaponless in the presence of the Grand Inquisitor sitting in Collectivopolis? The \"country beyond the wall\", Individua, with all its topographical details (shade and rivers, oratories and secret temples, va lleys and high peaks, and so on) is one of the most perfect symbols of the unconscious to spring from the imaginative perception of a present-day author-a perception that itself enables him to discern the \"bridge leading to the beyond\".

An agnostic statement as peremptory as this one does not simply appear out of pro­portion to the metaphysical methods at its disposal. It also carries an infinitely serious responsibility, for it can cause the so-called liberating discovery to collapse under its own triumph. If man owes his personal potestas clavium to this discovery of the unconscious, a potestas clavium powerful enough to configurate the bridge over the abyss, how, at the same time and in the name ofthis same discovery, can one try to deprive him of this power, having just given it back to him? This is the deprivation brought about by the agnosticism which dares not pronounce its name, when it says that the keys do not open any door, or that the door opens onto nothing, or that the bridge leads nowhere ... Or, since the \"modern\" discovery disowns itself in this way, is it not likely that it reveals to man something for which he had already been long indebted to a different authority? This other authority lies, perhaps, in all that we have learned to call the malakut of this world, as a spiritual world at once invisible and concrete, both because it is peopled by substantial spiritual forms, and because it shows that the meaning ofthis life for man lies in being able to exercise a configurative action on his own malakut or \"body of light\". Our Shiite theosophers, such as Qadi Sa'id Qummi, see the supreme stage of per­sonal initiation or trans-consciousness (sirr) as being the revelation that every theophanic form corresponds to the being of him to whom it is revealed; but they never confuse this correlation with a causality devolving solely upon him to whom the form is revealed, any more than Swedenborg's notion of correspondence abolishes the existence \"in itself of the higher level when symbolizing with the lower. The confusion would be as absurd as the confusion of supra-existence in the malakut with a claim to attain immortality by preserving the status ofthe natural physical body (through a perfect equilibrium of secretion, elimination,etc.). It would be to confuse a precarious perpetuity with what is called eternity.

The Imago Templi at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\" A great J ewish writer of our time, Elie Wiesel, has chosen as the epigraph to one of the most poignant of his books, Le serment de Kolvillag, 1 the following quotation from the Talmud: \"Ifpeoples and nations had known the evil they were inflicting on themselves by destroying the Temple of Jerusalem, they would have wept more than the children oflsrael.\" I was still pondering the far-reaching implications of these lines when, in a recent work,2 I came across another epigraph, taken this time from the historian Ignaz von Dollinger: \"Ifi were asked to name the dies nefastus in the history ofthe world, the day that would come to my mind would be none other than October 13, 1307'' (the day when Philip the Fair ordered the mass arrest ofthe French Templars).

Nevertheless, over the centuries a triumphal Image occurs and recurs, opposing this despair with the tenacity of permanent defiance: the Image of the rebuilding of the Temple, the coming of the New Temple, which assumes the dimensions of a cosmic restoration. The two images, ofthe destruction and ofthe rebuilding ofthe Temple, are inseparable one from the other. They draw on the same source, and they configurate a vision of the world which in both its horizontal and vertical dimension is dominated by the Image of the Temple, Imago Templi, and which conjoins the destiny ofthe city-temple and the destiny of the community-temple in the body of the Knights Templar. I use the term Imago Templi in order to typify and stabilize a specific intention in a Latin form ne varietur, thus avoiding the vicissitudes of translation. I should therefore explain how this Imago Templi has in the end come to impose itself on me as a student of Islamic gnosis, not by leading me away from this gnosis, but on the contrary by allowing me to penetrate to the heart ofthat for which I am seeking. In explaining this, I will also be delineating the successive stages ofthe present study. Unlike modern philosophers of History, visionary theosophers always have someone-a personal messenger-who comes to give them instruc­tions and to be their guide. Where does he come from? In the famous recital ofHayy ibn Yaqzan, composed by Avicenna, the messenger-the Angel-on being asked by the visionary whence he comes, replies: \"I come from the TEMPLE\", or, to be precise, from Bayt al-Maqdis. This latter term, which is the literal Arabic equivalent ofthe Hebrew Beth ha­miqdash, means, to be sure, the \"sacrosanct house\"; but as we know, the symbol ofthe dwelling-place is commonly used to denote the temple.4 The Arabic term designates Jerusalem; but the answer given to Avicenna refers not to the Jerusalem of this world, but to the celestial Temple of which the earthly Jerusalem is the image. We hear the same answer given in Suhravardi's visionary recitals. 5 Often, indeed, for the sake of precision, 4 a H. Corbin,Avicenna and the VisionaryRecita� trans. W. R.

Our mystical theosophers have explained themselves with extreme clarity on this point, and in doing so show themsel ves to be in profound agreement with all visionaries of the \"New Temple\". What is in question is a world which conditions a fundamental spiritual experience, the secret of which initially escapes us Occidentals because for us this world has for some centuries been a lost continent. It is the world situated midway between the world of purely intelligible realities and the world of sense perception; the world that I have called the imaginal world ('alam al-mithal, mundus imaginalis) in order to avoid any confusion with what is commonly designated imaginary. 7 Let us be quite clear about this. Our visionary theosophers-Suhra­vardi's Ishraqiyun-are no less aware than we are of the perils of the imaginary. I will recall briefly the metaphysics ofthe Imagination in, say, Suhravardi. The Imagination possesses a twofold aspect and fulfils a twofold function.8 On the one hand there is the passive imagination, the imagination that \"re-presents\" or \"re-produces\" (kh ayal). As such the imagination is, quite simply, the storehouse that garners all the images perceived by the sensorium, this latter being the mirror in which all the perceptions ofthe external senses converge. On the other hand there is the active Imagination (m utakhayyilah). This active Imagination is caught between two fires. It can submit docilely to the injunctions of the estima­lory faculty (wahmiyah), in which case it is the rational animal that assesses things in a way related to that of animals.

Yet the active Imagination can, on the contrary, put itself exclusively at the service of the intellect-of, that is to say, the intellectus sanctus as this functions in both philosophers and prophets. In such a case, Imagination is called cogitative or meditative (mlffakkira; it should be noted that this is another name for the active Imagination, the productive Imagination). The whole task consists in purifying and liberating one's inner being so that the intelligible realities perceived on the imaginal level may be reflected in the mirror ofthe sensorium and be translated into visionary perception. We have, I think, already gone a considerable distance beyond the limits imposed by psychology. That we do in fact go beyond these limits is all the more important for us because the vision of the Angel, and thence of the Imago Templi, does not emerge from the negativity of an unconscious, but descends from a level of a positively differentiated supra-consciousness. This order ofimaginative perception is described by Haydar Amuli, the great Shiite interpreter of Ibn 'Arabi, as being that of \"intellective Images\", metaphysical Images {amthilah 'aqliyah). It is the key which can open up to us the metaphysic ofthe Imago Templi. Ibn 'Arabi greatly extended the metaphysic of the Imagination.9 He agrees perfectly with Suhravardi in affirming the reality, plenary in its own right, of the intermediate world of the barzakh, the world in-between. His name for it is the Koranic \"meeting-place of the two seas\" (majma' al-bahrayn).'0 He sees it as the place where the world of pure Ideas in their intelligible sub­stantiality meets with the world of the objects of sense perception. It is the world where everything that appeared inanimate in the world of sense perception comes alive, the world to which Moses came before meeting his initiator {Kh ezr, Khadir). In short, it is at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\" that the Imago Templi reveals itself to the visionary. 9 Cf H, Corbin, Creative Im agination in the Suf1S11! of Ibn Arabi, trans. R.

In speaking of the Imago Templi, I intend to remain at the level of a phenomenology, a \"temenology\" if I may risk the word (from the Greek temenos, a sacred precinct), which exists at the level of the imaginal world {'alam al-mithal), the world in-between {barzakh), at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\". I once had occasion, in relation to the Mazdean transfiguration of the Earth by the imaginal perception of the Light of Glory (the Xvarnah), to speak of an Imago Terrae as a mirror reflecting the imagoAnimae?ll Similarly, the case of the Imago Templi at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\" implies a situation which is above all speculative, in the etymological sense of the word: two mirrors (sp ecula) facing each other and reflecting, one within the other, the Image that they hold. The Image does not derive from empirical sources. It precedes and dominates such sources, and is thus the criterion by which they are verified and their meaning is put to the test. According to our philosophers' premisses of the metaphysics of the imaginal, the Imago Templi is the form assumed by a transcendent reality m order for this reality to be reflected in the soul at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\". Without such a form , this reality would be ungraspable. However, the Imago Templi is not allegorical but \"tautegorical\"; that is to say, it should not be understood as concealing the Other whose form it is. It is to be understood in its identity with that Other, and as being itself the thing which it expresses. It will thus be clear that we do not intend to take up the task of the psychologists, still less to subject the Imago Templi to the categories of positive historical criticism. At \"the meeting-place of the two seas\", one is outside the process of becoming, outside historical causality and the norms of chronology, of filiations whose justification depends on archives and legal documents. This is because at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\" we are in the eighth clime\", a \"clime\" whose events and recitals take place in the Malakut the world of the soul and of visionary awareness. In the Malakut the only documents are the testimonials ofthe soul.

The only history we are concerned with here-sacred history or hierohistory or hierology-does not come to pass in the continuous time of chronological causality which is the time of secular history. Each manifestation of the Imago constitutes a unity in itself, without requiring a \"transfer of power\". It is itself its own time. The successive times of these manifestations are, rather, part of the tempus discretum of angelology, a discontinuous time. For this reason the link to be discerned between them is amenable neither to historical criticism nor to historical causality. On each occasion, what occurs is a re-assumption by the soul, a decision, a reconquest. These unities of discontinuous time are the times of the Imago Templi: they irrupt into our own time and confer the dimension of eternity upon the scissions they produce. It is through this rupturing of time that the truth of all history can finally shine forth; for through it history is liberated and transmuted into parable. The following tradition is the most striking of all. When the Temple of Solomon was set on fire by Nabuchodonosor (Nebuchadnezzar), the priests, holding the keys ofthe Temple in their ha nds, went up onto un­roof of the sanctuary. From there they cried in the face of heaven: \"Lord of the world, since from now on we can no longer perform our office in this Temple, take back the keys into your hand\". And they threw the keys up into the sky. A hand appeared in the sky and took hold of the keys.12 I think that a significant correspondence to this may be seen in our own Grail cycle. The epic concerned with the geste of Galahad ends with a mystical scene in the spiritual palace of Sarras: a hand appears in Heaven and takes hold of the Holy Grail, which from that time onwards is invisible to this world, in the time of this world. Yet the Imago Templi survives. When man has fashioned his inner being in such a manner that the Imago Templi becomes manifest to him, he is eo ipso at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\"; it is here, and nowhere else, that the keys ofthe Temple can be restored to him in personY It was in this way that they were restored to Suhravar di who, in Islamicized Iran, wished to recall from its exile the theosophy of Light professed by the 12 Friedrich Weimeb, Die Rolle Esther (Zurich, Origo-Verlag, 1968), p. 19. 13 Cf my study 'The Configuration ofthe Temple ofthe Ka'bah as the Secret ofthe Spiritual Life according to the work of Qadi Sa'id Qummi (1 1 03/1691)', section IV: Potestas clavium, published ab ove. 268"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TEMPU IN CONFRONTATION sages of ancient Persia.

This is the Imago Templi as it was manifested to the visionary perception of the prophet Ezekiel, and on which the community of Essenes at Qumran was to model its entire theology ofthe Temple and the new Temple. Hence, although there are always vestiges of history hidden beneath the veil of what are called \"legends\", it is not by following these uncertain signs that we will rejoin the knights of the Temple referred to at the beginning of this study. But we will observe that the Imago Templi, fore­stalling all empirical perception, possesses in itself such power that it makes the fact, a parte ante and a parte post of the filiation of the knighthood ofthe Temple quite inescapable. In both dire ctions, the filiation is estab­lished through the conjunction of the initiatic idea with the idea of a spiritual knighthood. In both directions, this must be seen as the awaken­ing of the Imago Templi to the awareness of itself, and then it will be understood how the links of ancestry and descent which are claimed to exist are not such as can be traced in archival documents. A parte ante, the Imago Templi, as it acquires an awareness ofitselfthrough the Templar knighthood, claims to descend from the primitive Judaeo-Christian com­munity of Jerusalem, and through this from the community of the Essenes. A parte post it determines the resurgence of the Templar idea in the eighteenth century, as in the great work ofWillermoz, in the dramatic epic conceived by Zacharias Werner and, above all, in Swedenborg's revelation of the \\'ova Hierosolyma. These are all hierophanies of the Imago Templi which frustrate the explanations as well as the negations of positive historical criticism, because the Imago precedes and rules over all historicaljudge­ments.

II. The Imago Templi and the destruction of the Temple I. The world as the crypt of the Temple. We observed at the outset of this study how, in the visionary recitals of Avicenna and Suhravardi, the Angel encountered at \"the meeting-place ofthe two seas\" replies to the visionary's question \"Where do you come from ?\" by saying, \"I come from the Temple\"-that is to say, from the heavenly Jerusalem. This reply sets the tone for the entire visionary composition, enabling us to perceive its difference with regard to an Imago Templi which is the Imago of the cosmic temple. This latter is the Image of the world-temple well-known in the cosmic mysticism ofpre-Christian antiquity. For example, Manilius (first century A.D.), in the prologue to hisAstronomica, 15 prays in the temple of the world, \"for the world too is a sanctuary, and Manilius is its priest\". Likewise, at the time ofManilius, the image ofthe temple ofthe world was, not exactly a commonplace, but rather a ruling belief: the Imago templi mundi. For Dion Chrysostom, the wellsprings ofbeliefin God lead back to the spectacle of the cosmos. For Plutarch, \"the world is a most holy temple ... Man enters into it on the day of his birth and contemplates in it ... the sensible objects fashioned, says Plato, by the divine Intellect as copies of intelligible realities\" . Cleanthus compares \"cosmic religion to an initiation. The star­gods are mystical figures with sacred names\"- The world is \"a temple filled with a divine presence, a te mple in which one must behave with the holy reverence of an initiate\". But this motif, as A J. Festugiere observes, is already to be found in Aristotle, in a remark concerning the mysteries of 15 For the quotations gathered together here, we are indebted to A.J.

This visible world is no longer itself the temple; it is the crypt of the Temple, or cosmic crypt. The initiation conferred by the Angel consists in showing the initiate how to leave this crypt17 and reach the Temple to which the Angel belongs, and to which the initiate, by virtue ofhis origin, also belongs. Inside the crypt he is merely an exile. The meaning and function of the physical heavens of astronomy are to guide the initiate to the supra-sensible heavens of the spiritual world, to the heavens of the Temple (the Malakut that was revealed to Abraham; Koran 6:75). Suhravardi is emphatic on this point. There are several ways of regard­ing the heavens. One of these is common to men and beasts. Another is that of the men of science, the astronomers and astrologers, who see the heavens with the eyes ofthe heavens. Finally, there are those who see the heavens neither with their eyes of flesh nor with the eyes of the heavens, but with the eyes of inner vision.18 In them the organ ofthe inner vision is an Imago caeli that does not originate in empirical perceptions, but that precedes and governs all such perceptions. It determines the whole way of viewing the heavens, of seeing them, in fact, as the Imago Templi, which is to see them at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\". This is why the Imago Templi is not subj ect to the vicissitudes ofthe history ofpositive astronomy: it is not a chapter in the history of science. Like their world {Jabarut and Malakut), spiritual beings are always described as sacrosanct, as \"hieratics\" (qudsi, quddus, qiddis), because they form the Temple (Bayt al-Maqdis) in relation to this world which is itself 16 The fo llowing remark of Seneca's sums this up: \"There are mysteries into which one cannot be initiated in a single day. Eleusis has secrets that are shown ool.y to those who go back to it and see it for a second time.

They constitute a double hierarchy, originating in the three acts of contemplation of the First and highest of the hierarchic Intelligences-the Intel ligence that Suhravardi always calls by the name it has in Zoroastrian angelology, in which it is the First Archangel to proceed from Ormazd: Bahman (Avestan Vohu-Manah, Greek Eunoia) or Bahman-Light.19 From the three acts of contemplation of the First Emanant or first Intelligence, there proceed a second Intelligence, a heaven, and the Soul that moves this heaven. This same ternary rhythm is repeated from Intelligence to Intelligence down to the Ninth, and from heaven to heaven, from the Sphere -Limit-the Sphere of Spheres-to the hea ven of the Moon. When it reaches the Tenth, the process is as it were exhausted. The Tenth is what philosophers call the active Intelligence, whereas theologians and theosophers call it the Holy Spirit. Both are in agreement about this identification. This Intelligence-Holy Spirit is the archangel Gabriel of the Koran, the messenger of the inspired revelation of the prophets, who is also the Angel of the human race, the Angel from whom our souls emanate. The hierarchical Intelligences are so many hypostases, and are named the Cherubim (the Angeli intellectuales of the Latin translations). The Souls that move each heaven are the Animae or Angeli caelestes.20 An impulse of love prompts the Animae caelestes to resemble the Intelligences whence they proceed, and it is through this impulse that each of them implicates its heaven in its motion. For this reason, the relationship between the two hierarches is typified sometimes as the relationship between a love that dominates (qahr) and a love that obeys {mahabbah; from this point ofview Suhravardi calls the Angeli caelestes the \"celestial faithful oflo ve\"), some­times as the relationship of parent and child, and sometimes as that between teacher and pupil. It is this relationship, too, which organizes the hierarchic Intelligences in, so to say, a symbolic manner so that they fonn an Order of the celestial Temple. It should be noted that Suhravardi typifies it as an Order of futuwwah, or Sufi Order. Each higher Intel ligence is the master (pir) that initiates the Intelligence that follows it: it instructs it like a teacher his 19 On the theory of the procession of the Intelligences, see my Avicenna and the Visionary Recital, op. cit., chap.

This is why spiritual ascent to the God ofGods is not possible for man unless he first unites himselfwith the Angel from whom he emanates, his celestial parent and his guide. This is the meaning of all Suhravardi's romances of spiritual initiation. It is to go out of the Temple crypt in order to enter the Temple. This brief survey enables us to perceive how the same Imago Templi governs the relationship of each Intelligence to its \"Tern ple\" (maskin, its dwelling-place) or heaven, including the relationship of Gabriel, as the Angel ofhumanity, to the \"Temples ofLight\" which are human spiritual individualities. Each heav en or Temple of heaven is composed of three things: the cherubic Intelligence from which this heaven emanates, this heaven that is the scope of its nostalgia; the Soul that moves it with a view to assuaging this nostalgia; and, finally, the heaven itself, whose subtle matter is condensed into the star it bears. The astral liturgies composed by Suhravardi should be compared with the famous astral liturgies cel­ebrated in the temples of the Sabians. 23 The liturgy specifies the Intelli­gence that is the sovereign of each heaven; it in vokes its moving Soul and glorifies the beauty of the heaven in question.24 But the hymn is not addressed to the \"astral mass\". The liturgy is consummated in the Mala­kiil; the star is a \"person\" only because it possesses a Soul, a Soul of which it is not the image, and which itself pertains to the Malakut. Unlike human souls, this Soul does not possess sensible perception; but the Anima caelestis has over human souls the advantage of possessing the active Imagination 21 Suhravardi, 'Le Bruissement des Ailes de Gabriel', French translation in ibid.

The destmction of the Temple crypt As for our souls, they emanate from the Angel of the human race whose theurgy they are, as each heaven is the theurgy of the Intelligence from which it emanates. They are \"tern ples\", called by Suhravardi \"Temples ofLight\"- The Angel who is both the Holy Spirit and the Angel of humanity bears the same relationship to these \"Temples ofLight\" as does each Cherub to its soul and its heaven. The word haykal (temple) is often used to designate the external habitation, the material body of the building which contains the Light and whose de­struction sets this Light free. In effect, it designates the human microcosm itself as a sp iritual individuality, just as the Twelve Imams are called \"temples of the tawhid\"; that is to say, according to the esotericists, temples oftheomonism .24• At the heart of each temple ofLight conceived in this sense is a sanctuary that Suhravardi calls the khangah-a term again borrowed from Sufism and normally used to mean a lodge of Sufis. In Suhravardi's visionary recitals, the spiritual man withdraws into the kh angah: there, the meeting with the Angel takes place?5 This amounts to saying that the khangah-the sanctuary ofthe temple which is the micro­cosm-is situated at \"the meeting-place of the two seas \" It is here that the visionary is visited by the flashes of light in which the experience of Suhravardi's \"oriental theosophy\" culminates. When the presence of these lights is prolonged-when they become permanently present-the state attained is designated by Suhravardi as Sakinah. This word is pre­cisely the Arabic equivalent of the Hebrew Shekhinah: the mysterious divine presence in the Holy of Holies in the Temple of Solomon. 26Thus, the Arabic equivalent to the term Shekhinah is used by Suhravardi to signify this Presence in the Temple of Light, in the kh angah, the sanctuary ofthe human microcosm. 24a We should note that the idea of the spiritual individuality ofman as the temple was a theme already familiar to the Stoics and to Philo.

Herein lies the difference from the sense of the world experienced as a temple in the religion of pre-Ch ristian antiquity. The sages of antiquity prayed in a temple that was intact; the prayer of Suhravardi's sage rises from the depths of the temple crypt, because he has been exiled from the Temple. We are situated between two catas­trophe s: one is the premise of salvation, the other is perhaps irremediable. The first is the descent into exile; this is something we will return to, because it determines the persistence of the Imago Templi. The second is in some sense the sending of the exile himself into exile : this occurs at the moment in which the world ceases to be experienced as the Temple crypt. This is not simply the destruction of the Temple, but the destruction of the Temple crypt: the crypt in which the exiles awaited their return to the Temple. Some have spoken of an astronomical revolution, but the phrase does not exactly cover what is at issue here. The issue here is the cessation of a hierophany, the hierophany of the Imago Templi; a cessation that involves the ruin ofthe Imago caeli, which above all determined the superior mode of contemplating the heavens of which Suhravardi spoke to us a little while ago. The split between angelology and astronomy is not just an episode in the history of science; it signifies the destruction of the Temple from which the Angel-messenger declared that he came. It is true that this destruction is only effective for those who believed or believe themselves to be bringing it about, for in fact the perception of the supra-sensible celestial Temple, and the angelology governing this perception, do not depend on the history of astronomy. For, as I said above, the Imago caeli does not derive from empirical perceptions: it precedes and directs such perceptions. To destroy the Imago caeli is to change the very mode of perception and create thereby a hiatus, a breach which misleads the historian. The world has ceased to be the crypt of the Temple. The destruction ofthe Temple begins with the dispeopling ofthe crypt. Once the crypt has been dispeopled of the presences that inhabited it, the Temple itself is open to attack. But the final process must be traced back in its distant origins. We were speaking earlier, with reference to the Imago Templi, of two mirrors which face each other and reflect within each other the same Image. It is one of these mirrors, the Imago caeli, that has been destroyed: 275"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"'IHE IMA GO TEMPLI IN CONFRONTATION nothing less than this, certainly, but also nothing more. But this destruc­tion ofthe Imago caeli-ofthe Temple crypt-was made possible only by the shattering ofthe symmetry exhibited, first, by the triadic structure of the celestial temples (Intelligence, Soul, and subtle body of the Sphere), and, second, by the triadic structure of gnostic anthropology: spirit, soul and body. This anthropological triad was gradually eclipsed in Western Christian thought. What remained was the dualism of soul and body, or of spirit and body, ofthought and extension-a dualism for which Descartes could not then be held responsible. This anthropological destruction has a striking parallel in the destruction wrought in the sphere of celestial physics by Averroes in his desire to be a strict Aristotelian. The conse­quence of this was in effect the disappearance of the second angelic hierarchy, the hierarchy of the Angeli caelesles or Animae caelestes as affirmed by Avicenna and Suhravardi. Since the world of the Animae caelestes mark­ed the threshold of the Imaginal world, the sove reignty of the active Imagination or Imaginatio vera was as a result entirely overthrown, and with it that whole world of the Soul, the world in-between, medial between the J abarnt and the Mulk. From that moment on, the way lay open to a vision ofthe world which, being no longer a vision governed by the Imago Templi, was to end by no longer perceiving in the cosmos anything apart from immanent and purely mechanical laws. Without the world ofthe Soul there is no Imago. Thus man had lost his own soul as the heavens had lost theirs: there was no longer an active Imagination to secrete and reflect in the sensorium the metaphysical Images of intelligible realities, revealed to it on its own level. What remains is an imagination whose products are now declared to be merely imaginary, the fantastic productions of the phantasia -in short, unreal. Never again will it raise man to \"the meeting-place of the two seas\". The ordeal of exile no longer exists; instead, there is a deliberate refusal to feel exiled, a rejection of the idea of the world as the crypt of the Temple-a rejection that heralds the devastation of the Imago Templi. Such a devastation is a sine qua non for the ascendancy of the norm that induces the desacralization of the world, its \"disenchantment\" in the etymological sense of the word. {D ie Entzauberung der Welt was the title of a book which appeared between the two world wars.)

We must rediscover the meaning of the crypt. When the Imago Templi is destroyed, one is no longer even aware ofbeing in the depths of a crypt. The world is \"disorientated\" : there is no longer an \"Orient\". One thinks one is out in the open, that there is neither an above nor a below. By contrast, for all our mystical theosophers the world has an \"Orient\" and is \"orientated\"; there is an above and a below, not necessarily in the sense of geometrical distance, but ineluctably in the sense of a metaphysical dis­tance. This is so because entry into this world is perceived essentially as an entry into the world of exile, as a \"descent\" from the Orient of the Temple to the Occident of the world as the crypt of the Temple27 The Imago Templi is then there so that the visionary, withdrawing into his khangah-the sanctuary of his microcosm-m ay recollect his origin. Un­like the sage of antiquity, he experiences his entry into this world as a rupture. It is exile far from the Temple. The Angel's whole message is to remind him that an exile does not delay when his family calls him back, that he must return in haste. This is the whole theme of Suhravardi's recital of the \"occidental exile\", as well as of several other recitals. 3. Entry into the world of exile. There is fundamental agreement between Suhravardi's hermeneutic of exile and that emphasized by a contempor­ary Cabbalistic master, Friedrich Weinreb, in his many books. I do not say that this agreement is surprising-far from it: it is to be expected and is therefore all the more significant. Destruction of the Temple means entry into the world of exile. In short, both for the master of Ishraq and for the Cabbalistic master, the destruction ofthe Temple is the actual occasion of our birth into this world which is the world of exile, but also the world through which we have to pass if we are to reach the new Temple. The 27 This is the whole theme of pre-existence that we find in Suhravardi. In his exoteric treatises, the skaykh al-ishraq adopts a position opposed to this idea. In all his esoteric treatises, on the other hand, which take the form of symbols and parables, the idea of pre-existence is implied. See for example 'L'Epitre des hautes tours', where it is said towards the beginning that \"return implies the anteriority of presence. We do not say to someone who has never been to Egypt: 'Return to Egypt\"' (L'Archange empourpre, op. cit.).

There is a striking recital dealing with the descent of the Neshamah29 (man's celestial soul, one of the soul s that dwells with God, the idea ofwhich is extremely cl ose to the Zoroastrian idea ofthe Fravarti/Foruhar). This soul is asked to animate a human being whose embryo is in the process ofgrowing . The soul is aware ofall it will have to give up in order to \"descend\" to earth, but only through its descent will the human being be marked with the di vine seal and bear withi n him the Im ago Dei. For this reason, the soul too traverses the same road as God until the return fr om exile. The Shekhinah in exile is \"the totality ofall the suffe ring ofall time and ofthe suffering ofall creatures in all the worlds\". As long as Creation endures there will be exile, up till the time when the last Neshamah has descended into this world. The Angel who accompanies the Ne shamah during its descent reveals to it that it will fi nd hi m again at the end ofits passing through the world ofexile, that he wi ll be there to take it back \"home\". He tells it that all it learned of the meaning of Creation in its existence \"before this world\" will be plunged into oblivion, like a temple destroyed. Its garment oflight will become a garment conditi oned by the form oftime. Yet in its exile the Neshamah will be in unison with the exile ofthe Sh ekhinah. Imitating the gesture ofthe priests on the roofofthe Temple of Sol omon when it was being devoured by flames, the Angel throws the keys ofthe Temple back into the heavens . To know these things is eo ip so to avoid confusing the apparent hi story of humanity with the history conveye d to us in the di vine Logos, the Word of the prophets; for the latter hi story is played out on another pl ane and cannot be measured with the yardstick of our world and our life.

To understand it, as we said at the beginning, is to reach \"the meeting-place ofthe two seas\". Who will reach it? The reply to this question is given in an equally striking hermeneutic relating to the saving of Moses from the waters; for one ofthe symbolic properties ofWater is to typify the sense oftime and of engulfment in time. Pharoah's aim is to make all male children who sink into time succumb to the indifferent uniformity of all that is encased in time, and to prevent them from rising to the height ofthe worlds revealed by the divine Word. They are to drown in the waters of secular, one­dimensional history. The little \"ark\" in which, according to esoteric tradition, his \"celestial parents\" saved Moses, was in fact the divine Word, and Moses was preserved from the flux of historical time. What Pharoah wanted, on the other hand, was that only \"normal man\" should survive-the man who conforms absolutely to the norm of a world which, above all, does not wish to know that it is in exile31 The analyses of the sacred, for which we are indebted to the sociological philosophies or philosophical sociologies from the nineteenth century to the present day, strike us as being in perfect conformity with the intentions and dispensation of Pharoah. Even when they agree in thinking and saying that \"history is nothing other than the profanation of the sacred land that] it is therefore the decadence and decomposition of a previously given reality\",32 it is no less the case that the content they attribute to the notion of the sacred is of an alarming poverty, because it is reduced to purely formal aspects. This is because these analyses have themselves taken on the form of the world of exile to such an extent that they can no longer even be aware or perceive that it is a world of exile. And yet the majority of our contemporaries live according to ideologies spawned by these analyses. At this point there is a preliminary question to be asked. If History is nothing other than the profanation of the sacred, in the sense that the profane, which used to be mute, has now itself taken possession of the Word, how is it possible to speak ofthe sacred using a Word which is itself desacralized, a Word which, in its very nature, profanes and is 29 Ibid., pp. 35-36. 31 Cf.

In practice and in truth, only Moses can speak ofthe sacred-every Moses who is \"saved from the waters of History\". Sociologists and philosophers of History, on the other hand, are the docile followers of Pharoah. They are men as Pharoah wishes them to be-they conform to his norm. They are unaware that their dialectic can relegate \"the past to the past\" only in the temporal world ofthe \"waters of History\". Whoever does not free himselffrom the norm which recognizes only the historical, which acknowledges as true only that which is in time and in the documents ofHistory, will never understand, for example, that what sacred history (hierohistory) recounts in the Revelation on Mount Sinai is not an event which only took place in, let us say, the year 2449 after the Creation. The Revelation on Sinai dwells intemporally within man, within every Moses who has been saved from the waters. The foundation lives within us, it is that whereby we exist in truth and in reality. For this reason it is no less true to say that the Revelation on Sinai exists also before the beginning of the world34 4 The norm of those exiledfrom the Temple. We have now been given the key to the recurrences of the Imago Templi. There is no need to evince these recurrences in terms of a material, historical filiation, or to explain them in terms of an external historical causality. It must be repeated that the norm of these recurrences is not written down in legal documents; it is an inner norm, written in the hearts ofthose who are exiled from the Temple. Likewise, the goal towards which we are guided by Suhravardi's \"Recital of the Occidental Exile\" is a mystical and eternal Sinai, a Sinai which 33 Mircea Eliade, in Fragments d'unjoumal (Paris, 1973), p. 310, initiates an entire inquiry into the question raised here. We ourselves would express the contrast in the following terms. Profane history sees mankind as mankind has created itself; History is the creation that man regards as his own, and of which he is the result. Sacred history or hierohistory reascends to events that are prior to the world, prior to the destruction ofthe Temple, because it is by this Temple that I was created, and its Im ago exists within me . This is the key to my hermeneutics, the sacred norm which determines the ascent from world to world. 34 F.

Above the Sinai of the Angel of humanity, other Sinais rise in tiers-temples of the hierarchical Intelligences that antecede him, up to the \"God of Gods\". At the summit ofthe first Sinai, the Shaykh al-ishraq situates the Great Rock which some Shiite traditions also describe as the \"Green Emerald\". This Rock is the oratory, the temple of humanity or the Tenth hierarchical Intelligence. 35 This great \"rock\" is designated by the Arabic term sakhrah and it is so essentially allied to the Imago Templi and to the tradition of the Temple that, as we shall see, it is at the origin ofthe denomination ofthe Knights of the Order of the Temple. It has given its name to the building constructed on the site of the Temple and which is still called, even today, Qubbat al­Sakhrah, the \"Dome ofthe Rock\". Thus the Imago Templi, in Suhravardi also, is rooted in the deepest traditions concerning the Temple. Very ancient Jewish traditions tell us that this holy rock was the initial point­the starting-point-of Creation, the original Centre around which the earth developed concentrically. Jacob rested his head on it while he slept and dreamed of the ladder linking Heaven and Earth, which the Angels ascended and descended (Gen. 28). It corresponds to the position of the Holy ofHolies in the ancient Temple. This is why the place marked by the rock is seen as the entrance to the higher world or, rather, as already part of it. It is through the holy rock as the foundation stone that Heaven and Earth exist and communicate with each other. It was consequently already at Bethel before Jacob found it there36 The idea of such a communication between Heaven and Earth thus determines the current notion according to which the earthly sanctuary is situated at the nadir of the celestial Temple, which is at the zenith This notion is illustrated by Jacob's vision ofthe ladder, and is to be found in all the hierophanies ofthe Temple.

The cubic temple of stone is then transfigured into a spiritual temple, the centre of the earthly world, the terrestrial homologue of all the temples of the celestial universes. 38 We referred above to the concept ofthe \"Temples ofLight\" in Suhra-. vardi, which make the microcosm-m an's sp iritual individuality-a temple ofLight. The concept expands to take in an entire community. A Koranic verse (7:159) says: \"Among the people of Moses there is a community which is guided by the Truth and which thereby practises justice\". By means of this personal ta'wiL Suhravardi transposes the idea of this community ofthe elect to the ancient Persian people, the people of sages whose doctrines he revived in Islamic Iran, as he expressly puts it, without having had a predecessor in carrying out a project such as this.39 The Imago of the spiritual Temple-of the community-temple-enables Suhravardi to link the Khusmvaniyun of ancient Iran with his own disciples, the Ishraqiyun, in Islamic Iran. In Ismaili gnosis we also encounter the idea ofthe \"Temple of Light\" ofthe Imamate, constituted by all the forms of light present in the initiates, the high dome or \"Sublime Temple ofLight\" being formed by the Imams themselves.40 As the community-temple the spiritual Temple has its own architecture. We shall come across the equivalent in the Imago Templi ofthe Essene Community ofQumran. In this way the Imago Templi oflslamic Iranian gnosis, with Suhravardi as its great mediator, leads us back to the primordial hierophany ofthe 37 Ibid. 38 See my article on the spiritual interpretation of the temple of the Ka'bah in Qadi Sa'id Qummi, published above.

The Sakinah­Arabic equivalent of the Hebrew Shekhinah, and signifying the steady illumination dwelling permanently in the \"Temples of Light\"-is identified by Suhravardi with the Xvamah, the Light of Glory in Mazdean religion. This Light of Glory passes from the heroes ofthe heroic epic to the heroes ofthe mystical epic, to the community which, among the ancient Persians, was the homologue ofthe community ofthe elect among Moses' people. The great rock of the Temple of the Angel, to which the pilgrim of the \"Occidental Exile\" ascends, has the very name ofthe rock which was the foundation-stone of the Temple of Solomon. I remarked above how for one of Suhravardi's followers, the fifteenth-century Jalal Davani, Perse­polis became one ofthe main spiritual centres oflran, and Persia became a Solomonic kingdom.41 At the same time, in the north-west, in Azerbaijan, the temple of Shiz, the great sanctuary of Fire where the sovereigns of Sassanid Persia were consecrated, became the Throne or Temple of Solomon (I'akht-i Sulayman). Even in the absence of written documents, the Imago Templi supplies us with persuasive testimonials about itself. One essential factor stands out over and above everything else. We spoke earlier of the hermeneutic which adds depth to the notion that the destruction of the Temple is the occasion of our birth into this world of exile, since the exile follows on the destruction of the Temple. All the catastrophes, then-the destruction of the Temple of Solomon in 586 B.C., the destruction in 70 A.D. of the second Temple, which had been rebuilt by Zerubbabel, and the destruction ofthe Temple of Shiz-are only so many episodes in the history ofthe exile. To be sure, the norm ofthose who arc in exile remains centred on the rebuilding of the Temple, because their norm is to fight against the desacralization ofthe world. But this rebuilding will be definitive and imperishable only ifit is the building ofthe Temple to come, beyond the time ofthis world. The destruction ofthe Temple is the original catastr ophe. Its rebuilding can only be a cosmic restoration. This is the significance ofthe vision and theology ofthe Temple in the prophet Ezekiel-a vision that provided the archetype on which was modelled the ethos of the Qumran Community. Ezekiel's vision is the reply to the knights of the Temple, to their cry of despair in a lonely am phi theatre of the Pyrenees. 41 a A S.

This is further confirmed by the fact that it was the book on which the Essene Community of Qumran modelled its own conception ofthe Temple, in relation to which its ethos was determined in the face of secular norms and ofthe catastrophe ofa profaned Temple. Our first task must therefore be to compare the theology ofthe Temple in Ezekiel with that professed by the Essence ofQumran. In this we will be guided by the remarkable piece of research undertaken by a Japanese theologian, Shozo Fujita.42 Although this work is unfortunately unedited, it is truly a model ofTemple phenomenology. For Ezekiel, as for the Community ofQumran, the vision ofthe Temple unfolds into a drama whose starting-point is the ruin of the Temple and the reasons for it, and whose culmination is a vision of the New Tern ple, the building of which is the prelude to the apotheosis of a cosmic restoration. Here is disclosed the perspective of an eschatology which is already realized in and through the celestial liturgy, a liturgy in which the mem­bers ofthe Qumran Community participate. The theology ofthe Temple in Ezekiel comprises four major phases: 1.. The ruin of the Temple deserted by the Shekhinah and by the Glory of Yahveh; 2. The spiritual Temple of the exile: God himself is now the Temple; 3. The return ofthe Glory and ofthe Shekhinah: the restoration of the Temple; 4. The vision ofthe New Temple on the high mountain as the visionary perception of a cosmic restoration. 1. The ruin of the Temple deserted by the Shekhinah. The sin of Israel, which led to the destruction ofthe Temple built ofold by Solomon, was its apostasy to other gods. Thus it was essentially a sin against the Temple, and the Temple was the place ofthis apostasy: \" ... . and behold northward at the 42 Shozo Fujita, The Temple Theology of the Qumran Sect and the Book of Ezekiel: their relationship to Jewish Literature of the last two centuries B.

As this thesis has llllfortunately remained unpublished, we are glad ofthe present opportunity to make its content and its outstanding quality known.-Ezekiel, we may remember, was among the first group of exiles deported to Babylon. Thus, exile creates the backgrolllld to his vision ofthe destruction and the final restoration of the Temple, a vision which confers a unique character on Ezekelian Temple theology. 284"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"'IHE IMA GO TEMPLI IN CONFRONTATION gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry ... Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary?\" (Ezek. 8:5----6). This is why the condemnation oflsrael is symbolically described as the departure of the Glory of the Lord (Kevodh Yahveh) from the Temple, 43 and why Ezekiel has the vision of the Glory leaving Jerusalem. This Presence of Glory signified the personal presence of Yahveh, and that was why the Temple constituted an area which was completely consecrated, separated, closed in upon itself: nothing profane ofany description was to be associated with it. This ideal Imago Templi is the basis of Ezekiel's theology of the Temple. Its profanation cannot but induce the divine Presence-the Shekhinah-to depart from it; and this desertion is the real catastrophe in the destruction of the Tern ple, because the Shekhinah, the mysterious divine Presence, is what makes the Temple the \"representative\" of the kingdom of God on earth. Its departure is thus what brings about the destruction of the Temple: \"I no longer have a dwelling upon earth\". This destruction implied, together with the exile of the Shekhinah, the suspension or cessation of the activity relating to the realization of the Kingdom (the cessation of the activity of the divine Right Hand), 44 for the Temple, as the ideal centre ofthe world, was the centre from which God ruled over the world, the centre ofthe cosmic theocracy. Furthermore, just as the divine condemnation began with the Temple, so the work of divine restoration had to begin with the Temple. The vision of the New Temple fills the last chapters (40-48) ofthe Book ofEzekieL \"Thou son of man, shew the house to the house oflsrael, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern\" (Ezek. 43: 1 0). In the course of these long visionary chapters Ezekiel's Imago Templi is defined: the image of a supernatural Temple beyond our time 43 For what fo llows, cf ibid., pp. 19---26. 44 Cf H. Odeberg, 3 Enoch or the Hebrew Book of Enoch (Cambridge, 1928), chap. XL VII 1, p. 154, note l. The real catastrophe in the destruction of the Temple was the departure of the Shekhinah and its absentation from the earth, because its presence in the Temple had made it the \"repres entation\" ofthe kingdom ofGod on earth. God withdraws his Shekhinah from the Temple and this is why the Temple is destroyed. \"God no longer possesses any dwelling-place on the earth\". We spoke above ofthe comparison to be made in the work of Suhravardi between the Arabic Sakinah, the Hebrew Shekhinah, the Persian Khurrah (Avestan Xvamah, Light of Glory), and the Hebrew kavodh.

It is not to be confused, therefore, with the second Temple, built by Zerubbabel in 515 B.C. 2. God himself as the Temple. The promise of the new Temple arises out of the very abyss of its destruction; for, if that destruction were definitive, it would no longer give rise to anything but what goes today by the name of \"the theology of the death of God\". The theology of the Temple can never accept such a death. The promise ofthe New Temple comes not from a theology of the death of God, but from a theology of exile; and this inspires a motif in Ezekiel which anticipates the most elevated intuitions of spiri­tuality. In this theology of exile it is God himself who becomes the temple ofhis faithful; for there were some who sighed and groaned because ofthe profanation of the Temple (Ezek. 9:8). These are \"the remnant oflsrael\", the last righteous men. The Angel-scribe was ordered to \"set a mark upon [their] foreheads\" (Ezek. 9:4), as a guarantee of immunity and protection. To all the others the Eternal can say, \"I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency ofyour strength, the desire ofyour eyes\" (Ezek. 24:21), for the love of such as these for their temple is no more than superstition. But the divine Presence which has deserted the Temple will remain in the country of exile among the exiles. \"Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house oflsrael wholly, are they .. \"- Although I have cast them far off among-the heaven, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come\" (Ezek. 11:14--16). So there is a promise of a divine Presence in the countries of exile.45 Those who are exiled, who have re ceived the mark of the Angel on their foreheads, are the true heirs oflsrael. God is identified with the Temple. The Temple on the earth of exile is only temporary. God is not, of course, identified with the physical building; rather, it is the idea ofthe spiritual Temple which is heralded by the prophet Ezekiel and which will be realized in the Community of Qumran. The spiritual Temple is the establishment of a spiritual and personal bond between Yahveh and his people: \"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God\" (Ezek. 11 :20). This spiritual proximity is in no way hindered by spatial distance 45 For what follows, see Shozo Fujita, op. cit., pp. 34-43. 286"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TEMPll IN CONFRONTATION or by dispersion into the countries of exile, for it signifies the habitation of the Torah in the heart through the heart's renewal: \" ... make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, 0 house oflsrael? For I have no pleasure in the death ofhim that dieth, saith the Lord God: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye\" (Ezek. 18:31-32). Even more than the Torah, it is God himselfwho dwells in the heart: \" ... yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary\". God himself is the spiritual Temple that dwells with the exiles.46 There is a conjunction between the renewal ofthe human heart and the establishment ofthe new Temple that, as a spiritual Temple, presages and heralds the spiritual worship that a spiritual Israel will offer up to God \"upon a very high mountain\" (Ezek. 40:2). This is the perfect Imago Templi: the spiritual Temple as the place where spiritual worship is celebrated. The Glory ofYahveh has departed from Jerusalem and dwells among the exiles, in Babylon or other places. Yahveh has become the spiritualized Temple, but he has nonetheless promised that when he returns to the new Temple where he will dwell forever, he will restore the Glory to it. This is a new phase in the templar theology ofEzekiel. 3. The return of the Shekhinah. As we have already observed, the destruction began with the Temple and with the departure from it ofthe Shekhinah or Glory. Similarly, the restoration begins with the Temple and is the return ofthe Glory ofthe Lord to the new Temple.47 \"And the glory ofthe Lord came into the house by the way ofthe gate whose prospect is towards the cast\" (Ezek. 43:4). As the Glory, carried by the Cherubim, had withdrawn }:::y the Temple's eastern gate (Ezek. 10:18-19; 11\"23), so on its return it enters the Temple by way ofthe eastern gate. Now\" ... behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from 46. This verse fu:m Ezekiel (11:1§1 allows us to be_sp:cifi.c about what we should understand by \"spiritualization' of the Temple. We will return to this later (see below, note 121). Here, Shozo Fujita (p. 41, note 1) tells us: \"An object can be said to be spiritualized when it is interpreted in accordance with S<XIIe predominant theo­l�cal or religious concept.

This water and this East are essential components ofthe Imago Templi Novi, for it is the water that fertilizes the wilderness and enables the fishes to live. We also encounter the fountain of the Water of Life at the foot of the mystical Sinai, the temple of the Angel of humanity in Suhravardi's \"Recital ofthe Occidental Exile\".48 The restoration ofthe world, and the return from the state of ruin to the state of Paradise, depend on this living Water. It should be noted that this power of regeneration and transfor­mation has its source at the threshold of the new Temple, and that this threshold faces the East. 49 As Shozo Fujita observes, this is not a geo­graphical location but a theo logical image, which form s the typological counterpart to the \"wilderness of the land of Egypt\" (Ezek. 20:36): \"And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise ofmany waters: and the earth shined with his glory\" (Ezek. 43 :2). Here, too, the tone ofthe setting is the same as that ofthe lshraq, ofthe morning splendour of Suhravardi's \"Oriental theosophy\". The visionary Ezekiel experiences the rays of the rising sun as a vehicle bearing the Glory of Yahveh, 50 and it is with the rays of the rising sun that Yahveh enters his Tern ple through the eastern gate (Ezek. 43 :4): \"So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house\" (Ezek. 43:5). The eastern gate was opened only 48 Shozo Fujita, ibid. p. 49, reminds us that the description ofthe Temple in the 'Letter of Aristeas' (see below, section IV, B, 2) mentions a natural spring welling copiously out ofthe Temple precinct. Tacitus {History 5:15) speaks ofthe Temple's Jons perennis aquae. The same image of a stream of water coming out of the Templ e of Jerusalem occurs in some pre-exilic psalms, e.g. Pss. 46, 65 (Fujita, p. 50). The rivers mentioned in Rev. 22:1 and I Enoch 26:2-3 derive from Ezek. 47 (ibid., p. 51). We are reminded here of Suhravardi's 'Recit de l'exil occidental' : the Spring of the Water of Life at the foot of the mystical Sinai, which is the temple ofthe Angel­Holy Spirit. 49 Even though there is evidence that at a given moment a solar cult, severely condemned by the prophet Ezekiel, was celebrated in the Temple of Jerusalem, this did not necessarily lead Ezekiel totally to reject the association of the sun's glory with the presence ofYahveh. See Shozo Fujita, ibid., p. 24, note I, and p. 52. 50 Ibid., p. 53, note 1. Shozo Fujita here refers to the studies of J. Morgenstern, suggesting that a golden image of Y ahveh stood in front of the Holy of Holies in the Temple until it was removed at the time of Asa's reform in 889 B.C. The reflection of the sun on this image during the spring and autumn equinoxes was \"the glory of the Lord\".

The closed door is henceforth a symbol to us ofthe fact that God will never again desert his Temple 51 Because there will be no more idolatry, the eternal divine Presence-the eternal Shekhi­nah-will reign supreme, and by the same token the Imago Templi is the Imago Paradisi. 52 Thus, in the pages of the Book of Ezekiel, we rediscover the motifofthe destruction ofthe Temple signifying the fall from Paradise53 The restoration of the Temple brings us to the ideal of the city-temple to come: \"I ... will set my sanctuary in the midst ofthem for evermore. My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people\" (Ezek. 37:26-27). Here the Temple is truly the place ofthe ever-continuing Presence (m ishlam):54 \"I was a sanctuary for them\" in the time of exile; \"My dwelling is now with them forever\". Let us observe that it is not on account oflsrael, but on account ofhis own sacrosanct Name that God will restore the Tern ple: \"And the heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst ofthem for evermore\" (Ezek. 37:28). On whom, then, will fall the privilege of being the priests of this Temple? The full sacerdotal ideal of the prophet-priest Ezekiel manifests itself at this point. His prayer will be fulfilled by the \"sons of Light\", the knight-priests ofthe Community ofQumran, and by all their emulators, those whose entire inheritance consists in God alone. The last chapters ( 40-48) of the Book of Ezekiel clearly demonstrate the ideal of the city­lomple, anticipating the heavenly Jerusalem of the Johannine Apocalypse. The city-temple assumes the dimension of a cosmic restoration. 51 Ibid., p. 55. 52 Shozo Fujita, ibid., p. 59, reminds us of the m� texts in which the image of Paradise serves to descnbe the blessmgs of the divme Presence (Shekhinah): the oracle of Balaarn (Nurn. 24:3---9), the prophetic message in lsa. 11, Ezek. 47:6--12, Joel 3::8. 53 Cf above, section III, 2. 54 Shozo Fujita, in ibid., p. 63, stresses the concept ofthe Temple {m iqdash) as the divine dwelling-place {m ishkan).

The Ne w Temple. Let us repeat that the delineation ofthe Temple found in Ezekiel furnishes us with the image not of a historical Temple, but of the Temple as it will be at the time of the final restoration, envisaged as a cosmic restoration55 The vision which inaugurates the book situates us on the level of visionary perception: \" ... as I was among the captives by the river ofChebar ... the heavens were opened, and I saw visions ofGod\" (Ezck. 1:1). The opening ofthe heavens is what we encountered previously, expressed in the phrase \"the opening of the Malakut\", and it can only occur at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\" (cf above, sections I and II). Similarly, chapters 40----48, which describe the vision of the new Temple \"in the land ofisrael ... upon a very high mountain\" (Ezek. 40:1) make no mention of Zion or of any tradition of Zion, nor do they refer to the ancient Temple or the ancient city: the perspective is an entirely new one. The stream of water which, as we saw, flows from beneath the threshold of the Temple, on the Eastern side, brings about the cosmic restoration, the return to Paradise. Paradise is thus connected with the high mountain, which is henceforth situated in the Garden of Eden. 56 This vision locating the final Tern ple on the high mountain of Paradise is peculiar to Ezekiel, for the Book of Genesis (2-3) contains no reference to a mountain in the Garden of Eden. Upon this high mountain will be planted the \"tender branch\" that typifies the messianic prince and, with him, the future messianic nation, which will grow to the height of a noble cedar (Ezck. 17:22-23): \"And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by. And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden\" (Ezek. 36:34-35). Here, then, the Imago Templi 55 Cf. Th. A. Busink, Der Tempel von Jerusalem, von Salomon bis Herodes ... , vo l. 1, Der Tempel Salomos (Leiden, Brill, 1970), p. 42 , note 156. Here the author, after referring to the treatise Middoth (On the measurements of the Temple), which belongs to the second-century Mishnah, suggests that the delineation of the Temple in Ezekiel should be interpreted in the same sense. This sense should also be given to the description ofthe measurements ofthe new Temple in the Qumran texts. It was necessary to provide for the replacement ofthe old Temple because of its defilements, but this replacement is merely temporary, provisional upon the restoration ofthe new Temple. Cf below, note 122. In his great work, Th. A. Busink provides diagrams reconstructing the first and second Temples, as well as a sketch of Ezekiel's ideal eschatological Temple. 56 Shozo Fujita, Temple Th eology, pp. 70-71.

As the centre of the universe, too, it is situated \"on a high mountain\" because it is the link between Heaven, Earth and the sub-terrestrial world (the living Water welling up from below the threshold). This is an essential function, one which can also be interpreted in the sense we assigned above (in section II) to the destruction and restoration ofthe Temple. Already the cosmic symbolism can be detected equally in the form of the altar described by Ezekiel. In short, Ezekiel's vision ofthe new Temple sets before us the Temple's celestial archetype, or, in other words, the celestial Temple as the arche­type-a concept which reappears frequently in later apocalyptic literature. In its nature the new Temple-the city-temple-is supra-terrest rial, and it is envisioned \"as the frame of a city\" (Ezek. 40:2). The mode of visionary perception of the new Temple corresponds to the mode of the initial vision (that ofthe divine chariot or Merkabah) : \"And above ... was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it\" (Ezek. 1 :26). This vision is one which par excellence pertains to the mediatory imaginal: it is a vision not of a terrestrial Temple, nor of an earthly Jerusalem, but of a city-temple whose origin is celestial: \"The new Temple is described as pre-existing in the supra-terrestrial world. \"58 The city-temple-Paradise regained, the link between heav en, earth and the sub-terrestrial world-is characterized exclusively by the sover­eignty ofYahveh, for it is through love ofhis Name that Yahveh restores the Temple. Ezekiel's message of the new Temple concerns Yahveh's continuing Presence in the midst of his people. He is the centre, and this is expressed symbolically by the central position ofthe final Temple in the universe. Ezekiel's concern is not to glorify the brilliance of its external appearance, but to herald the establishment of divine sovereignty in the universe, at its ultimate zenith. The temple is eschatological, essentially 57 Ibid., pp. 76 ff Shozo Fujita suggests a comparison between this and the descrip­tion of the Temple on the scroll of Gudea, even though the text of this scroll was composed long before Ezekiel. The temple is in honour of the god Ningirsu. In a dream Gudea receives the plan ofthe temple inscribed on a \"tablet oflapis lazuli\".

They can perceive it only as a mythological representation, and therefore as unreal. The Imago Templi as the centre of divine action in hierohistory is the characteristic of Ezekiel's theology of the Temple, or templar theology, and as such it can be the object only of \"inner\" oc esoteric perception. There are two great phases in this theology of the Temple. The first is when God himself becomes the Temple in the land of exile: a unique declaration which, as we saw, initiates a new relationship between God and the true believer of Israel, represented by the faithful posterity of Zadok. The second is when, on the summit of the lofty mountain, the final Temple appears as a supra-terrestrial Image, 59 divine in origin-the unprofanable dwelling of the Sacred. The eastern gate is shut.

The exaltation of the Temple. A whole group of books illustrates the motif which one may style \"the exaltation ofthe Temple\"- As portrayed in the Book of Ecclesiasticus (the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach), the Imago Templi is associated particularly with the representation of Wisdom, Sophia as a hypostasis, common in wisdom literature (cf. Proverbs 8-9). In a splendid poem, Wisdom herself states that she proceeds from the mouth of God and that God appointed her to dwell in the holy Tabernacle, that is to say in the Temple. Moreover, as Sophia is also identified with the Torah, the fact that Sophia dwells in the Temple eo ipso signifies that the Torah dwells there as well (cf. Deuteronomy 10:5; \"I ... put the tables in the ark which I had made\"). And the Son of Sirach utters an ardent prayer: \"Have compassion upon the city ofthy sanctuary, Jerusalem, the place of thy rest\" (Ecclus. 36: 15). 60 The Book ofDaniel contains an announcement of the restoration of the Temple, whose message is explained by the angel Gabriel to Daniel \"presenting [his] supplication before the Lord [his] God for the holy mountain of [his] God\" (Dan. 9:20): \"- .. for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision. Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city ... to anoint the most Holy\" (Dan. 9:23-24). Nevertheless, attention is focused on the earthly Jerusalem, and nowhere is the Temple interpreted symbolically.61 Because of disillusion with the second Temple, built by Zerubbabel in 515 B.C., the Book of Tobit exhibits as it were a nostalgia for the perfect Imago Templi.

Here again, what is envisaged, ev en in this idealized form, is the earthly temple, which will \"physically\" incorporate the divine Glory:62 the city-temple that will receive all the peoples who have renounced their id ols. Rabbinical literature likewise presents an Image of the glorified Temple. Targumical texts (Jonathan, Onkelos) tend towards an idealization ofthe Temple (largely because they exemplify the hermeneutic known in Islamic gnosis as ta'wil). The Temple of Jerusalem is the only Temple in which the divine Shekhinah dwells forever, and as such it is the source of all divine benediction. Midrash and Talmud envisage the Temple as a symbol of the glory oflsrael and anticipate its restoration. We thus observe, with Shozo Fujita, that all these writings, apart from Ecclesiasticus, expect the magnifi­cence of the ideal Temple to be the final restoration of the first Temple, the Temple of Solomon. They accord with Ezekiel where the sense of expectation is concerned. But they differ from Ezekiel in the sense that for him the first Temple had been utterly profaned, and thus the new Temple is not envisaged as being purely and simply the restoration of the first. This fundamental conception confers on the Temple a significance which is highly symbolical and theological, whereas in all the other writings the restored Temple at Jerusalem is idealized to such an extent that its theological significance, and hence the significance of the divine judgement pronounced on the first Temple, are eclipsed. By the same token, the Imago Templi is overlaid with lavish descriptions of the details of its external appearance, while the vision of Ezekiel did not dwell on this external appearance at all. 63 2. Hope in thefuture Temple. This theme provokes a question which, de­pending on the answer given, will lead to two different conceptions ofthe 62 Ibid., pp. 96-97, according to the Septuagint version. The Vulgate gives the fo llowing, in the canticle ofTobit the elder after the disappearance ofthe archangel Raphael: \"Beatus ero si fuerint reliquiae seminis mei ad videndarn claritatem Jerusalem ... Portae Jerusalem ex sapphiro et smaragdo aedificabuntur, et ex lapide pretioso orrmis circuitis muronnn ej us. Ex lapide candido et mundo omnes plateae ejus sternentur, et per vicos ejus alleluia cantabitur\" (Tobit 13:20---22). \"Omnis autem deserta terra ejus replebitur, et domus Dei, quae in ea incensa est, iterum reaedificabitur, ibique revertentur omnes timentes Deum, et relinquent gentes idola sua et venient in Jerus alem et inhabitabunt in ea\" (14:7----S). 63 Shozo Fujita, op. ck., pp. 105 ff 294"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TEMPU IN CONFRONTATION significance of the restoration of the Temple. The question is: who will be the builder ofthe new Temple?64 According to some, he will be a Messiah of David's line, an idea going back to the Book of Zechariah (6: 12). Accord­ing to others, he will be God himself, an idea going back to the Book of Ezekiel ( 40-48). In the first of these cases, the Imago Templi represents a temple which will be essentially the restored Temple of Solomon; this is the image gleaned from the Book of Tobit (see above) and also from the Psalms of Solomon. In the second case, the future Temple will not be simply a restoration of the first. In virtue of its transcendent nature, it will be infinitely more glorious. The image ofthis Temple, whose origin is ulti­mately the vision of Ezekiel, is attested in I Enoch, in the Testament of Benjamin (Fhe Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs), and finally, and most importantly, in the writings ofthe Community ofQumran. We must therefore note the similarities between Ezekiel and I Enoch. In both there is the idea that the new Jerusalem will have nothing in common with the old, but will descend or be brought down from Heaven.65 In both there is the idea that since God himself is the builder, the new Temple will be infinitely superior to the first Temple, the Temple of Solomon. The origin of the final city-temple is celestial and transcendent. 3. The young branch planted on the mountain. Here the Imago Templi, inasmuch as it is an image of the eschatological Temple, is emiched by a motif which was to supply the Community ofQumran with one ofthe most significant themes in its theology ofthe Temple. We have already noted, in the Book of Ezekiel (17:22-24), the image of the \"young branch\" planted on the mountain of the Temple-a branch which is the principle of the growth and flowering ofthe new Israel. Originating in this image is the theme of the righteous men who together constitute, symbolically, the \"planting of justice\", and are offshoots of the \"plant of eternal justice\". In the Psalms of Solomon, in I Enoch, in the Book of Jubilees, in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, the righteous are symbolized as \"plants of justice\". Hence arises 64 Ibid., pp. 130 :It: 65 Ibid., p. 134, where the author refers to the Judaeo-Christian apocalypses: the Revelation of John, 21:10; IV Esdras 7:26, 13:36; II Baruch 32:2. Cf. Le Livre d'Henoch, trans. F. Martin (Paris, 1906), pp. 233-236. Shozo Fujita, moreover, stresses the fact that in I Enoch the idea of the final Temple of Jerusalem is linked to the idea of God as the \"good shepherd\": it is his task to build the eschatological Jerusalem and to gather together all the children of Israel. The appearance of the final Messiah heralds the restoration of the Im ago Paradisi. 295"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"THE IlvlAGO TElv.fPLI IN CONFRONTATION the idea that the eschatological Israel will be \"like God\". In a Qumran document which has already been the subject of lengthy research, Mel­chizedek, a priestly, messianic and eschatological figure, is designated as one of the Elohim.66 His precursor Abraham was the first \"righteous plant\". All the righteous planted after him by God, from age to age, are chosen from among the rest of the Jews and Gentiles, with the result that the theme of the plant of justice is indissolubly linked to the idea of divine election. By the same token, it appears to be inseparable from the idea of a gnosis and of the divine plan in hierohistory. The plant of justice receives nourishment, in fact, from the Water that is knowledge, and this knowledge is the gnosis that unveils the secret of the divine mystery to the righteous who are called upon to inaugurate the new era. Thus the rise of these \"plants of justice\" is, if not the most important event, certainly one ofthe most important in the divine plan ofhierohistory, whose secret meaning is registered on the \"celestial tablets\" so frequently mentioned (I Enoch, Th e Book of Jubilees, Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs), 67 and which the Angels reveal only gradually to certain privileged men. We may say that these \"Tablets\" are the \"code oftheocracy in History\",68 but only ifwe specify that, as the setting oftheocratic activity, History means something other than what is understood by the word as it is currently employed. This is why we said earlier that we would rather use the term hierohistory, in order to avoid all ambiguity. For the same reason, it is not enough to say that History has two dimensions-one vertical and one horizontal-in the sense that it must be interpreted not merely in terms of a \"final end\" (eschaton) but also in terms of an \"up above\"- Precisely here one must specify that a vision of History which acknowledges that the events that constitute it possess a celestial archetype, confers on this History a parabolic dimension, a dimension which elevates all events to the level of parables. Eschatology cannot simply be an event which one fine day puts an end to the rect ilinear perspective of secular history. Equally, 66 The eschatological Israel that is \"like God\" involves the theme of imitatio Dei; cf ibid., p. 141 note 1. Here we may remember the sentence which recurs frequently in the Islamic mystics: takhallaqu bi-akhlaq Allah, \"model your ways on the divine ways\". The Qumran fragment ab out Melchizedek (p . 140 note 3) has already been the subject ofa considerable literature. We will return to it elsewhere in connection with its implications for Ismaili Imamology. 67 Cf Hans Bietenhard, Die himmlische Welt im Urchristentum und Sa.dtjudentum (Tubin­gen, 1951) , pp. 231-254: 'Die himrnlischen Bucher und Tafeln'. 68 Shozo Fujita, Temple Theology, pp . 142 ff. 296"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TBMPU IN CONFRONTATION the latter is incapable of grasping the eschatological dimension. What it offers is a caricature: a social messianism or popularized eschatology. We will have occasion to recall, when speaking of Qumran, the connection between realized eschatology and the mysterium liturgicum, between the existential meaning of eschatology and liturgical time. Only when there is such a connection does the Imago of the final Temple acquire its authentic and existential significance, as the eternal theocratic kingdom. The final Temple, built in the middle of\"the eternal planting of justice\", will be the centre of the new world, where only the unique divine sove reignty will be recognized. The synthesis of the theme of the \"planting of justice\" and that of the restoration of the Temple-that is to say, the new Temple as God's planting, in which the \"plant ofjustice\" flowers eternally-establishes an Imago of the new world centred on the Temple, an Imago Templi which is faithful to the vision of Ezekiel. By means of this symbolism, the pact or alliance between God and men takes the fonn of the Temple-a fonn which we, for our part, will certainly not defme as empirical, since it is a fonn which is par excellence the Temple's imaginal form, and is therefore experienced on the imaginal level, at \"the meeting­place of the two seas\". Thus, the Image of the future Temple {I Enoch and the Book of Jubilees) is inseparable from the restoration of the primordial Paradise. This fact is the root of all that is said below concerning the symbolism ofthe Temple theology at Qumran.69 4. The celestial Temple and the cosmic restoration. In this way we re-encounter the theme which marks the climax of Ezekiel's templar theology, the theme in which \"the cosmic res toration and the Temple\" are associated. The start of our inquiry here is a Jewish tradition according to which the Temple is destined to be \"in Heaven\" until the end ofdays.70 What is this celestial Temple? The reply to this question embraces three phases: a. the celestial liturgy; b. the celestial Imago Templi; c. the link between the celestial Temple and the eschatological Temple. a. The Testament of Levi (3:4) contains an account of the vision that he 69 Ibid., pp. 148, 150---151. 70 Other traditions situate the celestial temple \"between heaven and earth\"; ibid., p. 152, note 1.

In the sixth Heaven are the \"Angels of the Presence\", who are its liturgies and who intercede for men. The idea of liturgy evokes the ritual observed by the priests in the Tabernacle and the Temple, but the angelic liturgy is purely spiritual and does not include any blood sacrifice. It may be obj ected that this is merely a spiritualized description ofthe earthly Temple, projected into Heaven. We believe this to be too facile a way by far of surrendering and conforming to the expl anations of modern psychology. In total contrast to this type of explanation, it may be said that to see what our visionaries see is to see that the earthly Temple is never more than a projection on earth of the celestial Temple. This archetypal relationship will prove crucial for the theology of Qumran, inspiring the texts of its dazzling celestial liturgy. Philo also testifies to the idea ofspiritual worship among the Essenes. It is perfectly correct to speak of the pre-Christian origins of spiritual worship.72 The \"Angel ofthe Presence\" plays a most important part in intertesta­mentary literature . He is the intercessor, the minister of the spiritual liturgy {Testament of Levi 3:5----6), God's Scribe, whose task in the celestial Tern ple is to write down the decrees which determ ine the destiny of the hierohistory of the world (Jubilees 1 :27)73 -this hierohistory which, through its hidden decrees, defies the secular norms of exoteric History. b. Thus the celestial Imago Templi arises, in a form which accords with the scope of the angelic liturgy and with the hidden reality of a hierohistory that resuscitates from the fallen Temple the figure of the ideal Temple reserved for God, the Angels and the righteous.74 Sacred cosmology, or hierocosmology, presents us with the vision ofthe ascent ofthis Temple into the heights-the vision ofits vertical cosmic dimension. The Holy of Holies is in the seventh heaven. The sanctuary where the Angels of the highest rank celebrate their liturgy is in the sixth heaven. The vestibule of the Temple corresponds to the fourth and fifth heavens, where the lower-71 According to one manuscript, the \"seventh heaven\"; ibid., p. 152, note 2.

The archetypal relationship-whose importance for the Qumran Community we noted above-goes back ultimately to the vision of the new Temple in Ezekiel, to the idea of the celestial archetype of the Tabernacle as it impressed itself on the priest-theologian. c. With regard to the significance ofthe celestial Temple as the escha­tological Temple, the lived experience of this must be sought in the mysterium liturgicum In I Enoch (chaps. 24-25), there is a description of a visionary journey towards the north-west, in the course of which Enoch sees seven magnificent mountains. The central mountain surpasses all the others: \" ... resembling the seat of a throne: and fragrant trees encircled the throne\" (24:3); \" ... it reached to heaven like the throne of God, of alabaster, and the summit of the throne was of sapphire\" (18:8). The Angel-guide, who is here the archangel Michael, explains to the visionary: \" . . . it is His throne . . . when He shall come down to visit the earth with goodness\" (25 :3). Four things are to be noted here: the mountain is a link whereby communication is established between Heaven and Earth; it is the throne on which God is seated when He descends; it is, consequently, the mountain-temple; and from this mountain, divine grace is poured out over men. There is an analogous vision in Ezekiel ( 40: 2)76 Among the fragrant trees one is without peer. The archangel Michael explains (24:4) that no mortal may touch its fruit until the day of judge­ment, when it will be transplanted close to the temple of the Lord (25:4---5) and its fruits will nourish the Elect. This tree is the tree of Life, 11 and we are 75 In the fifth heaven are \"the Angels who bear the replies to the Angels ofthe Lord's presence\". This is most likely a category of Angels who are inferior in rank to the latter, to whom it is their function to bear the prayers of men. The Angels of the Presence offi:r these prayers to God, then bear his replies back to the lower-ranking Angels, who in turn communicate them to men. In the Greek Apocalypse ofJJaruch, 11-12, the archangel Michael is represented as receiving the prayers ofmen which are brought to him from earth by the Angels. Elsewhere he is identified as being himself the \"Angel of the Presence\"; Shozo Fujita, op. cit., pp. 156-157. The essence of the angelic hierarchy can thus be expressed sometimes in liturgical terms and sometimes philosophically. We may also recall the superimposed Sinais ofwhich the celestial Temple is constituted in Suhravardi's 'Recital ofthe Occidental Exile'. 76 Shozo Fujita, Temple Theology, p. 161. 77 R. H.

This is why entry into the new Temple is an act both eschatological and liturgica1.78 The liturgical act consists in obtaining, in integrating to oneself the fr agrance of the tr ee of Life, the source of long life, joy and sanctification.

B. The theology of the Temple in Hellenistic Judaism. These documents, which belong to the two centuries pr eceding the Christian era, testify to an unreserved exaltati on of the Temple of Jerusalem, whose Imago nourished the nostalgia of the faithful scattered in the countries of exile. Moreov er, the influence ofHellenistic thought, which saw ultimate value and ultimate truth in the invisible and the immaterial, made itself felt in a notable tendency to idealize the Temple. Other characteristics are the absence of the apocalyptic expectation of a fu ture temple, and the lack-except in the case of the high priest Onias and of Philo-of a critical attitude towards the Temple of Jerusalem. While such an attitude was by way of compen­sation to be re sponsible for the formation ofthe Community at Qumran, in Onias and Philo the motives for it are different. Onias was unlawfully banned from the Temple; Philo concentrates essentially on the grandiose vision of the immaterial Temple. 1913), vol. II, pp. 200-204.

The Septuagint. The Septuagint version of the Bible demands a com­parative study which is practically inexhaustible and also extraordinarily interesting, si nce any translation inevitably involves, to a certain extent, a hermeneutic80 While it emphasizes the exaltation of the Temple of J er­usalem, the Septuagint seems anxious to avoid any association of God with an earthly site or building. Where the last verse of the Book of Ezekiel concludes: \" ... and the name of the city from that day shall be, the Lord is there\" (Ezek. 48:35; cf above), the Septuagint prefers: \" ... and the name of the city, from the day that it shall be finished, shall be the name thereof (To lwoJi« aVril\">, the name of this city) . 2. The Letter of Aristeas, which in fact recounts the \"legend\" of the seventy­two translators of the Bible into Greek, is a text in which Judaism \"is expressed through the mouth of a pagan who is a devotee of Jewish worship and law\". We are indebted to him for an ideal Imago Templi, an Image of \"the Temple as biblical tradition, especially the priestly tradition, had impressed it upon the imagination and the veneration of pious Jews\" ,81 and which is in correspondence with the eschatological image: \"And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top ofthe mountains\" (Isa. 2:2). With its sense of the univer sal vocation of the Jewish religion, which finds support in a symbolic hermeneutic, this text can be seen as a precursor to Philo. It is possible, and even probable, that the description of the Temple, of the solemnity of the ritual and the splendour of the liturgies, was influenced by the accounts of pious pilgrims. But it seems, also, that the apocalyptic image ofthe fm al Temple in Ezekiel has contributed here to the idealization, although this does not culminate in a theology ofthe Temple which can be compared to Ezekiel's82 80 Shozo Fujita, op . cit., pp. 174 ff, gives some striking examples. Cf Ps. 48:9, where God is said to be \"in the midst of [his] temple\" instead of \"in the midst of his people\". 81 Cf.

II Maccabees was originally a five- volume work written by a certain Jason of Cyrenia, of which we only possess a shortened version in one volume (second century B.C.). Its theme has been defined as the glorifi­cation of the Temple, which in this dramatic history functions as the central pivot ofthe action. It has also been said that it is a history in which the archetype of the event assumes more importance than the factual reality of the event itself.83 In connection with this, we should bear in mind the observations made above about the necessity for a concept of hierohistory as parabolic (parahistoric) in contrast to profane, exoteric and literalist history. Here the drama ofhierohistory consists oftwo acts, symmetrical in structure.84 In Act I, the Temple is threatened by Heliodorus (3:9-39), desecrated by Antiochus (5: 11-20), and finally reconquered and purified by Judas Maccabeus (10:1-8). In Act II, the Temple is threatened by Lysias (11:1-21), and Nicanor (14:31-15:27), and finally rescued by God (15:28-35). The two acts culminate in the establishment of a new solemn festival (10:5-8). The two cycles ofthe drama are thus concerned with the threats against the Temple and its preservation by God himself. One can, it is true, distinguish certain features to be found also in Ezekiel's prophetic image ofthe mountain ofthe Temple, but the difference here is that the author is thinking essentially of the exaltation of the existing Temple (the second Temple, that of Zerubbabel). Moreover, there is as it were an adherence to Jeremiah's warning against all magical belief in the Temple: \"Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord [is here] ... \" (Jer. 7:4). Here, the Temple is not the end in itself, but merely the sign ofthe Presence ofGod among his people.85 In accordance with the line of thought which is that of Philo and 83 Ibid., p. 193. D. Arenhoeve1 (quoted in ibid., note 4) speaks of a \"geschichtslose Geschichtschreibung\", a non-historical historiography. We thus appear to come back, in one way or another, to the concept of \"subtle history\", which we have emphasized here. 84 Following the analysis provided in ibid, pp. 193 ff. In relation to section VI below, we should point out the existence in the Scottish rite of a grade of \"Knight of the East\", which tradition traces back to the Maccabean period.

Waite, Emblematic Freemasonry (London, 1925), p. 106. 85 Cf these lines by F. M. Abel, quoted by Shozo Fujita: \"The Temple is not an end in itself; but merely a means whereby to attain a higher end.

This line ofthought goes back, to be sure, to Ezekiel (11:16): in the time of exile, God himself is the Temple (cf above). In any case, we for our part believe that the opposition between the vision ofthe material Temple \"localized\" on earth, and the vision of the ideal spiritual Temple, is somewhat artificial, since in fact the Imago Templi as such is always perceived on the level of the in-between, of the imaginal-the level which we have already designated as that of \"the meeting-place of the two seas\". 4. The temple of Leontopolis. This would also appear to be the way in which the high priest Onias IV perceived the temple that he built at Leontopolis in Egypt,86 during the exile imposed upon him by the advent of the Hasmonean dynasty. There is no doubt that he intended, as far as was possible, to make the temple he was building into an image ofthe Temple at Jerusalem. To the extent to which an eschatological meaning is assigned to the verses from Isaiah (19:18--- 19) in the letter that Onias addressed to Ptolemy Philometer and Cleopatra, quoted by the historianJosephus, the Imago Templi would have been an eschatological Imago for the community grouped around him. To this extent his perception ofthe Temple is in line with that ofEzekiel and ofQumran, with the difference that Qumran did not build a physical temple at all, but remained in expectation of the final Temple, to be built by God himself.87 5. The Sibylline Orocles88 Book III refers to Cyrus and then to Joshua ben Jehozadak, the high priest of the community which had returned from with reference to 2 Mace. 5:19---20: \"Die eigentliche Geschichte des Buches ist die des Volkes; der Tempel ist wesentlich Symbol; in seinem Zustande offenbart sich der Zustand des Volkes\"; quoted in ibid., p. 200 note 2.

The author uses hyperbole: not only Cyrus, but all the kings ofPersia will lavish gifts upon it and em bell ish it with gold and precious metals. In the \"Sibylline Oracles\", the Imago Templi is seen as the symbol of the return to the Golden Age.90 We must note, however, that in the \"Oracles\" it is the second Temple, Zerubabbel's Temple, which is exalted, whereas in Psalm 132:7-17, for example, it is the future temple, which will be built by the Davidic Messiah. The difference is resolved on the level of the Imago Templi: if the author visualizes the post-exilic community as the final messianic establishment, the implication is that he perceives the Temple of Jerusalem, of which he is a contemporary, as the restoration of the first Temple, the Temple ofSolomon, in all its magnificence. The exaltation of the Temple thus links up with the exaltation in the Book of Tobit 91 which we discussed above. 6. Philo, in his monumental work, has provided us with one ofthe greatest conspectuses of symbolic hermeneutics to appear among the \"religions of the Book\". To discover the Imago Templi in this work amounts to inquiring whether and how this Image is present in it on the imaginal level. The fact that Philo uses the terms allegory and symbol interchangeably tends to complicate the inquiry, insofar as we try nowadays to distinguish precisely between them92 But whether allegorical or symbolical, Philo's hermeneutic is aimed essentially at revealing the hidden meaning (the batin oflslamic gnosis). And since the hidden meaning is nothing other than the letter raised or transmuted into symbol, and perceived henceforth on the level of the imaginal world, the symbol itself is no longer something behind which hides the thing symbolized. It is, quite simply, the form assumed on this level by the transcendent reality, and this form is this reality. Thus, 89 Zech. 6: 1 1-14.

Far from being exhausted, these problems may not even have been properly formulated yet. The hermeneutics of Philo will have to be compared with those of Qumran, a comparison from which the Ismaili hermeneutic in Islamic gnosis must not be excluded. Needless to say, for Philo the Temple of Jerusalem is the only authentic Temple on earth: one God, one Temple on earth. He also gives us a celebrated description ofit. But the work ofhis true genius is other than this. Dominating his thought is the idea that notwithstanding the unique­ness on earth of the Temple of Jerusalem, on a higher level of vision there are two temples, the cosmic te mple and the temple of the soul. We had occasion above (section II) to refer to the cosmic mysticism ofpre-Christian antiquity, to the Imago Templi mundi. This theme is one which Philo accepts as self-evident,93 even though he is specific about his own personal idea of the cosmic temple, which he sees as a philosopher. One could in fact say that there is a double cosmic temple, because the cosmos includes both the sensible cosmos \"which is the temple of the natures perceived by the senses\", and an intelligible cosmos \"which is the consecrated temple of invisible natures\". One could also say that there is a unique temple constituted by a unique cosmos, \"whose sanctuary is the most holy part of the essence ofbeings, that is to say Heaven\" with all the intelligible natures that it comprises. On the other hand, the cosmic significance of the Temple of Jerusalem and of the parts which compose it is attested in Philo by reference to Exodus 25:40, where Moses is ordered: \"And look that thou makest them [the tabernacle and all it contains] after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount\" . The tabernacle on earth (the Temple) is the image ofthe tabernacle in Heaven, the archetypal model which was revealed to Moses. 94 This motif also has roots in wisdom liter ature: the Book of Wisdom likewise saw in the Temple of Solomon \"the image of the sacred tent\" 95 The phenomenology of the Imago Templi is 93 Shozo Fujita, op . cit., p. 222.

We have already alluded to the motif of the Temple-archetype in Shiite gnosis; cf my 'Configuration ofthe Temple ofthe Ka'bah', op. cit. 95 \"Et dixisti me aedificare templurn in monte sancto tuo, et in civitate habitationis tuae altare, similitudinem tabernaculi sancti tui, quod praeparasti ab initio\" (liber Sapientiae 9:8). 305"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"TI-IE IMAGO TEN.!PLI IN CONFRONTATION completed by the motif of the Temple of Wisdom, the Temple that Sophia has built for herself (see above, section IV, A, I, and below ).96 The motif of the temple of the soul, or soul-temple, derives from the analogy that exists between the soul and the cosmos.97 In his treatise on the Cherubim, Philo develops a detailed comparison between the human soul and the palace of a king:98 \"There is only one dwelling that is worthy (of God), and that is the soul prepared (to receive him). To speak in all justice, the dwelling of the invisible God is the invisible soul\"; \"The soul of the Wise Man activated by grace is a veritable altar ... The sacred light burns on it always, unceasingly tended. For the light of the spirit is wisdom\"; \"God delights in altars without fire, on which the virtues dance in unison.\" \"Ultimately,\" writes A. Jaubert, \"the entire soul is the seat of a spiritual worship far preferable to the worship of temples. It offers up a true liturgy to its creator.\" This liturgy is to be considered in relation to the double Temple: since there is a cosmic temple and a temple ofthe soul-a cosmos-temple and a soul-temple-there is also cosmic worship and worship of the soul, a worship that takes place in the macrocosm and a worship that takes place in the microcosm. In both cases, the temple is a spiritual one. In the books of wisdom (see above, note 96, Proverbs 9:1-2), hypostasiz ed Wisdom, Sophia, was already building her temple and celebrating her liturgy in it. In Ecclesiasticus, Sophia, \"come forth from the mouth ofthe Most High\" and therefore identical with his Word, his Logos, \"is described as a high priest officiating in the Temple of Jerusalem ... She fulfils her liturgical function in the presence of the Lord (24:1-12) ... She officiates mysteriously before the face of God like an Angel of the Presence, and her liturgical function is intimately associated with that of the priests of the Temple. We are close to a conception of the Logos-priest intimately related to the Temple liturgy.\"99 The high priest ofthe cosmic temple is the First-born, the divine Logos (&eta<; Ao-yoo;).

Ne vertheless, the corre­spondence between the cosmic temple and the temple ofthe soul-between the cosmic worship and the worship of the soul-leads him to the notion of the \"Aaron of the soul\" .103 There is thus a triple Logos-priest. There is the First-born Logos, the priest ofthe cosmic temple; there is Aaron, typifying the high priest of the Temple ofJerusalem, who is both \"the Logos of Moses and the Logos of God\"; and there is Aaron, the Logos who is \"Aaron of the soul\". This illustrates the thesis first introduced above: \"There are two temples of God. One is the cosmos, in which the high priest is God's first-born, the divine Logos. The other is the spiritual soul, whose priest is the true man; his sensible image is he who offers up the prayers and the sacrifices of the Fathers, who is clothed in the vestment whereon is reproduced the whole ofHeaven, so that the cosmos may co­celebrate with man and man with the universe\" .104 Just as the soul is the 100 Shozo Fujita, op. cit., p. 222.

In point of fa ct, this corresp ondence overcomes al l opposition between the corporeal and the incorporeal, for it enables one to grasp both ofthem simultaneously on the level which we have already designated as \"the meeting-place ofthe two seas\", the appointe d pl ace for hierophanies.

This in itselfis the definition of the imaginal world, the world where, for Philo as well, the Im ago Templi is made manifest. In this world the alios (the other) of allegory is surp assed, because the Im ago is the fo rm in which both the one and the other integrally mani fest themselves.

Philo searches for the hidden spiritual meaning -the esoteric meaning-of all corporeal objects (temple, vestments), of all liturgical gestures, in an attempt to discover a W1iversal meaning in the Jewish temple and its worship107 To be sure, the Imago Templi that emerges is different from the visionary Imago ofEzekiel or ofQumran, but it leads in its own right to an authentic interiority: the Logos as high priest in the spiritual macrocosm corresponds to the true Man who is re born in the spiritual soul. The two kingdoms-the two Temple s-are one. 7. Meister Eckhart. It is only possible here to make a few brief observations. The search for the Imago Templi should be pursued throughout the Jewish esoteric tradition, for only then could a theosophy ofthe Temple be built up which would enable us to understand how and why the symbolism of the Temple overflows into Christian mysticism, how and why nostalgia for it remains the lasting source of Christian esoteric ism. The following are two examples of this. Gershom Scholem, in an admirable book, has indicated one of those convergences that throw light upon the course ofthis inquiry. Recapitulating the process whereby the cosmological symbol of the Temple ofthe heavenly Jerusalem has become a mystical symbol for the author ofthe book Bahir, he writes: \"Infinite divine Thought, that precedes and embraces all things, is the mystical 'tern ple' in which all spiritual beings have their place'' This is the mystical place to which the prophet Habakkuk comes in the \"delights\" or \"ecstasies\" ofhis prayer: \"Oh God! I have heard thy speech, and was afraid\" (Hab. 3:2). To hear in Hebrew also means spiritual understanding. The supreme sphere of hearing is what one hears God say. The thought from which \"ear and eye draw\" is named \"the king ofwhom all creation has need\", the king who is withdrawn, miraculous, hidden in his temple, \"and who has commanded that no one should ask for him\" .108 G. Scholem goes on to make the following comparison: \"This symbol­ism, in which the Temple is the most profound divine thought, can be 107 Ibid., p. 224, note 2: \"Philo said that sacrifices at the Temple were not just on behalf of the Jews, but 'for all mankind'\" {Spec.

II, 163), for it \"has received the gift of prophecy and priesthood on herself of all mankind\" (A hr. 98). 108 Gershom G. Scholem, op. cit., pp. 141-142.

This is the symbolism of the 'temple' by which, as by so many other metaphors, Meister Eckhart, some hundred and fifty years later, was to define the highest sphere ofthe soul, its 'knowledge by way ofthe Intellect'. The soul's noetic faculty (Vemunftlichkeit),109 as Eckhart calls the highest aspect ofthe intellect, is its pure thought, in which it is in contact with the intelligere of God-in which it is the very Intellect of God. 'Where is God, if not in his temple where he reveals himself in his holiness? The temple of God is the Intellect. Nowhere does God dwell more patently than in his temple, the Intellect, as that other master [Aristotle] has said: God is an Intellect that lives in the knowledge of itself. . . for only there is it at rest (Stille) \\\"110 As Scholem observes, the starting-point ofthe Bahir is different from that of Meister Eckhart, who proceeds from the concept of God in Aristotle, but the symbolism is the same. The transition from the temple ofGod to the temple ofthe soul signifies the coming into contact of divine thought and human thought, since the intelligere of the soul in this temple is in contact with the intelligere of God. This contact is the source itself of all speculative theology, in the etymological sense of the word speculum: a catoptric mysticism. Meister Eckhart returns to the theme ofthe temple in a sermon on Matthew 21: 12. The nobility of the human soul lies in the fact that it carries the Imago Dei within it (cf Eckhart's idea of the \"noble man\"), and as such it is the Temple, from which all merchants and traders must be driven away. For \" ... God wants to have this temple empty, so that He alone may dwell in it. Hence this temple pleases Him so much, because it is so like Him, and He is so pleased to be in the temple if He alone dwells in it \" .111 109 It should be noted that in translating the German Vernunft from Meister Eckhart's text we use, not the term \"reason\", but the terms \"intelligence, intellect\". Nous is more than reason, and it is doubtless one of the misfortunes of philosophy, whether we are concerned with Meister Eckhart or with Hegel, that it has become customary to translate Vemunft as \"reason\".

It testifies to the hierophanic presence of the Imago Templi, nostalgia for which, as we shall see, found expression in the various preoccupations of the \"templar knighthood\" (see below, section VI). The famous theosopher and English Rosicrucian Robert Fludd (157 4-1637) affirms the idea of the triple Temple. There is the Temple of Solomon; the Temple of the Holy Spirit, or soul; and the celestial Temple that is the spiritual palace, situated, like the temple in Ezekiel's final vision, \"on the high mountain\", which in this case is \"the high mountain of initiation\" .112 v. The spiritual Temple and the Community of Qumran Any attempt to construct or reconstruct a theosophy of the Temple, to explain the recurring hierophanies of the Imago Templi, will have from now on to dwell at considerable length on the Essene Community ofQumran, whose supreme legacy before its disappearance was the transmission, expanded into a vast literature, of the message ofthe prophet Ezekiel. It is barely thirty years since the first discoveries were made of the \"scrolls\" hidden in the caves of the J udaean desert, and already the research into them has reached such proportions that it is difficult for the inquirer to master the bibliography.113 Here we are concerned with four points: I.

I. The critique of the Temple of Jerusalem. As we know, the position adopted by the Community of Qumran stems from their severe critique of the Temple then in existence in Jerusalem, that is to say, the second Temple, built by Zerubbabel in 515 B.C. To the judgement which condemns this Temple and its priest irremissibly is opposed the vision of the celestial Temple, of which the Community is structurally the symbol and the anticipation. The theological ideas, images and expressions found in the Book of Ezekiel are used by the Essenes of Qumran in formulating and presenting their theology ofthe Temple. As we know from the document which goes by the name of the \"Damascus Document\", 114 it is because of the treason ofthose who have abandoned Him that God has turned away His face from Israel and from His Temple, and has delivered them \"to the enemy. Ezekiel said: \" ... because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them\" (Ezek. 39:23). This reactuation of Ezekiel's theology of the Temple is itself a remarkable instance ofthe spiritual hermeneutics practised at Qumran.115 The events of the past are reclaimed from this past, not through an allegory which passes them over, but through a transference which makes them the archetype of ever -recurring events in which prophetic truth is accomplished. The abominations preceding the catastrophe and the destruction of the Temple of Solomon (586 B.C.) recur with the presence of the accursed priest, with the last priest-kings of the Hasmonean dynasty116 and the profanation ofthe sacerdotal office ofthe Temple. But in Ezekiel, there is also \"the remnant of the faithful\", those who bear on their foreheads the mark imprinted by the Angel. It is they who, in their turn, form the Community of Qumran. Remarkably, we fm d the same diptych in an eighteenth century epic concerning templar knighthood: a drama in which the catastrophe is ratified by a condemnatory judgement counterbalanced by an apotheosis (see below, section VIII). Does not the Imago Templi become, in each of its recurrences, the dram a of man succumbing to the 114 a Shozo F\\.!iita, op. cit., pp. 235 ff 115 The pesher, which in many ways resembles the ta'wil practised in Shiism and Ismailism. 116 This dynasty starts with Judas Maccabaeus (165-161) and ends, after several tragic reigns, with Mattathias Antigonus ( 40-3 7), tenth in the dynasty. 312"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"THE IMA GO TBMPLI IN CONFRONTATION norms ofthe secular world before triumphing over them with the help of this same Imago? The divine judgement condemning the Temple is one of the most important motifs in Ezekiel's Temple theology, and is a motif also found in the \"Damascus Document\". This correspondence illustrates the way in which the Community had an understanding \"in the present\" of the divine judgement executed in previous times by the Babylonians: a corre­spondence between the last days of the Hebraic monarchy in the sixth century before our era, and the abominations which put an end to the Hasmonean dynasty. Just as the Angel once received the order: \" ... set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst [of Jerusalem]\" (Ezek. 9:4), God has now raised up for such men the \"Teacher (or the Master) of Righteous­ness\". Thus, the Community was able to trace its origins back to the period of the exile. The modern historian may be lost here; but for whoever perceives the hidden reality ofhierohistory or \"subtle history\" as it was perceived by the Community of Qumran, this origin is true in a literal sense. The judgement that was brought of old against the first Temple corresponds to thejudgement ofthe \"end ofdays\", that is to say, it corresponds to the time of the Community of Qumran, the time of \"realized eschatology\" (see below, § 4). We will do no more than mention the motives which had prompted the secession of the Community. There was the evil spell hanging over the Temple through the presence ofthe wicked priest, who had ignobly and unlawfully usurped the priesthood, and who emiched himself through plundering.117 There was the basic disagreement about the calendar which, while it may appear secondary to us, nevertheless possessed a fundamental importance for the Community, since on it depended the synchronism between the celestial and the terrestrial liturgy, and thence 117 We referred above (note 86) to the exile ofthe high priest Onias IV, who built the temple of Leontopolis in Egypt. This temple may perhaps have been built by his own father, the high priest Onias III, if it is admitted that he was not assassinated but exiled hirnselfto Egypt. Ifthis is the case, then Onias III was removed frcrn his priestly office one year after the accession ofAntioclrus Epiphanes IV (175-1 64) because he was opposed to the latter's policy ofradical hellenization. The result was the combining of the royal and high-priestly offices in the person of Simon Maccabaeus (142- 1 35; cf I Mace. 14: 27-47). The Hasmonean dynasty thus became a dynasty of priest-kings \"until a prophet to come would manifest the divine will\" with regard to this situation. The situation was satisfactory with Simon Maccabaeus, but ceased to be so with his late successors. 313"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"THE IlvfAGO TEMPLI IN CONFRONTATION between the celestial Temple and the earthly Temple. Both in doctrine and in practice, this synchronism was essential and fundamental. There were \"Halachic\" disagreements. Finally, there was the question of the authenticity of the sacerdotal lineage, the lineage of the faithful Sons of Zadok, who had been dispossessed by the Hasmonean usurpers. Con­fronting these negatives was the Imago novi Templi, contemplated by Ezekiel in his visionary ecstasy, and of which the Qumran Community felt itself to be the realization. True, this new Temple's defining characteristic, then as now, was that it was not yet realized-not in a \"physical\" sense, for in any case its reality is perceived on the imaginal level of vision, but rather in the plastic sense of its architectural detail. This was because the Community of Qumran felt that it was itselfthe new Temple, in so far as this was a spiritual Temple whose institution inaugurated the new era. And this profound assurance was rooted in the spiritual hermeneutic as it was lived at Qumran: a hermeneu tic which simultaneously unveiled and realized the truth ofthe prophecies, for the Community was itselftheir culmination. Ezekiel's prophecy ofthe new Temple was being fulfilled in the Community of Qumran.118 2. The symbolism of the new Temple. The Qumran Community, having to confront the henceforth tarnished and desecrated second Temple from which it had cut itself off; was aware that it constituted, symbolically, the new Temple as a spiritual Temple.119 Miqdash adam: the translation \"human temple\" is already eloquent. The translation suggested by B. Gartner is more accurate: a \"temple ofmen\", that is to say, a temple \"consisting of men\". The Community, as the \"house of God\", bears the seal of eternity: the eternal Temple is henceforth in the process of realization within the Community. The sacrifices offered up in this \"temple\" which is constituted by the members ofthe Community are purely spiritual in nature, consisting in the strict observance o( and deepening penetration into, the hidden meaning of the Torah.120 It is, indeed, a symbolic Temple, by contrast with the \"material temple\" which the high priest Onias IV attempted to 118 Cf Shozo Fujita, op. cit., p. 259, note 1: the comparative plan ofthe structure of the new Temple as it is described in Ezekiel, and as it is actualized at Qumran in the fe eling of the Messianic Community. 119 Ibid., pp. 263 ff, the lengthy analysis ofthe document 4 Q F/orilegium. 120 Cf.

At Qumran, it is the spiritual Community itself which sees itself as the \"place\" or ideal of the Temple. The Imago Templi is being actively realized; the Community, therefore, as a spiritual or th eo­logical temple, is the \"new Temple\". Nevertheless, the idea of the \"spiritualization of the Temple\" must be given a precise meaning. The Community has no intention of breaking with the idea ofthe Temple and the worship celebrated in it. The \"spiri­tualization, consists in transferring the concrete entity-the Temple build­ing-to a spiritual kingdom-the Community-temple-and in replacing the sacrificial rituals by a form of worship that consists of a life spent in observance of the Torah and of a liturgy of hymns and psalms celebrated in conjunction with the celestial liturgy. Needless to say, the term \"spiri­tualization\" in no way implies the idea of a lesser degree of reality, of a temple less \"realistic\" than the Temple of Jerusalem.121 The opposite is true: the \"spiritual\" represents a degree of reality that is preeminent. Thus the idea of the Temple was never abandoned. On the contrary, it was reinforced by the idea ofthe regeneration ofthe Temple at the end oftime. Like the primitive Judaeo-Christian community, Qumran retained both the idea ofthe Temple and the longing fcr it.122 The question now arises: how did the Community intend to re alize, in its actual structure, its theological ideal of the \"new Temple\"? The two most important areas within the material Temple were the Holy ofHolies and the sanctuary. Within the new Temple, these are represented respec­tively by the \"sacerdotal circle\" and by the circle formed by the rest ofthe Community; and these two circles are typified by Aaron and Israel. The firm and sure foundation of the \"Temple constituted by men\" is the truth-that is to say, the understanding in depth ofthe Torah and ofthe Revelation to which the Community owes its existence.

The \"foundation\" laid by God-the rock-are the \"truths\" made known to the Community by the hermeneutic of the Torah. The \"tried stones\" on which the New Covenant is based are the members of the Community/23 fo r in purifYing the members ofthe Com­munity, the Holy Spirit confers on them an inner vision which penetrates into the mysteries of God. Again, in Ezekiel, regenerate Israel will sacrifice to God \"in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel\" (Ezek. 20:40, 40:2). Here the Community, in relation to the mountain-temple, is spoken of as a temple containing two areas, the Holy of Holies and the sanctuary, corresponding to the priests and the people, Aaron and Israel. Ezekiel's prophetic conception is actualized in the new Temple as an eschatological Community, the symbolic new Temple. In this way, the image of the true Israel rises to confront the official Israel. 124 We will have occasion later to see how the persistence of this same I mag a Templi is the source ofthe entire \"templar\" tradition at the heart of a Christianity which had ceased to be an eschatological community. In both instances, the norm ofthe Temple confronts the norms of a profaned and desacralized world. Most striking of all, perhaps, is the bond thus established between spiritual hermeneutics and spiritual worship. The former, as a new Revel­ation, puts the Community in a position in which it experiences itself as 123 Cf B.

To study the Torah is to prepare the way of Go d.126 This way can be understood in three senses: as the exodus from Jerusalem towards the desert of Judah (the place-names here acquire, typologically speaking, a permanent signi­ficance); perfect observance ofthe Torah; and preparation for the age to come.

In their tum, the Hebrew prophets received revelations from the Holy Spirit, clarifYing what had been revealed through Moses. In his own tum, the \"Teacher of Righteousness\" was the unique master who instructed the members of the Qumran Community in the divine truth. He was the \"final prophet\", 127 possessing a knowledge and a hermeneutic ofthe Revelation which were entirely new. Like EzekieL he combined three offices in his person: he was a priest of the line of Zadok, an inspired prophet, and a visionary of divine things.

The symbolism of the planting, the water, and the high mountain. This constel­lation of symbols is what really determines the \"Ezekelian\" character of the Community. By means of a tropological hermeneutic, the images of Ezekiel's vision actually become the active images in terms of which the Qumran Community represents itselfto itself. We have already alluded to the vision in Ezekiel (17:22-24) ofthe prince ofthe future city-temple as a \"young branch\" planted on the mountain of the Temple where the new Israel will flourish (cf. above, sections III and IV, A, 3). Hence the idea of the \"planting of righteousness\" or \"eternal planting\". The Community of Qumran, as the symbolic Temple, feels itselfto be this planting.132 The symbolism of the planting spontaneously evokes the symbolism of the water that nourishes the trees of life-that is, the Teacher of Righteousness and his disciples-and this Water issues from the \"fountain of Mystery\". The notion ofmystery encompasses all the things that man is unable to see unless God himselfre veals them to him . \"There is a cosmic mystery of God (Razi-el) , 133 a vast and profound secret that only the Teacher of Righteousness and his followers can at least recognize; and this knowledge or gnosis enables them to be the authentic lineal heirs ofthe \"planting of righteousness\". Their growth and prosperity are assured forever and without limit by the \"living Water\", that is to say, by the mystery. We have already observed in Ezekiel (47:1-12) the visionary image of the Water welling up from beneath the Temple threshold on the eastern side, swelling into a powerful torrent which flows through the desert to the sea. By this torrent the parched earth is made fertile; a dead sea is 130 Cf Shozo Fujita, op. cit., pp. 275-278. 131 A.

As the Angel, the visionary guide, measures it, it becomes too deep to be crossed. Similarly, a Qumran text says: \"And they [the springs] shall become an unleashed torrent over all the banks, and shall go down to the fathomless seas\" .134 The parallel is obvious. It indicates that the source ofthe torrent which fertilizes the parched earth is ultimately to be sought in the Temple. The Water that wells up from below the Temple threshold symbolizes the special revelation imparted to the \"Teacher of Righteousness\", and by means of this Water his Com­munity thrives like the \"Tree of Life\". It is from the symbolism of this Water, too, that the Community derives its sense of participation in God's \"eschatological programme\". This participation consists in the profound study and strict observance of the Torah, since this was \"to prepare the way ofGod\" (see above, the three meanings of such preparation), the Torah being precisely that which was symbolized by the Water-this Water that \"issues from beneath the threshold of the house\", that causes justice to flourish and transforms the land.135 We agree with Shozo Fujita in thinking that when the Community refers to the \"scroll hidden beneath the threshold\" and to \"the water that nourishes the plants in the dry land\", it associates both these concepts with the prophetic image of Ezekiel contemplating the Water whose source is in the Temple. They knew that they were those in whom this prophetic vision found its fulfilment, and that, as the symbolic temple, their Community was the source in which God's \"eschatological programme\" was initiated.136 But as we shall see later, the living within oneself of such a fulfilment of the prophecies is what was known as \"realized eschatology\". Finally, the symbolism of the high mountain, too, both proceeds from and nourishes the experiential sense of \"realized eschatology\".

Qumran will not become a high mountain some day in the future: it is already a high mountain in the spiritual sense, a mountain as high as heaven. When a text says: \"Thou [the Community] shalt be as an Angel ofthe Face for the glory of Elohim of hosts ... \", this corresponds strictly with the description of the celestial Temple and ofthe office ofthe Angels ofthe Presence in the Testament ofLevi 3:4----6 (see above)138 The Imago Templi is no longer a symbol referring to something beyond itself; it is realized in actuality, becomes the event itself (becomes, as we said above, not allegorical but tautegorical). As regards the synchronization of its divine service with the angelic liturgy, the Community is the place where eschatology is already and actively realized. 4. The celestial liturgy and realized eschatology. The connection indicated by this sub-title best illustrates the fundamental orientation of the members ofthe Qumran Community. Iftheir entire life is dominated by the Word of God, it is because they are truly \"existential interpreters of the Holy Scriptures\". 139 The features which characterize the life of the Community derive from its eschatological hermeneutic ofthe whole ofthe Old Testa­ment, and it is this lived hermeneutic which confers on the eschatological Community a permanent sacred status, an irreducible life-style. The Com­munity ofQumran lived the eschatological salvation as something already accomplished \"in the present\". The J ohannine community, as we will see later, did much the same. This mode ofbeing, it has been said, implies the fulfilment of \"five eschatological acts\": resurrection, new creation, com­munion with the Angels, final deliverance from the power of death, and anticipatory (\"proleptic\") transference to the holy Cityl40 This escha-137 Ibid., pp. 228, 290.

The \"five acts\" mentioned above were performed \"in the present\" in the liturgical congregation. Communion and liturgical companionship with the invisible Angels are an essential aspect of \"realized eschatology\": they testify to the fact that the restoration of Adam as a glorious celestial being among the other celestial beings is already accomplished141 The Qumran Community is not a multitudinary Church; it is \"the Tern ple\" , not the chosen people in the ethnic sense of the word, but the coming together and union of chosen individuals. Like Israel on Mount Sinai, the members ofthe Community live in a camp which is Qumran (cf. Exod. 19:2, 16-17), awaiting the manifestation of God's Glory. Because the Community is the living sanctuary, and thus the \"centre ofthe earth\", it marks the boundary between the sacred and the profane. It is the fortress which the sons of Light must defend through incessant combat against the attacks of the sons of Darkness.142 This com bat is an eschat­ological one, and is carried on side by side with the angelic powers, since all beings of Light are partners in the same struggle. Thus, angelology governs the life of Qumran: the Angels are present at the council, at the liturgy, and in the combat. This communion and companionship with the Angels characterize the Qumran Community-temple and its spirituality. The highest expression of this spirituality is to be found in an \"angelic liturgy\", of which the text, to the great dismay of researchers, has so far at least come down to us only in a fragmentary and mutilated form. Nevertheless, a fragment suffices to show how this ceremonial liturgy re-enacts each time the great moments of Ezekiel's vision of the divine Chariot (the Merkabah) Ezek., chapters 1-10). Even though the word Me rkabah does not appear in these chapters ofEzekiel, they have furnished the Jewish mystical tradition with its central image of the Throne which is like a chariot. And G. Scholem has no doubts about the Essene origin of Edward Aune, The Cultic Setting of Realized Eschatology in Early Christianity (Leiden, Brill, 1972), pp. 31 IT (abbrev. Cultic Setting). 141 Cf. ibid., pp. 41-42. 142 Cf.

It is thus possible to say that the theophanic vision described by Ezekiel (1-10) was lived actively, liturgically, by the Com­munity of Qumran, and that in this sense the worship it celebrated was truly a celestial liturgy. It is true that in Ezekiel the vision ofthe divine Chariot is not a prophecy. But the Qumran hermeneutic, by virtue of being an existential tropology, was able to confer a prophetic significance on the Ezekelian vision of the Chariot. 145 The resurrection, as \"realized eschatology\", is not a fact, which happens in history; it is the \"liturgical mystery\".

There is synchronicity-interpenetration-between the liturgy celebrated in the celestial Temple and that celebrated in the earthly Temple. 147 Another aspect of the \"angelic liturgy\" of Qumran is brought out by the importance of the seven archangelic Princes of the divine heptad. 148 \"The fourth among the Chief Princes shall bless in the name of the King's majesty all that waJk in uprightness with seven words of majesty, and he shall bless the foundations of majesty with seven matvellous words . . .

The same experience of a realized eschatology is found in the liturgy both of Qumran and of the 146 J. Strugnell, 'The Angelic Liturgy at Qumran', in Supplements to Vetus Testamentum, vol.

In this sense it is true to say that whoever lives in the Community ofthe sons ofLight is already living in the last times. The eschatological experience of communion and companionship with the Angels is accom­panied by a secret paradisal joy .150 It goes without saying that the Community of Qumran was thus fully aware of the presence of God's Spirit within itself Some have wondered whether one could go so far as to say that this possession ofthe Spirit was itself also experienced as an eschatological gift, and this is a theme of controversy among Qumran scholars.151 It seems to us, however, that in contrasting the Christian community, with its certitude of the fa it accompli, with the Community ofQumran looking ahead to an advent ofthe Spirit that will bestow a more integral form on the visitations ofYahveh, we fail to consider what is implied by the simultaneity of the jam (already) and the namium (not yet). Is Pentecost-the outpouring of the Spirit-afact accomplished once and for all, or is it afact which is still to come? The certainty that it is both past and to come is what has inspired all paracletic movements which could not accommodate themselves to the official Church, bogged down in History.152 Such a certainty is also a nostalgia, and these two together have prompted the recurrence and the persistence of the Imago Templi in the face of the institutions and dogmas of the official Church (see below, section VI). We would make a similar comment with respect to the question whether, when the Community asserts that it possesses an esoteric divine knowledge 149 D. E. AWle, op. cit., loc. cit.

We are familiar with the attempt made by present-day \"dialectic theology\" to \"detemporalize\" primitive Christian eschatology, but this is not what we are concerned with here. On the other hand, to affirm that the Qumran Community is the only one in which future eschatological salvation penetrates the present age, and then to go on to assert that the juxtaposition of future and present must itself be considered as determined and conditioned \"temporally and historically\", 154 is simply to relapse into historic ism.

We believe that here it would be fruitful to introduce an analysis of the temporality of time, such as we have elsewhere elicited from Shiite gnosis.155 It is as though our theological discussions in the West always stay on the level of \"dense and opaque time\" (z aman kathif), when we ought to be bringing into play, above all in this case, ideas cognate with subtle time {zaman lafJJ) and hyper-subtle time (z aman altaj).

It is one of the modes-and an exalted mode at that-of envisaging the presence of the final salvation.157 Once this realized eschatology is seen as essentially linked to the motif of Paradise and of the restoration of Adam, the Anthropos, to the state of Paradise, it has to be safeguarded by a conception of a time which is other than the time of History; for otherwise the motif in question will be relegated to the imaginary, and will not be stabilized on the level of the mundus imaginalis as a reality suigeneris in its own right: the reality in which the events ofhierohistory or \"subtle\" history take place. For all visionary events take place and have their place in the subtle time of this subtle history, whenever the invisible world, disclosing itselfto the seer, sets him in the company of the Angels. This is what happens in the great visionary scene that takes up the whole of chapter III of the Book of Zechariah. The high priest Joshua is defended from Satan by the Angel ofYahveh himself. The Angels remove his soiled clothes and clothe him in festal garments (3:4). And the Angel of Yahveh utters the solemn promise in the name of the Lord of hosts: the Temple ofJerusalem, rebuilt and purified, will once more be filled with the divine Presence. It will once more be the place filled with the company of Angels, because there is no gap, no hiatus between the celestial and the earthly Temples. \"Ecce enim adduco servum meum Orientem \" (3 :8). \"Ecce vir, Oriens nomen ejus et subter eum orietur et 156 A Jaubert, op. cit., p. 191. 157 D.

This very same expression is used to describe the com­panions of the psalmist of Qumran.159 There is a knowledge which man, through his communion with the Angels, is called upon to share. The Angels are the \"knowers\" par excellence. \"You have charged man with an eternal destiny in the company ofthe Spirits ofknowledge ..

The Angel's knowledge is knowledge of the Orient\" in the Orient\" of things, knowledge which is \"oriental\" in the metaphysical sense of the word: the cognitio matutina, a term whose exact equivalent is the 'ilm ishraqi found in Suhravardi, who resurrected the ancient Persian theos­ophy ofLight in Islamicized Iran. Oriens is the type of man realized by all the sons of Light. Naturally, the esoteric character of this knowledge or gnosis need not surprise us. It has long been known from the historian Josephus that the Essenes pledged themselves \"not to reveal the names of the Angels\", for this is one of the mysteries about which the initiate does not speak lightly in front of anyone. But this does not mean that, on the level of Qumran angelology, it is not fitting to note, as Annie Jaubert does so welL the expansive breath of cosmic communion which inspires the piety of the faithful. The word ecclesia is taken here, of course, in its etymological sense, connoting the idea of a liturgical assembly. It would therefore be simpler to say just \"the Temple\", since the union ofthe celestial and the terrestrial communities is, indeed, the Temple. Bearing this in mind, we can subscribe to the following lines: \"On entering into the covenant ofthe Community, which was by definition the Covenant of God, the new member was involved in an immense ecclesia, both of Angels and of men, of which it could perhaps be said without paradox that it was more celestial than earthly. It was the communion ofthe sons of Light, ofthe sons oftruth, of the \"Saints\", whether of heaven or of earth. Beyond was the world of darkness, where Belial and his troop of evil spirits exercised their perverse 158 What the Vulgate translates as Oriens is often translated as \"branch\".

Recent researches have demonstrated what there is in common as regards this experience between the Essene Community of Qumran and the primitive Johannine community, that which produced the Johannine corpus (see below, § 4). We must limit ourselves here to this latter theme. The questions raised would assume their full amplitude if we could refer in detail to the theology of the primitive Judaeo-Christian community of Jerusalem, the Church of James, of which the Ebionite community is the extension. We shall be able to allude to it only in passing; but the inquiry must in any case confront themes of formidable complexity, and it is most important to specify the terms in which these themes are being formulated: historical or phenomenological. We must confine ourselves here to the perspective within which we can hope to understand the recurrence of the hierophanies of the Imago Templi. The phenomenological relationships and affinities discernible, with re­gard to Temple symbolism, between the Qumran Community and the Johannine community, raise questions such as the following: 1. What is essentially common to the idea of the new Temple at Qumran and the same idea in the Johannine community, and what is the essential difference between them ? What essentially creates this difference? 2. What does this difference tell us about the experience of time and history? Has hierohistory been brought to a close?

Ifresurrection and eschatology are conceived and lived as located in the mysterium liturgicum, is it not clear that current conceptions of eschatology are inadequate? 3. On the other hand, is it not by grasping the common element in the eschatological experience ofthe Qumran andJohannine communities that the purposes and aims of all the paracletic movements which have arisen in the course ofthe history ofChristianity can be explained? And cannot the birth of the concept of the Ecclesia johannis as the third reign and Church of the Spirit be explained in the same way? Is there not an essential connec­tion between a mystery ofPentecost both already come to pass and not yet come to pass, jam and nondum? 4. Is it not with reference to the purpose common to the paracletic idea and to the recurrences ofthe Imago Templi that a response will be given to the twofold lament heard in the beginning, the lament sounded in the Talmud and the lament which, echoing in a solitary Pyrenean amphi­theatre, links the fate ofthe Temple with the fate ofthe Templar knight­hood? Here, in particular, the inquiry becomes the concern of phenom­enology. 2. The theology of the Temple and the theology of the Church. The primitive Christian community considered itselfas the inheritor ofthe divine prom­ises, as the ideal Israel confronting the Israel ofhistory. The discovery of the literature of Qumran has had the result-still unforeseeable thirty years ago--ofsetting us in the presence ofthe lofty spirituality ofa Jewish community which had a great deal in common with the milieu from which the prim itive Christian community emer ged. Each has its founder (for Qumran this was the \"Teacher of Righteousness\"), whose interpretation of the Scriptures is decisive for his community. Both communities have the same sense of eschatology. Both claim to be the true Israel. An important function is fulfilled in the thought ofboth communities by the same theme, that of the symbolism developed around the Temple. At Qumran and in the New Testament, this Temple symbolism involves three factors: a critique of the Temple of Jerusalem and of its sacrifices; the belief that the last days have begun; and the conviction of both communities that God dwells within it as he once dwelt within the Temple. Both have the sense ofbeing the community-temple.161 161 B. Gartner, The Temple, op. cit., pp. IX-X, 100. 329"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TEMPLI IN CONFRONTATION Having said this, we must note that, notwithstanding that they share the symbolism ofthe Temple, there is an essential difference between the two communities, namely, the fact of faith in Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God. The feature which distinguishes the symbolism of the Temple in the New Testament is that it is entirely dependent on faith in Jesus.162 The texts of Qumran represent the Community as being itself the new Temple. The canonical Gospels stress the replacing of the Temple by a person-by Jesus as the Messiah. St. Paul and the authors of the other Epistles do, it is true, re turn to the idea ofthe community, and represent the Church as the new Temple; but the idea ofthis community owes its existence to the person of Jesus and is based on him. 163 The innovation and difficulty arise precisely at the point at which there is a question of establishing the link between the pre-existing Christos and the person of the historical Jesus. On the one hand, Israel is God's first­born. There is the figure of the angel Metatron, of the \"Cherub on \"the Throne\", of the Son of Man, revealed and shown to Enoch as Enoch himself. But this revelation is effectuated through a celestial assumption, not through an earthly incarnation. On the other hand, there is the coming of the Messiah in the historic person of Jesus. Several centuries had to pass before Christian thought could stabilize its Christology. Here we will simply say that between the two extremes-the Community-temple ofQumran and the historical Christology ofthe Great Church-primitive Judaeo-Christian Christology represents something like a middle way: the Christo logy of Christos Angelos and of the Ve rus Propheta. 164 The fact that this was not the way followed by official Christology is doubtless the inner and decisive tragedy of Christianity, and is of great significance for our present inquiry. In effect the connection, established and lived, between the new Temple and the messianic conception is replaced by the connection between the new Temple and the Christology ofthe New Testament. The community­temple is transformed into a corpus mysticum, the idea of the mystical body of Christ, of which Christians are the mem hers. The two representations 162 Ibid., p. 101. 163 Ibid., p. 122. 164 Here, one should take into account all the conclusions to be derived from the researches ofM artin Werner, Die Entstehungdes christlichen Dogmas, 2nd edn.

It suffices to differentiate what one might call the spirit ofthe Temple from the spirit of the official Church, and to explain, in spite of the hiatus of its external history, the persistence over the centuries of a tradition of the Temple which has been sometimes latent and sometimes explicit. The norm ofthe Temple continues to inspire a theology of the Temple which sees itself as the esoteric aspect of the theology of the Church. This is what religious phenomenology may thematize as Christian esotericism and Templar tradition. These observations contain some elements of the reply to the first question raised above. 3. Is all .finished? Is it in fact enough simply to speak of two ecclesiologies, as though the Qumran image ofthe Community-temple, the place ofthe divine Presence, were the equivalent ofthe magisterium ofthe Church with its assertion of canonical possession of the potestas clavium? The answer can, it seems, be reached by considering how the experience of time is lived differently on both sides. For the Qumran Community, as we saw, resur­rection and eschatology are lived not as events occurring in History that has happened, but as a mysterium liturgicum, a celestial assumption. Lit­urgical time is reversible, and the events occurring in it do not belong to the historical time ofirreversible chronology. They occur at \"the meeting­place of the two seas\", where the celestial Temple and the earthly Temple conjoin. They belong to hierohistory, to \"subtle history\". One cannot make History out of the events of \"subtle history\" 165 These events are both already over and still to come, and their end is always expected: lived eschatology consists in being \"always in readiness\". This essential expec­tation excludes the possibility of time being finished, as it is finished according to the meaning assigned to Christ's death and resurrection by a Christianity that, no longer eschatological, has lapsed into History. In this case, the events are past: \"All is finished\". By the same token, the time of the Church, inaugurated after everything was accomplished, is the time ofHistory, of irreversible history. In this 165 Most theologians and critics omit to question the concept of \"history\" and accept it as a fait accompli. There is thus no way out ofthe impasse.

We believe that this, ultimately, is the essential difference not just between Qumran and Christianity, but between all Jewish theology of the Covenant and Christian theology\" .166 If the writer of these lines is right, the situation is serious, for it amounts to saying that the Jewish theology of the Covenant remains open to the future, while Christian theology is closed upon the past. These lines enable us, in fact, to grasp the moment when Christianity, having been essentially eschatological as the mysterium liturgicum, succumbed to the perils of History. If there is nothing left to expect, it means that hierohistory is over and done with, let us observe in passing that the denial of this ending to prophetic history or hierohistory is, likewise, all that differentiates Shiite Islam from Sunni Islam . Islamic prophetology inherited something from the Judaeo-Christian theology of the Ve rus Pro­pheta, but extends the manifestations ofthe latter up ti ll Muhammad, who then becomes the \"Seal of prophecy\". For Shiite gnosis, however, the closing of the cycle of prophecy marks the inauguration of the cycle of spiritual initiation. Something is left to expect, which is the appearance of the twelfth Imam. Ismaili gnosis, moreov er, goes as far as to challenge the closing ofthe cycle ofthe manifestations ofthe Ve rus Propheta.167 It is most important to note the analogy of the positions adopted here. There are those for whom the past is over. There are those for whom the past is still to come. For ifthere is no higher teaching to be expected, this means that the New Testam ent has no literal sense beyond which one can go; that it is complete, an accomplished and acquired revelation, which one has only to put to use. This would seem to exclude the idea itselfofChristian esoteri­cism, But, ifthis is the case, statements such as the following are incom­prehensible: \"Therefore speak I to them in parables\" (Matt. 13:13). 166 A. Jaubert, op . cit., p. 468. These lines provide a clear description ofthe situation as envisaged from the point of view of official Christology-Christology as it has prevailed \"in hi story\". But such a closure is exactly what our authors urge us to oppose and overcome. 167 Cf En Islam iranien, op . cit., vol. IV, index s.v. prophete, prophetologie, Verus Propheta. See also H.

There is, then, something to come: the events that will verify the prophetic meaning ofthese parables. We have already seen how all events, when they are elevated to \"the meeting-place of the two seas\", become parables. This was the line taken by the hermeneutics of the Joachimites, the followers of Joachim of Fiore.169 This elevation, however, is not possi ble without the inspiration of the Spirit-Paraclete. Must we then say that the mystery ofPentecost is defini­tively accomplished, or that it is both jam and nondum? Such a simultaneity is verifiable only in a time which is other than the time of the history of accomplished facts : the \"subtle time\" of the mysterium liturgicum. 170 The paracletic idea is quintessentially Johannine; and without it, there is no reason for the recurrences of the Imago Templi. These recurrences are connected, in one way or another, with the idea of the \"Church of John\" as the reign ofthe Spirit-Paraclete, the final reign which is already being lived \"in the present\". These are all elements of the reply to the second and third questions raised abov e, which will be completed in what follows. 4. Liturgical theophanies and christophanies. Herein lies the extreme importance of the researches demonstrating what there is in common between the lived eschatology of Qumran, on the one hand, and of the primitive Christian community-or, more precisely, ofthe \"Johannine community\"­on the other. The element common to both these communities is the escha­tological sense of the liturgical mystery. By the term \"J ohannine community\" is meant what several theologians have designated as the \"School of St. John\", 171 the milieu in which the theology and eschatology of the \"Gospel 168 Compare Isa. 6:9-10 (following the vision ofthe seraphim). 169 P. de Lubac, Exegese medievale, III, 459, sadly reproache s them for this hermen­eutic, which he regards as their fundamental error. The opposition could not be more clearly marked. 170 Cf. above, note 157.

Aune, op. cit., p. 63, note 3 (note: we always use the term \"Johannine \" fur everything deriving from the teaching that originated in the apostle John, and the term \"Johannite\" fur everything deriving from the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem). 333"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TEMPIJ IN CONFRONTATION according to St. John\" were developed in a context of worship, preaching and instruction. Such an eschatology is not a \"datum\" fitting into a system, but a vital affair offaith and relgious experience, whose outward expression is moulded by the modalities ofpiety and worship. This theo­logical expression of it derives from the piety and spirituality of the Johannine community, from its thought and its religious experience; and at the centre ofthe religious life is the worship, the liturgy.172 The different modes in which eschatological salvation was conceptual­ized as a phenomenon realized \"in the present\", in the experience both of the individual and of the community, were determined by the current forms of Christian piety and worship.173 As at Qumran, piety and worship in this case are those of an eschatological community. The experience of eschatological salvation \"in the present\" is a phenomenon which by its essence cannot be understood apart from the liturgical worship, and it is the latter which defines the community. Thus, eschatology and worship are ab initio inextricably intertwined. The celebration ofthe Last Supper, which was the central act ofthe li turgical community, was seen not only as the affirmation of events that had already occurred, but as the present anticipation of the eschatological consummation of the history of salva­tion.174 This anticipation, then, was essentially a liturgical mystery, ac­complished in a hierophanic time. Herein is revealed the phenomenologi­cal relationship between the writings of Qumran and J ohannine literature. We saw above (section V, 4) that this remarkable form of eschatology, \"presently realized\" in liturgical worship, implied, if not the presence of a gnostic component, at any rate a marked affinity with Jewish gnosis. This in it self implies that a Jewish gnosis existed before Christian gnosticism developed. For certain theologians, so-called \"heterodox\" Judaism is the background against which one can achieve a better understanding of the Gospel of John; a whole section, at any rate, of the Johannine community came from this background.175 Some theologians, referring to the vision of Isaiah (Isa. 6:1 ff.), go so far as to view Johannine mysticism as an offshoot of the mysticism of the Merkdbahl76 The vision anticipated by the book of 172 Ibid., pp. 9, 64. 174 Ibid., pp. 13, 16, 17. 175 Ibid., pp. 65-66. 173 Ibid., p. 8. 176 Peder Borgen, Bread from Heaven: An exegetical Study of the Concept of Manna in the Gospel of John and the Writings of Philo (Leiden, 1965), pp. 3, 147, quoted in ibid., p. 91. 334"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TEAJPLI IN CONFRONTATION the Ascension of isaiah presupposes a visionary ascension into heaven177 Likewise, the aim of the Gospel of John is not to preserve a historical memory of the earthly Jesus, 178 but to impart another \"history\" whose place and seat is the spiritual knowledge of the Johannine community. This \"history\" possesses a plenary reality in its own right, a reality which is certainly different from the outward history of events, but is no less real-is, rather, \"even more real\" than this outward history. The charac­teristics of the Johannine Jesus derive existentially from the activities­pneumatic, charismatic, prophetic-of the Johannine community. As a result, Christology determines eschatology, and eschatology becomes an aspect of Christology179 Johannine \"history\" is not divided into a series of periods and epochs, among which the period of the Church is qualitatively distinguished by the fact that it has been inaugurated by Jesus' earthly ministry. Jesus' true, eternal mission was not interrupted by his passion, death, resurrection and ascension; rather, these events together serve to broaden his ministry, to render it more effective, through the bestowal on the community of the gift of the Spirit-Paraclete, Jesus' Alter Ego. The limitations and particulars which characterize his historic mission are laid aside.180 These characteristics enable us to understand each event as originating in the mysterium liturgicum and lived \"in the present\" of liturgical time. Hence the phenomenological affinities between the \"liturgical visions\" of the Jewish prophets and the visions ofthe primitive Christian prophets,181 which are so many eschatological transpositions in the celestial kingdom. In Israelite worship, the theophany, the \"liturgical advent\" ofYahveh, was the central event in the divine office. In the divine office of the Johannine 177 D. E. Aune, op. cit., p. 91:John 8:56 assumes a similar visionary experience on the part of Abrah am . 178 Ibid., p. 67. 179 Ibid., pp. 84, 88. 180 Ibid., pp. 104- 105. 181 The vision of the sessio (of the Son of man) ad dexterum Dei can be understood with reference to two perspectives. Either the prophet and the liturgical community see themselves as transported to the celestial kingdom (Hymns of Qumran, Apocalypse of Paul, Odes of Solomon), or the prophet and the liturgical community see the obj ect of their vision as com ing to them (vision of Stephen, initial vision of the Apocalypse, the Johannine community at the time of the farewell speech). \"Re· gardless of precisely how the future is thought to be actualized in the present, the cult is the primary setting for that actualization.

In John 1:51, for example, 182 which is an independent fragment concluding the conversation with Nathaniel and alluding to the coming and going of the Angels between heaven and earth, the evangelist is not anticipating an event which is going to happen one distant day in the development of evangelical history. He is speaking of \"the sort of event that the Johannine community experienced spiritually (pneumatically) in the context ofthe worshipping community.\" In the context of the charismatic liturgy, the temporal boundaries between present and future are abolished, and the glories of the future eschatological state, conceived as a restoration of the primitive paradisal condition, \"are experienced as a reality in the present\" .183 In the same way that the Jewish mystics wished to experience a visio Dei by way ofanticipation,184 the Johannine community experienced a visio Christi in its celebration of the liturgical mystery. Here, theophany could only be Christo­phany. Thus the real question, as D. E. Aune, for example, posits it, cannot be one simply of acknowledging or of trying to reconcile or maintain a tension between the present and future elements; neither can it be one of superficial attempts to explain things by the supposed \"transformation\" of futurist eschatology into realized eschatology. Far from it: \"the solution to the problem (of Johannine eschatology) consists in determining the func­tion ofthis eschatology in the Johannine liturgical community, in deter­mining the significance assumed by it for this community in relation to its 182 \"Verily, verily, I say nnto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels ofGod ascending and descending upon the Son ofman\" (John 1:51). D. E. Aune, op. cit., pp. 96---97, recalls the exegeses ofthis which have been given. G. Quispel (quoted in ibid., p. 97, note 4) interprets this vision in terms ofa background of esoteric Judaism-of, that is to say, Merkahah mysticism. 183 Needless to say, all theophanic visions and visionary experiences presuppose the \"subtle body\" ofmystical anthropology as the organ whereby they are mediated. Cf Ode berg, The Fourth Gospel, cited in ibid., p. 101: \"In order to enter the highest heaven, the Celestial Realm, the ascending human being must change into fire, taking on a body oflight, or, as it is also expressed, put on garments oflight ... There is also in mystic notions from different times and places of origin a common idea of an inner, spiritual body, sometimes viewed as merely latent in earthly men ... sometimes as the conscious possession even during earthly life of the twice­born, who as a consequence are able to perceive and act both in the earthly world and the spiritual world.\" 184 Ibid., p. 99, note 1.

In the case both of the Community-temple of Qumran and of the Johannine com­munity, the certainty of the presence of the Spirit makes possible the experience ofrealized eschatology. Given the precedence ofthe mysterium liturgicum over all other considerations and interpretations, 186 the \"com­ings\" and \"returns\" of Jesus would appear to refer in the first place to the liturgical \"coming\" that recurs in the form of a visio Christi during the celebration of the liturgy \"in the Spirit\", as the Johannine community celebrated it.187 The comings anticipated in liturgically realized echatology were not, of course, mistaken for the final act, the Parousia or \"Second Coming\", which is the end of eschatology itself, of the eschatology that has already begun. But it seems to us that without this actualization in the present, the Parousia would never occur at all. The Johannine scheme of things remains open: all is not finished. \"He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do\" (John 14:12). Such a man will have traversed the initiatic way of the second birth (John 3, the conversation with Nicodemus). The promise ofthe coming ofthe Paraclete was not fulfilled in the past alone. The outpouring of the Paraclete, the mystery of Pentecost, is simultaneously jam et namium in \"subtle time ... This is why it is renewed 185 Ibid., p. 102. 186 Ibid., p. 127. Cf John 14:3, 18, 28.

In the perspective ofthe Paraclete, the three Abrahamic faiths can come together in the same city-temple. We have attempted to explain this elsewhere,189 and it is indicated by the persistence of the hierophanies of the Imago Templi. This brings us to the reply to the fourth question raised above. 5. Christian esotericism and the Templar tradition. At this stage of our enquiry we are faced with a decision regarding the process whereby eschatological Christianity became Christianity within History. Was it because of the delay ofthe Parousia, that is to say, because the awaited Parousia did not take place, that people ceased to expect it and began to make history, to be in History? Or was it because it ceased to be awaited that the Parousia was delayed indefinitely and in the end has not taken place at all? Here the phenomenologist effects a \"Copernican\" reversal of the question that confronts historians with regard to the transition from eschatological Christianity to historical Christianity-a transition that decided the fate of official Christianity for two millenia. For to go from \"subtle time\" to \"opaque time\" was to succumb to the temptation ofHistory. The time of prophets and ofprophetic visions was not within the time ofHistory. The Copernican reversal ofthe question is made necessary by the existential phenomenology ofthe Imago Templi that we are attempting to elucidate. Faced with a Church which had become a historical power and a society in the time ofthis world, the longing for the Temple is a longing for the \"place\" where, during the liturgical mystery and at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\", eschatology was realized in the present-a present which is not the limit of past and future in historical time, but the nunc of an eternal Presence. This \"realized eschatology\" was the restoration ofPa radise, the restoration of the human condition to its celestial status. The longing 188 The Quest ofthe Holy Grail, ed.

And it is in its broadest sense-that is to say, as implying some link or other with the recurrence of the Imago Templi-that one must grasp the recurrences of the word \"templars\" .190 The Community of Qumran felt itself to be the new Temple, felt itself to be involved, alongside the angelic powers that were invisibly present in its midst, in the fight ofthe sons of Light against the sons ofDarkness. This aspect ofthe Community makes it a perfect example of \"Templar knight­hood\". A previous example had been furnished by the companions of Zerubbabel when building the second Temple: they also confronted the demonic counter-powers. An affinity has rightly been shown to exist between the ethic of Qumran and that of Zoroastrian knighthood. Ormazd could not defend the ramparts of the city of Light without the help of the Fravartis. The ethic ofbattle is the same in both cases: it does not consist in waiting for an eschatological event that will take place later, on some distant day. The battle fought by the beings ofLight is eschatology itself in the process of being accomplished. This is the connection between eschatology \"in the present\" and the ethic ofknighthood, and hence the connection between eschatology \"in the present\", in the process of being accomplished, and the Ezekelian vision of the celestial Temple: the de­fenders ofthe holy City are defending an Imago Templi that embraces both the celestial and the earthly Temples, and connects heaven with earth. In this way, we do not deviate from our initial hermeneutic (see above, section II), according to which the destruction ofthe Temple signified our entry into this world, and its rebuilding signified our departure from exile, our return to the original world whence we came. Thus, an indissoluble connection is established between the Imago Tem­pli and a Templar knighthood in its multiple forms. The Imago Templi polarized the Western esoteric tradition, and this is also why the image of the Temple knighthood-of the Order of the Temple-remains indissol­ubly linked to the concept of initiatic knighthood. The \"history\" of it must therefore be the antidote to-the antithesis or 190 As serving to designate, in a broad sense, all those whom the tradition of the Imago Templi sees as the predecessors or the successors ofthe knights ofthe Temple-all those, that is to say, who in some sense are bound to the seiVi.ce ofthe Temple. 339"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"cmmter-history of-that History which, as we saw at the beginning, has been described as nothing less than the profanation of the sacred.

Going back to the symbol we used earlier (see above, section II), it is to conform to the norms that Pharoah wishes to impose on men. If History-profanation is no more than the decadence and corruption ofwhat was given to us originally, then we could say that in our day the disease has attained planetary dimensions.

Reference was made earlier to the symbol ofMoses saved from the waters ofHistory. To save in a similar way is the function of the Imago Templi. Given that this is so, the transition, since the time ofthe Montanist crisis, from eschatological Christianity­the Christology ofChristos Angelos-to a Christianity and a Christology within History, must surely strike us as fateful, a sign ofthe process of corruption. Does not this sign coincide with the refusal of gnosis? And is it not then the case that the secret oflsrael, the secret of the \"new Temple\", communicated impartially to all nations, is a sign that the difference between the \"Temple\" and the profane has been abolished? Unfortunately, all too frequently one hears people say that the Christian Revelation has no secret about it, nothing esoteric that needs interpretation. \"All is finished\", as we were reminded earlier. In accordance with this attitude these same people oppose the Christian revelation to gnosis and to the hermeneutic that accompanies gnosis. In compensation, we are told that the Christian mystery is unprofanable, because it requires one to be present at this mystery through the sacramental communion of faith. Any gnostic would see this contrast both as fragile and as painfully artificial, for it starts out by forgetting that in this same sense gnosis itself is also and par excellence unprofanable. It is not enough to hear the esoteric meaning uttered; it is necessary to be present at it through a new birth. Gnosis and palingenesis are inseparable, and this is also the sacramental sense of communion through gnosis. On the other hand, to separate the Christian Revelation from gnosis is precisely what lays the former open to profanation. The overwhelming desacralization that is occurring in our time gives us"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TEMPLI IN CONFRONTATION ample food for thought. A hostile attitude towards gnosis has led to f<ngetfulness or ignorance ofthe original relationship between the primitive Christian community at Jerusalem and Jewish gnosis . The same hostile attitude has inspired the statement that all Christian esotericism is doomed to defeat. Unfortunately, what we are witnessing today is the defeat to which we are condemned by the absence or the refusal of gnosis. Protesting and testifying against this absence, on the other hand, is the \\persistence ofthe Imago Templi and its connection with the notion of an inititiatic knighthood that is perpetuated from century to centucy, unknown to the majority of men. Exactly the same theme occurs in Islamic gnosis, both Shiite and Ismaili. 191 We must emphasize once again that our inquicy here is not ofthe sort that a historian would conduct. The transmissions effectuated by the Temple traditions are not supported by legal acts, registered documents, and so on. Here above all it is necessaty to proceed phenomenologically, allowing the traditions to tell us what they will, without losing sight of two things: i) These traditions can tell us, better than any archival document, what goes on at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\", at the place, that is, where all spiritual transmissions-which are not, of course, simply trans­missions of certificates or archives-realb; take place. 2) The moment the decision to filiate himself to a tradition becomes effective for a man of spiritual aspiration, the \"historic\" link between him and his predecessors is forged. He is their lawful heir and successor, whatever the chronological hiatus between them (we have frequently cited the case in point of Suhra­vardi, reviving the theosophical tradition of the sages of ancient Persia in Islarnicized Iran).192 This existential link is not \"historical\" in the current exoteric sense of the word, for it cannot leave any trace in any archive; but nonetheless it is formed once and forever in the time of \"subtle histocy\"­which could also be termed \"parahistory\", since it bears the same relation­ship to profane histocy as does the parable to all one-dimensional utterances. Ifthe phenomenologist has some difficulty in making himselfunderstood on this point by the historians, that is no reason for him to give up or to be discouraged!

The aspirations ofChristian esotericism were polarized in the historical Order of the Knights of the Tern ple, conceived as having been the seat ofthis esotericism. It goes without saying that the ancestry ofthis Order was the subject ofinquiry, and in this inquiry the significant aspiration is revealed. For this ancestry was always traced back to the Temple of Solomon through the Essene community and other related communities. This is why we had to start by noting the \"purposes\" (in the phenomenological sense ofthe word) ofthe Imago Templi from the representation of this Imago in Ezekiel's theology of the Temple down to its representation in the theology of the new Temple among the Essenes of Qumran. So much for the ancestry of the Imago Templi in the Templar tradition, considered a parte ante. At the same time, Christian esotericism could not consent to the de­struction ofthe Temple, and neither could it agree that Philip the Fair had succeeded in bringing his evil act to a successful conclusion. Its only possible response was a challenge, echoing the desperate cry ofthe Templar knights that we heard at the beginning, resounding through the solitary amphitheat re ofGavarnie. A parte post, the succession of the Temple, down to the resurgence of initiatic knighthood in the eighteenth century, was assured by a series of links, the very choice ofwhich increases our knowl­edge of the meaning and the \"purposes\" of the Imago Templi. This meaning and these purposes can still be perceived in the Temple ofthe Grail built by Titurel at Montsalvat, in Zacharias Werner's great dramatic poem, and in Swedenborg's Nova Hierosolyma. We Occidentals have been over-forgetful, perhaps, ofboth the meaning and the tradition. But it has seemed to me important to bear them in mind, because I have heard it said too often that we in the West were destined to obey the norms ofmaterialism and mechanization. 6. Templar filiation \"a parte ante '� Let us situate the sparse historical data of which we can be certain-those that establish us ab origine symboli, at the birthplace of the symbol--at the centre from which the traditions a parte ante and a parte post radiate outwards. To begin with, there is the epistle addressed by St. Bernard to the first knights who formed the \"Militia Crucifera Evangelica\"- Here the Temple of Solomon as the Temple of 342"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TEMPLI IN CONFRONTATION Wisdom is already seen as the outward symbol of the inner temple, to whose building their Order was thus pledged from the start. The Temple must first be built in the heart. This link, emphasizing the vocation ofthe knights as builders, at the same time validates the relationship of modern templarism to the original Templar knighthood. This validation stems essentially and above all from the fact that both exemplifY the same archetype, and that the \"modern Templars\" are no less the spiritual sons of St. Bernard than the Templars to whom he spoke ofthe Holy City and of the promise made at Zion. There are differences, of course, between the original Templars and, for example, the Templars ofthe Holy Grail (see below, section VII), but both share in the same heritage, constituted in the \"treasures of Heaven\" .193 Secondly, there is the monument erected in the ancient and sacred precinct ofthe Temple-the monument known as the \"Dome of the Rock\" (Qubbat al-sakhrah in Arabic), though often and wrongly as the \"Mosque of 'Umar\". This monument owes its name to the fact that it is situated exactly on the rock which, according to tradition and to the opinion of a good many scholars, used to be in the Holy of Holies of the old Temple. By an act of donation on the part of the king of Jerusalem, Baudoin II, the building became Templum Domini, the church of the knights Templar, who were henceforth associated indissolubly with the Temple through their name. The building forms a regular octagon surmounted by a dome, and was the prototype of the Templar churches built in Europe. The dome itself was the symbol of the Order and figured on the seal of the Grand Master.194 From that time on this symbol was to beparexcellence the Imago Templi, dominating the horizon of \"templarism\". The word \"templarism \" will be used here to denote the whole concourse ofthe hierophanies ofthe Imago Templi in Western consciousness-a concourse that phenomenology should analyse and contemplate while acknowledging at last the importance of this spiritual fa ct. It would be important to analyse what is expressed by the 193:J Arthur Edward Waite, A New Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry (A rs magna Laiomorum) (London, 1921), vol. II, p. 239 (abbrev.

What this tradition tells us is that the builder­knights are engaged in the same task as the builders of the first and second Temples. It testifies to the continuity of the endeavours that converge in the vision of the final Temple, the supra-natural Temple \"on the high mountain\" ofEzekiel's vision. It is for this reason that the building and rebuilding of the Temple postulate a continuing series of builders, who succeed each other not by means of archival transmission but through their common will. It is by virtue of this common will that they are the spontaneous heirs of each other and share the same secrets. This corre­sponds exactly to the idea of the continuing line of gnosis (s ilsilat al-'irfan) in the esoteric ism of Shiism, Ismailism, the Ishraq, and Sufism, as well as to the idea which is the very secret ofprophetology.195 The continuity is determined by heav enly inspiration, which brings together what is con­stantly being dispersed by the vicissitudes of this world. When these versions ofthe same tradition were put into written form­a tradition which is neither \"history\" nor \"myth\" nor \"romance\", in the sense assumed by these words in the dilemma by which historicism is imprisoned-nothing was yet known about the Essene Community of Qumran, although the Essenes themselves were known. What Templar tradition claims is precisely the heritage ofthe Essenes and, through them, of the Judaeo-Christian gnosis of the Church of Ja mes. This claim thereby implies that something is yet to come, that \"all is not finished\". We referred earlier to the Messianic perspective that dominates both the prim itive Judaeo-Christian community and the entire body of Jewish gnosis. The messengers of this future possess differing qualific ations, sometimes as hermits, sometimes as knights (as hermits and knights play the key roles in our own Grail cycle). In this way, the Traditio Templi in itself presupposes a tradition of Templar chivalry, of a spiritual and initiatic knighthood. Because the continuity of this tradition does not arise from an immanent historical causality, it can be expressed only in symbols. Those who transmit it are raised to the rank ofsymbolical personages, and the events whose protag­onists they are assume the status ofparables. There is an episode which would seem to situate us ab origine symboli, reported by the fifth-century 195 a En Islam iranien, op. cit., vol. IV, index s.v.

Some workmen descend, by means ofa long rope, to the bottom of a well. They discover that rising out of the water is a column, and that on the column is placed a book wrapped in a linen cloth. The workmen take the book up, and on examination it turns out to be a copy of the Gospel of John.197 It would be impossible to find a more concise and arresting symbol to express the link that connects the Temple of Solomon to Johannism in general, down to the Johannine temple of the Nova Hierosolyma. The expression ofthis continuity was the task ofthe transmitters, those known now as the Knights ofthe Morning and ofPalestine, now as the Brothers ofthe Thebaid, now as the Sons ofthe Valley, and so on. Their intervention is sometimes direct and sometimes through intermediaries, because their true dwelling-place, like that of the esoteric hierarchies in Shiism and Sufism, is not a country that we can locate on our maps. Very briefly, we will outline the versions of this Templar tradition a parte ante, previous, that is to say, to the Order of the knights of the Temple. According to this tradition, the latter are not the founders but the preservers, during an auspiciou s period (in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries), of an uninterrupted Templarism. A One version198 introduces the \"canons of the Holy Sepulchre\", established in Jerusalem after the conquest of the Holy Land by the Crusaders. These canons were the depositaries of the secret knowledge of 196 Philostorgius (died after 425 A.D.) had composed a work on ecclesiastical histocy in ten books, seen from the Arian point ofview.

It was their brotherhood which had restored the primitive Order after the destruction of the second Temple by Titus in 70 A.D. When Hugh de Payens and his eight comrades-at-arms were established on the site which had been that ofthe Temple, the canons, realizing that they had the same end in view, joined with them and initiated them into the esoteric sciences. In this way the primitive Order was restored under the name of the Order of Templars. When Jerusalem was reconquered by the \"Saracens\", the headquarters were transferred to Cyprus. The historic Templar Order here resembles an episode in secular Templarism; but this major episode connects the Jewish and the Christian periods of the Traditio Templil99 of the hiero­history of the Temple from the time of Solomon. B. Another version, which was current mainly in what went by the name ofthe \"chapter ofClermont\" in eighteenth-century France, is more specifically linked to alchemical symbolism and royal Art. Mter the Ba­bylonian captivity, Esdras \"was responsible for embedding a quadrangular stone in the foundations of the second Temple, a stone in which three hollows had been made. Each hollow contained a dish, and these three dishes (salt, sulphur, mercury) were the key to the great work\" .200 What then occurs constitutes one of the motifs that are at the source of the modern resurgence ofthe Templar tradition known as the \"Scottish rite\". In effect, between the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries, four Brothers who were originally from Scotland came to Jerusalem, succeeded in prising out the quadrangular stone, and took it back to Scotland. 201 In recognition of this service, the King ofScotland, David II, appointed them to be \"Knights of St. Andrew\". The heirs ofthe four Scottish masters were the Templars, three of whom, after the suppression of their Order (see below, § 7), confided their secret to the \"Knights of God and his Temple\" .202 The Historia Ordinis here postulates a periodicity ofhistory, analogous to the periodicity found in the Judaeo-Christian community and in Ismailism, 199 This schema corresponds to the \"Discours\" ofthe knight Andre Michel de Ramsay, the friend of Fenelon. 200 Le Forestier, op. cit., p. 86. 201 The rock on which the dome is built thus becomes the symbol par excellence ofthe alchemical work.

The period of Noah (the Order of Noachians). 3. The period ofNimrod. 4. The period encompassing the first and second Temples. 5. The period of the Templars, put in possession ofthe esoteric science by the teaching ofthe four Scottish masters. 6. The period of persecutions and of the destruction of the Order. 7. The period of the resurgence of the Order of the Tern ple in the eighteenth century. 203 Here again, we observe that the Templars had been formed as such because they had been entrusted with an exalted transcendental science, transmitted from sage to sage since the earliest times. C. The theme of a secret and superior authority, hidden behind the Order which is manifested in hi story, leads on to the idea ofthe knight­priests. This idea dominates the tradition ofthe Clerici Templi, systemati­cally expounded in the eighteenth century by the Lutheran pastor Johann August Starck, who had worked on a massive collection of documents. Here we re-encounter the equivalent of the canons ofthe Holy Sepulchre (version A), but this time they are called the \"canons ofthe Temple ofthe Lord\" (Canonici Templi Domini). They served in the church that was built on the ruins of the Temple of Solomon, and it was their prior, Am aldus, who had received the knights in the quarter conceded to them by the King of Jerusalem. The link between the knights of the Temple and the canons of the Temple was effective from then on. The latter had inherited the esoteric sciences of the Essenes through the intermediary of seven hermits, descendants, across the vicissitudes of successive transmissions, of the primitive Essene community.204 These hermits were the first people met by Hugh de Pay ens and his comrades. They preserved the tradition of a prophecy announcing that eternal Wisdom, Sophia aetema, would manifest herself once more \"in the ancient sanctuary of Jerusalem, when the 203 Ibid., pp. 88-90. 204 The role played by the seven hermits is reminiscent of the role ofthe seven ahdal in Islamic esotericism. These hierological data which emerge from \"subtle history\" refer us , such as they are, to the problem of the survival of the primitive Judaeo­Christian community of Jerusalem, the Church ofJames. What we now know, thanks to the Essene Community of Qumran, has given us a better understanding of what lay behind the claims to such a lineage. We would do well to ponder in this Sense on the great work by Hans Joachim Schoeps, Theologie und Geschichte des Judenchrislentums (Tubingen, 1949). 347"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"1HE IMAGO TEMPLI IN CONFRONTATION knights clothed in white come from beyond the seas to defend the holy City\". Thus the new hierophany of the Imago Templi was proclaimed: the light ofthe Shekhinah-ofthe divine Presence-would once more dwell in the Temple. All, hermits and knights, had found refuge in Jerusalem with the canons ofthe Temple. D. A fourth version takes the form of an epic of mystical knighthood, the \"Knights ofthe Morning and ofPalestine\". The name itselfis strikingly reminiscent of what is implied by the term Ishraq, the keystone of the doctrine expounded by Suhravardi, the twelfth-century \"resurrector ofthe theosophy ofLight professed by the sages of ancient Persia\". The Ishraq is the dawning, the orient of the light, and hence the \"oriental\" light. The Ishraqiyun, Suhravardi's followers in Iran, are the \"orientals\" who stand at the \"orient\" of the Light.205 Here, the Knights of the Morning and of Palestine are the most ancient knighthood in the world. They were scattered after the destruction ofthe second Temple, but they preserve their traditions, laws and liturgies in expectation of the event that will enable them to rebuild the Temple for the third time. The event seemed imminent during the time of the Crusades. The Knights of Palestine came out of their citadel, emerged from their retreat in the deserts of the Thebaid, and joined those oftheir brethren who had remained at Jerusalem in a state of vigilance. Their rel ations with these latter seem analogous to those which we shall find existing between the \"Sons ofthe Valley\" and the knights of the Temple (see below, section VIII), in which an invisible authority acts incognito through the intermediary of dramatispersonae who are the visible manifestation of its existence (an idea, as we saw, which closely resembles that ofthe esoteric hierarchy in Islamic gnosis). The Knights ofthe Morning were Essenes, healers, sons ofthe prophets and of Melchizedek, king of a supernatural Salem. Their brothers in Jerusalem were apparently a kind ofMilitia hermetica, who dedicated part oftheir quest to the realm ofNature.206 Their connection with the Tem­plars stems from the fact that they shared the same vision of the Imago 205 Cf En Islam iranien, op. cit., vol.

We have said that beneath the solemn appearance of defending the Holy Sepulchre, the knights Templar pursued a secret objective, which was none other than the rebuilding of the Temple of Jerusalem. This was also the purpose of the \"Thebaid Solitaries\", who were in possession of the mystical measurements ofthe first Temple. Thus they were all \"knights of the Temple\", whose secret purpose was to have been achieved amidst the architectural splendour of a restored Jerusalem and of a sanctuary renewed under the aegis of a gnostic Christianity207 (see below, section VII, the icmple ofthe Grail). This version ofthe tradition also expresses therefore the sense of a theosophia perennis; those who testify to it have in common the idea of the restoration of the Temple, and regard themselves as the spiritual descendents ofthe Essene community. E. A fifth version expresses the same idea. This is the version of the \"Twelve Chosen Masters\" :208 twelve Masters who, after the completion of the first Temple, formed a separate fraternity, governed by one of them­selves, and were chosen in person to be the Temple guard.209 Their Order managed to hold out until about the year 70 A.D., after which it lapses into obscurity. Some of them had embraced Christianity,210 and it was their descendents who, in the twelfth century, joined with the knights of the Temple and with the knights of the sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem in pursuit of the same objective, which was to establish a Christian Temple modelled on the Temple of Solomon. This is the essential thing to bear in mind in our phenomenology of the Imago Templi: the intention to rebuild the Temple ofJerusalem was common both to the knights Templar and to the mystical brotherhoods, variously designated is the Brothers ofthe Thebaid desert, the Knights ofthe Morning and of Palestine, and so on.

This is doubtless the clue to what is meant by the longing for the Temple in the face ofthe tragedy ofhistorical Christianity. To grasp the full significance ofthe claim to Essene descent, one must recognize behind it the presenti­ment of a Christianity that vanished too soon from external history, a presentiment that cannot capitulate before the violence of such history. After the death in 62 or 66 A.D. of James, first bishop of Jerusalem and the first \"bishop of bishops\", the Judaeo-Christian community, warned by an Angel, emigrated to Pella on the other bank of the Jordan. It thus escaped the torments of the siege that ended in the destruction of the Temple in 70 A.D., and it survived as the community of\"Ebionites\" until the fourth century. Meanwhile, however, a new Christianity began to gain ground, a Christianity so \"different\" that the doctrine and gnosis professed by the first apostolic community of Jerusalem, founded by the very people who had been Christ's companions, were described and reputed by the \"fathers of the Church\" to be an abominable \"heresy\".211 It is one ofthose mortal paradoxes which receive too little attention. For this reason, the longing for the Temple which is expressed in the traditio Templi and arrogates a line of descent for the Templar knighthood that goes back through the Essenes to the primitive Judaeo-Christian community, configurates a history that is \"more true\" than the official history of external facts. It is so much \"truer\" that it leads to the affirmation of an Ecclesia Johannis in opposition to the Ecclesia Petri, when this Church of Peter quite simply did not exist in the time of the Church of James. The phenomenologist's task is now to discover a counter-history \"more true than history in the evidence a parte post of the Templar tradition­evidence that confirms the secret survival ofthe Order ofthe Temple until its resurgence. 7. Templar filiation \"a parte post': As in the preceding case, we will note some historical traces ofthis secret survival after the official destruction of the Order of the Temple (the Grand Master Jacques de Molay died on March 18, 1314). We know that the Order of the Temple survived in Portugal as the Order of Christ. Traces of its survival are also found in Germany, mediated by the knights of St. Mary of Jerusalem, otherwise 211 On this paradox, cf Hans Joachim Schoeps, op. cit., p. 342. 350"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"1HE IMAGO TEMPU IN CONFRONTATION known as the Teutonic knights; this would explain the rapid success ofthe \"Strict Templar Observance\" in the eighteenth century.212 And there are the even more specific traces to be found in Britain.213 But our phenomen­ology of the Imago Templi aims essentially at authenticating different evidence, on the level proper to it. The role assigned to the four Scottish masters, mentioned above (version B), already indicates the importance of the \"Scottish rite\" in perpetuating the Templar tradition. It would be difficult to grasp its importance a pane post without bearing in mind its significance a parte ante, because the primitive Scottish rite paved the way for the role of the Scottish knighthood in the survival ofthe Temple. Its survival, assured by this knighthood, made possible the resurgence ofthe spiritual initiatic chivalry, the \"Scottish rite\", in the eighteenth century. The primitive Celtic Church, prior to Romanization, is represented by groups of monks known as Culdees (cf the German Kuldeertum) .214 The origin ofthis name is the Irish ceile de, ofwhich the Latin equivalent was Coli Dei, Deicolae, that is to say, men of God: viri Dei, amici Dei. 215 The groups of companions called by this name seem, moreover, to have played a much large r role in Scotland than in Ireland. We gather from the documents that these companions combine the features both of secular clerks and ofhermits or anchorites, finally appearing as Canons Regular (similar to the Canonici Ordinis Templarii ofversion C above). Assuredly, these autonomous groups ofhermit brothers correspond to what we know of the original structure ofthe Celtic Church-a structure, unfortunately, which did not place it in a powerful enough position to resist the Romaniz­ation ofthe twelfth century. What is important here for our phenomenology of the Imago Templi is that these Coli Dei had a role to play on the Celtic side analogous to the role attributed on the eastern side, as we saw above, to the canons of the Holy Sepulchre, the spiritual descendents of the 212 Cf.

The appeal to a distant Celto-Scottish filiation parallels the appeal made to affiliation with the builders of the Temple of Solomon and the community of Jerusalem.

The Coli Dei are als o included in the spiritual line of descent from the builders ofthe Temple ofSolomon, the line ofthe Essenes, the gnostics, even the Manichaeans and the Ismailis.216 They were established at York in England, at Iona in Scotland, in Wales, and in Ireland; their favourite symbol was the dove, the feminine symbol of the Holy Spirit.

But it is equally possible to see it as a deformation of the Hebrew word Harodim that desifnates the officers, the foremen of wotks in the building of the Temple.21 The Order of the Temple was first introduced into Scotland by King David I in the middle of the twelfth century.220 The royal Order ofHeredom ofKilwinning, or \"Royal Order ofScotland\", was revived in 1314 by King Robert I, the Bruce, and this 216 Waite, Encyclopaedia, I, pp. 161-165;Emblematic, p. 66. 217 Waite, Encyclopaedia, I, pp. 198---201. 218 Ibid., I, pp. 347-348 . 219 Ibid., I, pp. 344-345.

It has also been suggested that the word Heredom consists of a suffix, \"dom \" (=hood, ship) appended to the word \"Here\" (or \"Her\"), derived frcm the Latin herus (master, chief; guide). If this were so, \"Heredom of Ki1winning\" would mean \"knighthood of Ki1winning\". Cf R. S.

As was the case with the filiation a parte ante, there are several versions ofthe Templar filiation aparte post222 A The provincial Grand Master of Auvergne, Pierre d'Aumont, suc­ceeded in taking refuge in Scotland with a few ofhis knights. They helped King Robert the Bruce win the victory of Bannockburn in 1314, which made Scotland independent of England. In gratitude, the King restored the Royal Order of Scotland and affiliated the Templars to it. The Order continues to exist today. B. After putting up a valiant defence in some castles of the Order, Pierre d'Aumont had to flee his Province in the company of two com­manders and seven knights, ten people in all. In order to escape recognition, they disguised themselves as masons. They finally found refuge in the island of Mull to the north of Scotland, where they met George Harris, grand commander ofHampton Court. Aumont was elected Grand Master in 1312 by the brothers who had taken refuge on the island.223 C. The version of filiation through the count of Beaujeu, nephew of Jacques de Molay, differs from the preceding versions, maintained in the eighteenth century by the \"Strict Templar Observance\". It forms the Swedish version ofthe Templar filiation, substituting Sweden for Scotland as the place where the secrets of the Temple were guarded. However, a variant of it exists which is interesting in that it links the names of Beaujeu and Aumont. On the instructions of his uncle, Jacques de Molay, Beaujeu-together with nine knights (making ten people in all, as above)-managed to save the secrets ofthe Order: the annals and secret papers, the crown of the kings of Jerusalem, the seven-branched gold candlestick, the exalted knowledge. These treasures were deposited in Cyprus, in the care of the canons of the Holy Sepulchre (see above, § 6, version A), who were still living there in the greatest secrecy.

There is the version known as that of Eliphas Levi: before his death, Jacques de Molay organized and established an esoteric structure. He erected four metropolitan lodges: Naples fo r the east, Edinburgh for the west, Stockholm fur the north, and Paris for the south. E. There is a version which is quite unrelated to the preceding versions and unassociated with the Scottish tradition, according to which the successor named by Jacques de Molay was Johannes Marcus Larmenius of Jerusalem, who in tum was succeeded by his son, Franciscus Thomas Theobaldus Alexandrinus, and then by a whole series of Grand Masters.225 F.

Independent mention must be made ofthe Order which still exists in England, and which goes by the name of \"Military and Religious Order ofthe Temple and Holy Sepulchre\".227 As in the case ofthe Royal Order ofScotland, this is no honorary title, but denotes a spiritual and initiatic knighthood. We can do no more than recall here the action of Jean-Baptiste Willer­moz, in Lyons during the eighteenth century, whose objective was to establish an \"inner Order\", separate fiu:n the \"Strict Templar Observance\" in Germany. Willermoz' intuition was profound, and is in accordance with what is presupposed by the filiation ofthe Order of the Temple aparte ante. As we observed, this filiation, while constituting the strength ofthe Order ofthe Temple, establishes this Order as a single phase in a per­manent Templar tradition. This was also to be the theme of Zacharias Werner's great dramatic poem (see below, section VIII). There was thus no need to restore in a material sense the historic Order of the Temple, as many wished to do. What was needed was to affirm one's spiritual descent by taking one's place in the tradition that the Order had made its own in 224 Ibid., p. 69. 225 Ibid., p. 944.

Will ermoz professed a profowd spiritual­ity which was centred on the Imago Templi. In this sense his \"instructions\" are worthy oflong study, as a textbook ofTemple spirituality.229 They lead to an interiorization that could profitably be compared to Philo's and to that ofsome ofthe masters mentioned above. The ideal ofthe spiritual Templar chivahy had already been admirably formulated by the Chapter of Clermont: \"Eques et frater hierosolymitanus scientiis divinis elatis maximam operam dare debet, ut in dies magis magisque luce mirifica et illuminationum divinarum scintillis incendatur et inflammetur.\" 1bis is how it would be \"until the day when the Order of the Temple retook possession of Jerusalem, thus making possible the rediscovery, in one of the caves of the Holy Mountain, of the store of integral esoteric knowledge\".230 We should at this point consider the Imago Templi in Goethe-both in the unfinished poem entitled Die Geheimnisse (the Mysteries), which is about twelve Rosicrucian knights, and in the \"Tale of the Green Serpent\". The first we have written about elsewhere. In referring later on to Mon­tserrat, Goethe himself pointed out the way which leads to Montsalvat and to the Temple ofthe Grail.231 Proceeding along this way, we come to the meeting-point of Celtism and Templarism, ofCeltic tradition or hierology and Hierosolymite tra­dition or hierology (see above), within the perspective of the \"1bird Temple\". The motifofthe three temples dominates Templarism from the Ezekelian theology ofthe Temple onwards (see above, section III). The first two Temples, that of Solomon and that of Zerubbabel, were still built 228 On the assemblies ofLyons and of Wilhelmsbad, see Le Forestier, op. cit., pp. 476 ff, 610 :fE 229 The complete text ofthem has been published by A Faivre as an appendix to his edition of the work by Le Forestier, op. cit., pp. 1021-1 049. 230 Quoted by Le Forestier, ibid., p. 94, who remains completely oblivious both to the beauty and to the implication ofthese texts, whatever the place and time of their origin. In them the motif of the mystical Mountain reappears, as in Ezekiel's vision of the final Temple. We are not concerned here with historical or material verification, but with stgns and inter-signs, as it were. One cannot but remember that it was precisely in the grottos and caves of the desert of Judaea that the \"scrolls\" ofthe Qumran Comrrrunity were fo l.D1d, without which our pren001enology of the Im ago Templi would not attain the meaning to which it aspires . 231 a: En Islam iranien, op. cit., vol.

What it requires is a knighthood dedicated to its service. Celtism and Templarism come together: in Wolfram's \"Titurel\", the Temple is conceived and the building of it is directed by Merlin, the Celtic prophet, who was initiated by Joseph of Aramithea into the mystical measurements ofthe temple-archetype, the Temple ofSolomon. In the \"New Titurel\" by Albrecht von Scharfenberg, the architectural splendour ofthe Temple of the Holy Grail on the summit of Montsalvat bestows on us a fleeting vision of the Temple in Heaven. VII. The Temple and the Templars of the Grail For several generations, treasures of philolo gical erudition have been expended in \"explaining\" the different aspects of the cycle of the Holy Grail. Unfortunately, no more than the indecent virtuosity ofpsychoanalysis is the method of literary historicism equal to the task that confronts us here. One would wish that, like the Bible, the entire cycle of the Grail poems could be read by \"believers\" not as a corpus but as the \"Bible of the Holy Grail\"-read as the Bible was read by such as Philo, Origen or Swedenborg. There are many people who have not seen, or do not wish to see, that the Bible has any esoteric meaning at all. Nevertheless, over the centuries this esoteric meaning, in all its aspects, has impressed itself on the reading ofthose who have known how to read. We will not take up the argument here, particularly since the argument between \"those who see\" and \"those who do not see\" cannot be resolved. A hermeneutic of the Grail which would coordinate and systematize the data of the corpus from beginning to end is a task which has yet to be undertaken. Here our only concern is with the Imago Templi. With what features is the Temple ofthe Grail presented to us? For the sake of simplicity, let us say that the clearest description of the Temple, as the Castle ofthe Grail or Gralsburg, is given in the Germanic corpus of the \"Grail Bible\". In this corpus, the founder of the dynasty of the guardians of the Grail is King Titurel. The Temple is to be his creation. We referred above to the \"Titurel\" by Wolfram von Eschenbach; in his 356"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"THE llv£A GO TEMPU IN CONFRONTATION \"Parzifal\", express mention is made ofthe Temple ofthe Graif32 on the occasion of the baptism of Feirefis, the pagan half-brother of Parsifal.233 Up to this point (Book V for example), it is merely a question of the dwelling-place or house of the Grail, the castle-t emple as it were. And it is only in Albrecht von Scharfenberg's \"New Titurel\" (DerJunge Titurel), between 1260 and 1270, that the Imago Templi rises in all its architectural magnificence. (This great epic consists of 6,000 stanzas of 7 verses each, or 42,000 verses. No translation of it has yet been made, even into modern German.)234 In it, the cycle ofthe Grail is developed into an epic ofthe Temple, whose climax is attained between the Temple of Solomon on Mount Moriah and the heavenly Jerusalem. The entire theology and spirituality of the Temple also attain one of their crowning-points on the heights ofMontsalvat, the support of a hierophany which is the Temple of the Grail. Indeed, the teachings ofTiturel amount to an entire theology of the Temple, as complete as the theology of Qumran and other elected places. This theology culminates in an eschatology that finally confers its full meaning on the knighthood ofthe Templars ofthe Grail in relation to the knighthood ofthe historical Templars. There is the description ofthe Temple; there are its correspondences; and lastly there is the theology of the Temple ofthe Grail. I. The description of the Temple of the Holy Grail.

Lars-Ivar Ringbom in his great work, Graltempel und Parodies: Beziehungen zvoischen Iran und Europa im .Mittelalter (Stockholm, 1951; abbr. Graltempel), had already made full use of Albrecht's epic. His researches embrace all the prototypes, imitations and parallels of the Temple, fran West to East, and he lays particular emphasis on the affinity between the \"Burg\" of the Persian Sassanids and the Gralsburg. The material employed is considerable.

Here he decides to found a temple for the Grail. 237 Up to this moment, in fact, the Temple has not yet been established at any definite place, but floats between heav en and earth, held up invisibly by the Angels. The building incorporates all kinds of precious stones. Gold predominates, and the furniture is of aloe wood. The stones are chosen according to the standards ofPythagorean art and the science ofHeraclius.238 The rock of the mountain is onyx. When all the grass and earth are removed, the onyx surface shines as brilliantly as the Moon. One morning, there appears on this surface the complete plan ofthe Temple, projected from heaven. The plateau itself forms a base two toises thick.239 Between the edge of the plateau and the Temple wall, there is a space five toises wide all around. Vertically, the building forms a high dome, supported by columns of bronze. It is completely covered with gold and precious stones, whose inner significance will be discussed later on. The windows are surrounded by beryl and luminous crystals . The panes are coloured or encrusted with precious stones, and dim the brilliance of the light. The roof is also of gold, encrusted with precious stones so that its glare should not blind the eye. The Temple of the Grail was built with the help of Heaven, like the Temple of Solomon, Templum Throni Dei, in Jerusalem, the stones for which were brought to the site already cut, so that no displeasing sound of hammer or chisel should be heard during the building ofthe Temple. The same goes for the builders of the Temple of Titurel: everything was sent to them by the Grail. The high central dome is covered with sapphire, representing the celes­tial dome in all its azure brilliance. It is studded with carbuncles which sparkle in the darkness of the night like stars. It contains an image of the 235 L.-1.

Golden cymbals herald the succession ofthe days. The entire Temple forms a vast, high rotunda, divided into a number of chancels, each of which projects towards the outside. Some manuscripts give the number of chancels as seventy-two; others give it as twenty-two. We must again remember that both figures have their arithmosophical significance and can in no way be opposed to each other. To object to the gigantic proportions of the building with seventy-two chancels would be to forget that the Temple of the Grail is located at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\", on the \"Earth of Light\" , and not in the world where the laws of physics prevail. In each chancel, the altar is orientated, that is to say, turned towards the East. The main chancel is also turned towards the East, and is double the measurement of the others (in the version of the twenty-two chancels, we thus have a total of22 + 2, or 12 X 2 = 24); it surpasses the others in sumptuousness, and is consecrated to the Holy Spirit. The one immediately beside it is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, that is to say to eternal Sophia. The third chancel is consecrated to St. John. The chancels that follow are dedicated to each of the other eleven apostles. The four evangelists are represented by four statues of Angels, whose high, widespread wings direct attention to the celestial Throne. Three portals give access to the Temple, one to the west, one to the south, and one to the north. Above the western portal is an organ of extraordinary construction and power. Finally, at the centre of the rotunda is the Holy of Holies, a small building which, like a microcosm, reproduces the entire structure of the great Tern ple, except that instead of several chancels, it has a single altar. The towers flanking the great Temple on the outside are here replaced by ciboria holding images of the saints. In this Holy of Holies the Grail is kept, floating in suspension, so that the space below forms a large sacrarium. The architectural relationship between the great Temple and this micro­cosm is the perfect figure of the relationship between the outer and inner Temples in man as a microcosm . A meditation which interiorizes the vision of the Temple built by Titurel bestows on it its perfect mystical significance, and another relationship, which reduplicates this Temple, corresponds to it.

As we will suggest below, there may be a profound esoteric meaning in the disappearance ofthe Templar churches, built in the form of a rotunda, and in the ascendancy of the semi-rotunda of a chancel opening onto the rectangle of a basilica. 240 2. The correspondences. As conceived by Titurel, the Temple ofthe Grail is the image ofthe cosmic Temple.241 There are three zones: intermediary, lower and upper, a) The intermediary zone is formed by the twenty-two ( + 2 = 24) and the seventy-two chancels. There are artificial trees filled with Angels and birds; the ground is covered with a forest of flowers, lilies and roses; the walls sparkle with the green of emeralds. The whole rotunda has the appearance of an enchanted garden, a transfigured Earth, an earthly Paradise, b) The lower zone is beneath the tiles which are crystal-plated, transparent as water. In this crystal sea, fishes and other creatures are made to move by an ingenious mechanism, c) The upper zone corresponds to the dome covered in sapphire, which represents the dome ofheav en and its constellation s. The Temple is thus the living representation of the cosmos: sky, earth and water. As in the preceding cases (see above, section III ff.), the Temple can be seen here as the link between the celestial, the terrestrial and the sub-terrestrial. As such, the Temple ofthe Grail is a sanctuary situated at the centre ofthe world, and Montsalvat is the mountain at the centre ofthe world.242 As we saw, Albrecht von Scharfenberg does not fail to refer to the Temple of Solomon. This he does not because there is an architectural correspondence between the two Temples-the Temple of Solomon was not the architectural archetype of the Tern ple of the Grail-but because he saw that the two Temples are the equivalents of each other.243 The Temple of Solomon had been built as a dwelling-place for the Shekhinah for the divine Presence. The Temple ofTiturel was built as the dwelling-240 a Ringbom, op. cit., pp. 50 ff. 241 Ibid., p. 58. 242 Ibid., p. 247.

Shiz (where the German archaeological mission has made some very important excavations during the last rew years) is now called Takht-i SulaymCD'l (throne or temple of Solomon).

This may point to an aspect of the nature of the Grail which is worth reflecting on. The Temple of the Grail is not a building of ecclesiastical inspiration or finality. It is not a church among the other churches of Christianity. Likewise, the Grail cycle, whether its origin lies in the person of Titurel or in that of Joseph of Aramithea-the first Christian bishop-appears to know nothing of the Roman hierarchy. The Grail Temple is the realization, in the New Testament cycle, of the Temple corresponding to the building constructed by Solomon in the Old Testament cycle. This is why both Temples were built with the same direct divine assistance. This being the case, it is here appropriate to reflect on the functional convergences between the rotunda of the Grail Temple and the building already mentioned (see above, section VI, 6), known as the \"Dome ofthe Rock\" (Qubbat al-sakhrah). This latter is supposed to be built on the site of the Holy ofHolies in the Temple of Solomon, and it figures on the ancient seals of the Knights Templar. Its plan (the rotunda surrounded by an octagon) is the prototype of certain Templar churches, and the figure of the ideal sanctuary in the kingdom of a Christian Solomon. Yet, because of its origin, the building also appears as the sanctuary in the kingdom of an Islamic Solomon. The sacred rock has a function here which is homolo­gous to that of the Black Stone in the Temple of the Ka 'bah The building is as it were a temple-reliquary, and the relic it preserves is this rock itself as umbilicus Terrae, the starting-point of all Creation and the site of the Holy of Holies.244 The Imago Templi can be seen as the meeting-place of the great families of the Abrahamic tradition, of all the \"communities of the Book\" {A hl al-Kitab). This convergence should be studied with the guidance ofthe vision of another temple, with reference to which the last chapter of the \"New Titurel\" says that it can be compared only with the Temple ofthe Grail. This miracle of architecture is the Palatine chapel in the land of the mysterious Prester John, an \"Orient\" that we would seek in vain to find on our maps, as literalist researchers have always been tempted to do. To this \"Orient\", mystical land of Prester John, Titurel and Parsifal were ultimately to transfer the Holy Grail, hidden from that time on from mortal eyes, like the Temple itself which heralded the heavenly Jerusalem. 244 Ibid., pp. 203-2(6 See also my stud_y on 'The ConfJgUrntion of the Temple of the Ka'bah', published above, pp. 235 ff."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Let us ascertain, at least, the direction in which the Quest of the Grail is to be pursued, and hence the meaning ofthe vocation ofTiturel, builder of the Temple. It is through him that the transition from the Temple of Solomon to the heavenly Jerusalem of John's vision is consummated. The geste ofTiturel is inseparable from the geste of the builders of the first and second Temples, Hiram and Zerubbabel,just as the three hierophanies of the Imago Templi are inseparable one from the other: the Temple of Solomon, the Temple of the Grail, and the Johannine Temple which is the heavenly Jerusal em. They are inseparable because each of them has reference ultimately to the spiritual temple, the \"inner Church\", the Ecclesialohannis. Such also is the entire theology ofthe Temple ofthe Grail. 3. The theology of the Temple of the GraiL The interpretation of the Grail Temple is provided by Titurel himself in his great \"speech from the Throne\"/45 where he reveals his doctrine ofthe Temple. The speech is addressed to the young, so that they may put themselves at the service of the Spirit with the virtue demanded by the Grail. True, the interpretation that the poet, Albrecht von Schatfenberg, gives through the mouth of Titurel is not exhaustive; it is essentially concerned with the theological aspect, but it leaves the way open for subsequent interpretations. 246 What strikes one initially is the age of Titurel. The poet gives it as four hundred years, yet he radiates the beauty, vigour and youth of a man of thirty. The secret ofthis youthfulness is Titurel's identification with his Temple: every man is always as old as his temple. The start of the construction of the Temple signalled a second birth for Titurel, a dies nata/is on a higher level of being. The thirty years it took to build the Temple will be his age forever, the perpetual flowering of his youth. This is the norm of the Temple (cf the lines by Vladimir Maximov which serve as the epigraph to this book). The second thing that strikes us, coming before the great explanation of the Temple, is the importance assigned to the role of the archangel Michael. On the one hand, there is the evocation of the angelic cohorts 245 ���as 510-586.. Gurlnla. Trendelenburg,.9P ..... cit.

On the other hand, there is presented, as an aftetword so to speak, the image of the archangel l'vlichael as he whose fimction is the \"weighing ofsouls\".247 Just as the Qumran Community sensed in its midst the invisible presence of angelic powers, at whose side it waged war against the sons ofDarkness, so the Templars of the Grail partner the celestial militia. In the thirtieth year of its construc­tion, the Imago Templi leads the entry into battle. The weighing-up of what has been gained in the course of battle leads from meditation on the Temple that is being built to meditation on departure from this world. Hence the emphasis placed on the archangel l'vlichael's double role. An interiorizing meditation discerns a virtue in every stone of the Temple. It is this which, after the evocation of the Temple of Solomon described above, enables the poet, in his \"speech from the Throne\", to show the heavenly Jerusalem appearing through the Temple of the Grail. At the same time, the connection between the Grail and the vocation of those who guard it is confirmed. At each moment they offur to the Grail a pure heart. The Grail knighthood makes them into men whose soul has the virtue of a \"diamond\" (adamas). The word is not chosen at random: there is an esoteric connection between what one might call \"sacred mineralogy\" and mystical anthropology, the conception ofman intrinsic in the theology ofthe Grail Temple. Because it is made up of all the precious stones that exist, the Temple becomes the parable or the likeness of Man. The meaning of Titurel's Temple lies in promoting the formation in man of the Temple, in investing him with the Imago Templi. As the Temple is constructed of the most noble materials, so should man be, since God desires to dwell in the human soul. In the first place the parable concerns individual man. But it also becomes the parable of the human community when, through the in visible action of its knights, the Spirit makes the boundaries of the community of the Grail coincide with the totality ofthe human community. An essential part is played in the inner transformation of man by a meditation which interior-247 This is a classic theme in the iconography ofthe archangel lV!ichael, and represents him holding the Balance in his hand (for example on the portal of the Sainte Chapelle in Paris). 363"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TEMPLI IN CONFRONTATION izes the virtue of each stone, deepening its symbolism.248 The diamond has already been named; after it the twelve precious stones that Aaron wore when he entered the Temple are also specified. The invocation of the number twelve leads to the mention of the twelve apostles to whom Christianity owes its diffusion. (We could also think of the twelve precious stones at the foundations of the wall of the heavenly Jerusalem; Revelation 21: 19-20.) There follows a reference to the effects of each precious stone both on the inner man and on his body. This sacred mineralogy signifies that when the secret ofthe Grail Temple is transposed to individual man, it becomes the secret of the purification and ennoblement of his whole person. Thus, to know what the precious stones \"have to say\" becomes the pre-requisite for participation in the nourishment provided by the Grail. It is true that the process is a circular one: man must acquire virtues in order to prepare a dwelling within himselffor the Holy Grail, but these virtues themselves can come only from the Grail. Nevertheless, in revealing the relationship between the precious stones and man's essential being, the circuit reveals the relationship of man to the Grail. Until the Temple was built, the Grail could be touched only by the Angels. After it is built, it tolerates the contact of men, but only of those who have acquired the virtue of a diamond. These are the men who constitute the knighthood of the Grail. 249 Such being the nature of the Temple, we are able to understand its rituals and liturgies. It is significant that, of the three great Christian feasts of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost, greater importance is assigned to Pentecost than to the other two (one line for the first two, but an entire stanza for the third). This is because Pentecost is the main feast of the Grail Temple. The principle chancel ofthe Temple is consecrated to the Holy Spirit (see above, § 1 ), and the spirituality of the Grail knights is dominated by the mystery ofPentecost. In \"The Quest ofthe Holy Grail\", it is on the eve of Pentecost, after the arrival of Galahad, that the Holy Grail manifests itself among the knights around King Arthur: \". . . there came a clap of thunder . . . Suddenly the hall was lit by a sunbeam which shed a radiance through the palace seven times brighter than had been 248 Cf. ibid., pp. 76-77, fo r some of the correspondences signified by the constituent parts ofthe Temple. 249 Ibid., pp. 78-79, 83. 364"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TEMPLI IN CONFRONTATION before. In this moment they were all illumined as it might be by the grace ofthe Holy Ghost ... \" For a long time they were silent, then \"the Holy Grail appeared, covered with a cloth of white samite; and yet no mortal hand was seen to bear it.\"250 The next day, the Quest for the Holy Grail began. The feast of Pentecost in the Temple of the Grail is not just a commem­oration ofthe outpouring ofthe Spirit. We have already seen (see above, section V, 4) how in the Community-temple of Qumran the celestial liturgy was itself realized eschatology. Here, the liturgy of the Grail is Pentecost realized; it is the event \"in the present\". This is so because the outpouring of the Paraclete did not happen once for all in the past, but is still to come, and the community is still in expectation of it. Once again, the norm of the Temple here is the jam and nondum, already and not yet (see above, section VI, 1). Hence the necessity of the persistence of Christian esotericism (see above, section VI, 5), of which the Grail cycle is a monument. The Imago Templi of Titurel dominates every Paracletic perspective, including that of the EcclesiaJohannis of the Joachimites (see above, section VI, 2-3)251 As we observed above, the Grail befo re the \"time ofTiturel\" remained on high, carried invisibly in the hands ofthe Angels. The \"time ofTiturel\" is the \"time of the Temple\", the recurrence \"in the present\" of the mystical liturgy. The Grail may now be touched by the hands of its knights, and can reproduce itself indefinitely in the future within each soul that has attained the required purity. Attention was also drawn earlier (see above, section IV, 7) to the affmity that may be seen to exist between the Imago Templi of the heavenly Jerusalem in Jewish esotericism, and the idea of the mystical Temple in Meister Eckhart. Here once again, the similarity is obvious. \"We may wonder whether Meister Eckhart the mystic, born in a epoch when the romance (the New Titurel) was written (between 1260 and 1270), was not himselftouched by the light ofthe Grail and the Grail Temple, when he defines the uncreated part of the soul not only as a scintilla (spark) but as a castle ( castellum), a small fortress (Burglein)\", 252 We may also recall the 250 The Quest of the Holy Grail, op. cit., pp. 43 ff. 251 Cf the two studies cited above, note 152. 252 Cf.

The two numbers twenty-two ( + 2 = 24) and seventy-two, given as being the number of chancels in the Temple of the Grail, each possess, as we said, an arithmosophical meaning. It is not surprising that the space inside Titurel's Temple is of a size that makes it the measure, eschatologi­cally speaking, ofthe entire human community. The number twenty-four is double the number ofthe signs ofthe zodiac, and suggests the corre­spondences between the Temple ofthe Grail and the cosmic Temple. But the number seventy-two corresponds to the number of peoples and of human tongues (seventy or seventy-two), as the Ancients traditionally represented them. The figure seventy-two is certainly contained, poten­tially, in the number twelve ( 12X 6 = 72). In favouring it, preeminence is given not so much to its relationship with the cosmic dome as to the relationship of the Temple with the human race. 253 In Wolfram, the chivalric ideal already brought the knights ofEast and West together in the same knighthood. Eschatologically, the setVice of the Grail should bring together the whole of humanity in the Temple of Titurel. The Pentecostal mystety is \"eschatology realized\" in the Temple ofthe Grail (see above, section V, 4). We also said above that, on the one hand, the secret of the Grail Temple was the Holy ofHolies which exemplifies the relationship ofthe Temple with the Temple within man as a microcosm, and that, on the other hand, this secret lay in the form ofthe great Temple, which is a perfect round. This form has fascinated researchers. The Finnish scholar L. J. Ringbom has traced its models, imitations, parallels and variations from Persia to the far West. According to him, the form ofthe temple in the round is essentially and par excellence the form of the sacred royal building.

Yet the chancel ofthe Gothic church-for example, Saint-Martin de Tours, or Saint-Remi de Reims-consists of no more than a semi-rotunda opening onto the rectangle ofthe old basilica, so that the plan of the whole building is cruciform. The breaking, or rather the cutting-off, of the rotunda signifies the breaking of the whole formed by the sacerdotal kingship of the Grail or, in other words, the breaking ofthe unity formed by exoteric and esoteric, which are henceforth separated and dispersed. The whole drama and meaning ofthe Temple aborigine lies in the capitulation of the esoteric before the official norm and power of the exoteric Church. The historian of traditional architectural forms can thus follow the progress of the Imago Templi from the Orient to its entry into the West, where the hearts of men are so hardened that it cannot survive. The Templar rotundas are destroyed. With a few exc eptions, all that remain are the semi-rotundas, traces of a mutilated unity255 The exoteric is triumphant, and the idea of the royal Temple returns to the country whence it came, to the mystical \"Orient\" where it is received by him who is the guardian of the priestly kingship, the mysterious Prester John, who is not a ruler ofthis world. This is the last episode in the \"New Titurel\". Yet it must never be forgotten that the Temple ofthe Grail was only ever manifest at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\", in the Land of Light or Terra Lucida, the \"eighth clime\" which the Ishraqiyun call the \"intermediary Orient\". It was not and could not be \"incarnated\" in this world, in the sense that this word is misused today. In a single night, the Temple was transferred from this \"intermediary Orient\" to the \"Orient\" ofthe meta­physical world, to which Titurel and Parsifal transferred the Holy Grail. Ifthis \"return to the Orient\" possesses a symbolic virtue for the history of traditional architectural forms, it possesses it no less with respect to the temple within man-or, better, to the temple that is man.

The rebuilding of the Temple is the work of a human lifetime; or, more precisely, one can only leave the world of exile by undergoing a second birth, signified by the rebuilding ofthe Temple. The transference ofthe Temple to India is the return of the soul to its country of origin. Finally, this \"return to the Orient\" gives us the clue to the secret ofthe Grail knighthood. The \"India\" to which the knights withdraw in the wake ofTiturel and Parsifal is not one which we can hope to find on the map. Traditionally, the word designates a distant Orient where the realm of the invisible Paradise begins. It would be futile and absurd to identifY the Prester John of the Grail cycle with a ruler of this world, with, for example, a Mongolian or Ethiopian ruler, as happened in previous centuries. At the end of Wolfram's epic, Prester John is Parsifal's nephew; at the end of Albrecht's epic, the name and the honour are conferred on Parsifal himself256 Prester John is the ideal priest-king of the Johannine kingdom. The return ofthe Templars ofthe Grail to his kingdom is their return to invisibility, to a strict inco gnito. One cannot therefore speak ofthe Temple ofthe Grail without opening one's inner vision and hearing to the musical dramas ofRichard Wagner. Indeed, in the \"recital ofthe Grail\", Lohengrin voices the norm ofstrict esotericism to which evety knight of the Grail is subject: \"And its power is sacred as long as it remains unknown to all.\" The final scene oftheir \"return to the Orient\" suggests to us how best to envisage the relationship between the Templars ofthe Grail-in \"Parsifal\" and the \"New Titurel\" -and the knights of the historic Order of the Temple. The historic Order was the visible manifestation of a still more exalted knighthood that was unknown to men, the temporaty trustee of a mission which, fium centuty to centuty, these superior and unknown knights assign to those who are worthy. This is how J.B. Willermoz, in the eighteenth century, himself understood the significance of the historic Order of the Temple in relation to a permanent Templarism that was superior to it-a relationship through which alone the historic Order could claim descent from the Order of 256 a En Islam iranien, op. cit., wl.

There is a striking correspondence between what is implied by this vision ofthings, and the occultation ofthe Grail knighthood. The triumph ofthe Imago Templi lies in its thus emerging safe and sound from all failings, all betrayals, all enslavement to the norms ofthis world. Counter-histoty is ultimately more true than histoty. Once in occultation, the Templars of the Grail can assume other names. One such name is the \"Sons ofthe Valley\" in the great dramatic poem by Zacharias Werner. via. The Imago Templi and the \"Sons of the Valley\" 1. The critique of the Temple. In Zacharias Werner's great drama, the] mago Templi is linked to the theme of the Temple's perpetuation, but it differs in two essential respects from the Templar tradition that we have already discussed (see above, section VI). 1. The tragedy ofthe historic Order of the Temple gives place not to a glorification pure and simple of the Imago Templi, historically represented by the Order, but to a critique a( and lamentation over, the descendence into which the Temple has fallen, and which motivates and governs the expectation ofthe new Temple. 2. As a result, Templar filiation is not seen as following directly on the historic Order of the Temple, as if it were simply a question of reviving this Order. Templar f:tliation is conceived as being the work of a higher Order, which is concealed behind the historic Order of the Temple, as well as behind all the known manifestations of Templarism. This hidden community is called by the author the \"Sons ofthe Valley\". The Templar heritage is ensured by their decisions; it is not engendered historically by the events of profane histoty. The new Temple is not the fruit of historical evolution. As regards the first point, we are confronted with a critique of the Temple at a moment parallel to that found in Ezekiel and in the Com­munity ofQumran. The historic Order ofthe Temple is guilty ofbetraying the orders of the \"Valley\", a betrayal which is like a repetition of the sin of Israel that violated and desecrated the Temple. Thus the tragedy corre­sponds to the first part of the Book of Ezekiel (see above, section III), which speaks of the judgement of God on the Temple and the resulting exile of the Shekhinah. But the destruction of the desecrated Temple is a necessaty prelude to the coming ofthe new Temple, which assumes the dimensions of a cosmic restoration. The vision of the return from exile and the rebuilding ofthe Temple correspond in Zacharias Werner to the alchemical 369"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TEMPLI IN CONFRONTATION transfiguration of the martyr Jacques de Malay as prelude to the coming ofthe new Temple, which will be the work ofthe \"Sons ofthe Valley\". In both cases, the Imago Templi is manifested in two phases: the tragedy of its destruction, and the triumph of its restoration (see below, Nova Hierosolyma). The whole drama ofhumanity is contained within the drama ofthis Imago Templi, whose norm opposes the violations and profanations of History with the inviolability and sacredness ofthe Temple \"on the high mountain\". As regards the second point, because the historic Templars were no more than temporary trustees of the secrets of the Temple, Zacharias Werner is led to adopt an attitude different from that which tends to exculpate the unfortunate Templars on the charges brought against them in the course of an unjust trial. The expectation of the new Temple presupposes a critique ofthe old one. It is not that the author goes over to the side oftheir sinister enemies, King Philip the Fair ofFrance and Pope Clement V; but he attempts to explain their fate in terms of a superior logic, one which enables him already to proclaim the dawning of a new day. In effect, the tragedy ofthe historic Order ofthe Temple is raised to the rank ofparable. In saying that this tragedy typifies all the drama of mankind, we are once again thinking of the essential meaning assigned from the start (see above, section II) to the destruction and the restoration of the Tern ple: entry into the world of exile, and departure from it. In Zacharias Werner's dramatic poem, the Templars ofthe fourteenth cen­tury are in fact no more than surrogates for the Templar masonry ofthe eighteenth century because, according to the author's vision, both ofthem were unfaithful to the mission with which they had been entrusted by the \"Sons of the Valley\". In what did this betrayal consist? All the reproaches and criticisms levelled by Zacharias Werner at the historical Order ofthe Temple are in fact directed at his own eighteenth-century contemporaries, who are easily recognizable. The Knights Templar are said to have misused a secret knowledge that had been entrusted to them, and to have been about to reveal it at an untimely moment to the profane world. It was on account of this that the \"Sons of the Valley\" withdrew their protection from them, and they were abandoned to their destiny of destruction. They were not, however, utterly abandoned: a small remnant was preserved with a view to the future palingenesis.257 In this, Zacharias Werner is simply following 257 A E.

In the fi rst place, he is thinking of the disquiet­ing Illuminati of Weisshaupt in Bavaria, who had al ready provoked a vi olent reaction on the part of the \"Strict Templar Observance\", and whose political aspirations did indeed bring di scredit on Templarism in general. 258 Secondly and more generally, the author has in mind the whole spirit of the Enlightenment in his critique of a degenerate Templarism: th e reduction of religion to morality in the name of a rati onalism and a criticism that so mutilate the hi gh ideal ofthe Temple that it is no longer recognizable; a deism that opens the way to atheism pure and simple and unleashes the passions of egoism and personal ambition-in short, every­thing that the spiritual knighthood was charged and pl edged to oppose259 Obviously, it woul d be easy to speak ofanachronism wi th respect to the role assigned to the fourteenth-century Templars as mouthpieces for the Enlightenment.

In several scenes we are presented with the life ofthe Order and its ritual ceremonies, in a way which is intended to show us the deep-seated reasons for the Order's decadence. Its Grand Master, the virtuous Jacques de Molay, is unable to remedy the situation. Under a false pretext, Philip the Fair persuades the knights to come to France.

In the background we perceive the action of the unknown Superiors, the \"Sons of the Valley\", whose mysteri­ous messengers Eudo and Astralis have the task of preparing Jacques de Molay for his fate, and the young knight Robert of Heredom for his mission. This is the young man who has been chosen to carry through the palingenesis ofthe Order, or rather its continuation after its destruction on the visible stage ofHistory. B. The brothers of the Cross (Kreuzesbruder). 261 This time the action is set in Paris on March 17-18, 1314. The theme is the trial ofthe Templars, their condemnation, and their appeal. But it is important to observe that Philip the Fair is merely the agent, accursed no doubt, but nevertheless the mere executive agent of decisions which are taken by an authority higher than his, the authority of the \"Sons of the Valley\". If the Order must disappear it is because it has overstepped the limits of its power. After an imprison­ment lasting eight years, Jacques de Molay \"understands the meaning of his tribulations and his deat h. He is received as a member ofthe Valley in the cave of Carmel, after which he undergoes martyrdom in a sort of apotheosis and mystical ecstasy\". Robert of Heredom, after having been initiated as well, flees to Scotland with a few knights. In accordance with the Templar tradition, the Imago Templi once again makes the royal Scotland of Robert the Bruce into the sanctuary where the Temple is perpetuated. 2. The ''Sons of the Va lley': What exactly does this name represent? It represents an exalted company of initiate Brothers, who constitute ab origine the secret Church ofChrist-not unreminiscent ofEckhartshausen's \"Inner Church\".262 For Zacharias Werner, it represents a brotherhood of \"unknown Superiors\", which was at work behind the Templar knight­hood ofthe fourteenth century and is still behind the Templar knighthood of the eighteenth century. In fact, both of these knighthoods represent simply a temporary form of manifestation which is determined by the brotherhood ofthe Valley. When the Valley, because ofa transgression, withdraws its protection from these forms, they are left defenceless before 261 L.

The Valley, which is a purely spiritual and secret power, has no part in the tide of becoming, and participates in human events only in a mediate sense, through the com­munities emanating from it and whose destiny it controls. Thus, the historic Order of the Temple had been organized by the Valley into three hierarchical levels: a. the knights, men of action who were not even aware of the Valley's existence; b. the initiated brothers, who received esoteric instruction; c. the masters, who were in direct but secret communication with the \"Sons of the Valley\". The latter thus correspond, in a certain sense, to the knights of the Grail after their occultation in the kingdom of Prester John (see above, section VII, 3). More precisely, they correspond to those mysterious figures of Templar tradition, through whom this tradition traces the ancestry ofthe historical Order back to distant Essene origins. They are variously called the \"Knights of the Morning and of Palestine\", the \"Thebaid Solitaries\", the \"canons of the Holy Sepulchre'1, the Canonici Templi Domini, and so on. They have all been mentioned before (see above, section VI, 6). Nevertheless, it is important to qualify the relationship: the \"Sons of the Valley\" did not simply have to ally themselves with the Knights Templar. The \"Sons of the Valley\" assign to these knights the mission which links them to the distant Essenes, to the original Judaeo-Christian community. When they withdraw their mission from the knights ofthe Temple in the fourteenth century, they themselves continue to exist as before, immutable in their Valley, the guardians of the Imago Templi in its ideal purity, ready to ensure its future palingeneses. This \"Valley\"-\"the peaceful, silent homeland of a community of Sages whose task was to sanctify and divinize the world\" -is the valley of Jehoshaphat in the Holy Land, according to a Hermetic tradition, and its name appears in the Bible in the Book ofthe prophet Joel.263 The word of three syllables that in Zacharias Werner's drama the Temple initiates whisper into each other's ears is obviously the word Jehoshaphat.

At the moment of repeating the password, the youngest member of the Temple, young Gottlieb, as though discovering by inspiration the profound truth that the others have forgotten, utters these words: \"!ch­in mir-wir sind-das Sein\" (!-within me-we are-Being).264 The valley of J ehoshaphat is likewise located, not on our maps, but at \"the meeting-place ofthe two seas\" (see above, se ction II). Its very name confers on it an eschatological dimension, since it appears to the prophet Joel as the place ofthe Last Judgement.265 The eschatological dimension is that ofthe Imago Templi, whose virtue is such as to make it the supreme and effective rec ourse of all innocent men condemned unjustly. It is the Appellatio ad vallemJosaphat.266 We are reminded here of the last words of Jacques de Molay, summoning Pope Clement V and King Philip the Fair to appear before the judgement seat of God (both of them, as we know, died that same year). Because it is situated at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\", in the place which par excellence is median and intermediary, the valley of J ehoshaphatalso typifies the mode of knowledge that Zacharias Werner opposes to the rationalism which is destructive of the indissoluble unity of Creator and Creation, and to the deistic conception of God as separated from his creation and indifferent to it: a Deus otiosus. The starting-point must be the original intuition. In creating man, God entrusted him with the task of \"completing the temple\", this implying far man the obligation of becoming himselfthe Temple ofGod.267 Instead, through his egoism, man builds a dwelling for himself, shattering in this way the unity of Creation. The centre ofCreation no longer coincides with the centre ofthe divinity, for man henceforth locates this centre within himself.

It is a form of knowledge that is discursive, analytical, falsely objective; that isolates and parcels out into autonomous components something which constitutes an essential unity. Moreover, it is a form of knowledge that wrongly arrogates to itself the privilege of being the only valid mode of knowing. On the other hand (and here we perceive the profound influence on our author of the great theologian Schleiermacher), there is a mode of knowl­edge which is intuitive, divinatory, combining the action of imagination and feeling, and which as such is the mode, essentially, of religious knowledge.268 This rediscovery of the noetic value and of the mediating function of the Image and the Imagination is of major importance, for Zacharias Werner there by validates at once imaginative know ledge and the existence of that mundus imaginalis ('alam al-mithal) which fulfils a function (between the J abarut and the Mulk) so essential for the theos­ophers of Islam. Only a metaphysics of the imaginal can attain to \"the meeting-place of the two seas\", to the \"valley of Jehoshaphat\", as Suhra­vardi so admirably demonstrated (see above, section II). This mediating function ofthe active Imagination is essential for spiritual alchemy-that is to say, for the effectiveness of the alchemical operation viewed as a transmutation of the inner man. Moreover, it is this exalted science of alchemy that Zacharias Werner sees as the secret of the \"Valley\", the secret which transformed the martyrdom ofJacques de Molay into an ecstatic apotheosis. The Order had but a single aim: the regeneration, the new birth, brought about by the re-establishment ofthe identity between macrocosm and microcosm. The all-powerfulness of the active Imagination (quite different, as Paracelsus says, from the \"fantasy\") puts into operation an alchemy which comprises simultaneously a conception of the world, an 268 Ibid., pp. 210, 292.

Today we would add: too sociological. I quote, from memory, a recent invitation \"to celebrate (the Eucharist) less and to share more (socially)\".

And this is so whether it is a case of practical alchemy or speculative alchemy: the notion of mediating and mediation is the very foundation ofthe Ars magna.

Mercury both engenders and resorbs contraries, and it is also one ofthe names for the Stone of the Sages. This stone has the power to destroy gross matter and to convert the body of man into a subtle body of a lum inous essence, like the bodies of the Righteous in Paradise, or the body ofthe androgynous Adam before his Fall. The active Imagination is the organ of meditation that assimilates the Opus alchemicum, by which base metal is refined. In virtue ofthis assimilation, the Imagination is the mediator which brings about the refinement of whoever \"spiritualizes himselfuntil he reaches the final stage ofmystical union\".269 Such is the secret of the apotheosis of Jacques de Molay and of the Imago novi Templi. 3. Towards the new Temple. In speaking ofthe Grand Master Jacques de Molay, Robert ofHeredom called him \"that great, poor, misunderstood heart\". Despite his modesty and renunciation, which led him to submit to the fateful decision, taken by the Chapter, to return to France-a return whose consequences he foresaw-Jacques de Molay had to undergo the moral and physical sufferings of an unjust trial, as well as endure the distress of eight years in prison, in order to attain supreme purification.270 The interiorizing ofthe alchemical work leads, certainly, to a superior form ofgnosis, to a knowledge ofthe unitive way. What characterizes this knowledge, however, is that it is not merely theoretical: it is the actual experience ofthe unitive way and ofthe mystical union. The three stages of the alchemical operation, whose secret is also the secret of the \"Valley\", have their spiritual correspondences: nigredo, the dark night ofthe soul; albedo, illumination, the birth of the .filius philosophorum; and rubedo, the red of divine love, the hierogamy ofthe soul with her God.

His transmutation is simul­taneously the transmutation of the entire Templar Order. His death is redemptory, the philosopher's stone which transforms the base lead ofthe old Temple into the gold ofthe new.271 While Jacques de Molay embraces death in ecstasy, Robert of Heredom throws himself into the world of action which leads to the coming of the new Temple. In an extraordinary scene, the initiator, Adam de Valincourt, instructs him in the significance of earthly death. Defunct bodies liberate the \"seeds of resurrection\" . When living beings disappear, they leave behind them a subtle body (Paracelsus' corpus sp iritual, the jism mithali or imaginal body of the Islamic theosophers). When the rose is subjected to the action of fire, burned to ashes and then diluted after fermentation, a bluish colour appears, followed by the astral form of the rose. This experiment is the same as that conducted by the great Christian Cabbalist F. C. Oetinger, using a sprig ofbalm-an experiment he found so over­whelming that he returns to it over and over again. \"May the son ofthe Valley be annihilated-And may there spring from the worm-eaten Temple -A tree of life flowering in the eternal sacred wood of the Lamb.\"272 Towards the end ofthe poem, Robert ofHeredom is thus initiated by the Sons ofthe Valley and created Grand Master ofthe new Temple, which will be born again from the ashes of the old. He is the guardian of the secret Palladium until the time when men are sufficiently mature to ac­knowledge him, and worthy enough to receive the Light which the Valley revealed to Jacques de Molay on the eve of his martyrdom.273 Robert's name in chivalry refers us to the mystical mountain ofHeredom in the north of Scotland, of which mention has already been made (see above, section VI, 7). The entire Scottish tradition is thus evoked, the part played by Scotland in the renaissance ofthe Order ofthe Temple after its destruction.

Zacharias Werner's great Templar epic ends with a triumphant celestial liturgy which assumes the dimensions of a cosmic liturgy. In the Revelation of John, the vision of the Nova Hierosolyma likewise sets us in the presence of a cosmic liturgy, a celestial liturgy in which we relive the mystery of an eschatology that is already visionally accomplished, as in the liturgies ofthe Community of Qumran (see above, section V, 4). In Swedenborg, the new Jerusalem as the Imago Templi heralds the coming of the Nova Ecclesia. In the celestial Temple, John witnesses a magnificent liturgy which 274 Cf L.

Ideally speaking, the Israelites are a people of priests (Exod. 19:6). In the vision of John, all the Elect are also a people of priest-kings (Rev. 20:6 and 22:5). The believer's status is simultaneously royal and sacerdotal278 (like that ofthe knight-priests at Montsalvat). As was the case with the Community of Qumran, there is here an indissoluble union between the celestial and earthly liturgies: the believer in heaven and the believer on earth are united in the same liturgical act. The connection between \"events in Heaven\" and those which \"take place\" on earth is dramatically illustrated in the effects that the celestial liturgy can have on those who are on earth: \"And the Angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake\" (Rev. 8:5). The Image of the celestial Temple and that of the new Jerusalem are indissolubly united in the Johannine vision. \"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name ofmy God, and the name ofthe city ofmy God, whi ch is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out ofheaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name\" (Rev. 3: 12). The new Jerusalem is none other than the new Temple of God. John thus reinterprets all the traditional expectation of Israel: \"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away\" (Rev. 21: 1). This is truly a new creation; and the city-temple that comes down from heaven (21:2) is part ofthi s new creation, and descends from newly­created skies. We can see from this that it is a question not simply ofthe rej uvenation and transformation ofthe old, but ofthe breaking-through of something that is outside and beyond history. Is this conception radically different from that of the Rabbis for whom the city was the celestial city­archetype?279 We think not, because the descent ofthe city-archetype in any case marks a break or discontinuity in the course of things. It is hierohistory or \"subtle history\" breaking through and dissolving the norms 276 Cf R. J. McKelvey, The !'lew Te�p/e, the Church in the New Testament(Oxford, 1969).

This hierohistory is also, by its essence, a radical inno­vation, a new creation, hitherto unseen. The true relationship is expressed, moreov er, in a remarkable symbol. 2. From the Temple of Ezekiel to the Johannine city-temple. The symbol in question is a magnificent window in Chartres cathedral, which shows the apostle John perched on the shoulders of the prophet Ezekiel.280 This symbol by itself makes the relationship between the vision and theology of the Temple in Ezekiel (see above, section III, 4) and the J ohannine vision ofthe Nova Hierosolyma quite clear: fundamentally they are in agreement, but in the second new heights are reached. To reach these heights, however, it is necessary to be carried by Ezekiel himself higher than his own vision. \"And he [one of the seven Angels] carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God\" (Rev. 21: 10). Ezekiel, too, relates how \"In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south\" (Ezek. 40:2). The temple contemplated by the visionary Ezekiel is already a city -temple just as the city contemplated by John is a city-temple. Here, our inquiry should complete the parallel previously established (see above, sections III and V) between the Ezekelian theology of the Temple and that of the Community of Qumran, by establishing another parallel between the Qumran vision of the Nova Hierosolyma and the J ohannine vision. 281 For the present we must confine ourselves to pointing out what there is in common between the Ezekelian and Johannine visions of the new Temple. Common to the Temple in both visions is the geometrical layout, whose symbolism is such as to characterize an Imago Templi common to the esotericism of the entire Abrahamic tradition. In Ezekiel's city-temple, whose name is \"the Lord is there\", the four sides of the perfect square each have three gates (north, south, east and west): twelve gates in all, the 280 There is a beautiful reproduction of this in Paul Popes co's hook, La Cathedrale de Chartres, Chefs-d'oeuvre du Vitrail europeen (Paris, Bibliotheque des Arts, 1970), fig. 40, window 95 (south), and p. 140: \"The evangelist appears like 'a dwarf on the shoulders of a giant', meaning that the evangelists are lesser then the prophets, but see further because they are more highly-placed.\" 281 Cf Shozo Fujita, Temple Theology, pp. 306-316, the final chapter entitled 'The book of Ezekiel and the fr agments of \"New Jerusalem\"'. 380"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TEMPLI IN CONFRONTATION name of each corresponding respectively to the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel (Ezek. 48:30-35). In the Revelation of John (21:12), the city-temple, the new Jerusalem descending from heaven, \"had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel\". There are three gates in each of the four sides of the square. Furthermore, the city wall had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles (Rev. 21:13-14). Another parallel completes this one. Twelver Shiite prophetology always establishes a correspondence between the number of twelve Imams, and the twelve heads of the twelve tribes of Israel, the twelve springs that gushed from the rock struck by the staff of Moses. And Shiite gnosis, most notably in the work of Qadi Sa'id Qummi, meditates in this sense on the cubic form ofthe Temple ofthe Ka'bah, which corresponds to the form of the city-temple in Ezekiel and John. In the twelve edges of the cube, Shiite gnosis perceives the symbol of the twelve Imams, who are the spiritual temple because they are par excellence the ministers of the esoteric aspect of the prophetic revelation. The very structure ofthe Temple thus betokens the structure of the pleroma of the eternal prophetic Reality, and the Temple of the Ka'bah is transfigured into a spiritual Temple282 In this way there emerges an Imago Templi that is common to all three branches of the Abraham ic tradition. Through the mediation of their esotericists, they are finally reunited in the mystical Jerusalem, in the same spiritual city. Next, there is the Johannine statement: \"And I saw no temple therein [in the city]\" (Rev. 21:22); for the Temple is the Lord God himself and his Christ. Jewish eschatology itself, it is true, makes the new Jerusalem into the symbol of the unity not just of Israel, but of humanity, and John relates his vision to this great hope by making the city-temple the centre of the world. But is not a future Jerusalem without a temple something unthinkable, unacceptable for the Jewish sense of piety? In reply, Ezekiel himself and, closer to our time, Swedenborg, prepare the way for 282 Cf my study on 'The Configuration of the Temple of the Ka'bah', published above.

Does not God say, in the Book of Ezekiel (11:16): . yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary\"? (see above, section III, 2). There are thus two essential aspects to be taken into account. 284 a. It would indeed be disconcerting if the new Jerusalem had no temple. What John means is that the temple of the new Jerusalem is God himself and his Christ (Rev. 21:22), and the intimacy proclaimed in Ezekiel between God and man is experienced on an even higher level. The veils or barriers between God and men disappear in the new Jerusalem. \"And they shall see his face\" (Rev. 22:4). b. Another aspect, leading back to the first, is that the new Jerusalem is itself the Temple: it is all Temple, the city-temple. Not only is God a temple for the believers., as in Ezekiel; the believers are also a te mple for God (cf the Community-temple ofQumran; above, section V, 2. See also Rev. 3:12: the believers become pillars in the Temple and bear the name ofthe new Jerusalem). The city-temple is in the form of a cube (as is also the Ka'bah; see above), like the Holy of Holies in the Temple of Solomon (I Kgs. 6:20). The new Jerusalem and the Temple are one and the same thing. Better still, the new Jerusalem is itselfthe new Heaven and the new Earth. Let us note, too, that whenJohn speaks of God as the temple ofthe believer, and of the believer as the temple of God, he does not signify the same thing as when one speaks ofthe Church as the Temple of God. He is not describing the Temple alone, but the Holy ofHolies, the most sacred part ofthe Temple. Thereby the necessity for Christian esotericism is also established (see above, section VI, 1-5). Consequently, the Johannine Imago Templi is the symbol ofthe ultimate and final communion between God and his people, the fulfilment of the Ezekelian promise: \"They will be his people and God himself shall dwell amongst them\". The divine Presence-\"the dwelling of God amongst them\"-which believers are privileged to experience on earth, will not be taken away from them when they die. In the world to come they will still have that privilege. This is what it means to become \"a pillar in the temple of my God\" (Rev . 3: 12), and to enjoy the immediate vision of the divine (Rev. 21:2 2, 22:4). There alone will the mystical epic of all Templar chivalry be consummated, for it is not in this world that man's goal and destiny are to be sought. 284 For what follows, see McKelvey's apposite observaticns in ibid., pp. 175-177, 187. 382"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"THE IMA GO TEMPLI IN CONFRONTATION 3. The ''NovaEcclesia\"in Swedenborg. The entire spiritual oeuvre of the great eighteenth-century visionary theosopher Swedenborg is dominated by the idea of theN ova Hierosolyma, signifying the Nova Ecclesia whose annunciator and prophet it was Swedenborg's mission to be. His hermeneutic of chapter XXI of the Revelation is in some sense the recapitulation of his entire doctrine. \"The whole of this chapter,\" he writes, \"treats of the Lord's Advent, and ofthe new church to be established by him. It is this new church which is meant by Jerusalem . . . \"285 We should therefore study the whole doctrine of the new Jerusalem; but we will confine ourselves here to the commentary on the chapter in question, which has the virtue of reminding us of the laws of imaginal visionary perception (angelic hierognosis in Swedenborg). The hermeneutic of the Imago Templi illustrates how esoteric and exoteric, by virtue of these very laws, are inseparable. 286 The heavenly Jerusalem is perceived first of all by the visionary of the Apocalypse as the holy city; immediately afterwards, he contemplates it as a young betrothed maiden. In the doctrine ofSwedenborg the two images, superimposed one upon the other, are symbolic visions, an exemplary case of correspondence. The very idea of such a correspondence presupposes the ontological reality of what we, in common with our Islamic theosophers, have called the mundus imaginalis and, consequently, the necessary percep­tion of things at \"the meeting-place of the two seas\". Symbolically or \"representationally\", the new Jerusalem is perceived as a city; in its spiritual reality it is perceived as a betrothed maiden. This, observes Swedenborg, is exactly what happens for the Angels when they see, read or hear in the Word something to do with a city. In the thought of the lower-ranking Angels, it is still perceived as a city. In the thought of the Angels of a higher order, it is perceived as the Nova Ecclesia with respect to the doctrine. But by virtue of the law of correspondences, which ensures the plenary reality sui generis of the visionary Images that immediately translate the inner state of those who perceive them, the holy city is perceived in the thought of the still higher-ranking Angels as a most beautiful maiden, clothed in garments that correspond to the attributes of 285 Emanuel Swedenborg, The Ap ocalypse Revealed (London, The Swedenborg Society (Inc.), 1878), vol.

John was \"carried ... away in the spirit to a great and high mountain\" (Rev. 21:10). This signifies that John was carried off into the third Heaven, and that there the Nova Ecclesia, with respect to its doctrine, was made manifest to the eyes of his visionary perception, first as the image of a city and then as the image of a betrothed maiden. If \"to be carried away to a high mountain\" means to be carried off to the third Heaven, this is because it happens \"in the spirit\" and he who is \"in the spirit\" as regards thought and vision is in the third Heaven. The Angels of the third Heaven dwell on the mountains, those of the second Heaven on the hills, and those of the first Heaven in the valleys between the hills and mountains. The elevation to the third Heaven happens in an instant. It corresponds to a change of thought, that is to say of the visionary's total inner being.288 The new Jerusalem descends from Heaven \"having the glory ofGod: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal\" (Rev. 21: 11 ). What this means is that in the Nova Ecclesia, which is the Nova Hierosolyma, the letter of the Word had become trans­lucent, so that its spiritual meaning was immediately apparent to the sight. For those who have en tered into the spiritual intelligence of the Word, its spiritual meaning is made luminous in the light of their Heaven, a light which proceeds from the Lord as from the sun. For such beings, the same applies to the spiritual meaning concealed within each detail ofthe Word. We should follow Swedenborg's hermeneutic in detail with regard to all of the verses describing the New Jerusalem. 289 2B7 Swedenborg, op. cit., art. 881, p. 708. 288 Ibid., art. 896, pp. 716-717.

The quotation is taken from his fundamental work, Heaven and its Wonders, and Hell: from things Heard and Seen, London, J. M.

We must not think, he says, that in the Nova Ecclesia, the New Jerusalem, there will be no temple. No; what is meant is that in the New Jerusalem there will be nothing external (exoteric) whose inward (esoteric) meaning will be veiled. The reason is that although the word \"temple\" does indeed designate the Nova Ecclesia as the place of the celestial liturgy, in its highest sense it designates the Lord himself in the human manifestation of his divinity. Then \"the Lord God is himself the Temple\",290 as we also read in Ezekiel (see above, section III, 2). The fact that in this world there is a screen which separates inner and outer, esoteric and exoteric, is what creates the necessity for a Christian esotericism. The understanding that this duality is abolished by the Nova Hierosolyma is the essential perception that links Swedenborg to all the spiritual masters for whom the norm ofthe spiritual Temple signifies the coming of the Paraclete. Their agreement on this point unites the Joachi­mites of the eternal Gospel, the Jewish Cabbalists, and the Twel ver Shiite theosophers who identify the coming ofthe. twelfth Imam with the coming of the Paraclete. This is why we said above that the mystical Jerusalem is the spiritual Temple common to the three branches of the Abrahamic Heaven with man through the Word: a conjunction ofthe spiritual meaning with the material meaning, ofthe exoteric with the esoteric. \"Anyone who reads these words understands them merely according to the sense of the letter, according to which the visible heaven and earth are to perish, a new heaven is to exist, and the holy city Jerusalem with all its dimensions as here described is to descend upon a new earth. But the angels present with man understand these things quite differ­ently, for they understand spiritually what man understands naturally. By the new heaven and new earth they understand a new Church. By the city Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, they understand its heavenly doctrine revealed by the Lord.\" Swedenborg goes on to give the spiritual meaning of all the details in the description of the New Jerusalem in the Apocalypse, and sums up as fo llows: \"The natural ideas of man pass into spiritual ideas with angels, without their knowing anything of the sense of the letter of the Word . . . And yet the thoughts of angels unite with the thoughts of man, because they correspond to one another. They unite almost like the words of a speaker and the understanding of them by the hearer ... Therefore, when angels think spiritually and man thinks naturally, they are cm\"]joined almost like soul and body; the internal sense ofthe Word is also its soul, and the sense of the letter its body. Such is the Word throughout; hence it is evident, that it is the means of conjoining heaven with man; and that the sense ofthe letter serves as a basis and foundation .\" Op. cit., art. 307, pp. 143- 1 44. 290 Swedenborg, The Apocalyp se Revealed, op. cit.,pp. 734-735. 385"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"THE IMA GO TEMPll IN CONFRONTATION tradition. The Temple as a \"place ofvision\" is the ultimate intuition to which we are guided, through all its recurrences, by the Imago Templi. TEMPLE AND CONfEMPLATION There is no place here for anything resembling a conclusion, let alone an epilogue. The Temple is not yet completed. I would prefer to use the word \"denouement\", but I would accompany it with this question. When what is at issue are the norms that reign in our world, in the present state of our civilization, might not the Imago Templi appear to us as \"resolving\", or absolving (in the sense that it sets us in the presence of an absolutum, an absolute because it absolves from the limits which block our world off from the horizon of the spiritual worlds) the horizon of the world beyond? It is significant that the Latin word templum originally meant a vast space, open on all sides, from which one could survey the whole surround­ing landscape as far as the horizon. This is what it means to contemplate: to \"set one's sights on\" Heaven from the temple that defines the field of vision. By the same token, the idea of contemplation introduces the idea of consecration. The term was actually used above all to designate the field of Heaven, the expanse of the open Heaven where the flight of birds could be observed and inter preted. Perhaps the idea ofthe cosmic Temple, which we have come across seve ral times in the course of our inquiry, should be viewed in this li ght. Thus sacralized, the word templum finally came to mean the sanctuary, the sacred building known as a temple, the place of a divine Presence and of the contemplation of this Presence. Thus, the Latin templum became the appropriate word with which to translate the Hebrew and Arabic expressions that we met with at the start (Beth ha-miqdash, Bayt al-Maqdis; see above, section I), which connote the idea of a divine dwelling-place; whereas, through its distant etymology, the word itself connotes the idea of a place of vision. The temple is the place, the organ, of VlSlOn. Our inquiry, which embraced the theology of the Temple both in Ezekiel and in the Essene Community ofQumran, has presented us with this thesis: God himself is the temple of believers-and, reciprocally, believers are themselves the temple ofGod. This is the whole motifofthe man-temple, the community-temple. To be the man-temple (one should say templatio, templificatio hominis) is to be oneself a space of contemplation, 386"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TE.AJPLI IN CONFRONTATION and thence a consecrated space. It is here, in the man-temple, that the Imago Templi manifests itself, because in the man-temple the Imago Templi is the mirror reflecting the Imago Animae, and because in this sense contemplator, contemplation and temple are one. There is thus an indissoluble link between Israel and the idea of the Temple, not only because Templar hierologies lay claim to a descent that goes back ultimately to the first Temple of Solomon, but also with regard to the essence of that which makes the temple. When I say that we owe the Temple to the people-temple, I am thinking particularly of the late Hebrew etymology that was given to the name oflsrael, in perfect accordance with the thought of Philo. Moreover, this etymology accords perfectly with that of the word templum, for the meaning it assigns to the name Israel is man-temple: \"He who sees God\"­The word thus designates \"the race of seers\", and \"Israel thus became, by definition, a people of contemplalives dedicated to the vision of divine things\". As Philo explains, \"The eye of the soul, which is the most transparent, pure and piercing of all, which alone is permitted to see God, bears the name of lsrael.\" Through this philosophical transposition, the concept of Israel is expanded to mean a spiritual and mystical Israel, representing both the assembly ofholy, \"seeing\" souls, and the individual soul, the soul's intellective part, the voiic; or &avow, the thought of the sage \"who sees God and loves him\". Vision surpasses sound: the ears become eyes. Philo explains further: at the time ofthe theophany of Sinai, it was said that \"all the people saw the sound\" and did not understand it, \"for ifthe voice ofhuman beings is received by the hearing, the voice of God is received by the sight, like a light.\"291 We could say the same of active contemplation. When man is thus, man is truly the Temple . And it is when man is thus that we can speak of the denouement, that is, of the resolving, absolving function of the Imago Templi. This is not, of course, a resolution that can be produced with a great flourish of dialectic. As we envisaged at the start of this inquiry (sec above, section II), the destruction of the Temple now appears as the destruction of the man­temple, and thence as the desacralization ofman and ofhis world. We grasp the full extent of the tragedy when we recall that, in the course of this inquiry, we have been told over and over again that the Temple was 29 1 Annie Jaubert, op. cit., pp. 411-412. 387"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TEMPLI IN CONFRONTATION the place through which Heaven and earth were in communication, the intermediary locus \"at the meeting-place ofthe two seas\", linking Heaven with the earth.

Heaven and earth have ceased to comunicate: there is no longer either temple or contemplation. From then on the knot of agnosticism tightens around the consciousness, shutting it off from itself. This is the reign of the \"normal\" man, of the man, that is, who conforms to the norm ofPharoah (see above, section II). The world of such a man is a world that \"God no longer looks upon\", that is no longer his concern. An eminent Iranian shaykh, from whom I have learned much,292 went so far as to say to me, some time before he died, when we were speaking about the confident pessimism of Shiite traditions: \"Never forget! The day will come when one will no longer be able even to utter the name of God in this world.\" For many of our contemporaries, that day is already here. The Temple is destroyed. There is no longer any link between Heaven and earth. The norm of our world can assume all manner of names: sociology, dialectical or non-dialectical materialism, positivism, historicism, psycho­analysis, and so on. There is nothing, not even parapsychology, that does not oppose a savage refusal to any so-called \"spiritualist\" consequence that one might be tempted to deduce from one's observations and dis­coveries. The knot which paralyses our awareness is well-tied. The difficulty is that most men live outside themselves, even though they may never have gone outside themselves, for the good reason that they have never been inside themselves. Of course, there is no lack of therapies to make them go inside themselves; but ifthese are successful, it is often even more difficult to make them come out ofthem selves. Deprivation in the external world is followed by sterile stagnation, endlessly hammering out the contours of a false subj ectivity. I would say that the virtue ofthe Imago Templi lies in making us be within ourselves outside ourselves. For we must not confuse introspection, introversion, with contemplation: there is no con­templation without the Temple. The virtue of the Imago Templi lies in delivering the man-temple both from the dangers of an invasive sociology, and from the dangers of a subjectivity which is its own thrall.

The norm of the Temple may doubtless appear fragile or absurd in a world like ours, and the stale of the \"guardians of the Temple\", of the contemplatives \"at the meeting-place of the two seas\", may seem infinitely precarious. Nevertheless, the norm that they follow itselfbears witness to another world, as for the Essene Community of Qumran it bore witness to the fact that the celestial cohorts were fighting by the side oftheir earthly partners. What will the future of this norm be? The answer, it seems to me, comes at the end of Albrecht von Scharfenberg's great epic, \"The New Titurel\" (see above, section VII). Here, there is an episode which has all the impact of a parable of the Imago Templi. When Titurel and Parsifal take the Holy Grail back to the East, they pass through a certain city. Parsifal leaves the inhabitants ofthis city with an image ofthe Castle­temple ofthe Grail at Montsalvat. And with the aid ofthis single image, the inhabitants set about building their own Temple ofthe Grail. This Image is also what remains to us. No more; but no less. No less, because it provides the answer to our question: what will happen in the future to the norm ofthe Temple? And it answers this question because this Image is imperishable, to the extent that we see it rise triumphant in the \"waste land\", from an earth that is spiritually more devastated than the domain of the Grail ever was before the coming of Parsifal. I call to witness the extraordinary vision ofthe castle-temple at Montsalvat which comes in one ofthe most moving pages written by Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Here the Imago Templi, rising like a challenge to dominate the norms of a hostile landscape, can be contemplated in all its purity. The vision takes the form of a study made by a painter who is trying to set down the moment when Parsifal \"contemplates\" the castle -temple ofthe Holy Grail for the first time. \"In shape the picture was twice as high as it was long. It showed a wedge-shaped ravine dividing two mountain crags. Above them both to right and left, couldjust be seen the outermost trees ofa forest-a dense, primeval forest. Some cr eeping ferns, some ugly, menacing prehensile thickets clung to the very edge, and even to the overhanging face of the rock. Above and to the left a pale grey horse was coming out ofthe forest, ridden by a man in helmet and cape. Unafraid ofthe abyss the horse had raised its foreleg, before taking the final step, prepared at its rider's 389"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"THE IMAGO TEMPLI IN CONFRONTATION command to gather itselfandjump over-a leap that was well within its power. But the rider was not looking at the chasm that faced the horse. Dazed, wondering, he was looking into the middle distance, where the upper reaches of the sky were suffused with an orange-gold radiance which might have been from the sun or from something else even more brilliant hidden from view by a castle. Its walls and turrets growing out of the ledges ofthe mountainside, visible also from below through the gap between the crags, between the ferns and trees, rising to a needle-point at the top ofthe pictu re-indistinct in outline, as though woven from gently shimmering clouds, yet still vaguely discernible in all the details of its unearthly perfection, enveloped in a shining and lilac-coloured aureole­stood the castle of the Holy Grail. \"293 This visionary page written by Solzhenitsyn is evidence that the Imago Templi, the image of the castle-temple left to mankind by Parsifal, will never be lost. It is in some sense the response to the geste of Parsifal, and both together are the response to the desperate cry ofthe Templar knights that we heard echoing at the start in an amphitheatre in the High Pyrenees. Together they reply: No! the Temple is not destroyed forever. This was known to Suhravardi also, with whom we began this discussion and with whom it is right that we should end it. Suhrava rdi composed an entire \"Book ofhours\" in honour ofthe \"guardians ofthe Temple\", who are unknown to the majority ofmen. They guard a secret Temple, and those who find their way to it can join in the invocation which returns, like a refrain, in one ofthe most beautiful psalms composed by Suhravardi: \"0 God of every God! Make the litany of the Light arise. Make the people of Light triumphant. Guide the Light towards the Light. Amen. \"294 Paris, Thursday July 25, 1974 293 Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
