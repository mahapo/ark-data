We located the work of Fethullah Gülen and the movement that gives its name to this book: Hizmet Means Service.When the Niagara Foundation, with headquarters a mile from where I live, began to make its mark on the Chicago and national scene, I found an advantageous instrument for beginning to satisfy my curiosity, providing information and the company of representatives of the Hizmet. Th e founda-tion’s work also attracted me for its interfaith enterprises. Th rough several years of interaction, its leadership and I developed confi dence in each other, and Niagara asked me to edit this collection of essays, which I was happy to do. First, I thank Hilmi Cinar, who was a virtual co-editor, and his col-leagues Yasir Bilgin, Sherif Soydan, Hakan Berberoglu, and Ayse Cinar for their part in helping select scholars and see the project through.Along the way, the development of this book was greatly enhanced by the addition of Eleanor Peck to the editorial staff . Fortuitously, she was working as an editorial intern in Chicago during the year when Niagara and I needed her kind of expertise, which she willingly and more than capably brought to our eff orts.

Scott Appleby as a full-time associate and eventual co-director. Scholars from numerous nations took part in what became a fi ve-volume work, Th e Fundamentalism Project (University of Chicago Press, 1994–2004). Th e authors and editors took pains to defi ne “fundamentalism” and its cognates in an eff ort to deal fairly with participants in the various move-ments. Th ose who inspired the project at the academy were motivated chiefl y by their desire to understand phenomena such as the Iranian revolution aft er 1988 and American Protestant fundamentalism, which was being much noticed in American politics and culture in the 1980s.Over the next few years, our company of scholars dealt with several dozen movements, but there was no question that Islamic-based expressions attracted the most attention and motivated much of the scholarly inquiry. In time, aft er the project had been completed, I returned to my career-long focus chiefl y on religion in America; Appleby became director of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, where he formed and led a new school of global studies. Nevertheless, we and the dozens of scholars with whom we had worked could not help but notice that Islamic movements continued to occupy a great deal of attention on the world stage. It also became clear that, in American culture in general and in the media and politics in particular, ideologically motivated public fi gures oft en treated Islam as a monolith, whose participants were given to extremism and religious fanaticism.

When, on occasion, we and our colleagues were challenged to point to forms of Islam that could be called “moderate,” “open,” or “dialogical,” we explored a Turkish-based but inter-national movement oft en called Hizmet. It is named for its focus on “serv-ice” but is also oft en called a Gülen expression, aft er the Sufi mystic preacher Fethullah Gülen, known for his interest in interfaith relations. Th is same interest had drawn me to study Hizmet as a model or exemplar of a promis-ing way of being religious in Islamic contexts.Th e present volume collects essays on discrete but sometimes overlapping studies of the main features of what we will here call Hizmet. Some con-tributors are Muslim, friendly with but also critical of the movement, and others are academics of other or of no particular religious community or commitments. Th ey do not presume that all their readers have been long familiar with these topics, but they move beyond mere introductions into scholarly analysis of Gülen and the manifestations of his movement.A particular polarity in this volume addresses the terms “secularity” and “religion,” both of which are code names for very complex realities. Most of the topics of the following chapters—such as education, politics, and busi-ness—are normally treated “secularly” in the world we call “free,” which means in this case in cultures or societies where specifi c religions or religion as such are not established or legally privileged. Yet within that secular order, broadly defi ned, hundreds of millions of people practice religions and do not want the state to dictate which religion or whether religion shall be legally favored. Millions of people have died, and many still die, when religious forces legitimate or exploit political or military power to serve their ends.Facing “the secular” in many nations and regions are the voices and forces of religions or religious cultures. Some observers and analysts might cheer or champion the Hizmet movement as an ally on the religious front. Yet they tend to be cautious in their appraisal, because many have seen how the asser-tive and aggressive religions have oft en become militant and sometimes even terroristic. In the face of the theory, rhetoric, and practice of such religions, many would simply champion “the secular.” Being suspicious, they would therefore withstand the appeal or actions of almost any “open” kind of reli-gious movement, regarding them as irrelevant at best and dangerous at worst. In a world of nuclear arms, terrorist activities, and rivalries ancient and novel, assertive religion, when presented, needs to be justifi ed.Th e leaders of the Hizmet movement, aware of the dangers in what we might call “public religion” in Turkey and elsewhere, still see a need to advo-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Introduction • 3cate some kinds of religious emphases. Th ey have observed that, in many dimensions of culture, religion does not remain sequestered in private forms, however much some reverent people who practice a religion may wish it to do so.When we began the Fundamentalism Project as an international, inter-disciplinary, and inter-religious inquiry, we found some academics and other informed citizens who questioned the investment of so much energ y, or even any energy at all, in themes that manifest religious phases and faces. Th e doubts arose because, as some said, “everyone knows that religion has no power in the modern world.” Today it would be foolish for anyone to make such an observation. Daily newspapers and hourly reporting in other media focus on and diagnose the place of religion in wars, terrorism, political con-fl ict, and—it is important to note—in positives like health care, volunteer activities, welfare agencies, peacemaking eff orts, and the day-to-day lives of millions.Gülen and those involved with Hizmet are themselves very much aware of the potential and power of religion(s) for evil and good, but their move-ment has helped provide a fresh and needed perspective and a means for developing positive relations among the religions and for some benign uses of religion as such. It is natural to focus on their understandings of the “sec-ular” and the “religious,” as we have coded the central polarity, in the special case of Turkey. Admittedly, those who look on or inquire from a distance (for example, from North America or Western Europe) may fi nd the model of Hizmet exotic, remote, or overheated, but every chapter in this book points to emphases and instances that are analogous to places far from Turkey. As a citizen of such a place, I have participated for decades in inter-faith activities and welcomed the Hizmet movement from the time I began to have occasion to observe and study it. Th is has been the case with many scholars in many nations. Th ey fi nd Hizmet to be a worthy case study—forbidding or obscure though it may at fi rst glance appear to be—as they become familiar with its ethos, program, and achievements.Readers might fi nd the organization of the movement puzzling at fi rst. It lacks a central authority, a clear set of “rules of order,” or a hierarchy that can enforce policies and standards. So unfamiliar is the set of ideas and practices in the movement that it can arouse suspicion in a time when suspicions about religions abound, or it can produce shrugs among busy and preoccu-pied persons who have other issues on their minds. However, having studied the Gülen movement as a scholar, and as a reporter having observed it in"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"4 • Martin E. Martyaction, I have my confi dence in it confi rmed. Th is trust depended on some years of my reading of Gülen movement resources, enjoying Hizmet-hosted events, and—without abandoning scholarly detachment—coming to admire many of its scholars, devotees, and critics. We trust, and here present, twelve informed authors who anticipate the questions readers might have, and who serve as critical guides among phenomena that might at fi rst appear forbidding, confusing, or promising—or, more likely, all three at once. Such readers will fi nd themselves in the orbits of respectful people schooled in and devoted to scholarly hospitality.I will provide a brief introduction at the beginning of each chapter and then step back, leaving colleague Appleby to write the fi nal chapter in which he provocatively assesses the chapters, full of variety and sometimes in con-tradiction with each other as they may be. Forcing ideology or uniformity on the scholars who write about this movement could obstruct the eff orts of scholars and citizens in general who would move on from here, capable of making their own judgments and acting on them."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"5I n a l a n dsca pe w h er e m a n y religious and cultural movements were active, three religious movements emerged to transform late Ottoman and modern Turkish society. Th e movements emerged in a clear chronological sequence. Each created disruptive changes in Turkish religious culture within the relatively short time span of a few decades. Each of them also has an ongoing history. It is important not to overlook that point: the recent history of the oldest of the three movements includes many forms of activ-ity—such as expansion into electronic media or business ventures—for which the newest of the three is better known. Singly and collectively, these movements tell us a great deal about how Islamic religious movements have changed in their forms of self-expression and organization during the past two centuries. Th is is probably the most important lesson to learn from comparing the three of them. Historians with a comparative awareness of early U.S. history will be tempted to liken these movements to the Great Awakenings of that period. Th e comparison is not misleading, yet it is also not very helpful to those who have not studied early U.S. religious history. oneHizmet among the Most Infl uential Religious Renewals of Late Ottoman and Modern Turkish HistoryCarter Vaughn FindleyFull appreciation of Fethullah Gülen requires contemplating the Hizmet movement in the historical perspective from which it emerged and in a global frame of comparison. Carter Vaughn Findley, professor of History at Ohio State University, fi rst examines Hizmet as the latest of the three most infl uential Ottoman and Turkish religious renewals since 1800. Over two centuries, the evolution from the movements of Mevlana Halid and Said Nursi to that of Fethullah Gülen vastly expanded the repertory of options for organization and action. In the past few decades, the expansion of horizons from local to national to global created the added potential for teachings of Gülen to inspire the world of the twenty-fi rst century as profoundly as the world of the twentieth century was inspired by those of Gandhi."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"6 • Carter Vaughn FindleyIn Islamic terms, the movements respond to the pious expectation that every age will have its mujaddid, or “renewer.” In an environment where many religious movements coexisted, it is not hard to see that these three move-ments were the “renewals” of their respective times. It may be harder to understand how they achieved the impact that they did. For a historian, this is an interesting question to contemplate.Th e three movements are those launched by Mevlana Halid, Said Nursi, and Fethullah Gülen. Together, they carry Islamic religious culture of the late Ottoman and Turkish lands from the last great movement launched within the historical forms of the mystical orders into a new age that left the old forms behind to seek new modes of organization and action. Ultimately, this search produced results of signifi cance not only for Muslims but for people of all the religions and all the world.mevlana halid and the halidiye movementMevlana Halid, known in Arabic as Shaykh Khalid, lived from 1776 to 1827, but the critical years for launching his movement were from 1811 to 1827, a period of less than two decades. Born a Kurd near Shahrazur in Ottoman Iraq, he studied there and in Sulaymaniyya. Among Kurds, the Islamic mys-tical brotherhoods (tarikat), whose followers are referred to synonymously by the terms sufi and dervish, were the only institutions that bridged tribal divisions. Early on, Halid was initiated into the Kadiri order, then the domi-nant order in Kurdistan, and perhaps other orders. But then he did some-thing exceptional: he went to study in India, where he was also initiated into the Naqshbandi (in Turkish, Nakşibendi) order in its reformist, mujaddidi form, founded by the Imam Rabbani, Ahmad Sirhindi (d. 1624), a religious reformer recognized as the mujaddid of the second Islamic millennium. Halid’s Indian teacher not only trained him to teach religious sciences such as Qur’an commentary (tafsir) and prophetic traditions (hadith) but also appointed him as his deputy (khalifa) to spread the mujaddidi form of the Naqshbandi Sufi movement in Kurdistan. Halid’s experiences in India thus prepared him to reinvigorate the religious brotherhoods of the late Ottoman Empire and to do so in a way that emphasized strict Shari‘a observance, a requirement that some other orders neglected but that Sirhindi demanded.Only sixteen years passed between Halid’s return to Iraq (1811) and his death (1827), but this relatively brief span of time suffi ced for him to produce"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Hizmet in Late Ottoman and Modern Turkish History • 7the greatest Islamic renewal of the last Ottoman century. Th e appeal of his new religious message attracted many followers but disrupted the status quo for the local amirs and Kadiri shaykhs. Th eir opposition forced Halid to relocate to Baghdad and later to Damascus. However, his expertise in the religious sciences also impressed the strict religious scholars, who disap-proved of mystics neglectful of the Shari‘a. Halid’s impact as both scholar and mystic won him acclaim, even from people who were not his followers, as the mujaddid of his century. For Halid, not only the organizational form of the Sufi brotherhood but also traditional techniques of oral teaching and manuscript production still proved eff ective in propagating his movement; the fact that he expressed himself in Arabic also facilitated the spread of his message among learned Muslims far and wide. He used these traditional techniques innovatively, reportedly sending out seventy khalifas who spread his teachings to Istanbul, where earlier waves of mujaddidi infl uence had prepared a receptive audience, and as far beyond as Chechnya and Java. He found many followers among merchants and landowners. Many of his fol-lowers were Kurds, and the patterns of Kurdish labor migration to Istanbul helped to broaden the base of his following there.Th e Halidiye movement owed its success to many factors. Its founder was both a charismatic ascetic and a man of learning. Strict Shari‘a observance helped win support from the ulema. At a time when Christian missionaries were already upsetting intercommunal relations, even in Kurdistan, and nationalism threatened the empire in Greece and Serbia, demands for strict Shari‘a observance encouraged Muslims and positioned the movement as a force for Ottoman reintegration. Th e Naqshbandi principle of “solitude within society” (halvet der encümen) enjoined social and political engage-ment. In the late Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey, no religious move-ment has gained great infl uence without running into trouble with the authorities, and that was already true for Mevlana Halid. However, he over-came the suspicions of the Ottoman sultan of his time, Mahmud II (1808–39), by ordering his followers to pray for the state. Neither otherworldly like some other Sufi movements nor anti-Ottoman like the Wahhabis of Arabia, the Halidiye thus became a force for Ottoman revitalization and reintegra-tion. Th e two later movements discussed below are not direct outgrowths of the Halidiye movement, but they emerged out of zones where it was the most dynamic, recent renewal movement. In that sense, both the Nur and the Gülen movements are at least indirectly indebted to the religious rein-vigoration that Halid inspired."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"8 • Carter Vaughn FindleyA central element of the Halidiye movement’s appeal was its spiritual discipline. Like other Naqshbandis, Mevlana Halid’s followers performed their distinctive religious rites (dhikr in Arabic, zikir in Turkish) silently. To this, Halid added the practice of rabıta, the disciple’s meditative concentra-tion on the mental image of his shaykh. Halid insisted that his followers concentrate on his image alone. Th is maintained the centralization of the order, at least until some later khalifas permitted their disciples to concen-trate on their image, instead. Performing their dhikr not only silently but oft en alone or in small groups meant that the Halidis did not actually need dervish lodges (tekkes), although they might use them as meeting places. Eventually, the Halidis had more tekkes in Istanbul than any other order but—paradoxically—were better able to live without them aft er the tekkes were ordered closed in 1925. All considered, it is not surprising that the Halidiye achieved sometimes great infl uence under the empire. Naqshbandis benefi ted especially from the attack on the heterodox Bektaşis aft er the Janissaries were abolished in 1826.1Factors like these enabled the Halidiye movement to fi gure for a century as the most important Islamic revival movement in the Ottoman cultural space. So much of the literature on the Halidis is in Arabic, and so much of the evidence about their history comes from the Arab provinces of the empire as well as from other Ottoman regions and lands outside the empire, that the signifi cance of the movement is impossible to grasp without looking beyond the boundaries of today’s Turkey. Aft er the collapse of the empire and the founding of the Turkish republic, the Halidiye movement faced new competition. But its growth and adaptation continued. Strict Shari‘a observ-ance, the silent dhikr which requires no meeting hall, and the principle of social and political engagement all helped the Halidis endure. During the 1920s and 1930s, the harshest phase of republican laicism, some Naqshbandis in the east took up arms against the Turkish republic. At the same time, others applied for jobs in the new Directorate of Religious Aff airs, thus colo-nizing from within the laicist republic’s own agency for controlling religion. New forms of religious organization and cultural production emerged in the twentieth century, and these are most visible in the case of the new religious movements of that century. However, the Naqshbandis also branched out into new ventures in a similar range of ways, from mosque congregations to business ventures and print and electronic media. It is not surprising that the Turkish republic’s fi rst openly religious prime minister, Turgut Özal (prime minister, 1983–89, and president, 1989–93), was a Naqshbandi. Recep"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Hizmet in Late Ottoman and Modern Turkish History • 9Tayyip Erdoğan (prime minister, 2003–14) also comes from a Naqshbandi background. Th e Justice and Development Party (in Turkish, Adalet ve Kalkınma, or AKP), which Erdoğan heads, won three successive general elections in 2002, 2007, and 2011 prior to his becoming Turkey’s fi rst directly elected president in 2014.said nursi and the nur movementTh e man who next created disruptive change in Turkish religious life, Said Nursi, lived a long life, from 1877 to 1960. Once again, this disruption occurred in a relatively short time span, in this case between 1925 and 1944, when Nursi wrote most of the vast number of treatises known collectively as the Risale-i Nur, for which he wished to be remembered. He, too, is some-times mistakenly referred to as a Naqshbandi. However, the evidence indi-cates that he had read widely in the literature of both Sufi sm and formal religious studies but was neither the follower of an existing Sufi movement nor the creator of a new one. By 1925, when the Sufi brotherhoods were closed, not only laicists but also many religious people (in Turkey and in other Muslim countries) felt that the Sufi brotherhoods had outlived their usefulness and that it was time to move on. For practicing Muslims in Turkey, there was an even greater problem: how to fi nd a place for them-selves in a new political system that still recognized Muslim holidays and tacitly assumed that being a Muslim was a major marker of national identity, yet the policies and attitudes of the ruling elite equated all religion with the lowest forms of superstition. Under the circumstances, what people of faith needed was truly not a new brotherhood but a new kind of leader who could guide them toward spiritual fulfi llment in the face of a regime that did not respect that quest. Just at the moment when the early republic’s top-down policies of laicism and populism were at their most aggressive, Nursi emerged to reassert God’s sovereignty. Not surprisingly, the offi cial reception he got was by far the most hostile of any faced by religious leaders under discussion here.Nursi’s life story is a fascinating one, combining human quirks and eccentricities with austere asceticism and inspired vision. Early on, he made an impression, both as a nonconformist and as an intellectual and spiritual prodigy, whence the epithet Bediüzzaman, “the wonder of the age.” Living through a profound personal crisis just as the empire collapsed and the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"10 • Carter Vaughn FindleyNational Struggle occurred, he came to believe that Ahmad Sirhindi, who had earlier inspired Mevlana Halid, was transmitting to him a message to “unif y your kıble”—essentially, to face in only one direction to pray. To Nursi, this meant that his only source of inspiration must be the Qur’an. Spending much of his life in internal exile in western Turkey, far from his native region, he began writing religious treatises, which ultimately constituted the Risale-i Nur. People joined the movement by gathering to study the treatises, thus becoming talebe-i Nur, “students of light.” Nursi insisted that, in this case, the renewer (mujaddid) was not himself but his writings.For purposes of brief discussion, two aspects of Nursi’s writings appear par-ticularly signifi cant. First, despite one prominent scholar’s opinion that the Risale-i Nur lacks overall cohesion, and although the treatises do move back and forth in the sense of connecting modern issues with Qur’anic interpreta-tion, other scholars have found the collection to be unifi ed. In a recent study, Serdar Poyraz has demonstrated conclusively that a clear organization governs the entire Risale.2 Starting with “Th e Words” (Sözler) as the foundations, texts grouped under specifi c titles, such as “Th e Flashes” (Lem’alar) and “Th e Rays” (Şualar), as well as all the other texts of the Risale, have programmatic rela-tionships to “Th e Words” and to one another. Th e mere fact that “Th e Words,” “Th e Letters” (Mektubat), and “Th e Flashes” each contain thirty-three parts, which add up to ninety-nine, the number of the “most beautiful names” of God (esma-yı hüsna), demonstrates that the ten volumes of the Risale have a carefully planned structure.Th e other especially signifi cant aspect of the Risale pertains to its pur-poses and goals. Trials and investigations by the government attempted to determine whether Nursi was trying to found a new mystical order or under-mine the republic. Talking past those charges, he demanded that European philosophers be brought to examine his works. Th ey—or, at any rate, the European materialists from whom Turkish laicists had taken their inspira-tion—were Nursi’s target. Could European philosophers answer his refuta-tion of them? For Nursi, there were three ways to acquire Islamic knowledge: the Qur’an, the Prophet, and “the Grand Book of the Universe,” a phrase from the mystical tradition. Within the universe, just as God “makes the sun and the moon attend to [their] duties,” the manifestations of His omnipotence also include “a magical emanation of true planning, adminis-tering, regulating, purifying and assigning duties.”3 Nursi wrote to prove that the Master of the Universe is the Master of Modernity."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Hizmet in Late Ottoman and Modern Turkish History • 11In addition to arguing that materialist science could not undermine reli-gious truth, Nursi’s movement embodied a new phase in the transformation of religious forms of organization and action. Nursi went far beyond merely abandoning the old organizational model of the religious brotherhood (tari-kat). He founded a text-based movement. During his lifetime, moreover, his movement accomplished the entire transition in the production of Islamic knowledge from oral to textual transmission and from manuscript to printed texts. Unwilling to abandon the script of the Qur’an, Nursi insisted until the early 1940s that his writings be reproduced only in the Arabic script. Aft er 1928, this made it illegal to print them in Turkey. Copying manuscripts became increasingly the occupation of his followers; correcting manuscripts took up more and more of his time. Manuscript reproduction became a major force in perpetuating literacy in the Arabic script in Turkey, among women as well as men. If his followers’ claims that they produced 600,000 manuscripts are even remotely true, then one of the largest manuscript production projects in the history of the world occurred in the twentieth century. Finally, the argument that Latin-script texts would make his teachings more accessible to the young convinced him to allow some of his writings to be typed in Latin letters in the early 1940s; some texts were also reproduced photographically then. A 1956 court decision that the treatises did not violate the law fi nally led to the printing in Latin letters of the entire Risale. Increasing the number of readers into the hundreds of thousands, this started the process of moving the treatises into the mainstream of Turkish media.fethullah gülen and the gülen movementTh e death of a charismatic founder inevitably creates a crisis in the history of a religious movement. In contrast to the lack of a direct connection between the rise of the Halidiye and the Nur movements, a connection does exist between the Nur movement and Turkey’s third major religious revival. Th e Nur movement divided into several branches aft er Nursi’s death in 1960. Gradually, it became apparent that a young religious leader who was also a student of Nursi’s writings was going to become a new leader of exceptional impact. Th is was Fethullah Gülen (b. 1938). In the evolution of new forms of organization and action, beyond the Sufi brotherhood model that had worked for Mevlana Halid, the movement that Gülen inspired takes us again toward new horizons."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"12 • Carter Vaughn FindleyKnown for his austere lifestyle, inspirational preaching, and profound knowledge of the Qur’an, the Risale-i Nur, and other subjects, Gülen has also written a great deal. Yet his movement is no longer text-based in the way that Nursi’s was. Known to his followers as Hocaefendi (roughly “teacher-master”), Gülen has defi ned yet another new model of leadership. Gülen is more interested in action than in writing. Increasingly, hizmet (service) is becoming the key term in the way its followers talk about the movement. As in the case of the Halidiye and the Nur movements before it, the Gülen movement’s success refl ects how well it corresponds to the challenges and opportunities of its times.Like Halid and Nursi, Gülen made history in a relatively short time span. His movement expanded from local to national to global within twenty years aft er 1983. Th e new conditions created inside Turkey by Özal’s decade of national leadership (1983–93) and then the wider changes created by the Soviet collapse and the new era of globalization provided opportunities for the movement to grow. Gülen and his followers have responded to these opportunities in inspired ways. Still localized around Izmir in the 1970s, the movement started with Gülen’s mosque congregation, the local Qur’an school, the Nur movement’s reading groups (dershane), summer camps for male university students, and apartments (ışık evleri) that supporters made available to provide housing and a motivational environment for same-sex groups of university students.Aft er 1983, changes in the law on private foundations (vakıf) led many supporters to create new foundations, and the movement’s decentralization and lack of hierarchy facilitated a proliferation of initiatives, particularly in three fi elds: media, business, and education. In media, Gülen supporters bought the newspaper Zaman (Time) and made it into a large-circulation newspaper. Th ey founded many print publications and expanded into elec-tronic media with Samanyolu (Milky Way) TV and Burç (Tower or Zodiacal Constellation) FM radio. Out of these eff orts, the Turkish Journalists and Writers Foundation (Türkiye Gazeteciler ve Yazarlar Vakfı, or GYV) also emerged to communicate between the movement and the outside world.In the same period, leaders of Turkey’s major religious movements encour-aged economic growth by persuading conservative families, who distrusted banks and used to keep money in gold, to put their wealth to economically productive uses.

In some cases, older businesses, like the Ülker chocolate and biscuit fi rm, identifi ed with the Gülen movement, and many new fi rms, associations, and foundations also emerged in associa-tion with it.What is most remarkable since the 1980s is both the speed and scale of the “take-off ” in this sector of the Turkish economy as well as the growth in its members’ philanthropy. Among the new associations and foundations associated with the Gülen movement were the Turkish Teachers Foundation (Türkiye Öğretmenler Vakfı) and the Akyazılı Foundation for Secondary and Higher Education, which owned hundreds of dormitories for university students by the 1990s. “Th e Light” (Işık) Insurance Company was set up by movement supporters in 1995, as was the Asia Finance (Asya Finans) bank, which aimed to expand investment in the Central Asian republics. Th e movement also had its own business council, the Association for Solidarity in Business Life (İş Hayatı Dayanışma Derneği, or İŞHAD). Much of the expansion of Turkish enterprise into the Central Asian republics has been the work of movement supporters.Aft er 1983, it became possible to found private educational institutions. Th is quickly became the Gülen movement’s best-known endeavor. In addition to vast numbers of secondary schools, Gülen supporters founded Istanbul’s Fatih University in 1995, followed by universities in the capitals of all the Central Asian Turkic republics except Uzbekistan. By the early 2000s, Gülen supporters claimed over 1,000 schools in more than a hundred countries. Th e students of those schools are mostly male, but they include students of diff er-ent religions and ethnicities, and there are also schools for girls.Th e Hizmet movement schools in Kyrgyzstan provide a good illustration of what Gülen supporters have accomplished in general and in Central Asia in particular. Identifi ed with the Sebat Foundation since their beginning in 1992, these schools have grown to the point that they are found in every province. As of 2011, the schools in Kyrgyzstan were educating nearly 8,500 students, selected out of more than 50,000 applicants each year. Many of the students received partial or, in some cases, full remission of school fees. Th e facilities were new and well-equipped with laboratories, computers, and smart blackboards.

Naming schools for national culture heroes added to the pride and consolidated links with the local society, as in the case of the Çıngız Aytmatov Boys High School in Bishkek, named aft er the great Kyrgyz novelist.Gülen movement schools have been criticized for educating more boys than girls. As of 2011, this was certainly true in Kyrgyzstan. However, the Silk Road International School in Bishkek was a Hizmet school with a mixed stu-dent body, and most Kyrgyz provinces had at least one girls’ school. Th e Issıkgöl Girls’ High School, located in a former Soviet vacation colony with its own beach on Kyrgyzstan’s warm-water lake, was an impressive institution with an exceptional student body, which was also ethnically and religiously diverse. Th e demand for more girls’ schools was certainly strong. For example, the director of the boys’ high school in another province had to drive to Issıkgöl to visit his daughter, who was a boarding student there; then he had to drive back home and answer questions about when a girls’ high school would be opened in his province. Parents—even if neither one had a high school edu-cation—oft en wanted their daughters as well as their sons to attend the schools. A visiting scholar was certain to be asked to talk to the students and was bound to be impressed by their neat dress, respectful behavior, and mental sharpness. On any given day, the visitor might also be impressed with the con-trast between the young people seen inside the school and those outside on the street. Inside, one saw mostly boys busily studying in white shirts and blue blazers, and outside were more girls going about in tight jeans and high heels. It seemed there was more than one way to be modern in Kyrgyzstan, and more for Hizmet movement supporters to do to contribute to this project. A visit to the Süleyman Demirel University in Almatı (Kazakstan) off ered impression-istic evidence to me that the proportion of female students is higher in the universities founded by Gülen supporters.By 2007, the Gülen movement claimed over six million members all around the world, and it was making itself known for its eff orts to promote tolerance and interfaith dialogue everywhere. Working with members of the movement suggests that its greatest contribution may be in character forma-tion and education. Both of these, and character formation especially, are traditional preoccupations of the Islamic mystical movements, which were the historical precursors of the Nursi and the Gülen movements. To any thoughtful observer of the Turkish scene in recent decades, the need for improved education is equally salient. Gülen has specifi cally articulated the goal of training a “Golden Generation” (altın nesil). Th e downside of this"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Hizmet in Late Ottoman and Modern Turkish History • 15approach has been to perpetuate the historical elitist bias of Turkish educa-tion. However, in countries where the state of the public schools is problem-atic, as in parts of post-Soviet Central Asia, visiting Hizmet schools and encountering their students makes it easy to understand why demand for the schools is so strong. Against the backdrop of Turkish educational his-tory, what is new about Hizmet’s educational role is not so much its goal as the vastly enlarged possibilities created by the collapsing of old boundaries between peoples and religions in a world where the global and the local are present everywhere simultaneously.Even so, as in the cases of Halid and Nursi before him, Gülen’s eminence as a religious leader made him a target of offi cial attack and even indictment in Turkey. As a result, he has lived in North America since 1999. Absent from Turkey, he is present everywhere, thanks to the activity of his followers and the globalization of the electronic media. Th is engagement with global modernity provides the basis on which to appreciate the full measure of the Gülen movement’s signifi cance.conclusionDuring the past two centuries, three great renewals have transformed Ottoman and Turkish religious culture. A leader exceptional for his piety, learning, and vision launched each movement, achieving great impact within just a few decades. At some point, each leader ran into trouble with govern-ment authorities suspicious of change that challenged state control. Th ese renewal movements won many followers largely because they responded par-ticularly well to the challenges and opportunities that Muslims encountered at the time, whether it was in the 1820s, the 1920s, or the 1980s. In terms of their social organizations and their means for propagating their beliefs, the movements diff er notably—yet their diff erences fi t together, end to end, trac-ing a signifi cant learning curve in religious history. For Halid, the model of the mystical brotherhood (tarikat) still worked as an organizational model. In his time, oral transmission and manuscript production still suffi ced to convey the movement’s ideas and beliefs. In compensation, the fact that his movement originated in the Ottoman Arab lands and that he propagated his message in Arabic facilitated its spread to the wider Muslim world, some-thing much harder to achieve for religious leaders who express themselves in Tu r k i s h ."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"16 • Carter Vaughn FindleyA century younger, Nursi inhabited a world where not only laicists but also many religious Muslims thought it was time to leave the accumulated trappings of the mystical brotherhoods behind. Nursi off ered his followers a religious shield against materialism, and he gave it to them in the form of a prodigious body of writings. Th ose writings became the basis of a text-based movement, which believers could join by studying and reproducing his works. Partly in reaction to the secularization of Ottoman print culture aft er 1908, Turkish-speaking Muslims now needed print media of their own. As noted, in his lifetime Nursi and his followers lived the entire transition from orality to textuality and from manuscript to print, and they did this with the huge amount of writing that he produced. Unlike Halid, who oper-ated in the larger space of the late Ottoman Empire and whose writings in Arabic were understandable to learned Muslims everywhere, Nursi lived most of his life in the narrower space of the Turkish republic. As a Kurd dedicated to Turkish-Kurdish brotherhood within Islam, he wrote almost entirely in Turkish, aside from a few works in Arabic. As a result, the fact that he produced one of the twentieth century’s most important bodies of writing about Islam remained practically unknown outside Turkey for dec-ades, even to experts on Islam.Turkey’s third great renewal movement, the one inspired by Gülen, grew out of the Nur movement and also propagated its message originally in Turkish. However, the fact that the Gülen movement emerged more or less simultaneously with the rise of instantaneous electronic communications has enabled it to spread its message around the world with a speed and effi ciency that Nursi could scarcely have imagined. Th e Gülen movement has explored many new frontiers of social organization and cultural production. It has cre-ated print and electronic media. It has set up foundations, businesses, and, especially, schools. It has set the example of how a Muslim religious move-ment can take advantage of contemporary means of networking to off er a constructive and productive engagement of Islam with global modernity.Ultimately, the Gülen movement may prove as signifi cant for the world of the twenty-fi rst century as the Gandhi movement proved for the world of the twentieth century. In both cases, a movement launched within a partic-ular faith has addressed its message of peace and fellowship to people of all faiths and has spread globally by emulation, without formal organization. Shaped by the struggle against imperialism and racism in British-ruled South Africa and India, the inspiration of the Gandhi movement spread to all the world, inspiring the civil rights movement in the United States and"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Hizmet in Late Ottoman and Modern Turkish History • 17the anti-nuclear, environmental, and human rights movements of Europe.

An oft en-cited account states that he was born on April 27, 1941, in Erzurum’s Pasinler (Hasankale) County in the village of Korucuk, a hamlet of some fi ft y or sixty houses. Informally, I was told that November 11, 1938, is the actual date of his birth, and this date has been confi rmed in certain other accounts, as well.1 Th e discrepancy is explained by one source, citing Gülen’s younger brother, Sibgetullah, who explained what happened when their father went to Erzurum to register Fethullah’s birth. He asserted that the offi cial at the registry refused to enter the name “Fethullah,” apparently because he felt it was too religious, so his father returned without registering the birth. Th ree years later, on April 27, 1942, when Sibgetullah was born, their father regis-tered both boys as being born on the same date. Some years later, in order to be eligible for his fi rst posting at the Uçşerefeli mosque, Fethullah had to present himself as being a year older, and therefore he had the registry papers amended to April 27, 1941.2One of the best sources for details of Gülen’s early life is the book Küçük Dunyam (My Little World), which was drawn from interviews conducted in the 1980s and compiled by one of his close associates, Latif Erdoğan.3 Th e idea of the “little world” or “small universe” may be a humble and homey reference to Gülen’s moral and spiritual formation. For many associates of twoWho Is Fethullah Gülen?an overview of his lifeMarcia HermansenFethullah Gülen is globally recognized as a contemporary Islamic religious leader and inspi-ration to an infl uential social movement. For all his reputation and accomplishments, one cannot assume that his biography is familiar to most readers in the West.

Th ere Gülen slept, contemplated, and studied books in his library of religious classics.Gülen was raised in a religious family in the small Turkish village of Korucuk. His ancestors came from Ahlat, a small town in Bitlis Province situ-ated in the mountains near Lake Van in eastern Turkey. Bitlis occupies a spe-cial place in the history of Islam in Anatolia: descendants of the Prophet were said to have settled there and established early exchanges between Turkish tribes and Islamic practices. Some believe that this mountainous area pro-tected the traditions of Islamic spirituality that began to fl ourish there.Gülen’s father, Ramiz Efendi (1905–74), was the preacher at the local mosque. He taught young Fethullah the Arabic language and instilled in him devotion to the Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. Gülen’s mother, Rafi a Hanim (1913–93), was also an early inspiration and his fi rst teacher of the Qur’an. He comments that, in retrospect, he could not imagine how this extraordinary woman could prepare daily meals for fi ft een to twenty people, do all the housework herself, and still fi nd the time to teach the Qur’an. Th e infl uence of parents and the need to respect them is an important part of Gülen’s formation and teachings. In fact, according to Gülen, parents rank second only to God in meriting devotion and aff ection. In the small collection of mementos displayed in the city of Izmir (as part of a spontaneous museum, prepared in his honor by affi liates, on the fi ft h fl oor of the dormitory of the Yamanlar School), the copy of the prayer book known as the Jawshan that belonged to Gülen’s mother is displayed along with his father’s personal copy of the Qur’an.In Gülen’s own words:My fi rst teacher was my mother. At that time, our village had no elementary school. Later one opened. I began praying when I was 4 years old, and have never missed a prayer since. One of my teachers was extremely hostile to reli-gion and could not accept this activity. Another teacher, Belma, liked me very much and would say: “One day a young lieutenant will pass over Galata Bridge. It is as if I were watching him now.”I ran all of the errands for my family, helped my mother with the house-work, and herded our cows and sheep. In my free time, I would read a book or memorize the Qur’an. When my father was an imam at Alvar village, I learned how to read the Qur’an with the correct pronunciation and rhythm from Haci Sidki Efendi of Hasankale, our district. I did not have a place to stay in Hasankale, so I had to walk back and forth on the 7- to 8-kilometer road.4"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"20 • Marcia HermansenGülen was the third of eleven brothers and sisters, three of whom died in childhood. Th ey were a closely knit family to whom he was very attached. A story is told that, when Gülen left home, his brother Mesih was so aggrieved that he did not speak for several years, until Gülen returned for a visit. Th e family home was always open to guests, and scholars were especially wel-comed and respected. As a child, Gülen was already drawn to the company of serious and learned elders from whom he could absorb knowledge and gain wisdom. However, the young Gülen had to struggle on various fronts—religious, fi nancial, and physical—to achieve a formal education. In 1949, his father moved from Korucuk to Alvar in order to work as imam of the mosque there. Th is move interrupted Gülen’s primary schooling, and he completed his diploma as an external student in 1958:My father had to leave Alvar. Aft er a period of time in Artuzu, he settled in Erzurum. While studying in Erzurum, I could fi t all of my belongings in a box I carried in my hand. I continued my education under very diffi cult con-ditions. We prepared our food in the same place where we slept. Most of the time we had to bathe in ice-cold water.5Gülen then describes how he stayed in a room that was so tiny he could not stretch out while his roommate was sleeping. Although he was studying for the public entrance exam for high school admission, in 1949 his father enrolled him in a Qur’an school in Hasankale, and he used to walk seven to eight kilometers daily to study there, as mentioned earlier, fi nishing his memorization of the entire Qur’an in 1951.In Sufi sm, Gülen received his early instruction from a teacher in the Qadiri Sufi order, Shaykh Muhammad Lutfi , known aff ectionately as “Alvarli Efe” (1868–1956). He visited his Sufi lodge (tekke) on a regular basis between the ages of ten and sixteen. Some mementos of this relationship, such as the cloak of Alvarli Efe, are also displayed in the Izmir collection.Of this spiritual guide, Gülen writes:Outside of my family, Muhammed Lutfi Efendi had a very great infl uence on me. Every word coming out of his mouth appeared as inspiration fl owing from another realm. We listened attentively whenever he talked, for it was as if we were hearing celestial things that had previously come down to Earth.I cannot say that I fully understood him, because he passed away when I was not even 16 years old.

My intuition, sensitivity, and feelings of today are due to my sensa-tions in his presence.6Scholar Heon Kim makes the point that Gülen’s early education exposed him to both the madrasa (traditional Islamic) and the tekke (Su fi ) styles of imparting knowledge, building character, teaching, and learning.7 A partic-ular aspect of Lutfi ’s teaching that seems to have infl uenced Gülen was an emphasis on tolerance and dialogue.8 In addition, Gülen’s father seems to have had connections to both the Qadiri and the Naqshbandi Sufi orders.9 Aft er Alvarli Efe’s death, Gülen studied briefl y with a second Qadiri shaykh, Rasim Baba.10In 1952, Gülen began studying basic Islamic sources in Arabic grammar and language in the madrasa of the Kurşunlu mosque in Erzurum under the grandson of Alvarli Efe, Sadi Efendi. At the age of about fourteen, he gave some of his fi rst sermons/lectures during the month of Ramadan in Korucuk and Alvar. As he matured, Gülen studied Islamic law, practical and theoreti-cal, from 1956 to 1958 in Erzurum with a teacher called Osman Bektaş (1914–86).11While studying with Bektaş Gülen was introduced to the works of Said Nursi by one of Nursi’s pupils, Muzaff er Arslan, who spent two weeks giv-ing lectures in the area.12 A few colleagues who joined a local circle formed to study Nursi’s works would remain Gülen’s friends and associates.In 1959, Gülen achieved the offi cial rank of government preacher. Due to the Turkish government’s control and certifi cation of religion and Islamic discourse, such offi cial recognition was necessary in order to preach or teach. As is common in many Sunni Muslim countries, mosque offi cials and preachers in Turkey are government employees. In addition to regulating religion, this offi cial status guarantees them a regular salary and pension, and it ensures that only individuals with the proper education and attitudes will hold these positions of public religious authority.During his career, Gülen was posted to a variety of Turkish towns and cities. As his reputation as a preacher rose, he traveled throughout Turkey, giving religious talks and participating in educational seminars. Th ese trips acquainted him with many areas of Turkey and enhanced his appreciation for the hopes and aspirations of people in various regions and in disparate situations. Gülen is known for his love of his homeland. In his American residence, he is said to keep containers of earth from almost every region of Turkey, as if desiring to remain in contact with his native soil."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"22 • Marcia HermansenIn 1959, he was appointed assistant imam at the Uçşerefeli mosque in Edirne. His salary was very low, and he slept in a window-ledge compart-ment of the mosque for two and a half years, oft en reading by candlelight. At about this time, Gülen received several overtures of marriage. However, he has remained single, an unusual course for a male Turk of his social stand-ing and generation. It is accepted that the burdens of being a spiritual adviser sometimes demand personal sacrifi ces of an individual, along with the rec-ognition that it would not be fair to a spouse to join in such an ascetic and committed existence.In November 1961, Gülen undertook the two-year compulsory military service required of all Turkish males; this took him to the far western Turkish city of Edirne, the second capital of the Ottomans aft er the city of Bursa. Because of Edirne’s proximity to Europe, the culture and attitudes that Gülen encountered there challenged the more conservative traditions of his Anatolian background. Kim suggests that this may have provoked him to adopt a more ascetic lifestyle, and Gülen engaged in spiritual retreats and fasting during this period.13 It was to be a turbulent time for him per-sonally and in Turkish history as well. His military commander encouraged Gülen to read Western classics along with his usual religious books, so his horizons broadened. He also performed a retreat at the Haci Bayram mosque in Ankara, remaining for several weeks sequestered in a window-ledge com-partment there.14 Such accommodations were already familiar to him since, as mentioned above, Gülen had stayed in a mosque window compartment for over two years during the Edirne period.15During the February 1962 military coup against the Turkish government, most of the troops were confi ned to the barracks, and Gülen endured a stressful period of uncertainty. By the end of his military service, he had become ill and weak, and he needed to spend some time recuperating in a hospital and later in his family’s home is Erzurum. His next post was offi -cially at Iskander, but he oft en spent time in Edirne and Erzurum as well. During this period, Gülen was frequently invited to give guest sermons and talks. In 1964, aft er completing the military service, Gülen was again posted to Edirne, this time as chief imam at a smaller mosque. Later, in 1965 and 1966, he preached at the Hızırbey mosque in Kırklareli.16It was in his next offi cial position (1966–71), in the coastal city of Izmir, that Gülen began to develop a substantial following, and his mission assumed its initial form and began to crystallize. He usually gave the Friday sermon at the Kestanepazarı mosque and weekend talks in nearby smaller"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Who Is Fethullah Gülen? • 23towns. At fi rst, he was occupied as a tutor and mentor in a Qur’an school attached to the mosque; he was also responsible for tutoring students at a nearby imamhatip, or religious school established to train imams. (A number of these pupils, such as Abdullah Aymaz and Ismail Büyükçelebi, became life-long friends and assumed prominent roles in the leadership of the Hizmet movement.) Gülen initially slept on a couch in the director’s offi ce, and later his lodging was near the mosque school in a small shed where he could barely stand or stretch out full length.17 His preaching at this point was generally in the form of moral admonishments, known as vaaz, and lec-tures on piety. Beyond the mosque, his broad interests and extensive reading led him to participate in cultural and intellectual conferences—lecturing, for example, on the poet and Sufi mystic, Rumi. Sometimes, topics of intel-lectual debate of the time, such as religion and science, were the subjects of his conferences.It is said by associates who attended these sermons and lectures during Gülen’s stay in Izmir that he would prepare well ahead of time through a period of reading and contemplation. Ultimately, he would become extremely tense and focused but also physically drained by the great amount of energy and concentration that he directed to the responsibility of deliver-ing the speech. His colleagues sometimes considered dissuading him from attempting to speak in such a depleted state. However, once he had mounted the pulpit or the podium, a current of energy seemed to enter and animate him, restoring to him the ability to project a larger-than-life presence and force. In such inspired states, captivating and inspiring teachings and mes-sages would issue forth from Gülen.18 His style of public preaching is a par-ticular and distinctive element of his reputation. His individual lectures are oft en cited and remembered by his admirers who attended, saw them on video, heard tape recordings of them, or were simply told about them. According to one anecdote related to me, Gülen, while preaching at the Hisar mosque in Izmir on one memorable occasion in the early 1990s, was so aff ected by a discussion of the war in Azerbaijan that he fainted. His style of preaching may be characterized as highly emotional, and he oft en weeps during his sermons, talks, and lectures.19 In Islamic religious circles, such articulations of aff ect are appreciated and interpreted as demonstrating commitment and sincerity. His rhetoric is moving, dramatic, and anecdotal, and his Turkish language is infl ected with Arab and Persian expressions and vocabulary, evoking the Ottoman Islamic heritage.

It is located in the courtyard of a bazaar consisting of small shops whose revenues sustain the mosque and its expenses as part of a religious endowment (vakf). Th is mosque is fre-quented by students and teachers from the nearby local university as well as area businessmen. Th is social combination was to prove an important factor in setting a model for the future success of the Hizmet movement by encour-aging cooperation between these disparate professional, social, and age groups. A number of initiatives that became characteristic of the Gülen movement emerged at this time: outreach to new sectors of the public; involvement in practical elements of the educational system; and religious instruction in new settings. Although he formally resigned from his posi-tion at the Kestanepazarı mosque in 1971, Gülen remained in residence near the Aegean Coast area, characterizing himself as an “itinerant” preacher until the 1980s.In his memoir, Gülen speaks of his early postings leading up to Izmir:In that second term of my stay in Edirne, I stayed with my superior Suat Yildirim, who was the muft i there. When I met with some pressure during my duty, I asked to be transferred to Kırklareli. I did not stay there long. During my yearly leave, I was transferred to Izmir. I went to Kestanepazarı Qur’an school in Izmir. At Kestanepazarı, I was busy with students. My offi -cial duty was not limited to Izmir, for I was expected to travel around in the Aegean part of Turkey. From time to time I would go to coff eehouses to explain things to the men who were killing time there.Most students at Kestanepazarı were talented. I was not being paid there, because I did not want any payment for what I was doing. At night I would visit the dormitory and cover [with blankets] those who had become uncov-ered. Aft er 5 years, I had to leave Kestanepazarı for some reasons.21Th is biographical excerpt mentions one of Gülen’s striking initiatives of the Izmir period, the Kahvehanesohbet (Coff eehouse Discourse) that began in 1969. Coff eehouses have been and, in many regions, are still a large part of male social networking and evening entertainment in Turkish society. During the Ottoman period, these were oft en referred to as Kiraathane, or “reading rooms,” and some establishments still use this designation on their signboards.

According to his companions on these forays, he was ini-tially greeted with some resistance and disparagement, but in some cases he found receptive listeners, and his circle expanded accordingly.Gülen’s memoir quoted above also mentions the dormitories in Izmir, for it was here that the fi rst Gülen-inspired schools and the fi rst dormitories were built. One of the distinguishing features of the Gülen movement became the new concept of residential mentoring for youth. A story about Gülen that is fondly recounted by associates regards his meeting in the 1970s with a group of businessmen from his congregation who wanted to support some charitable cause. Th ey proposed the idea of building a new mosque. Gülen replied, “Turkey already has so many mosques—what we are going to need now is dormitories for students.”Why dormitories? In the 1970s there was an explosion in education in Turkey and in the Muslim world at large. Th is created a particular need. Many of the students from smaller towns were coming to larger centers to become the fi rst in their families to receive high school and university train-ing. A great need for aff ordable housing and board existed. In addition, families were very concerned about the safety and well-being (both physical or moral) of their children, not only aft er their move to the “big city” but also in the climate of clashes between rightists and left ists that provoked a state of continuous violence. Many parents feared the possibility that their youth might be violently targeted by members of opposing factions. One may also imagine that Gülen’s own struggles to achieve learning in a deprived and sometimes hostile environment made him especially aware of the challenges that these young people would face. Th e exceptional element is that he displayed both vision and activism in choosing to concretely address these problems and by mobilizing others to eff ect this massive project to solve them.Another result of establishing dormitories in various Turkish cities was to enable increasing numbers of young women to pursue higher education. Girls from traditionally religious families were oft en prevented from pursuing uni-versity studies by parents who feared exposing their daughters to a secular sys-tem and the potentially alienating or corrosive infl uence in a new environ-ment. Th e educational system in Turkey is such that admission to university studies is based on competitive exams that not only determine the subjects that one may pursue but also oft en necessitate relocating to attend universities"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"26 • Marcia Hermansenwhere openings in specifi c fi elds are available. Naturally, the idea of girls leav-ing home for studies was threatening to traditional families. Alternatively, the new Gülen dormitories were perceived as providing a safe and wholesome environment, both physically and morally. Typical of the debates that were going on in this period is an account related to me by a young Turkish-American lawyer, the fi rst in his family to attend college, who described his parents’ discussing sending their sons and daughters to university. Th e mother insisted that, if the father deprived his daughters of this opportunity, then the sons also should not be further educated. Th e availability of Gülen dormito-ries and networks made such choices much easier for families, and a new cohort of females commenced higher education.Th ese dormitories and schools were more than structures and effi ciently run institutions. Th e spirit that infused them arose from Gülen’s call to fos-ter a “Golden Generation” that would restore, heal, and carry forward the best potentials of humanity in harmony with a modern and pluralistic world. At the heart of these environments was the human capital, dorm mentors, known as “belletmen” in Turkish, along with school teachers who would work selfl essly with their pupils, seeing them as individuals needing positive role models and dedicated mentoring.Another Hizmet initiative that was expanded during this period were the summer camps held for the students surrounding Gülen. Th ese camps started in 1968 and rapidly drew increasing numbers of young male attend-ees. At the same time, despite a relatively low profi le, the camps were periodi-cally visited by military detachments and even on occasion by politicians looking for support.I was invited to observe a Hizmet “camp” in the United States during the Christmas holidays of 2005 in the Chicago area. My pre-existing impression of camps was of tents pitched in a forest. Th is camp, however, was held in a summer resort hotel for which a very appealing rate could be negotiated dur-ing the winter season, especially at a time when most American families were at home with relatives.Th e activities of this camp consisted of reading and discussing religious writings, including Gülen’s book on the Prophet Muhammad, Infi nite Light.22 No dramatic religious practices took place, just a simple round of communal ritual prayers and devotions.23 Evening lectures were presented by visiting senior teachers (abiler) and a few outside guests. Almost all ses-sions were conducted in Turkish. It was a family atmosphere with special classes and activities for children and young people."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Who Is Fethullah Gülen? • 27It did not occur to me to ask—why call it a “camp”? It was only later that I learned about the fi rst camps and their place in the memory of the Gülen movement from one of the fi rst members of Gülen’s circle in Turkey, a man who was an early affi liate from the days of the Kestanepazarı mosque in Izmir, Ismail Büyükçelebi.24Aft er his evening discourse (sohbet) in Chicago, I was granted an inter-view, conducted in Turkish. Th e following account of the fi rst camp, held in 1968, is based on my notes:At the fi rst camp in 1968, there were about 50 students from local high schools and colleges in attendance. Th ey lived in tents in an open fi eld at Kaynaklar village near Izmir. It was in the open air, and there was a row of pine trees on one side of the fi eld. Th ere was a one-room house that had been used as a barn and needed to be cleaned up. For cooking, we made a hearth out of stones.All the [male] students were used to dorm life and had never cooked. Th ey learned by experience, taking turns and having Hocaefendi [i.e., Gülen] comment on the meals as they were progressing.Th e water came from a well and there was no electricity, only the light of oil lamps.Th e only place to do laundry was in a stream located about 30 minutes away.Th e second year of the camp, there were 120 students, and in the third year, 275.In the 1970s, Hocaefendi moved to the city of Enderem and so did the camps for four years. During this period, in fact, aft er the 1971 coup, there was more pressure on the movement from the state authorities. Gülen him-self was jailed for holding the camps because they were viewed as being potentially subversive.When camps were held, soldiers would routinely come and check for clan-destine activities.25When the students were alerted that such a raid was imminent, they would hide their religious books. In order to give the impression that fewer attend-ees were at the camp, they would put one bedroll on top of another.Th ey recited litanies of protection such as the prayer (du’a) of those who were at the early Islamic battle of Badr. One time, Gülen had a dream about the Prophet’s uncle, Hamza. Th e campers later learned that, at that very moment, the jeep full of soldiers who were coming to investigate had an accident on the road, thereby delaying the raid.26Once in the late 1960s, the future leader of the Refah Party, Necmettin Erbakan, came to the camps to attempt to rally support for his party. Th is"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"28 • Marcia Hermansentype of political solicitation, however, was not of interest to Gülen’s students.27In the spring of 1971, shortly aft er moving to a nearby town called Guzelyali, Gülen was arrested and spent seven months in prison aft er a mili-tary coup.28 Th e charge was that he was engaged in activities—such as founding dormitories and holding camps—that could be construed as sus-taining opposition to the secular government.Upon his release from prison in 1972, Gülen was posted to Enderem, a coastal town some one hundred miles from Izmir, and, in 1974, to Manisa, even closer to Izmir. In 1975, he initiated a series of conferences on topics of current public interest, such as “Science and the Holy Qur’an,” “Darwinism,” and “the Golden Generation.” Th ese conferences took him to the cities of Ankara, Corum, Malatya, Diyarbakir, Konya, Antalya, and Aydin.Th e theme of religion’s compatibility with science is a signifi cant one for contemporary Muslims and an especially relevant one for modern Turkey. Republican Turkey under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his successors had embraced a project of positivism and were confi dent that modernity and scientifi c progress would form the core of a successful Turkish state. Many Muslim thinkers in Turkey, responding to the Ottoman “Young Turks” and to the challenges of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, also had articulated the understanding that Islam was pro-science and “modern-ist.” In embracing this theme, Gülen follows, for example, Said Nursi but is more specifi c in his engagement with scientifi c theories such as evolution and with particular Western thinkers such as Darwin.In 1976, Gülen returned to Izmir and was appointed to the mosque in Bornova, near the local Ege (Aegean) University. Th ere he became aware of the plight of talented students who lacked the means to gain university admission without some remedial tutoring. In response, he encouraged the establishment of free tutoring centers to provide this service.29 Bornova had been the site of the fi rst Hizmet dormitory, memorable as a place where uni-versity faculty and students worked alongside workers to construct the building, inspiring local businessmen to contribute further material resources toward this good work.In Izmir, the presence of so many students in his congregation led Gülen to convene special sessions on Friday evenings where there would be a dis-course followed by open question-and-answer sessions. Many of the ques-tions dealt with the challenges of being a Muslim in the modern world. In later years, the students’ comments were collected and published in the four-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Who Is Fethullah Gülen? • 29volume series Questions Raised by the Modern Age that became a best seller in Turkey and has been translated into several other languages. In 1977, Gülen traveled to Germany and presented lectures and sermons there, fi nd-ing audiences among the Turkish guest workers who had come to meet the need for labor.In addition to traveling and meeting with a wider public at that time, Gülen began to have his ideas published in the popular press. In 1979, with the help of qualifi ed associates, he inaugurated the fi rst publishing project of the movement on a regular basis, a monthly journal called Sızıntı that still comes out regularly.30 Th is project was initially undertaken by Irfan Yilmaz, a biology professor. Th e purpose of the magazine was to demonstrate the har-mony of science and religion. Each issue featured a column by Gülen, and usually a striking image or photograph would be chosen, for which Gülen would write a thought-provoking caption. Th ese images were later collected into two volumes entitled Truth through Colors. A close study of their epi-graphs reveals that the seeds of Gülen’s future projects had already been sown, even at this early period in the growth of his following. Gülen combined his visionary ability with a penchant to use natural symbols in a sort of poetic embrace of the surrounding natural world combined with a strong urgency that human life should fulfi ll a higher purpose. For example, the series opens with the image of a mighty waterfall, accompanied by the caption that reads, in the English version, “Th ose who belittled you, considering you just a drop, never thought that one day you would grow into such a waterfall.”31In Gülen’s other writings, the waterfall, as in many spiritual traditions, stands for the power of water, patient and gentle yet ultimately strong:Stagnant waters become mossy; inactive limbs are subject to over-calcifi cation. By contrast, waterfalls are always clean. Th ose who always keep their brains active and souls purifi ed will one day see that they have germi-nated numerous “seeds of beauty” in themselves and all their eff orts have come to fruition. Only ploughed land can be sown; only gardens trimmed and trees pruned yield the best fruit.32Other repeated images in this series include “ruins” and the “ethnographic museum”—representing the idea that one’s life work, and that of entire peo-ples, will be later regarded from the standpoint of history. Th e idea of purposefulness and even of urgency to make a positive contribution is one that is repeatedly emphasized in Gülen’s sermons and epitomized by such symbols."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"30 • Marcia HermansenTh e Hizmet ventures into the print media have expanded to numerous journals geared to diverse interests, the most successful of which, the news-paper Zaman, now has Turkey’s largest circulation. Th ese media eff orts have grown into radio programming and a major television station, Samanyolu (Milky Way) TV, in 1994.the hizmet movement, 1980–94In Turkey, 1980 was a critical year because of the military coup that took place there. On the one hand, street violence was curtailed. On the other, Gülen was perceived by some in the military as being allied with forces on the right. His home was raided on September, and he was put under pressure to maintain a low public profi le. He took a permanent leave of absence from his position as a preacher and did not speak publicly again until June 1986, when he inaugurated the Camlica mosque in Istanbul.Th e period from 1980 to 1994 was nonetheless a fruitful one for Gülen and the Hizmet movement. During this time, he usually lived on the top fl oor of dormitories established in either Izmir or a suburb of Istanbul, or in an educational institute (Firat Egitim Merkezi, or FEM, which could be translated as the Euphrates Center for Education) located in Altunizade.33 Th ese aeries of Gülen came to be known as the “fi ft h fl oor,” the top level of the building where Gülen held sessions for the new generation of young stu-dents, oft en graduates of the movement schools, who were inspired by his message and by the treatment and mentoring they had received from com-mitted teachers there. In some of his writings, the balcony or terrace, or even his small room on the fi ft h fl oor, is memorialized by Gülen as a place where he received inspiration for future projects that needed to be undertaken. Th is time seemed to be a seminal or incubation period for the remarkable initiatives that were to follow. Gülen’s refl ections from this period are among the more mystical of his writings, describing the spiritual and visionary states that he experienced.34In his study of Sufi elements in Gülen’s life and thought, Heon Kim notes how the political environment in Turkey of the 1980s allowed a relative tol-erance of Islam. Gü len’s ties to prominent politicians, in particu lar to Turg ut Özal, who was prime minister and president between 1983 and 1993, gave him and his affi liates some offi cial protection.35 Still, in 1986 he was detained and questioned by the authorities, then released. When Gülen made the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Who Is Fethullah Gülen? • 31pilgrimage to Mecca later that year, he was off ered the opportunity to stay in the Muslim holy cities and thereby avoid problems in his homeland. He pre-ferred to return, however, and quietly made his way home unoffi cially across the Syrian border.Th e 1990s marked the opening of two major new horizons for Gülen and the Hizmet movement: expansion beyond the borders of Turkey, and dia-logue beyond the frontiers of Islam.Gülen by this time had become well known on the national Turkish stage because of the expanding network of dormitories and schools, his growing following, and its more visible media presence. He was interviewed by important journalists in the mainstream press, where his views were sought and disseminated. He met with politicians up to the level of prime ministers and heads of opposition parties. Scholars of politics characterize this rela-tionship as mutually benefi cial. Major Turkish politicians such as Özal, Bülent Evecit, and Tansu Ciller, by meeting with Gülen, established their religion-friendly credentials and thereby garnered broader public support. At the same time, these associations confi rmed Gülen’s support for the Turkish republic and the democratic electoral process, thereby avoiding sup-pression of the Hizmet movement and facilitating its expansion. However, both the Turkish political system and Turkey’s civil organizations remained vulnerable to interference by the military.It was also in the 1990s that Gülen initiated meetings with Turkish inter-religious partners such as Patriarch Vartholemeos of the Fener Patriarchate of the Greek Orthodox Church in Turkey and David Aseo, the chief rabbi of Turkey’s Jewish community. Th is dialogue initiative ultimately spread to such a high level that Gülen eventually traveled to meet Pope John Paul II in Rome in 1998.36In 1989, the Berlin wall came down, symbolically bringing the Cold War to a close. In 1994, the Soviet Union off ered its Central Asian satellite coun-tries autonomy, and they became the “ex-Soviet” or “former Soviet” repub-lics. Among these fi ve countries, all had historically Muslim backgrounds. Four of them—Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan—shared both history and language with the Turks. Tajikistan, where the majority language is Tajik, a dialect of Persian, has a signifi cant minority Turkic population.Th e fi rst major international outreach began for Gülen when students and businessmen among his following accepted his suggestion to undertake exploratory visits to these new Central Asian republics. Th ey came back"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"32 • Marcia Hermansenwith accounts of a crying need for development—most critically in the edu-cational sphere. Th us, the fi rst international “Turkish” schools were born.Dialogue has become a watchword in recent years. Political theorists such as Samuel Huntington have drawn a negative map of an impending “clash” of civilizations—based on the diverse histories and religio-ethical visions of competing world blocks—but others, including many from the Muslim world, have proposed the need for a “dialogue” rather than a clash.37 Among interfaith activists, the new framing of interreligious dialogue (as opposed to debate) began with increased ecumenism on the part of Christians, follow-ing initiatives by churches such as the 1962 Vatican II Council convened by Pope John XXIII.Interreligious meetings, debates, and discussions go back many centuries, whether sponsored by rulers or spontaneously emerging through natural human encounters. However, systematic dialogue without a triumphalist objective of conversion or “scoring points” against another faith is generally a modern phenomenon. For Muslims in the Muslim world to take initiatives in this regard had been rare and even extraordinary until very recently.38 We may thus see Gülen as a Muslim pioneer in interreligious dialogue.Th is dialogue actually began not with those from other religious com-munities but among those within Turkey of various ideological stripes—especially the right versus left —that were set up on Gülen’s initiative. In 1994, an organization known as the Journalists and Writers Foundation was established under Gülen’s aegis to foster and support this sort of dialogue within Turkish society. Th e initial promotional meeting was held at Istanbul’s Dedeman Hotel. Th ere, Gülen appeared before the media, stating that “there will be no turning back from democracy either in Turkey or in the world.” Th ese activities become a platform of the movement program both in Turkey and abroad. Within Turkish society, meetings known as the Abant Platforms were initiated in 1998. Specifi cally inter-religious dialogue, which began in earnest aft er 1997, was to become more prominent within the context of the Hizmet movement’s global activities.Gülen also traveled more extensively in the early 1990s. In the fall of 1990, for example, he visited several European countries, beginning with the Netherlands. Cassettes of his lectures and sermons had been widely circulat-ing among Turks residing abroad since the 1970s, and therefore many in these communities knew about Gülen and Hizmet. As he learned more about the conditions of Turkish workers who had settled in Europe, he advised them to “remain in Europe, become citizens, take part in elections, and send their"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Who Is Fethullah Gülen? • 33children for higher education.”39 Gülen also visited Germany, Denmark, France, and Italy on this trip. In 1992, he traveled around the United States, visiting many states at the invitation of Turkish students at various educa-tional institutions. In Ohio, he lectured in Columbus and Cleveland. In Texas, he went to Lubbock and Houston, visiting ex-prime minster Özal at the Houston hospital where he was being treated. Gülen fi nished in Colorado, Nevada, and California, departing for Australia in May 1992.40Meanwhile, the political climate in Turkey was in fl ux. Th e tensions between religious and militantly secular factions in society still persisted. Opponents targeted Gülen as a public fi gure associated with an Islamic reli-gious movement. On the basis of certain comments taken out of context or even inserted into his sermons and public interviews, charges were brought that his projects ultimately aimed at dismantling the secular state. Cassette recordings of some past sermons were broadcast on television that suggested he had the goal of an eventual Islamic state.41 Aft er percolating throughout the 1990s, the anti-Gülen campaign crested in 1999.Gülen described the context of the initial charges against him in the fol-lowing way:A newspaper columnist instigated action against me. It was one of my last sermons in Bornova. I talked about ash-Shari‘a al-Fitriya. God has two col-lections of laws: one, issuing from His Attribute of Speech, is the principles of religion, also called the Shari‘a. However, in the narrow sense they mean the political laws of Islam. Th e other, issuing from His Attributes of Will and Power, is the principles to govern the universe and life, “the natures of law” that are the subject-matter of sciences. In Islamic terminology, this is called Shari‘a al-Fitriya. Respecting these two collections of laws will make us prosperous in this world and the next, while opposing them will lead us to ruin. Th e Muslim world remained behind the West because it opposed Shari‘a al-Fitriya.I explained this matter to the congregation. I encouraged them to under-take scientifi c research and advancement. However, the next day a columnist wrote about this and claimed I had made propaganda for the Shari‘a, mean-ing the political laws of Islam.Th is matter was investigated offi cially by the public prosecutor’s offi ce. Later, this offi ce understood its mistake and referred the case to the head offi ce of the religious aff airs department. Th is offi ce said that no action was needed. But I guess, just as today some people are allergic to the word shari‘a, the martial law commander in Izmir was bothered by that word. He put me under surveillance. Th at situation was very diffi cult. Of course some people supported me, but it was very hard to make the military regime listen.42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"34 • Marcia HermansenTh ese court cases persisted in various sessions and jurisdictions, based on excerpts taken out of context from old sermons and lectures, but nothing concrete ever emerged. Finally, aft er six years, a court in Ankara acquitted Gülen.43 Even this judgment was appealed, and only in 2008 was the acquit-tal upheld.44toward a new millenniumIn 1997, a military crackdown know as the “soft coup” occurred in Turkey when the Kemalist military-bureaucratic establishment overthrew the dem-ocratically elected coalition government, which was led by the pro-Islamic Refah Party under the leadership of Erbakan.Gülen had been in the United States at this time having heart surgery and consultation at the Mayo Clinic. He did not return to Turkey aft er 1999 but instead took up residence in Pennsylvania in a lodge located in a quiet rural environment. Meanwhile, many of the seeds sown in Turkey and interna-tionally during the 1990s began to fl ower. Under senior leaders who had par-ticipated in the early cohorts of Gülen’s students, projects such as schools continued to expand in Turkey and in diverse parts of the globe, and new initiatives in religious dialogue and cultural exchange were taking place. Th e network of Hizmet schools also continued to fl ourish, and, by the new mil-lennium, additional dialogue centers had been established in major European cities, in the United States, and worldwide.Hizmet’s attention to religious tolerance and interfaith dialogue took on increased urgency aft er the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon. By that time, the Hizmet movement had become established in many countries, either through the “Turkish” schools or by means of the activities of cultural dialogue associa-tions. In the United States alone, such centers and institutions had been qui-etly growing since 1997. Th e role of moderate Islamic organizations ready to dialogue and contribute in global contexts and plural societies found increased receptivity and even urgency, both in the West and in the Muslim world.In recent years, as the Hizmet movement continues to grow and expand its global infl uence, Gülen has become increasingly well known outside of Turkey.

However, beginning in 2013, an increasing rift became apparent between the leadership of Erdoğan’s party and a number of groups and lob-bies within the country, most notably the followers of Gülen, who were accused of infi ltrating various institutions such as the police force and the judiciary. It remains to be seen what the local and global implications of this political struggle for the Hizmet movement will be.a day in the life of gülenIn Pennsylvania, Gülen lives near the Pocono Mountains in a building that is reminiscent of a country house or hunting lodge; it is called the Golden Generation Worship and Retreat Center.45 It is modestly but tastefully dec-orated, and Gülen is known for his aesthetic sense and particularity about order and cleanliness. Even in his autobiographical statement about his school days, Gülen noted that:I was very careful about my dress. My clothes were very clean and a little expensive for that time. Sometimes I would be hungry for days, but I never wore pants that were not pressed or shoes that were not polished. When I could not fi nd an iron, I would put my pants under the bed so that they would look pressed.46Gülen does not live in isolation. A number of his students as well as a Turkish physician and his family reside in small cabins scattered around the property that hosts those fortunate enough to have the favor of personal interviews. Th e upper fl oor of the main building contains a prayer room with a balcony available for women visitors to join in the prayers and attend lectures.Gülen’s own training was in a madrasa setting, and his writings refl ect the Ottoman Turkish intellectual tradition. For most of the generation of businessmen and activists following Gülen in the 1970s and 1980s, this knowledge seemed to lie in a remote past. Today, however, we see a revival of this classical learning tradition at the core of the Gülen movement through the education of a special group of students selected by senior mentors. Th ese students, generally Turkish graduate students in theology with a good com-mand of Arabic, study in this intimate residential setting with Gülen"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"36 • Marcia Hermansenhimself. Th is tradition began in the 1970s, was interrupted in 1980, and was reinstituted in 1985.47 It is estimated that seven or eight students are cur-rently chosen each year to join this program.48One scholar connects this style of teaching with early Islamic learning by a group of the Prophet’s companions known as the Ahl al-Suff a:Gülen has been consistently providing personal tutelage over the last two decades to hundreds of theology graduate students. Students gain admission to Gülen’s informal school by passing a rigorous exam in Islamic sciences and Arabic. Th ereaft er extensive study and an ascetic lifestyle await them. Students can remain as long as they wish, some for even as long as ten years. Gülen has been known to have had up to 40 students at times, although given his ill-health this number has dropped to 15 in recent years. In their lifestyle, daily programme and eff orts post “graduation” these students resemble the fi rst Suff a Companions.49According to one interviewee who has passed through this system, fi rst-year students simply listen to instruction and may achieve results through peer learning. In subsequent years, they are increasingly permitted to participate in the lessons and to ask direct questions. Th e curriculum includes heavy tomes of Hanafi jurisprudence (fi q h) such as a fourteen-volume commentary (sharh) on al-Tirmidhi by the contemporary Indian scholar Mubarakpuri,50 or the twenty-fi ve-volume work ‘Umdat al-Qari of al-Ayni. In addition, at least one work of classical Sufi sm by an author such as al-Muhasibi or al-Qushayri is covered each year.51Although Gülen avoids traveling and public speaking today, he regularly communicates with his affi liates through broadcast messages and transcripts of his lectures and discourses available on various websites.52 A specifi c web-site, Herkul.org, is a source for ongoing selections from Gülen’s discourses (sohbets) and other lectures. Excerpts from his talks and sermons, past and present, have been edited and compiled, leading to an extensive and growing body of literature in print as well as to many sources archived in video and audio format. A translation bureau in Istanbul ensures that versions become available in English and other major world languages to meet the growing interest in Gülen’s thought.Gülen personally follows a simple and consistent daily schedule. As described by A. Said Tuncpinar, he begins each day by performing the tahajjud, a prayer that pious Muslims undertake between midnight and the compulsory dawn prayer. He follows this with devotions consisting of recit-ing litanies from the collection of prayers known as Al-Qulub al-Daria.53"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Who Is Fethullah Gülen? • 37At dawn, he performs the fajr prayer, and then he and his students com-munally recite the tesbihat, a selection of pious litanies. He then listens to his students’ readings of either the Risale-e Nur or selections from his own work on Sufi sm, Emerald Hills of the Heart.Aft er taking his breakfast, he works with his students, providing an exe-gesis of passages from basic classical Islamic religious texts, then he rests in his room until the noon prayer. Following the noon prayer and recitation of tes-bihat, Gülen has lunch and engages in conversation with whomever joins or visits him that day. Th en he works on books and articles in his private room.Th e aft ernoon (‘asr) prayer is again followed by tesbihat. At this point, Gülen will give a conversational instruction (sohbet) that is attended by stu-dents and any guests. On doctor’s instructions, he follows this with twenty minutes of treadmill exercise.Up until the sunset (maghrib) prayer, Gülen may perform communal devotions with others. Aft er prayer and dinner followed by tea, he spends time with associates. Following the night (‘isha) prayer, he retires, though he is known to sleep little.54Th us concludes an overview of Gülen’s life up to the present. It is an unlikely voyage from a small Turkish hamlet to training in the classical Islamic tradition, a career in preaching and lecturing, and fi nally to a vision-ary spiritual leader whose teachings have inspired a broad and diverse sec-tion of the modern Turkish public to embark on altruistic paths of service as well as eff ective media strategies to garner support and mold opinion on many fronts.notes1.

Th is is not because Hizmet’s main inspirer, Fethullah Gülen, and his colleagues bring obscure philosophy to bear on its actions. Anything but that. Th ousands of people imbued with the philosophy and traditions of Hizmet are happy to point to institutions to which it has given rise and the discourse it fashions and favors. Complications arise simply because such creations are unfamiliar: they embody and articulate ideas rooted in Islam, the Qur’an, and Sufi mysticism. Jeremy Walton, a research fellow in the CETR EN Transregional Network at Georg August University of Göttingen, here provides context and defi nition to the subject. His writing refl ects fi rst-hand experiences that, as a scholar, he has enjoyed with Hizmet and with the texts that inform Gülen—and that Gülen, in turn, expounds. As a bonus, Walton also shines light on more current events, since the Erdoğan government has exerted particular pressure on the movement. Tolerance and dialogue, as described here, may be in short sup-ply but are needed more than ever in contemporary Turkey."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"42 • Jeremy F. Waltonthen outlined the relationship between institutional organization and phi-lanthropy that subtends the activities of both the GY V and Fethullah Gülen’s Hizmet movement in their aspiration to revivify the public sphere.Cemal Bey’s nostalgia for the Ottoman public sphere and his criticism of contemporary publicity off ered key insights into the institutional culture and activism of Hizmet. He went on to explain that, from Hizmet’s perspec-tive, the institutions of civil society (sivil toplum), in particular the pious foundation (vakıf), are uniquely suited to the articulation of a public Islam oriented toward charitable good works on both a local and a global scale. As I have argued at length elsewhere, this valorization of civil society as a domain of authentic piety and disinterested philanthropy—what I have described as the “civil society eff ect”—is deeply characteristic of Muslim civil society organizations in Turkey generally.2 For Hizmet representatives such as Cemal Bey, the public sphere should be a space that is simultane-ously vivacious, a Muslim analogue of Jane Jacobs’s urban utopia, and utterly separate from the intrusive eff ects of the Turkish state and its politics.3In this chapter, I adumbrate and analyze the discursive traditions, moral disciplines, and institutions of Hizmet in Turkey with reference to debates over the public sphere, civil society, and politics on the part of both Hizmet actors and its critics. My presentation, which draws on ethnographic research with Hizmet organizations—especially the GY V—as well as other Turkish Muslim nongovernmental organizations, proceeds in two broad sections. In the fi rst half of the chapter, I examine the relationship between Gülen’s moral-theological arguments and the institutional culture of Hizmet, with particular emphasis on the cardinal virtues of müspet hareket (positive action), hizmet (s er v ic e), hoşgörü (tolerance), and diyalog (d i a lo g ue). Following this, I summarize, analyze, and adjudicate among debates over the various categories and names that are applied to Hizmet, both by Hizmet actors themselves and by commentators in the Turkish media and public sphere at large.Before proceeding, however, a cautionary note is necessary. As this vol-ume goes to press, Hizmet is embroiled in an ongoing political dispute in Turkey, one that has pitted it against its erstwhile political allies, the govern-ing Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi; AKP) and Turkey’s powerful president (and former prime minister) Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in particular. Although the details of this controversy are beyond my purview here,4 the intense politicization of Hizmet within Turkey ges-tures directly to the precariousness of Hizmet actors’ attempts to distinguish"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Institutions and Discourses of Hizmet Culture • 43strictly between philanthropy within the sphere of civil society and “poli-tics” within the orbit of the state. In light of this politicization, the institu-tional cultures and discursive practices of Hizmet defy the classic anthropo-logical description of culture as a distinct, coherent, and self-contained domain of meaning and activity.5 On the contrary, as anthropologist Talal Asad has vigorously argued, the institutions and discourses of religion in the contemporary world are inseparable from, and conditioned by, the relation-ship between religion and the dynamics of the public sphere and the state.6 Th erefore, in what follows, I explicitly foreground the relationship between Hizmet’s moral-theological disciplines and institutional cultures, on the one hand, and broader public, political debates that aim to defi ne, and oft en to interrogate, these disciplines and cultures, on the other.moral philosophy and institutional cultureHizmet institutions, both in Turkey and across the globe, are remarkably diverse—they include a variety of NGOs and charities, private businesses, primary, secondary, and postsecondary schools, publishing houses, and mass media outlets.7 Gülen’s theology constitutes the unifying bond among these disparate sites and institutions. Th erefore, an examination of the ethical principles that animate Gülen’s theology and moral philosophy is key to comprehending Hizmet’s institutional culture.One noteworthy ethical precept characteristic of Hizmet is that of müspet hareket, or positive action. Th e Ottoman-Turkish theologian Bediüzzaman Said Nursi (1877–1960)—Gülen’s principal forebear and source of inspiration—fi rst articulated the concept of müspet, which is particularly favored by Turkey’s Nur community.8 Nursi distinguished between positive and negative actions in his fi nal epistle: “Our duty is to act positively; it is not to act negatively. It is only to serve belief in accordance with Divine pleasure; it is not to meddle in God’s business. We are charged with responding with patience and thanks to all the diffi culties we may encounter in this positive service of belief which results in the preservation of public order and secu-rity.” 9 Aladdin Basar, a contemporary interpreter of Nursi, illustrates the distinction between positive and negative actions with a practical example: “If you build a house on what was empty ground and then off er it for habita-tion, that is a positive act. But if you destroy it and make it uninhabitable, it would be negative.”10"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"44 • Jeremy F. WaltonIn a panoramic sense, a pious life for members of the Nur community and the Hizmet movement entails the pursuit of positive, altruistic actions, while immorality consists of self-interested, negative actions (menfi hareketler). Due to its social orientation—positive actions not only are in keeping with the imperatives of pious worship (ibadet) but also provide the fundament for proper relationships among Muslims and humankind at large (muamele; muamalat)—the principle of müspet is also a means to and form of service, hizmet. Th e principles of müspet and hizmet necessarily imply each other because they both presuppose and entail the absence of self-interest. In order for an action to qualify as positive, not only its end or object but also its means and the intention with which it is performed must exhibit an absolute lack of self-interest. As Nursi argued, positive action is a means both to living “in accordance with Divine pleasure” and to assuring a harmonious, stable social order in this world—the reciprocal duality of wor-ship (ibadet) ands social relationships (muamele). As an aspect of one’s duty to God as a Muslim, müspet is an apical theological-ethical principle for members of Hizmet; in relation to one’s duty to other human beings, müspet is a comprehensive socio-ethical imperative. Hizmet, as service both to God and to other human beings, encompasses both aspects of müspet.Zain Abdullah, an anthropologist who has conducted research among West African Muslim immigrants residing in the New York neighborhood of Harlem, has analyzed the concept of hizmet (which, in the Senegalese language of Wolof, is transliterated from the Arabic as khidma) among the followers of the Muridiyya Sufi order in an analogous fashion. Although Murids, as followers of Senegalese Cheikh Amadou Bamba are known, have no direct connection to the Hizmet movement, Abdullah’s rendering of khidma captures the spirit of Gülen’s enthusiasts as well: “Khidma encom-passes the total round of one’s activities, both secular and religious, blurring any distinctions between them, since its focus is to transform all actions into divine service.”11 Echoes of the principle of müspet are strong in this quota-tion: hizmet (khidma) demands the integration of all actions in accordance with a comprehensive, altruistic piety oriented toward the fulfi llment of divine service in this world. Here, we can also perceive an affi nity between hizmet and Gülen’s refl ections on the theological principle of taqwa (m i nd-fulness or piety). In his discussion of taqwa, Gülen writes: “A servant (of God) must . . . ascribe all material and spiritual accomplishments to God; not consider himself or herself as superior to anyone else; not pursue any-thing other than God and His pleasure.”12"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Institutions and Discourses of Hizmet Culture • 45In the summer of 2010, during a research trip to Turkey, I engaged in an illuminating conversation with several members of the GY V that exempli-fi ed the interrelationship between müspet and hizmet. Over lunch in the foundation offi ces, I asked my friends to evaluate the recent events sur-rounding the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara and the Humanitarian Relief Foundation (IHH) fl otilla to the Gaza Strip.13 One of my fellow diners immediately pointed out that, regardless of the motivations of the individual activists on the fl otilla or the administration of the IHH, the Mavi Marmara incident had resulted in the opening of the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, an undeniable success. Cemal Bey, whom we have already encountered above, responded with an assertion of the principle of müspet. Although he agreed that the opening of the border crossing was a positive outcome, he questioned the motivations of the activists. In his view, anyone genuinely devoted to “service” (hizmet) would necessarily eschew the self-promotion that characterized the Mavi Marmara activists. In other words, Cemal Bey argued that the ends of an action are not the only criterion of its ethical status—in order to determine this, one must also examine the inten-tions of the actors. By this standard, the Mavi Marmara event was not clearly an instance of müspet; indeed, it might even qualify as an instance of self-interested action, menfi hareket. And if an action is self-interested, it also fails the criteria of service, hizmet.As moral-theological principles, müspet and hizmet draw directly on a discursive tradition of ethical reasoning that extends back to the basic roots of Islam—the Qur’an and the Sunna (the authoritative example of the Prophet Muhammad, as recorded in the ahadith, the Prophetic traditions). Gülen interprets these and many other key concepts through the prism of Sufi theology, as exemplifi ed in his infl uential book, Emerald Hills of the Heart. Crucially, however, müspet and hizmet are also the ground on which Gülen erects a moral philosophy that bridges and synthesizes Islamic and liberal-democratic traditions of reasoning. Th e key concepts of this synthesis are tolerance (hoşgörü) and dialogue (diyalog), each of which is rooted in the ethical dispensation of müspet and hizmet.Gülen and Hizmet conceptualize dialogue as an ineluctable means to the desired end of societal tolerance. Th is means/end relationship suff uses Gülen’s writings—take, for instance, the following passage: “At a time when we are in great need of tolerance, with the grace of God, every sector of soci-ety will stand up for tolerance and dialogue, and the good things that come from this will spread faster than ever hoped for in all directions.”14 As an"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"46 • Jeremy F. Waltonethical practice, dialogue demands the displacement of one’s own interests and desires in order to comprehend those of another; in this respect, dia-logue fi ts the defi nition of positive, altruistic action. For Hizmet, dialogue is not merely a political project or gesture toward religious or cultural pluralism—it is an ethical act in its own right that performs a double service, both to one’s specifi c partner in dialogue and toward the ideal of altruism that Gülen’s writings incessantly stress.Th e ideal of tolerance and practice of dialogue are clear demonstrations of the synthesis between Islamic and liberal-democratic traditions that Gülen and Hizmet forge. Recently, critical political philosophers such as Wendy Brown have interrogated the genealogy and limits of tolerance as a principle of liberal governance.15 As my analysis of the dense relationship among müs-pet, hizmet, tolerance, and dialogue demonstrates, however, Gülen’s con-cepts of tolerance and dialogue cannot be reduced to a simple appropriation of liberal ideals. Indeed, his writings constantly stress that Islam is by defi ni-tion a religion of tolerance, and, at least from his perspective, secular moder-nity rather then religion is the principal antagonist of tolerance in the con-temporary world. Nowhere is this argument more explicit than in a chapter of Gülen’s book Toward a Global Civilization of Love and Tolerance, titled “Islam—A Religion of Tolerance.” Gülen draws on Qur’anic verses, the example of the Prophet Muhammad (Sunna), and the works of Sufi theolo-gians such as Rumi, Yunus Emre, Ahmed Yesevi, and Said Nursi in order to establish the essential relationship between Islam and tolerance as an ethical virtue.16 Although his aim in this chapter is to interrogate and reject the association between Islam and terrorism and, consequently, to render Islam commensurable with contemporary liberalism, all of his sources and prece-dents stem directly from a well-established Islamic discursive tradition.Taken together, the assemblage of theological and moral principles of müs-pet, hizmet, tolerance, and dialogue defi nes the distinctive institutional cul-ture of Hizmet. It is important to keep in mind, however, that Hizmet organi-zations are not only avatars of Gülen’s ethical and theological arguments but also professional offi ce spaces in their own right. Th e GY V, for example, is housed in a large, modern offi ce building in the neighborhood of Altunizade on the Asian side of Istanbul; in addition to conference salons and rooms equipped with state-of-the-art audio-visual equipment, the foundation head-quarters includes the cubicles and individual offi ces characteristic of any cor-porate or NGO offi ce setting. Yet within this familiar offi ce environment, the theological and moral sensibilities of Hizmet suff use interpersonal interac-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Institutions and Discourses of Hizmet Culture • 47tions and the aesthetics of the space. Over the many hours and days that I spent at the GY V, I frequently witnessed the distinctive respect and sincerity (samimiyet; ikhlas) that mediates the more hierarchical, vertical relationships within the organization—this sincerity is a refl ection of müspet and its deni-gration of self-interest, as well as a key moral end of Sufi theology that Gülen stresses in his writings.17 A noteworthy detail of the symposium room of the GY V is the ring of divan-style sofas that line the walls; these sofas are both a metaphor and a means for the ethic of sincerity that undergirds Hizmet. Individuals seated on divans can only address one another in an intimate, face-to-face manner, and the conversation among them is necessarily a conversation among spatial equals, as everyone sits at the same low level.Divan-style sofas, which I encountered at nearly all of the Hizmet institu-tions I visited, point to a more general facet of the aesthetic culture of Hizmet, which I have analyzed at length elsewhere: Neo-Ottomanism.18 We have already encountered the premium that Hizmet actors place on the Ottoman era in Cemal Bey’s contrast between Ottoman and contemporary models of the public sphere. As his valorization of the Ottoman public sphere suggests, Neo-Ottomanism—the recuperation of Ottoman ideals and practices to address the contemporary age—is not just a matter of aes-thetics. Hizmet’s image of interreligious pluralism, for instance, draws directly on the Ottoman millet (community; nation) system, which organ-ized relations among distinct religious communities during the Ottoman era. More generally, Gülen frequently praises the Ottoman synthesis of piety and tolerance; as he writes, “[B]eing tolerant does not mean foregoing the traditions that come from our religion, or our nation, or our history; toler-ance is something that has always existed. Th e Ottomans were faithful both to their religion and to other values, and, at the same time, they were a great nation that could get along with other world states.”19 Beyond such sweeping historical and political judgments, Neo-Ottomanism is also evident in the quotidian details of the institutional spaces that Hizmet inhabits. In addi-tion to divan-style couches—a distinctive appropriation of Ottoman inte-rior design to contemporary ends—another prominent Neo-Ottoman motif that frequently adorns Hizmet institutions is ebru sanatı (ma rbled watercolor painting). Ebru is the preeminent artistic genre in Hizmet spaces, and Hizmet actors eulogize its link with the Ottoman era. Finally, Neo-Ottomanism functions as a comprehensive model of urban space in Istanbul, which idealizes and aspires to reinvigorate the piety and religious pluralism of the Ottoman era."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"48 • Jeremy F. Waltonthe politics of namingIn nearly all of my discussions with Hizmet activists, the topic of politics has loomed silently, conspicuous due to its relative absence. Hizmet representa-tives consistently and forcefully deny that they are engaged in “politics” (siya-set). From their point of view, philanthropy and piety within the sphere of civil society are incompatible with politics, understood as the domain of the state, military, political parties, and their affi liated actors. Th is insistence on a fi re-wall between civil society and “politics” is precisely what I have elsewhere iden-tifi ed as the “civil society eff ect.” Although Hizmet undeniably maintains strong relationships with state actors and politicians, both in Turkey and else-where—in particular, the bond between Hizmet and the governing AKP was quite strong prior to their recent friction—Hizmet affi liates typically charac-terize these relationships as a form of lobbying that befi ts third-sector organi-zations. And while critical political theorists have argued that discourses of tolerance are deeply political, in that they embody the power of liberal govern-ance, advocates of tolerance such as Hizmet rarely view their own practices as “political.” Nevertheless, Hizmet actors cannot ignore the pervasive politiciza-tion of Gülen and his enthusiasts in Turkey. At a slightly earlier moment, Hizmet was lumped together with myriad other Turkish Muslim communi-ties and political actors as part of an anti-Kemalist,20 anti-modernist mono-lith. More recently, the acrimony between President Erdoğan and Hizmet, which achieved a climax with the December 17, 2013, corruption inquiry, has witnessed the unanticipated politicization of Hizmet in relation to the AKP, the principal heir to Turkey’s Islamist political movement. Erdoğan has gone so far as to accuse Hizmet of constituting a “parallel state” (paralel devlet) within the Turkish state bureaucracy.Against this deeply politicized backdrop, public debate over the proper categorization of Hizmet quickly becomes heated. Detractors of Gülen oft en seek to describe Hizmet enthusiasts in terms that deny them a legiti-mate role within contemporary Turkish society. Hizmet representatives therefore tread lightly when naming themselves—in doing so, they respond to a broad fi eld of public, political debate over what, exactly, Hizmet is. In this section, I attempt to navigate a course through these troubled political and categorical waters. I devote attention to a variety of categories that fre-quently apply to Hizmet, including “Sufi brotherhood” (tarikat), “commu-nity” (cemaat), and “movement” (hareket), in order to examine the relation-ship among these categories and the theological and ethical concerns that I"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Institutions and Discourses of Hizmet Culture • 49addressed in the previous section. Following this, I discuss Hizmet’s under-standing of the charitable foundation (vakıf) as both a contemporary civil society institution and a traditional mode of philanthropy within Islam.Among Turkey’s Kemalists, Hizmet is oft en thought of as a Sufi brother-hood, or tarikat (Arabic: tariqa), akin to such groups as the Naqshbandi and Mevlevi Sufi orders. However, despite Gülen’s recapitulation of Sufi theo-logical precedents and concepts, the category of tarikat is entirely inappro-priate to the sociological and institutional forms of Hizmet. Ali Bulaç, a prominent journalist and Muslim thinker, decisively made this point several years ago when he classifi ed Hizmet as a characteristically modern, urban community (cemaat).21 Bulaç argues that the categories of tarikat and cemaat are sociologically and historically incompatible: the fi rst emerged in a broadly agrarian, preindustrial society, whereas the second is characteristic of urban modernity and its modes of social organization. As a social and institutional form, a tarikat is defi ned above all by the hierarchical relation-ship between a shaykh (şeyh) and his followers, whereas a cemaat is a rela-tively horizontal sociological entity defi ned by a shared object or cause (in the case of Hizmet, the aim of achieving a superior Islam through ethical probity and philanthropy). Seen in this light, Gülen is better under-stood as a moral philosopher and theologian than as a shaykh addressing his disciples.Unsurprisingly, Hizmet affi liates do not use the term tarikat to refer to themselves; the category is solely an ideological bludgeon for skeptics and antagonists of the movement. Th e political use of tarikat rests on a simple ideological arithmetic: the Turkish state and Turkish society are (or at least should be) modern; tarikats are the quintessence of a non-modern social order; therefore, qua tarikat, Hizmet has no legitimate role in contemporary Turkish life. An exemplary instance of the political use of tarikat (rendered here as “Islamist brotherhood”) can be found in an editorial against the Turkish constitutional referendum, which passed with some 58 percent of the vote on September 12, 2010. Th e author of the editorial fulminates over the specter of Islamist democracy unseating Kemalist governance in Turkey and comments on Hizmet in this context, decrying “the level of infi ltration of the Islamist brotherhood, the ‘Gulen Community,’ into state institu-tions.”22 Th e description of Gülen’s devotees as an “Islamist brotherhood” exemplifi es Kemalist anxiety: as an anti-modern tarikat, Hizmet “infi ltrates” the sacred domains of the Turkish state. Th is paranoid logic is simple. Th e denial of modernity to Gülen and his supporters justifi es their unilateral"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"50 • Jeremy F. Waltonexclusion from the political process and prospectively categorizes Hizmet as irtica, reactionary and divisive. One of the more fascinating aspects of the recent dispute between the AKP and Hizmet is the manner in which Erdoğan has appropriated and inhabited this paranoid discourse to inveigh against Hizmet. As a devout Muslim, Erdoğan does not criticize Hizmet for its piety, but his contention that Gülen’s devotees have “infi ltrated” the state bureauc-racy in order to create a “parallel state” precisely replicates earlier Kemalist panic.In contrast to the category of tarikat, the categories of cemaat (com mu-nity) and hareket (movement) are multivalent, irreducible to their political deployments. Furthermore, Hizmet enthusiasts oft en apply both categories to themselves, a fact that grants each term a refl exive legitimacy that abso-lutely does not hold for the category of tarikat. Again following Ali Bulaç, I argue that the concept of cemaat eff ectively describes the voluntaristic nature of Hizmet (as well as the Nur community and other urban Mulsim groups in contemporary Turkey): religious communities,or cemaatler, come into being on the basis of the active initiative of their members, who coalesce initially as strangers living in the relatively anonymous social environment of the contemporary city. Th e concept of hareket, in contrast, underscores the relationship between the ethos of Hizmet and its aims: as a “movement,” Hizmet marshals its resources toward the ends of pious philanthropy, inter-religious tolerance, and a public vision of Sunni Turkish Islam.Hizmet actors vigorously debate the virtues and shortcomings of cemaat and hareket as categories applicable to their activities and identity. In par-ticular, I recall a lively discussion that emerged aft er my own presentation of a rudimentary version of this essay (in Turkish) at the GY V in the summer of 2010. Th roughout my presentation, I consistently referred to Hizmet as a cemaat rather than a hareket, but I soon discovered that my audience disa-greed with this preference. Ekrem Bey, a radio journalist and employee of the foundation, disputed my use of cemaat and argued that hareket more accurately captures the sociological and political plurality of Hizmet. For him, the category of cemaat implied a homogeneity that is impossible for a group of Hizmet’s global scope.Ekrem Bey illustrated this with an anecdote. Once, while traveling with several other Hizmet activists in Kiev, he stayed with a Ukrainian Catholic man who had been trained in one of Hizmet’s Turkish Schools [Türk Okulları]. On the night of his arrival, the hour for the nighttime prayer [yatsı namazı] had passed, and Ekrem Bey was seeking a place to perform"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Institutions and Discourses of Hizmet Culture • 51his prayer. His Ukrainian Catholic host graciously opened a small chapel in the building where they were staying so he was able to do so. Ekrem Bey then empha sized that it wou ld ma ke no sense to ca l l this Uk ra inia n Cathol ic a member of the community [cemaat], but, as a product of a Hizmet school, he certainly qualifi ed as part of the movement [hareket].Aft er Ekrem Bey had concluded his point, another member of the audi-ence raised a more fundamental objection. For him, the debate over the rela-tive accuracy of cemaat and hareket was a red herring; rather than deciding on the most comprehensive name for Hizmet, he advocated a focus on the activity of hizmet itself. Unlike cemaat or hareket, hizmet emphasizes proc-ess and ethos, rather than belonging and identity, and one can engage in hizmet irrespective of one’s membership in one group or another.Even as Gülen’s followers continue to debate and adjudicate among the various names that seek to defi ne their identity and activities, Hizmet is also the object of broader public discourse in Turkey. Th is discourse inevitably exerts pressure on Hizmet activists themselves. In the wake of the December 2013 corruption inquiry, Gülen and Hizmet have been especially prominent topics in the Turkish news and mass media. In general, this mass media dis-course refers to Gülen and his devotees as “the cemaat.” Although this public naming of Hizmet as “the cemaat” is not attuned to the conceptual nuances that I have delineated in this chapter, the new hegemony of this term has nevertheless aff ected the discourse of Hizmet itself. During a recent trip to Istanbul in September 2014, I found that almost all of my interlocutors from GY V and other Hizmet networks had begun to refer to themselves as “the cemaat,” though they were careful to highlight the imposed character of this name. Th e recent dominance of “cemaat” as a name for Hizmet in Turkey vividly illustrates the dynamic politics of naming that Gülen’s followers negotiate. Even as Hizmet seeks to name and to categorize itself, it is also named and categorized within a broader fi eld of political debate.Conversely, the sociological and institutional forms of the Hizmet are not exhausted by political and conceptual debates over categories such as tarikat, cemaat, and hareket. Th e cosmopolitan horizons of Hizmet determine a unique relationship to the concept of the ummah (ümmet), the universal community of Muslims. From the perspective of Hizmet, the ummah is best served and organized through the institutions of civil society and their philanthropic activities. Th e preeminent civil society institution of Hizmet, the foundation or vakıf, embodies a direct link to both an Ottoman dispensation of charity and a longer genealogy of Muslim philanthropy: the religious legitimacy of the vakıf"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"52 • Jeremy F. Walton(Arabic waq f), or charitable endowment, derives from a hadith of the Prophet Muhammad related by a companion of the Prophet, Abu Hurairah.23 As an institutional form, the vakıf also represents a tie to the Ottoman era, during which most activities that today count as social services were carried out by religious foundations. Simultaneously, the vakıf is one of the two legal catego-ries of nongovernmental organization in contemporary Turkey—unlike the other category of NGO, the association (dernek), foundations can hold prop-erty and are thereby able to engage in much more signifi cant charitable projects. In this respect, the vakıf is uniquely suited to the aspirations of Hizmet; it con-stitutes an elaboration of the philanthropic tradition of Islam and partakes in a mode of contemporary nongovernmental institutional legitimacy.what might “liberal islam” mean?By way of a conclusion, I would like to off er a few general refl ections on the implications of my argument for questions of Islam, liberalism, and secular-ism broadly. On the whole, I have avoided the topic of secularism in this essay, largely because it remains so fraught and over-determined in Turkey. As I briefl y discussed, laicist-secularist discourse in Turkey denigrates Hizmet by identifying it with anti-modern social and religious forms such as the tarikat. Hizmet activists have responded to this denunciation by assert-ing that Hizmet advocates a distinctly modern vision of Islam, fully com-mensurate with the ostensibly universal imperatives of democratic citizen-ship. Gülen himself has frequently pursued the opportunities that accrue to occupying a position of “moderate Islam” (ılımlı İslam), most notably in his swift denunciation of the attacks of September 11, 2001.24 Th e liberal dis-course of Hizmet actors articulates a critique of Turkish laicist secularism, which maintains an illiberal, monopolistic relationship to matters of reli-gion in Turkey. More recently, the GY V has countered Erdoğan’s and the AKP’s belligerence with a similar valorization of liberal principles. In a press conference in early February 2014, held in Istanbul’s luxurious Swiss Hotel, GY V representatives responded to Erdoğan’s claims that Hizmet consti-tutes a “parallel state” and that the December 2013 corruption inquiry amounted to a coup attempt by reasserting their commitment to “demokrasi, hukuk, ve insan hakları” (democracy, law and human rights).25On the whole, Hizmet’s public statements and self-characterization hew closely to the methods and anatomy of the liberal public sphere, à la Jürgen"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Institutions and Discourses of Hizmet Culture • 53Habermas’s classic analysis. Setting aside this liberal Hizmet discourse for a moment, however, we might productively ask: Do the characteristic dis-courses and institutions of Hizmet elucidate what we might mean by the phrase “liberal Islam”? A full reckoning of this question demands a more thorough treatment than I can off er here.26 Nevertheless, the distinctive institutional culture of Hizmet indisputably articulates a practice and ideal of liberal religion that extends beyond political posturing. Th e appeals that Hizmet spokespeople ma ke to libera l principles in relation to relig ion shou ld not be understood as “mere ideolog y”—to do so would be to dismiss them in the same manner as their critics in Turkey do. Rather, as I have endeavored to show, liberal principles of tolerance and pluralism hinge on the very theo-logical and ethical concepts and practices that underpin Hizmet. In sum-mary, the “liberal Islam” of Hizmet (and I insist on the scare quotes, lest we risk essentializing both liberalism and Islam) emerges along two distinct axes. On the one hand, Hizmet actors advocate a liberal model of religion as a counter-argument to the dismissals of Turkish critics, and, in doing so, they both respond to and embody what I have called, following anthropolo-gist Hussein Agrama, the “questioning power” of liberalism itself.27 On the other hand, the liberal ideals and practices of Hizmet—tolerance and dialogue—are inseparable from the principles of positive action (müspet hareket), service (hizmet), piety (taqwa), and the entire edifi ce of Gülen’s theology and moral philosophy. Th us, the discourses and institutions of Hizmet achieve form both in relation to a broader political terrain and in reference to specifi c ethical and discursive disciplines and genealogies. It is this constitutive duality, above all, that serves as a bulwark for Hizmet against the discontents of its critics in Turkey, secularist and Islamist alike.notesMy debt of gratitude to my many readers is incalculable.

A brief sketch of this controversy is as follows: In October 2013, Erdoğan announced his intention to outlaw all non-state, extracurricular test-preparation courses (dershaneler), the majority of which are affi liated with Hizmet; on December 17, 2013, Hizmet actors ostensibly retaliated by initiating a corruption inquiry focused on fi gures in Erdoğan’s inner circle, including his son. Although Gülen has adamantly denied active involvement in this confrontation, most nota-bly in a well-publicized interview with the BBC, commentators in the Turkish and international press have unanimously interpreted the corruption inquiry as a power play by Hizmet against the AKP. Erdoğan responded by denouncing Hizmet as a “parallel state” (paralel devlet), and, following the AKP’s success in local elections in March 2014, publicly vowed to “root out” Gülen’s supporters wherever they might be found, in Ankara and Pennsylvania alike.

From its origins in Turkey, this movement has grown large and complex, with followers and sympathizers around the world. In this chapter, I will examine the nature of the movement, placing it within the context of a social civic movement, and then explore the oft en-over-looked role that Islam plays in it. Th e importance of religion in the life of Turks remains strong despite attempts to marginalize it, and as such it is a major player in the shape and nature of the Gülen movement.Th is chapter will also elaborate on the undefeatable nature of Islam and how it functions to transform the lives of individuals, as is evident in the case of the Gülen movement. I argue that the spiritual and mystical dimen-sions of Islam—and particularly Sufi sm—have been engines in the work-ings of the movement. Th ese spiritual foundations have been among the least discussed aspects of the Gülen movement in academia. I have elsewhere fourTh e Role of Religion in the Gülen MovementZeki SaritoprakOf course, the Hizmet movement is, at its heart, religious in character. Fethullah Gülen, its leader, is most devoted to Sufi Islam, and he uses this commitment to study and expound on Sufi sm, Islam at large, and the world of religions. Th e question that prompts this chapter by Zeki Saritoprak, who teaches at John Carroll University, a Jesuit-based school in Cleveland, is: How is it religious? He guides readers through features that mark many religions, and he shows how Hizmet addresses each. Th ese include “sacrifi ce, eschatolog y, sincerit y, living for others, meditation on the sacred texts, and prayer.” Th e non-Muslim public, which tends to hear mostly about the political aspects of the movement, will understand Hizmet better if these specifi cally religious themes are clear."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"58 • Zeki Saritoprakexplored the spirituality of Fethullah Gülen, the eponymous “founder” of the movement, and discussed whether he could be a Sufi in a classical sense.1 My contention is that he is not, strictly speaking, a Sufi but that he success-fully combines the principles of Sufi sm with modern life. Because, in prac-tice, he applies all Sufi principles in his life and suggests that his disciples should do the same, I consider this spiritual dimension to be a part of what are called the “nonattached” Sufi traditions—that is, those that are not related to one of the major Sufi orders. According to these traditions, which are essential to the Qur’an as well, this world is transient and temporal, whereas the hereaft er is eternal. An important element of such traditions is drawing on spiritual strength in a variety of forms. Gülen himself fi nds and uses truth wherever possible. For instance, in one of his famous books, Beyan, which can be translated as “Clear Speech,” he uses the fi rst stanza of Rene Francois Armand Prudhomme’s (d. 1907) poem “In Th is World” for its eloquent explanation of the nature of this worldly life:In this world all the fl ow’rs wither,Th e sweet songs of the birds are brief;I dream of summers that will lastAlways!2He fi nds great strength in this way. Spirituality and strength seem to be divergent. Th e movement is full of such combinations, one of which, the bringing together of piety and tolerance, will receive special treatment since the movement’s successful promotion of these two seemingly enigmatic forces accounts for a large measure of its success and infl uence.historical backgroundAlthough it is clear that the movement is an Islamic one, based on the Qur’an and the Hadith (sayings of the Prophet), knowledge of the basic out-lines of twentieth-century Turkish cultural history is important to fully understand it. Th e movement emerged within the secular milieu of the modern Turkish republic yet is rooted in the religious and intellectual life of the Ottoman Empire. Th e last period of the Ottoman state, the period of decline, saw a tremendous upswing of intellectual debates regarding the future of the state, its identity, and its relation to religion. Broadly, we can place the interlocutors into three main camps. First was a group that claimed"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Role of Religion in the Gülen Movement • 59that Islamism was the remedy for the sickness of the empire. Th is group advocated for the application of Islamic law and the establishment of a pan-Islamic empire or caliphate. Th e political Islam movement of the Turkish republic is the inheritor of this approach. A second group advocated for an Ottomanism focused on the revival of the Ottoman state and integration of all Ottoman-affi liated nations. Th e third and ultimately politically success-ful group claimed that Turkish nationalism was the solution. Turkish nationalists wanted to bring all Turks together under one fl ag. Amid these heated debates, the catastrophe of World War I erupted. Aft er the defeat of the German and Ottoman alliance, the Ottoman Empire offi cially came to an end in 1920. On the ashes of the Ottoman state, the Republic of Turkey republic was declared an independent state on October 29, 1923.3Th e modern republic was established on the principles of Turkish nation-alism, and the leaders of the newly established state attempted to gradually replace Turks’ religious and cultural identities with a unifi ed secular Turkish identity. Even great scholars of Islam were praised because they were Turkish, not because they were scholars of Islam. Despite the new republican govern-ment’s open hostility toward the vestiges of the Ottoman state and the sul-tanate, the religion of Islam remained enshrined in the Constitution of 1924. Despite this and other actions, such as the opening of the fi rst session of parliament with a recitation from the Qur’an, readings from the sayings of the Prophet, and the inclusion of Islamic scholars in the parliament, the new government’s original tolerant approach toward Islam was just a politi-cal tactic. In 1928, the constitutional clause maintaining Islam as the religion of the state was formally removed, and the secular system was enshrined. Th e new establishment aimed to direct human energy from the idea of eter-nal salvation to the security and comfort of worldly life; physical well-being was more important than spiritual well-being. Th is new policy was under the infl uence of materialistic philosophy and the French concept of laïcité, a form of secularism somewhat diff erent from that in the United States.Under this new approach to religion, the secularism of the state was no longer simple neutrality between religion and non-religion; rather, the state itself established religious institutions to control religion. Loyalty to the state became more important than loyalty to God. Any possible religious development out of the state’s control was prohibited. Despite this prohibi-tion, it was naturally impossible for the state to control all religious develop-ments, and a dichotomy developed between religiosity by the state and religiosity by the public. Many people would go to the mosques for Friday"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"60 • Zeki Saritoprakprayer but aft erward ridicule the content of the sermon dictated by the Directorate of Religious Aff airs, the highest governmental religious institu-tion. Today, the state still sanctions the Friday sermons, and though local imams have more control over the their content, the state still has the fi nal say in appraising the appropriateness of those sermons.Despite such offi cial constraints placed on Islam, the religiosity of the people has never been eclipsed in the modern Turkish republic. If people did not want to go to the mosques due to some concern over government poli-cies, they would perform their prayers and other religious obligations pri-vately rather than in congregation. Religion has always been an essential need of any society, and Turkish society is no exception. Th e powerful role of Islam in the communal and individual life of the Turkish people, generally speaking, is indefatigable. As John Locke (d. 1704) rightly said, “Man’s [sic] fi rst care should be of his soul.” And again, “nothing belonging to this mor-tal condition is in any way comparable with eternity.” 4Since my goal in this chapter is to focus on the role of Islam, particularly its spiritual dimension, in the Gülen movement, I will not delve into the establishment of the movement itself; its history is discussed and elaborated upon in other chapters. Suffi ce it to say here that the movement can be described as a civic, religious, and social movement named aft er the founder, Fethullah Gülen—though, evidently due to his humility, he claims no role in its founding. Th e multidimensional nature of the Gülen movement shows that it was inspired by religious, national, and universal values. In fact, it can be argued that these inspirations are what give it strength.Th e movement is most famously dedicated to education but also works on social issues, such as advocacy for democracy and human rights. It also devotes time, eff ort, and fi nancial resources to disaster relief aid as well as health institutions, both in Turkey and around the world. Th e movement is highly involved in interfaith dialogue with adherents of other religions, most notably Christianity and Judaism, but members of the movement also participate in dialogues with Hindus, Buddhists, and others. Another dimension of the movement is that, through education, it contributes to peace building in many regions of confl icts, such as the Balkans, Philippines, northern Iraq, and some African countries such as Nigeria. As indicated by scholars of sociology and social movements, “the practical concerns of a movement, and the human problems it is trying to solve[,] have a major impact in motivating people to become engaged not only in a movement but also specifi cally in the work of culture making.”5"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Role of Religion in the Gülen Movement • 61Th e exact number of people affi liated with the movement is impossible to identify because it is loosely knitted and has no policy regarding registration or membership, but it is estimated that the movement’s supporters number around eight million in Turkey alone. One of the largest and most eff ective organizations affi liated with the Gülen movement is the Turkish Con-federation of Businessmen and Industrialists (TUSKON), which, according to an interview with its president published in 2013, has roughly 46,000 members who, combined, own 120,000 companies.6 In May 2011, an article in Le Monde Diplomatique stated that TUSKON has over 29,000 members and includes representatives from over 100 of the 500 biggest businesses in Tu r k e y.7 From a practical point of view, the presence of a large number of participants in the movement from the business world is of great importance because the movement is well fi nanced and has signifi cant fi nancial resources at its disposal. As is well known, Islam makes obligatory upon those who have enough wealth to give away at least 2.5 percent of their income, which is known as zakat. Th roughout Islamic history, Muslims have been using the proceeds from zakat for various purposes. It is given, for example, to the poor, the destitute, and those who are unable to pay off their loans or debts. Traditionally, Muslims also use this resource to build mosques and schools. For much of the twentieth century, the understanding of charity among most people in Turkey was to put a small amount of money aft er their Friday prayer in a charity box. Gülen has done much to change the idea of charity in contemporary Turkish culture. He suggested to his admirers from the business community that they give more and participate in the establish-ment of dormitories and schools. Hence, not only do they give the obliga-tory 2.5 percent but some also give between 10 and 20 percent of their wealth for those purposes. It can be argued that the motivation behind this strong support is not worldliness; it is grounded in the Islamic spiritual life that contributes to such a sacrifi ce.Although the witchhunt begun by Prime Minister Erdoğan in 2014 has exposed deep divisions within Turkish society, this is not something new. In fact, Gülen has been the subject of constant criticism from government offi -cials dating back to the days of the military dictatorship, whose leadership suspected that one day he might try to usurp their political power. In addi-tion, there have been religious zealots who think Gülen is too fl exible about Islam to the extent that he has established good relationships and dialogue with Christians and Jews since the 1990s. His most pointed critics have gone so far as to claim that he is a secret cardinal in the Catholic Church because"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"62 • Zeki Saritoprakhe had a meeting with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. Th ough these cri-tiques continue, Gülen and the movement are always positive and seek dia-logue, even with those who criticize them. On one occasion, Gülen spoke of a columnist, Hikmet Çetinkaya, who had been criticizing him in print for many years. Instead of having hatred toward him and cursing him, Gülen prayed that both he and the columnist would be in paradise, hand in hand.Th e broad nature of the movement again is infl uenced by the all-encompassing nature of Islam. Th e Qur’an strongly emphasizes the impor-tance of giving charity for the sake of God and without expecting anything in return in this worldly life. Th e reward, instead, is in the aft erlife. Th is aspect of belief in the aft erlife is absent in many contemporary social move-ments. However, giving charity just to help other human beings may still have some religious implications, since human beings are regarded as the most precious creatures of God in the universe. To protect and take care of such an addressee of God is Islamic. In fact, Muslim mystics would argue that it is even more Islamic to give charity just for the sake of God without expectation of reward even in the aft erlife.Th ere is no doubt that ideas of eschatology and life aft er death play an important role in the movement’s actions and perhaps may be counted as the most powerful source of motivation. As the Qur’an says, the consequence of every action, good or bad, will be seen in the aft erlife, no matter how small or large (99:7–8). Th ere is great trust in God’s decision, and, therefore, one is hopeful about the reward of God, yet there is no guarantee. One of the say-ings of the Prophet is considered a very good reference concerning positive deeds in this worldly life: according to a hadith, once a person dies, the account that records his or her deeds is closed, with the exception of some groups of people. Th ese groups are those who teach and disseminate knowl-edge, those who help with raising a child of good character, those who leave a copy of the Qur’an for someone to benefi t, those who build a mosque or a house for travelers so that they can rest during their journey, those who open channels for a river or who provide wells and fountains to bring water to the needy, and those who give charity from their own wealth while they are alive and healthy. For these people, their accounts remain open and their good deeds continue to increase even aft er death. It can be argued that this sense of eschatology and selfl ess dedication to education has some roots in a cer-tain type of the saying of the Prophet, which inspired both Gülen and his community. In many of his recent talks, Gülen has said something similar to what he told an interviewer in 2012: “If you go to help others, God will help"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Role of Religion in the Gülen Movement • 63you. Help is both spiritual and material.”8 According to Gülen, this is the way of all prophets. His philosophy can be summed up as: Th is world is not a place of reward but is darul hizmet, the abode of service. Th e place of reward is the aft erlife.Scholars of social movement theory argue that, for a movement to be eff ective, it needs to have a shared identity as well as a large number of par-ticipants. As the sociologist Christian Smith, in a volume on the role of religion in social movements, rightly puts it, “Th e larger the numbers of par-ticipants, the better, for larger numbers of grassroots activists helps to spread work out, reduce the expected costs of high-risk activism, and boost activ-ists’ perceptions of political effi cacy.”9 By providing this strength to any movement—and, in our case, to the Gülen movement—religion plays a key role. It seems to me that one thing distinguishing the Gülen movement from many other social movements is that the Gülen movement prefers to be proactive, not reactionary.It also prefers to avoid disruption and considers itself to be pro social order. As a philosophy, the movement avoids any physi-cal confrontation. It speaks out against injustice yet with no violence. Traditionally, sacred sources share a strong criticism of social injustice, or, as Smith puts it, “[R]eligion’s very sacred transcendence—with its conservative inclinations—also contains within itself the seeds of radical social criticism and disruption.”10 However, it can be argued that, in the essence of Islam, the protection of innocents comes fi rst, which is part of the Islamic under-standing of absolute justice. Th erefore, applying justice should not cause another injustice. Th e movement avoids disruption because of possible transgressions on the rights of innocents like women and children who have nothing to do with that injustice.Th e Gülen movement is considered an apolitical movement, yet it has contributed to the development of a democracy and multiparty system in Turkey by encouraging political participation. For example, in the 2011 gen-eral election and the 2010 constitutional referendum in Turkey, the move-ment, particularly through its women’s platform for democracy, reached out to more than one hundred thousand households to encourage them to vote. Th ese two elections were highly signifi cant in preventing possible military intervention into Turkey’s democratic system. Such political contributions by the movement are generally limited to Turkey and only occur when there is a signifi cant need for direct political action.Th e core of the Gülen movement lies elsewhere. Particularly, it has made important and lasting contributions to education on a global scale. To date,"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"64 • Zeki Saritoprakthe movement has established educational institutions from elementary schools to universities in more than 160 countries around the world. Th ese institutions are established as secular education systems and follow the cur-riculum of the host country. Students receive a high-quality education, espe-cially in math and science. Even though religion is not taught formally, educators act as role models for their students, and a general ethic of moral-ity is an important element of the curriculum. Parents and students might not even know the religion of the educators, but what they surely know is the morality of the educators and the quality education being provided.the role of religionWith this background in the wide-ranging eff orts of the Gülen movement, we can now turn to the role of religion in its principles. To begin, let us look at the environment in which Gülen grew up and received his education. According to available offi cial records, he was born on April 27, 1941.11 His fi rst teacher was his mother, and the fi rst thing he learned from her was the Qur’an. He grew up hearing the chanting of the divine names, the recitation of the Qur’an, and frequently hearing verses from various poems. He him-self memorized the Qur’an and learned many sayings of the Prophet as well as many poems. On one occasion, during an interview with Gülen in 2004, I learned that he could recite over one thousand couplets by heart; I asked if it took much eff ort to memorize all of these, and he replied, “I learned them from the cultural environment and the overall milieu of my generation.”Th e environment in which he grew up was a mystical one. His father, a self-educated farmer who later became an imam, was a mystic and lover of the Prophet and his companions. Other scholars and mystics, particularly the Naqshbandi Sufi master Muhammad Lutfi (d. 1956) and one of the fi rst great modern Muslim intellectuals, Bediüzzaman Said Nursi (d. 1960), had great infl uence on Gülen’s spiritual life. Both Lutfi and Nursi were well versed in Islamic mysticism. Th e fi rst was a great poet, and the latter was a great author of over one hundred treatises that were commentaries on verses of the Qur’an. Although Gülen was, and still is, curious about Western lit-erature and has read many Western philosophers, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau (d. 1778) and Émile Zola (d. 1902), the real religious infl uence that he received was from Muslim mystics. He is well versed in the commentary of the Qur’an, in the sayings of the Prophet, and in the history of Islam,"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Role of Religion in the Gülen Movement • 65particularly the era of the Prophet known in Islamic history as the era of bliss. Th ere is no doubt that this Islamic mystical environment shaped Gülen’s understanding of religion. Although the entirety of Gülen’s life could be usefully examined, in the current context we must limit our analy-sis to a few highly salient fragments.He was a preacher and an imam by training. He led the prayer in the mosque to which he was appointed by the Directorate of Religious Aff airs, and he preached regularly on Fridays. His highly moving and infl uential sermons and lessons attracted thousands to the mosque. He commented on the Qur’anic verses, elaborated on the companions of the Prophet, spoke on the exemplary life of the Prophet Muhammad and prophets before Islam, and taught Muslims to be self-critical. Gülen has been an important exam-ple of a charismatic leader as defi ned by Robin Th eobald: “Th e leader has a mission or message which in some way harmonizes with the basic needs, hopes, desires, ambitions or fears of his followers.”12We do not know if Gülen had envisioned such a large movement when he emerged as a leader in the 1980s. Nevertheless, it is evident that the princi-ples and mystical elements of Islam have contributed to the growth of the founder as well as to the movement. Religion in general and certain particu-lar elements of religion, such as sincerity, have functioned as an engine for the movement. In other words, as Nursi said when criticizing young Turks for their apathy toward religion, “Religion is the life of the life, both its spirit and its foundation.”13 We should note that sincerity in the Islamic mystical tradition is the spirit of religion—that is, one must act with good intention, only for the sake of God, with no personal advantages. Gülen describes such people as “sacrifi cing souls,” those who live for others rather than for them-selves. It seems to me that this Islamic principle has been at the heart of many of the movement’s achievements. I shall detail these in the following paragraphs.It is believed that all social movements confront the problem of motivat-ing their participants to make and maintain a commitment to a collective cause. One can argue in the case of the Gülen movement that this problem is minimized. Th e participants are greatly motivated to sacrifi ce their time, their comfort, and even their fi nancial resources. Th ere is no doubt that Islam plays an important role in such sacrifi ces. It is true that material ben-efi ts may motivate people to a certain extent, yet spiritual gains, such as the pleasing of God, are a much greater motivating factor. Th e power of this motivation is well accepted by scholars of social movements: “Perhaps the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"66 • Zeki Saritoprakmost potent motivational leverage that a social-movement can enjoy is the alignment of its cause with the ultimacy and sacredness associated with God’s will, eternal truth, and the absolute moral structure of the universe.”14 Th is well describes the participants’ motivation in the Gülen movement.Th is power of motivation is clearly seen when one makes a comparison between teacher participants in the schools that are run by the Gülen move-ment and schools that are run by the Republic of Turkey in Central Asia. Teachers and professors employed by the government receive a generous sal-ary, but those who are employed by the Gülen movement receive a very mod-est stipend. Both groups are assigned to teach in poverty-stricken areas, but it is noteworthy that those teachers who are well-paid government employ-ees will ask for transfers and leave their teaching posts rather quickly because of the diffi cult conditions of life in the region.15 Th e Gülen movement teach-ers, who see their jobs as a sacrifi ce and aim at the service of people, which eventually leads to the pleasing of God, stay and thrive in their positions. Such motivation contributes to the success of the schools even though the teachers are paid a minimal salary and suff er through the same poverty they fi nd around them. Such commitment has been one of the greatest accom-plishments of the movement, not only in Central Asia but also throughout the world. Th is idea is captured by Martin Luther, who is purported to have said at the Diet of Worms, “My conscience is captive to the Word of God. . . . Here I stand. I cannot do otherwise.” In other words, people who act for the sake of God and make pleasing God the goal of their actions will see worldly rewards to be minor compared to their high aspirations. Th is encompassing approach, rooted in the pleasing of God, includes respect, compassion, and service to all creatures of God. Gülen oft en repeats a saying of the Prophet, “God bestows His mercy to His servants who are merciful.” Th is is also stated in Gülen’s defi nition of religion, which is considerably diff erent from some classical defi nitions. According to Gülen, “Religion is the title of a deep relationship and love toward all creation in God’s name.”16 It is evident that love and compassion, which are deeply rooted in the religion of Islam, are the foundation of any successful movement, and the Gülen movement is no exception.At this juncture, a question may arise. Why would a movement rooted in the religion of Islam be so interested in such diverse areas of activism? Th ere are two primary answers. First, the elements of the movement’s activism are related to its understanding of the broad nature of Islam. Th e second is related to the universality of Islam, which considers human beings to be the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Role of Religion in the Gülen Movement • 67supervisors of the universe. Th erefore, any activism that relates to the better-ment of humanity is included in the area of interest of the movement. A quote from Gülen gives a sense of the importance of human beings to the movement: “To love and respect human beings only because they are human beings is an expression of love and respect for the Creator. If one loves only those who agree with him or her, then that is not considered a real love and respect. On the contrary, it is selfi shness and idolizing one’s self.”17 One can argue that the people in the Gülen movement are propelled by religious con-victions and that, whatever they do, they are expected to do it for the sake of God. As Nursi says, “Work for God, act for God, meet each other for God, then the minutes of your life will become years.”18 Religion helps to institute the very substance of the movement, including its philosophy, identity, strat-egy, and even its approach to current issues.Th e terminolog y employed by the Gülen movement has strong theologi-cal implications in Islam. For example, a Qur’anic verse speaks of Satan as the enemy of human beings: “Lo, devil is an enemy for you, so treat him as an enemy” (35:6). Th is Qur’anic concept of enemy, which is equated with the devil, is employed by the movement for some social problems such as igno-rance, poverty, and disunity. Th e movement sees these problems as enemies just as the devil is an enemy in the Qur’an. Th e struggle against these ene-mies should, of course, be appropriate to the nature of the enemy. Th erefore, a struggle against ignorance is to be fought with knowledge through educa-tional institutions. A struggle against poverty is to be fought with the arts, which include technology, agriculture, and trade. A struggle against disu-nity is to be fought by improving unity and harmony within the community. All of these enemies are addressed in the Qur’an. For example, to overcome ignorance, the Qur’an commands, “Read” (96:1). To overcome poverty, the Qur’an commands, “Give charity” (2:43, 83, 177, and 5:55). To overcome dis-unity, the Qur’an reminds human beings that they are all created from one male and one female, with no superiority of one over the other. Th ey are created to know each other rather than to fi ght each other (49:13).Several other religious factors that contributed to the activism of the movement can be cited in this context. It can be arg ued that the most impor-tant factor frequently emphasized and understood as an essential ingredient of the movement is sincerity. A short work on sincerity, taken from the writ-ings of Nursi, is expected to be read at least once a fortnight; in it, the pur-pose of actions is described as “only to have the pleasing of God.” If God wills, He will make others pleased with your actions as well. Th erefore, all"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"68 • Zeki Saritoprakactions should be done sincerely for the sake of God. Another religious fac-tor is a strong devotion to God, which connects the people of the movement and brings them to a shared value. Perhaps this is the engine of persistent activism, emphasized by Gülen when he says, “I have devoted myself to this cause, I have forbidden to myself to think anything other than this. I know this is not objective, not for everybody, but this is my way. I am a weak per-son, I cannot carry two things on my shoulder, I am carrying only one thing, which is my cause to serve God through serving humanity.”19Another important religious factor in the movement is the emphasis on quality human beings. Th roughout the writings of Gülen, one can see descriptions of the type of people he wants in his movement. He believes that, without them, success is impossible. Summarizing the importance of these factors, sincerity and quality human beings, Gülen says:When the basic elements of sincere friendship penetrate the outer and inner senses and faculties of heroes of nearness to God, they save such people from partial thoughts about things and events, causing them to reach the horizon of unity in all their sensations, impressions, perceptions, considerations, logi-cal or rational comments, and evaluations. Th ese heroes are raised, each according to their own capacity, to a comprehensive observation of things with their reason, mind, senses, consciousness, hearts, and secrets [another inner faculty], and this causes them to observe through the telescope of their outer and inner senses indescribable scenes, multifarious but one within the other, and bearing the stamp of the same One Maker.20Sociologists generally agree with Gülen’s focus on having quality people in the movement and the importance of their values on a movement’s success. Stephen Hart says, “Th ese [values and views of reality] are appropriated, transformed, and then used by movements to guide their activities and also to articulate movement purposes and garner support.”21 People in the Gülen movement allow the values most important to them to guide and grow the movement, which is one reason for its popularity and signifi cant achievements.In talking about the role of religion in the Gülen movement, it is neces-sary to examine the powerful role that the sacred text, the Holy Qur’an, plays. Th e Qur’an is the eternal message of God—for the past, for today, and for tomorrow. Unlike some other books of Divine revelation, its audience is not limited to one group of people, nor is its inspiration limited to a certain period of time. Such sacred transcendence is a source of devotion as well as motivation. Th e Qur’an connects its readers to the realm of the unseen, the"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Role of Religion in the Gülen Movement • 69realm of eternity. Th erefore, there is a world beyond this material world that is the real destination of all human beings, emphasized in about one third of the Qur’an. By implementing such faith in the heart of individuals, the Qur’an helps with the rectifi cation of the character. Th is contributes to the growth of quality human beings, who are essential elements for the success of the movement. Th is faith in the aft erlife and in the transcendent sacred source is what some scholars of social movements refer to when they speak of timeless truths, which are “believed to exist above and beyond the temporal, mundane, material world that we observe empirically.”22 Th e Qur’an, through its recitation and contemplation, has a powerful role in mobilizing people to do good works. For example, it addresses all human beings when it says, “Vie with one another in good works” (2:148).Th e Qur’an also provides a daily inspirational source against any possible hopelessness or frustration. Many principles of the Gülen movement, such as the principle of working for justice and nonviolence, are inspired by the teachings of the Qur’an, emphasized in the verse “Peace is better” (4:128). Despite the fact that Gülen himself was imprisoned and persecuted, he never sought retaliation but instead promoted peace. It can be argued that this practice was taken from the Qur’an. For Gülen, the Qur’anic verse “No soul shall bear another’s guilt” (6:164) closes all doors of violence and consti-tutes a central principle for the movement’s philosophy of nonviolence. Th is is because violence cannot usually be limited to the criminal; many inno-cents are also aff ected by actions of violence. Th eologically speaking, an individual may be a criminal, but his or her close relatives may be perfectly innocent. Th erefore, any violence might transgress on the rights of those innocents.Th e Qur’an inspires creative thinking, as well. To give one example, dur-ing the military coup of 1980 the government tried to take control of all private foundations in Turkey. For Gülen, this meant that many of his schools and dormitories, which were nonprofi t institutions, would be taken over and run by the government. Th is was troubling him but, while reciting the Qur’an, he became inspired. In Sura 18 is a story about Moses and a friend, Khidr, who were traveling on a ship. Khidr bored a hole in the boat, an act that upset Moses. When asked why he had vandalized the boat, Khidr replied that the oppressive ruler of their destination confi scated all perfect ships. Th e hole in the boat, therefore, saved the ship from being confi scated by the ruler, and the poor people who owned the boat were able to keep it. Inspired by this story, Gülen decided to start construction next to each of"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"70 • Zeki Saritoprakhis schools and dormitories. When the government offi cials saw the con-struction and realized that taking them over meant paying for the construc-tion, they let Gülen keep them.Like the Qur’anic texts, powerful narratives about the Prophet and his companions are some other religious factors that play a great role in the movement. Th ese narratives are oft en presented in the form of poems and songs. Generally, devotion and spiritual strength are emphasized. For exam-ple, Gülen’s famous poem, known as “Th e Rose of Medina” (Medine’nin Gülü), is repeatedly recited and has been widely spread through social media. To give a sense of Gülen’s emotional and powerful narratives, here is a stanza of his poem in which he addresses the Prophet:I wish I could sit with your love and stand up with your love constantly.I wish I could rise like a spirit and wander in your horizonSo that I could fi nd a way to fl ow into your heartI wish I could sit with your love and stand up with your love constantly.23Th is type of imaginative narrative provides at least two things. One is soli-darity in the community at a macro level by creating a shared identity for those who love the Prophet. Second, it provides a spiritual strength at a micro level. Many individuals, including some famous Turkish musicians, have used these narratives as part of their music.24 Th is unifying strength at the micro and macro levels turns into social actions through the sacrifi ce of individuals. Gülen describes these people as those who prefer the comfort of others over their own comfort and those who live to make others live well.In both his poems and his prose, Gülen uses powerful, mystical terminol-ogy such as “heart,” “passion,” “burning,” and “separation.” All these terms have been frequently used by Sufi masters when they complain about their separation from the beloved. Th e beloved can be the Sufi master, sometimes the Prophet, and occasionally God. For the Prophet, Gülen uses the phrase, “Th e rose of my heart.” As an example of his emotional prose narratives, one may refer to Gülen’s famous Friday sermons as well as sermons on the occa-sion of the feast of the end of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and the feast of sacrifi ce, Eid al-Adha. Although Gülen no longer gives these sermons, in the 1980s he used the pulpit very powerfully but also wisely. Th rough the large crowds his sermons attracted, he helped to create a level of peace and unity between confl icting political groups in the country, namely nationalists and commu-nists. He strongly advised his admirers to calm tensions between these groups. Th ese spiritual ingredients of the movement are missing from many"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The Role of Religion in the Gülen Movement • 71political movements of our time. Due to the lack of this spiritual dimension, political demonstrations and protests become more important than activi-ties designed to strengthen individuals spiritually. Political movements that do not involve spiritual elements may be more inclined to violence. It can be argued that Gülen’s early sermons were the seeds for today’s fl ourishing Hizmet movement and its peace-building eff orts.A brief analysis of one of Gülen’s speeches to his inner circle that recently became available on his offi cial website shows us how Gülen takes inspira-tion from the spiritual tradition of Islam.25 Th e speech is entitled “Black Clouds and a Call for Collective Prayer.” In this forty-minute speech, Gülen invites people to pray for peace and asks for a collective prayer to end con-fl icts around the world and in his home country, Turkey. He refers to the traditional prayer to end drought, a prayer well documented in the manuals of Islamic jurisprudence as an inspiration for the prayer to end confl icts. According to Islamic tradition, when a region or country has a drought, all members of the community go out and open their hands to God with the utmost level of humility, asking God for rain. Th e Prophet Muhammad humbled himself in this way, and sometimes even before the Prophet low-ered his hands the rain would come. Gülen suggests that Muslims should be inspired by this prophetic tradition and use the same prayer to end violence and confl icts in their regions and around the world collectively. It is well known in the Islamic mystical tradition that, when any prayer becomes a collective expression, it receives greater recognition from the Divine. Th is is not to say that Gülen neglects strategic planning developed by think tanks and scholars of sociology, psychology, and political science to fi nd solutions to certain confl icts. Indeed, the two go together—prayer and planning.In conclusion, the religion of Islam, with its great spiritual strength, includes many parts. In the Gülen movement, these parts—sacrifi ce, escha-tology, sincerity, living for others, meditation on the sacred texts, and prayer—are connected and function together like the engine of a machine. Th e movement’s apolitical understanding of religion, which is considerably diff erent from modern political Islamic movements, is the compass that directs its activities and goals. All the dimensions discussed above with regard to the motivation of the Gülen movement invalidate the criticisms of those who say that the movement looks for materialistic benefi ts and politi-cal positions. Working for material benefi ts instead of spiritual fulfi llment would be—for people of the movement—like choosing tin over gold.

In turn, this has given rise to many research projects looking at the philosophy and practice of the movement. In this chapter, I will lay out some of the key features of this movement that has excited so much interest and will set these in the con-temporary global context. In the fi rst part, I briefl y consider a sociological analysis of the Hizmet movement, noting that it does not fi t easily into any conventional typologies. I then suggest some reasons for this, including Gülen’s holistic approach, his synoptic thinking, and the plural identity of the movement. I note that this enables the movement to eff ectively build bridges across many diff erent divides: religious and secular, diff erent cul-tures and faiths, and diff erent academic disciplines, practices, and theories.I then suggest that central to the building of these bridges is dialogue of a particular kind, which sets the movement apart from many other attempts fiveBuilding Bridgesgülen pontifexSimon RobinsonTh e Gülen movement, Simon Robinson contends, is not a “sect” or a “cult,” as some critics have called it, but is a special social form organized to encourage its adherents to participate creatively in a world marked by pluralism among religions and, oft en, hostility among them. Religious forces and movements tend to defi ne themselves over against all others, inventing enemies and either keeping a distance from them or attacking them. Robinson, professor of Applied and Professional Ethics at Leeds Beckett University, here explores the origins of the Hizmet phenomenon and demonstrates that, though it is inspired by Sufi mysticism, its leaders and members conceive of their work not as agents of conversion but, aft er the model of Fethullah Gülen, as builders of bridges toward people in other religious movements and among secular forces alike."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Building Bridges: Gülen Pontifex • 75at interfaith and intercultural dialogue. First, the dialogue involves critical examination of the ideas, values, and practice in the movement and beyond. Th is refl ects Gülen’s concern for the development of scientifi c thinking, both as a means of developing critical thinking and consciousness of the wider environment and as the call of God to sustain and develop this. Th e second aspect of dialogue has been the practice of accountability, the capac-ity to give an account of ideas, values, and practice beyond the movement both to other key social and religious actors and to the wider society. Th e third aspect of Gülen’s dialogue is based on creative response to God. Th is is where the meaning of hizmet (service) begins to surface strongly, the ongo-ing service as vicegerents of creation. Th is suggests a responsibility shared by the religious and nonreligious alike. Th e question of any dialogue, then, is how to enable that creative response and how to share in a universal respon-sibility that transcends any particular faith. For much of the Hizmet move-ment, education, care, and business become the foci around which this response is negotiated. Th e chapter concludes with the argument that dia-logue bridging the areas noted above is also key to the continued health of the movement. Such dialogue embodies the practice of the key sets of virtues—intellectual, spiritual, and ethical.the nature of the hizmet movementMajor concerns have been raised about the purpose and identity of the Hizmet movement. In 2008, Gülen came out on top in a poll on the world’s leading intellectuals, organized by Prospect magazine.1 It was noted that the number of people from Turkey voting for Gülen increased aft er the poll was highlighted in the the Gülen-inspired newspaper, Zaman. So was there something sinister here, with willing followers being manipulated? Conspiracy theories abound in Turkey, as in any major Islamic movement, and thus it has been a short step to see the movement, at various points, as funded by the CIA, Iran, or even the Turkish state.2 Or, other critics have suggested, perhaps this is an Islamist movement, designed to subvert the Turkish secular state by stealth, through building an Islamic middle-class power base.

Th e movement works against institutional formali-zation.

Th e development and spread of these educational institutions is not centrally planned but comes as a result of dialogue between diff erent parts of the movement about priorities and resources. Hence, cases have to be argued critically about the funding of educational projects. Th is suggests distributed and shared leadership. Th e theological dynamic here is precisely to move away from any sense of ownership or centralized power. Service to God transcends any institutional manifestation and can only be focused on the attitude and action of service. Hence, the focus is purpose, not the person who is leader. I will test this more critically in reference to cults below.Sects tend to be defi ned in terms of their tension with the founding church or institution. Th ey are moving onto a new path. Membership is not formalized, and members tend to come and go. Again, it is not clear that the Hizmet movement can be seen simply in this light. Certainly there seem to be no clear boundaries, but it does not defi ne itself exclusively in terms of tensions with any higher or founding institution. Given the fact that there is no particular institution in Islam to be in tension with, Muhammed Çetin notes that one Islamic view of a sect is that it enacts a new, possibly deviant form of Islam.10 It is not clear that the Hizmet movement could fall into that category, given that Gülen’s stress is radical, in the sense of going back to the roots of Islam, with a strong focus on the Qur’an. His focus is on orthodox thinking and on how this works in practice. It is this stress on practice that makes the movement distinctive."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Building Bridges: Gülen Pontifex • 77Th e movement is infl uenced by the Sufi tradition; hence it might be seen as a Sufi order. However, classical tarikat Sufi sm would require initiation and involve esoteric religious practices and arcane terminology.11 Th is is the opposite of a movement that aims to make itself clear through it actions. Erol Gulay notes that Gülen also goes against the traditionalist Sufi para-digm by playing down the role of a Sufi master as mediator between the dis-ciples and God.12 Gülen sees himself as an inspirational leader but claims no formal authority. Rather, he points to the infi nite wisdom of the Qur’an and the many diff erent ways of accessing that.13 Nonetheless, Gülen and the movement are characterized by a strong neo-Sufi theology that stresses holism, combining a strong aff ective spirituality with refl ection on the Qur’an and the stress on action in one’s social context.Perhaps, then, the movement can best be seen as a cult or New Religious Movement (NR M).14 NRMs have received bad press in recent decades due to negative examples. However, cults are not aggressive or problematic per se. On the contrary, they may fulfi ll many diff erent needs, including self improvement, the desire to make a diff erence in life, a sense of purpose and direction, companionship and a sense of belonging, structured community, guidance, and a sense of self-worth and hope, all of which can be claimed by the Hizmet movement. Cults involve groups that are generally smaller than sects and are characterized by focus on the fulfi llment of aff ective needs only by that group. Hence, members are given great attention upon joining the group such that they feel unconditionally accepted. Th e strength of the bond is then tested by the group in terms of both ensuring orthodoxy of belief and being involved in spreading the infl uence of the group. Th e continued love and care of the group becomes dependent on the person accepting the ortho-dox beliefs and taking a full part in evangelism and recruiting new members. From this emerges the reality of an exclusive and conditional community: you are only valued if you sustain this commitment to the group. In one sense, then, the cultic experience keeps the person in a form of a conforming child, with no responsibility for decision making or sense of autonomous agency.15Conditionality is also associated with polarized thinking, and thus we see the member of the cult gradually turning his or her back on the outside world and viewing it as the source of evil, leading to confl ict with the fami-lies of converts to the NRM in question. Conditionality is related directly to the incapacity to handle the plurality and ambiguity of the “other.” Hence, the cult member will tend to see the family as accepting the condi-tions of the cult or not, as either good or bad."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"78 • Simon RobinsonTh e dynamics of dependence in a cult are also rooted in the perception of the leader of the NRM as the source of truth and, by extension, the ground of faith. Th e leader thus cannot be questioned and is most oft en not account-able. All of this leads to a judgmental ethics based on strict adherence to conditions and rules. It is not surprising that cults tend to have small num-bers of members, that they are not transparent (indeed, are secretive), and that they focus on orthodox thinking rather than public or practical action. In extreme cases, they are associated with myths and rites that are anti-rational and even subversive, leading to violence.16Th e Hizmet movement diff ers markedly from a cult in several ways. First, it is not small. Second, Gülen does not take on the directive role of a cult leader. On the contrary, he points to the primacy of the scriptures—and the imperative of service—and stresses the responsibility of the individual or the diff erent groups within the movement to develop ideas and practice, to put fl esh on the obligation to serve. Th ere is no doubt that Gülen remains a charismatic leader and that members of the movement hold him in the high-est respect.17 However, he consistently avoids attempts to institutionalize power, to perceive him as the source of all truth, or to view him as taking responsibility for the movement. Hence, Gülen himself specifi cally denies that the movement can be termed the Gülen movement or that the schools developed by the Hizmet movement can be described as his.18In a recent sociological study of the Hizmet movement, Joshua Hendricks argues that the movement is “ambiguous” and that this ambiguity is strate-gic.19 Th is concept of strategic ambiguity emerges from the organizational theory of Eric Eisenberg.20 Th is suggests that organizations foster ambiguity of meaning for several reasons. If the aims and objectives of an organization are ambiguous, for instance, then this might enable leaders to deny responsi-bility for actions. Equally, ambiguity in communication about aims and objectives might enable diff erent, quite distinctive groups to work together within an organization. It is not the place of an overview to address this argument in detail. However, three things are worth noting at this stage. First, there is a lack of conceptual clarity about Hendricks’s use of the term “ambiguity.” He applies it, for instance, to Gülen’s denial of any formally organized eff orts to develop new schools or other enterprises. However, it is not clear that leadership which addresses broad ethical and theological issues and intentionally argues that individuals and groups should take responsibility for how service is put into practice is necessarily ambiguous. On the contrary, this is based on a model of agreement around general prin-"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Building Bridges: Gülen Pontifex • 79ciples and an interpretation of these in practice. Th is gives rise to diff erent expressions of any principle. Second, ambiguity is oft en seen as a negative idea, and strategic ambiguity in particular can be viewed as intrinsically unethical precisely because it suggests deception.21 Th is sets up wider discus-sion about the nature of integrity as well as the integrity of organizations and leadership, which Hendricks does not sustain, largely because he does not develop an analysis of organizational ethics. Th ird, in the debates about leadership and organization are issues that point the need for a more pro-found analysis. For instance, there is positive ethical ambiguity at the heart of much religious thinking on leadership and service. One example of this is the servant leadership model, which argues, in some cases, that service should be carried out in ways that do not draw attention to the actions of the leader,22 instead focused on virtues such as humility. Th is raises major ques-tions of how ambiguity relates to contemporary views about the ethical pri-macy for transparency and accountability, where attention is precisely drawn to the good works of the person or group. Th is is a diffi cult tension to hold but cannot be viewed as a form of deception.Such points suggest the need for a more nuanced view of the Hizmet movement. Even the briefest of attempts to place the movement in tradi-tional religious categories fails. It contains elements of all these types and can be seen to be the development of diff erent traditions as well as a simple orthodox Islamic group. It does not, as Hendricks notes, have the character-istics of an institutional bureaucracy, and the diff erent formal groupings within the movement are not organized under the direct leadership of Gülen. It has a unifying leader and focus but has diversity within the move-ment. It sees the search for truth as a continuing refl ective and creative activ-ity, with God at the center. At one level, this refl ects the familiar tension between religious institutional identity, with its concern for growing and sustaining the organization, and core spiritual purpose and personal devel-opment, with its concern for personal response. To explore this further requires some consideration of Gülen’s thought.gülen’s thinkingGülen’s writings begin to reveal why neither he nor the movement can be placed in narrow categories. In particular, his thinking is holistic and synop-tic, based in a plural identity. It is focused in spirituality (indebted to Sufi"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"80 • Simon Robinsonmysticism), rational critical refl ection (focused in science), tradition and the-ology (focused in the Qur’an), and practice.Central to this is the idea of hizmet, which involves service with a great stress on continual action. Responsibility makes action critical, and Gülen contrasts passive submission with active service. Hizmet is about embodying the inner awareness of God in practice. It is based on spirituality and thus the consciousness of God and his call. Hence, piety is “this-worldly”: “Th ose who always feel themselves in the presence of God do not need to seclude themselves from people.”23 Th e human agency of the response to God is based on a holistic and dynamic anthropology that brings together emotion, spirit, rationality, and action: “God did not create people only to have them become passive recluses, activist without reason and spirit, or rationalists without spiritual refl ection and activism.”24For Gülen, hizmet involves the ceaseless responsibility of putting values into practice. Th is is focused in the example of the Prophet as a man of action, who “stressed learning trading, agriculture, action and thought. Moreover, he encouraged his people to do perfectly what he did, and con-demned inaction and begging.”25Th e focus for the believer is not salvation but rather to please God, “thinking only of his approval in everyday speech, behaviour and thought.”26 Th is means that the person is engaged without ceasing in particular activity, always asking “Oh my Lord, what else can I do?” Gülen inevitably stresses then the importance of individual discipline, including good time manage-ment and well-planned activity. Th is is all part of what it means to be responsible. Th e more that such responsibility is practiced in all contexts, the more that this leads to increased responsibility; “more blessings mean more responsibility.”27If the response of hizmet is holistic, it is also synoptic, making connec-tions between the diff erent aspects of meaning in practice, including con-nections between disciplines oft en seen as in confl ict, not least the relation-ship of science and critical thinking to spirituality. Key to this is Gülen’s thinking about creation. God created the world and appointed humanity to be the vicegerent.28 Humankind is thus responsible for the management of creation and, in this sense, stands in for God, as deputy, but also stands before him. Hence, humanity is both responsible with God and accountable to God for the world in its fullness.In order to fulfi ll this responsibility and trust God has made available all possible resources:"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Building Bridges: Gülen Pontifex • 81If humanity is the vicegerent of God on Earth, the favourite of all His crea-tion, the essence and substance of existence in its entirety and the brightest mirror of the Creator—and there is no doubt that this is so—then the Divine Being that has sent humanity to this realm will have given us the right, per-mission, and ability to discover the mysteries imbedded in the soul of the universe, to uncover the hidden power, might and potential, to use every-thing to its purpose, and to be the representatives of characteristics that belong to Him, such as knowledge will and might.29All resources are to be used to fulfi ll the divine purpose. Th e task of the vicegerent is not simply to believe in God or to worship but to understand “the mysteries within things and the cause of natural phenomena, and there-fore to be able to interfere in nature.”30 “Interference” is less the domination of creation and more the protecting of the harmony of the ecosystem and using its resources for the common good. Th e vicegerent thus becomes a co-creator with God, servant but also lover.31Key to awareness and appreciation of the environment, and its proper use, is science. Th is is not something that is seen as autonomous or against religion. Rather, science reveals the laws of nature and, by implication, helps us to see the purpose of creation. Th is clearly shows why Gülen, despite being fi rmly a crea-tionist (i.e., he believes in God’s literal creation and rejects the theory of evolu-tion), is concerned about science as an essential part of his educational work.Th e response to God’s call involves free will. Th e person chooses to res-pond to God and, in particular, chooses how he or she will maintain the balance of the environment, sustain the balance between the environment and humanity, and make the most of the resources given in creation, all for the benefi t of humanity and all with a purpose of raising the level of civiliza-tion for everyone. Th is requires continual critical refl ection on “purpose” in context—hence, again, the need to use science. Such a continual refl ective process, of course, cannot be simplistic, or even univocal, for two reasons. First, it is not clear that science per se can determine purpose. God’s pur-poses are a matter of value rather than scientifi c truth. Science may support and confi rm that value but cannot ultimately determine the value. Second, any judgment about purpose, or about the scientifi c support for purpose, will inevitably be contested. Hence, there is need for continual debate around the understanding of purpose. Th e practice of vicegerency, then, is teleological, social, and dialogic, with responsibility shared for creation.Th is reinforces identity, which is developed through the exercise of free will in making decisions about the social and physical environment, something"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"82 • Simon Robinsonsimilar to Charles Taylor’s deep decision making.32 Gülen points up the need to assert responsibility within that relational framework, precisely to avoid a loss of agency:By undertaking particular responsibilities through continuous acting and thinking, by facing and bearing particular diffi culties, almost in a sense by sentencing ourselves to these, even though it may be at the expense of many things, we always have to act, to strive. If we do not act as we are, we are dragged into the waves caused by the thrusts and actions of others, and into the whirlpools of the plans and thoughts of others, and then we are forced to act on behalf of others. Remaining aloof from action, not interfering in the things happening around us, not being a part of the events around us and staying indiff erent to them is like letting ourselves melt away, like ice turning to water.33Th e stress on hizmet makes the movement distinct from that of Said Nursi, who, though not arguing against service, did not see it as a founda-tional principle. Th e stress on hizmet also opens up the movement to the public sphere. Any testing of the movement’s ideas involves refl ection on action and whether or not it embodies the ideas. Hizmet also therefore opens the movement to critical dialogue with other perspectives and to the possibilities of shared responsibility and action beyond the movement. Hence, for instance, the thinking about creation can be distinguished from perspectives such as that of Hans Jonas and others who have an essentially anthropocentric view of sustainable development.34 Gülen’s care of creation is not based on responsibility for future generations so much as responsibil-ity to God. At the same time, both perspectives share a deep concern for the ecosystem and can work together for this good.Th is, in turn, leads to a stress on plural identity, something not surprising in a Muslim thinker proud of his Anatolian identity and from a nation with an Islamic majority that is also capitalist. Th e Muslim is also a citizen. Th is moves beyond an individualistic view of citizenship and into one of citizen-ship as mutual responsibility, and thus as essentially social in expression. Gülen, in this vision of citizenship, sees the importance of a civil society and of the responsibility of the Muslim to contribute toward that civil society, not simply to focus on the Muslim community. Th is understanding involves several elements. First, he accepts a view of the common good that all can own.35 Second, it is a short step from a view of the common good to one of human rights. As Ozcan Keles argues,36 Gülen provides a basis for human rights in the Qur’an. Th ird, this is reinforced in Gülen’s educational philos-"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Building Bridges: Gülen Pontifex • 83ophy as developing universal values and virtues. In this, education becomes a critical means to the development of citizens. Education has to be founded on science, language skills, and educational excellence if it is to enable the development of people who can take leadership roles in business and society. In all this, it becomes possible for Islam to take its place in a post-modern age as key for the development of society.37 Fabio Vicini notes that through the stress on action, and therefore the public nature of the Islamic respon-siveness, Muslims are able to share responsibility for and debate about prac-tice and underlying world views.38 Hence, Gülen can focus on the dar al-hizmet (abode of service), with the Muslim as part of a creative dialogue about society.39 Th is sense of responsibility for society extends to concern for peace and even for democracy itself.40 In other words, the Muslim as citizen is not simply to accept the legal framework in which he fi nds himself but must work toward democracy as an ideal of the state and as a framework for civil society.Central to the ongoing work of the movement is the provision of schools and, more recently, the support of universities. Given Gülen’s thinking, it should be no surprise that these schools are not focused purely on Turkish or Muslim identities but have been developed across the world, fostering the national identities of the countries in which they are based.41 In some cases, the schools have a minority of Muslims. In the Philippines, for instance, where there has been confl ict between Christians and Muslims, one school accepted students and staff from both religions. In this case, the school moved beyond a narrow educational focus to becoming part of the develop-ment of civil society in a confl ict or post-confl ict situation.Again, key to these schools is the development of the sciences and of uni-versal values and virtues. Th e sciences enable critical refl ection and ensure that science is not seen as antithetical to religion. Th e universal values include tolerance and justice, and they provide the basis for virtues that are central both to learning and to moral identity. Important for these is the consciousness of responsibility for responding to God’s call. Th is is “a prayer, a supplication which is not rejected, and a powerful source for further alter-native projects.” 42 At times, this is seen as a “vast love for all creation,” 43 combining elements of agape, an all-embracing love, and eros, a creative love.44 Th is leads to a strong sense of tolerance,45 accepting diff erence but also calling everyone to creative action. Included among other virtues is that of purity of heart or intention (ikhla).46 Th is is a response to God not based in secondary motivations, such as fear, self-interest, or even the interest or"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"84 • Simon Robinsondefense of the movement, but in simply pleasing God. Michael Graskemper also notes the virtues of excellence (striving to be the best) and commitment, in addition to service.47Th e development of such virtues, in turn, is based in the plural commu-nity of the schools, which connect the families, the local community, and even businesses. Th e business leaders who are part of the movement work together to fund the development of the schools.48 Th is activity becomes part of their hizmet—part of their corporate citizenship and their contribution to civil society. Responsibility in this requires cooperation and a negotiation of shared responsibility. Such negotiation recognizes resources and limitations, in the light of a sense of shared responsibility, and begins to identify how the common good can be eff ected in context. As noted above, the negotiation of responsibility takes the work well beyond a narrow view of religion. Th e development of a school in an area of confl ict, for instance, moves the center of concern away from evangelism to response to need, and in turn it involves other stakeholders as co-creators in the development of peace.49 Th is takes the business world into partnership with community and politics, and it thus affi rms the idea of corporate citizenship. Again, holding the plurality of iden-tity is critical. Business leaders are still primarily concerned about their busi-ness success, just as schools are focused on academic excellence. Th ey are also citizens and, in Turkey for instance, Muslims and Anatolian Turks.Th e action of the movement is a lso seen in the creation of a series of media outlets—primarily newspapers and television—placing it in the public sphere. Th is further enhances the core dynamic of being at home in the pub-lic realm and seeking to infl uence discussion in the secular society but also reciting the authentic voice of Islam. As a result, these outlets once more stress key universal values such as hard work, compassion, and justice.Th e distinctive blend of spirituality, synoptic thinking, and plural iden-tity, focused on the action of hizmet, points then to a complex and dynamic movement that does not rest on an institutional identity but constantly looks to fulfi ll the responsibility of vicegerent. What sustains this, bridging the diff erent cultures, is dialogue.dialogueAt the heart of the Hizmet movement’s philosophy and action is dialogue. Gülen’s stress on spirituality, rationality, and action in the public realm inevita-"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Building Bridges: Gülen Pontifex • 85bly takes this dialogue out of a narrow range of interfaith dialogue to intercul-tural dialogue. Th is has led to many diff erent groups, such as the Intercultural Dialogue Center,50 the Dialogue Society in London,51 and the development of dialogue platforms, not least the Abant Platform of the Journalists and Writers Foundation. Th ese eff orts have brought together intellectuals, activists, jour-nalists, and leaders of diff erent groups. In 2007, the Abant Platform developed intra-dialogue in Turkey between the Sunni and the Alevi minority.Dialogue is central to all the thought and action noted above, focusing on three interconnected aspects: consciousness of creation and the call to care for it, giving an account of thought and action, and initiating creative action. In the fi rst of these, dialogue is essential to the development of conscious-ness of the environment and its nature in relation to God. Dialogue further enhances relationships with the other who shares responsibility for that environment. In one respect, it reveals the sameness of the other, something focused on in the interfaith dialogue platforms and through stress on uni-versal values. It also focuses on diff erence and, with that, the importance of tolerance, again central to Gülen’s thinking. Such dialogue also helps the development of a realistic and truthful assessment of the data in any situa-tion. It enables the development of agency. It demands articulation of value and practice, which clarifi es what we both think and do. Dialogue itself develops critical thinking. Even just the diff erent perspective of the other questions and sharpens one’s own values and core concepts.Th is dialogue becomes even richer in light of Gülen’s holism, synoptic thinking, and plural identity. Th e dialogue is not simply around ideas, and therefore does not lead to a dangerous stress on the defense of ideas. Samuel Huntington’s thesis that Islam and the West are focused in a clash of civili-zations is precisely located in such a pattern of defense and attack.52 A holis-tic perspective, however, involves getting to know the self and other in mutual relations to plural culture, involving feelings as well as ideas, all focused on responsive action. It involves mutual challenge and mutual learn-ing, with an outcome not of defense but of action. Th is approach, and not the defense of right thinking, is what pleases God. Hence, such dialogue primarily involves genuine engagement with the other, whether this “other” is a person, project, or place. It does not result in the assertion of the organi-zation’s location or identity in the public realm.53 All of these elements demand that this pattern of ideas and actions involves being responsible not simply for critical thinking but also for the feelings that emerge around any sense of identity or around core values."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"86 • Simon RobinsonIn the second aspect, dialogue can be seen as the key means of advancing accountability. In one sense, this involves dialogue as the major means of ensuring transparency. Writers such as William Park suggest that the move-ment is not institutionally transparent.54 In a way, this is true. With many diff erent groups involved in the movement, it is hard to see how responsibil-ity can be worked through in a simple or linear way. However, the dynamic of dialogue itself embodies transparency, precisely because it requires all par-ties to give an account of their meaning and practice and thus be held accountable for it. Also, in many of the conferences organized over the past decade, this has involved an openness to critiques from diff erent perspec-tives, not least in dialogue around the role of women in and governance of the movement.55Such transparency enables the movement to give an account to society in general, and this is an important development of dialogue beyond simple bilateral relationships. It is not a free fl ow of meaning between participants, such as David Bohm’s theory of dialogue.56 Rather, the dialogue is focused on shared accountability to God and the global environment, and with that accountability to many diff erent stakeholders, from the state to religion to other nations. Th is multiple accountability, which has echoes of Mikhail Bakhtin’s focus on the interplay of many diff erent voices,57 demands an awareness of the diff erent stakeholders and is held together by the stress on hizmet. Th ere are also echoes of Paulo Friere’s view of dialogue (as nondirec-tive) in the way that leadership is dispersed in the movement.58Dialogue also demands the development of commitment to the self and the other.59 It is not possible to pursue dialogue without giving it space and time to develop, and this in turn demands a nonjudgmental attitude. Commitment to the self and the other is also essential if the potential critique of values and practice is to emerge from articulation and refl ection. Th e practice of dialogue enables listening and, with that, empathy, apprecia-tion, and responsiveness.60 We learn about the other as well as ourselves only if we are open to both. Th is deepens any sense of accountability to the other in the dialogue. Dialogue itself also sets up a continued accountability with those involved. Th is is partly because it sets up a contract, formal or informal, that establishes expectations that are continually tested by that dialogue.In the third aspect of dialogue, the stress is on action. Gülen suggests that we do not have to reach absolute agreement before working through the shared issues such as ignorance, poverty, and discrimination in society.61 On"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Building Bridges: Gülen Pontifex • 87the contrary, these issues provide a shared area of concern and, along with shared values, can be worked through regardless of diff erences. Th e stress on action strengthens the holistic framework. Action tests the accountability and commitment of those involved in the dialogue. Being accountable for actions also involves testing the actions against purpose and meaning. Th e actions themselves then become the basis for refl ection on meaning. Such refl ection becomes the basis for the development of integrity, connecting the diff erent voices and practice.Dialogue about creative action also enables the development of shared responsibility, not simply the recognition of shared interests. Th is leads to the negotiation of responsibility, exemplifi ed in the way that businesses develop decisions around funding the work of the movement. Th is is very diff erent from Jürgen Habermas’s view of dialog ue based on developing con-ceptual consensus.62 Th e eff ect of dialogue is to extend the imagination and develop creativity. It shows what is possible, especially where responsibility is shared, and so increases the capacity to respond. In this respect, such dia-logue enables the development of hope.63 Hope can be characterized as the capacity to envision the future in a positive and creative way, and C. R. Snyder suggests that it involves agency, support, and pathways to action.64 Th e fi rst element of dialogue enables a sense of agency, personal and collec-tive, in the participants as they develop clear understandings of purpose and identity around knowledge of ideas, values, and practice in relation to the social and physical environment. Th e stress on action looks to the develop-ment of pathways. Th rough the use of imagination and the negotiation of responsibility, pathways embodying core values are created. Th e commit-ment to action-based dialogue further enhances a sense of support and gen-uine engagement with the issues.Such dialogue embodies the development of responsibility, which Gülen casts as universal responsibility.65 Th is involves responsibility “for the crea-tion of events, nature and society, the past and the futures, the dead and the living, the young and the old, the literate and the illiterate, administration and security. . . . Everybody and everything.” 66Universal responsibility is not a simplistic moral responsibility, involving apportioning blame for everything, but implies proactive responsibility for engaging the past, present, and future, itself involving the practice of the key virtues—intellectual, spiritual, and ethical—such as practical wisdom, jus-tice, and tolerance. Such dialogue is distinctively suited to peace building, involving creative openness to the other.67"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"88 • Simon RobinsonconclusionTh e title of this chapter suggests that Gülen’s thought is that of a bridge builder (pontifex) and that the Hizmet movement embodies such building. I have argued that, far from the identity of the Hizmet movement being prob-lematic, it is focused on holism, synoptic thinking, and plural identity in the context of responsive service. Th ere are institutional elements to the move-ment in the diff erent groups that compose it, but it is the action-centered dialogue that sustains the movement as a whole. Th e dialogue at the heart of the Hizmet movement shows it “means business” and provides a dynamic of transparency that seeks an account of ideas, values, and practice that are critically tested, conceptually and empirically. It opens the dialogue to all parties so that plural perspectives can test each other. Th is context takes interfaith dialogue beyond the narrow and anodyne confi nes of discussions about theological concepts between religious leaders or theologians. It leads a dialogue of “engagement” rather than “location” (simply focusing on the identity and signifi cance of the movement), cross-cultural dialogue, and trans-faith rather than simply inter-faith dialogue. Th e stress on practice and shared responsibility takes seriously the plural identity of the movement as Turkish, Muslim, and “global” in respect to citizenship, making the move-ment at home in the modern and post-modern worlds.Poising a movement on such dialogue is, of course, a risky business. Th is is partly because it involves a constant learning process. Th e learning itself develops accountability as critiques are responded to openly.68 Th is involves dialogue both inside and outside the movement. It is the bridges of service that sustain the movement, not any hierarchy as such. Th e moral and spirit-ual force is in the action, supported by appropriate organization. In a sense, that is why Gülen’s leadership has been so important in enabling the move-ment to continually look both inwards and outwards. Th is dynamic means that the Hizmet movement and Gülen himself can be seen as being on a journey. In itself, this precludes any simplistic assessment of the Hizmet movement organization or of Gülen’s thinking, not least because, in light of political and religious challenges,69 no one can be sure of how either will develop.In 2007, I was fortunate to visit Gülen and discuss some of these issues. At one point, I asked him what will happen to the movement when he dies. His response was simple. Th ere is no planned structural response, no succes-sion plan. Instead, he gave an answer that inhabited the “middle way” of"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Building Bridges: Gülen Pontifex • 89practical wisdom and faith. He simply shrugged his shoulders and said that this would not be a cataclysmic event: “What will happen? Th ey will pray.” In other words, in his view, the answer will be found not in institutional organization but in dialogue with God and others who focus their response on the approach of hizmet.notes1.

Th e fi rst is: Since Fethullah Gülen and the Hizmet movement have much to say about morality and ethics, does one promote ethical discourse independently of various versions of Islam? Th e second question is: Can other religious sys-tems or nonreligious networks learn from the movement? More specifi cally, I will fi rst describe how Gülen and the Hizmet movement derive their understanding of morality and ethics from the primary and secondary sources of Islam. Th eir ethical understanding will be examined in terms of how ethics is enacted or applied. Th e chapter will then focus on similarities and diff erences of how ethical discourse is promoted by Gülen and the Hizmet movement compared to other versions of Islam. In the rest of the chapter, I will examine and describe ways other religious systems or nonreli-gious networks can learn from the ethical discourse and ethics-in-action of Gülen and the Hizmet movement.I begin by posing the question that many have raised: What is the secret behind the broad, deep, and rapid infl uence of the Hizmet movement over sixEthics in the Th eory and Practice of HizmetRadhi H. al-MabukNot every member of an organization can live up fully to the ethical ideals propagated by that group’s founders and leaders, and Muslims of all sorts are aware of the limits of their achievements. However, those who would appraise the Hizmet movement in its personal and larger contexts will ask what those ideals are, so that the relative achievements can be measured. We have asked Radhi al-Mabuk, professor of Education at the University of Northern Iowa, to summarize and set forth the ethical patterns and intentions, which he here does systematically and clearly. Some descriptions of how Hizmet ideals get lived out may sound unrealistic to many readers, but there need be little doubt as to what members of the movement expect of each other and themselves. Al-Mabuk clarifi es what is expected and probes the reasons for ethical living in a movement whose very name focuses on “service.”"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Ethics in the Theory and Pr actice of Hizmet • 93diverse people on almost every continent of the globe? Th e answer lies in the ethical foundation upon which the movement rests and from which it derives inspiration and direction. Th e ethical base of the movement drives its tripartite mission or ethical interests: alleviating poverty through helping the poor and needy as well as through relief eff orts; eradicating ignorance through educational initiatives; and promoting unity through intercultural and interfaith dialogue. So, what are the moral values that have motivated and continue to guide and inspire the work of this colossal transnational civic movement? And, where do these moral precepts come from?Th e ethical base draws upon the primary and secondary sources of Islam. Th e primary sources consist of the teachings of the Holy Qur’an and the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad. Th e secondary sources include the thoughts and actions of the close and loyal companions of the Prophet and the spiritual guides that adhered to the true teachings of the Prophet. Th e ethical nutrients that nurture Hizmet are supplied chiefl y by the writ-ings, sermons, and counsel of the spiritual guide of the movement, Gülen—or Hocaefendi, as he is lovingly and endearingly called by the followers of the movement. Gülen’s thoughts and teachings are deeply rooted in the teachings of the Holy Qur’an and the divine teachings and lived life of Prophet Muhammad. He also follows the example and counsel of the close companions of the Prophet and the spiritual guides that have followed in their footsteps. Gülen discerns that the ultimate objective of Islamic ideals is to help the individual to become perfect, refi ned, and self-actualized. Toward this aim, Gülen not only explicates but also leads by example the Islamic ethical principles and dictates. Although an original thinker, Gülen is very much practitioner-oriented, not a theoretician, when it comes to eth-ics. Th at is, he is most concerned with translating ethical precepts and vir-tues into proper actions, oft en preceding words with actions or at least matching words with deeds. In this respect, Gülen heeds the admonition of the following Qur’anic verses: “O you who believe, why do you say what you do not do? Great is hatred in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do” (As-Saf, verses 2–3).In no realm other than ethics is a Muslim called to match words with actions. Gülen fully understands that the singular and most central mission of Prophet Mohammed’s message is to refi ne and complete the ethical ideals in order to perfect human character. To achieve this loft y divine mission, Prophet Muhammad taught humanity about ethics through actions. As Muslims believe, his lived life off ers the perfect human model for developing"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"94 • R adhi H. al-Mabukexcellence and virtue. Th ey must emulate this model in all aspects of their lives. Indeed, Gülen follows the example of the Prophet and off ers his insights and experiences to the Hizmet movement. His aim, following cen-tral teachings of Islam, is to strengthen the inner and spiritual dimension of the adherents so that they develop the qualities and qualifi cations to be vice-gerents of God, to whom the angels were commanded to bow down. Later in this chapter, I will elaborate on the specifi c ethical ideals and qualities such as sincerity, honesty, humility, trustworthiness, tolerance, love, forgiveness, compassion, selfl essness, and peacemaking that Gülen strives to instill in the followers of Hizmet. First, however, we must discuss the sources that inform Hizmet’s ethical interests.primary sources of ethics in the theory of hizmetAt the heart of Islamic ethics is the utter and unwavering belief that God is the Creator and source of all goodness, truth, and beauty, and that the ulti-mate responsibility of human beings is to submit to His will reverentially. Human beings are the responsible, dignifi ed, and honorable agents of the Creator. Th ey are God’s appointed vicegerents on earth. Humans are so dig-nifi ed by God that He put everything that is in the heavens and on the earth in their service. Humans are entrusted to do good and spread goodness in their lives and guard against corruption, evil, and wickedness. Hence, com-mitment and devotion to ethical ideals ensure that the human is honoring his or her mission of upholding good in this life.Prophet Muhammad put much emphasis on the value and task of cultivat-ing refi ned manners and character. Th e following hadiths, or sayings of the Prophet, underscore the centrality of refi ned manners in Qur’anic ethics:Th e Prophet said: among the Muslims, the most perfect, as regards his faith, is the one whose character is excellent. (Al-Tiridhi, Hadith 628)Th e best among you are the best in character (having good manners). (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Hadith 8.61)Do you know the things which most commonly bring people into paradise? It is fear of Allah and good character. (Al-Tirmidhi, Hadith 4832)Th e prophet said “I guarantee a house in the surroundings of Paradise for a man who avoids quarelling even if he were in the right; a house in the middle"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Ethics in the Theory and Pr actice of Hizmet • 95of Paradise for a man who avoids lying even if he were joking; and a house in the upper part of Paradise for a man who made his character good.” (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Hadith 5.104, narrated by Abdullah Bin Amr)In Sunan Abu-dawood, Hadith 4782, narrated by Abu Umamah, we read:Th e most beloved to me amongst you is the one who has the best character and manners.Th ere is nothing heavier than good character put in the Scale of a believer in the Day of Resurrection.Th e messenger of Allah said: By his good character a believer will attain the degree of one who prays during the night and fasts during the day.ethics in the practice of hizmetIn order to understand the ethical ideals in the practice of Hizmet, it is help-ful to think of the individual as operating at both ends of the spectrum within the following four arenas.Obligatory to SupererogatoryWithin this realm, an individual fulfi lls the obligatory rituals and deeds, and, by so doing, he or she is motivated to do good works for others. Th e act is still performed out of a sense of religious duty. If, however, the deed is performed out of love, then it falls within the supererogatory or ihsan domain. Before, during, and aft er performing the deed, the person’s goal should be to seek God’s pleasure only. If one engages in nonobligatory acts such as feeding the hungry and attending to the needy without regard for recognition or publicity, and if he or she does it anonymously, the act is said to be a supererogatory one. Th e Arabic word ihsan comes the closest in meaning to the word supererogatory, and it refers to deeds that are beautiful, proper, and suitable. Th e ethic of ihsan serves as an inspiration for Muslim piety, especially for Sufi s. In the Hizmet movement, members are implored by Gülen individually and collectively to seize every opportunity to give of their time, eff ort, and money to help others without expectancy for reward, approval, or any material gain.Th e young men and women in Hizmet who take up teaching responsibili-ties in faraway lands are an example of this obligatory-supererogatory ethical"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"96 • R adhi H. al-Mabukdimension. Teaching, for most faith-inspired groups, is a sacred act; some deem it an obligatory duty, whereas others welcome it with enthusiasm. In the latter case, teaching is seen as a divine favor and opportunity bestowed upon the dutiful servant. Th e servant, in turn, undertakes the duty with reli-ance on God for guidance, insight, and assistance to perform the act in the best and most complete manner possible. Th at is, he or she hopes to do the work with the utmost sincerity and purity of intention. Gülen goes so far as to teach that, at the highest point of sincerity in worship, the individual’s aim is not Paradise but the pleasure of God. Gülen’s point is in line with the third kind of worship that Imam Husain, grandson of the Prophet, described: “Some people worship God, coveting His rewards. Th is is wor-ship of merchants. Some people worship God, fearing His punishments. Th is is worship of slaves. Some people worship God, thanking His blessings. Th is is worship of the free superior persons.”1Inner and External DimensionsTh e inner dimension has been the focus of many scholars and spiritual masters. Th e heart is where the inner dimension is believed to operate, and it drives the entire human personality. Th e Sufi s accord the inner dimen-sion of the human a prominent and signifi cant status. If the maintenance of the heart is neglected, then the heart is very likely to get sick, corrupt, and become a playground for evil tendencies. With ongoing service, watchful observation, and disciplined dedication, the heart is cleansed, purifi ed, and brought closer to its Creator. Th e Qur’an uses the word taqwa to refer to one’s vigilance against moral peril as it equips believers with the ability to control the inner thought that produces human action. Under the watchful eye of taqwa, the self-injurious or handicapping thoughts and impulses are redirected and transformed into positive and self-enhancing ones.For the Sufi s, the heart is the intrapersonal space where the inner self per-forms its mystic contemplation and comes into union with God. It is the gate to Divine love and knowledge. Gülen diff ers from the Sufi s in that he stresses, in addition to the intrapersonal side, the interpersonal dimension. Gülen asserts that “the inner and outer dimensions must never be sepa-rated.”2 Th us, one’s contemplation and self-purifi cation must be manifested outwardly in the form of good deeds and selfl ess service to others. Put diff er-"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Ethics in the Theory and Pr actice of Hizmet • 97ently, an individual’s intrapersonal spirituality must materialize into an altruistic and tangible social action.In striving to blend and integrate the two dimensions, the individual’s self-purifi cation regimen and aim must include attainment of sincerity of intention. Every act of worship a person performs must be predicated on the authentic and true intention of doing it for the sake of God. By so doing, a person will not expect monetary or moral rewards for the good deeds and services one undertakes. Th e reward is the pleasure and satisfaction one derives from doing good things, and doing them to please God and God only. Doing so may not be easy in an environment that thrives on and basks in human rewards and recognition. It takes the inner discipline of self-abnegation to reach the level of selfl essness. Th is is the ultimate goal that Gülen teaches his followers to achieve.Closely aligned with sincerity is the virtue of truthfulness, which also starts and springs from within and has direct eff ect on those who are genu-inely striving to be truthful to God. Th is ethic is another jewel in the crown of a refi ned character, which Gülen covered in his book Key Concepts in the Practice of Sufi sm.3 It is an ideal that was exemplifi ed by all of the messengers of God, and one that they instructed their disciples to do. Like sincerity, truthfulness requires synergy between the outer and inner dimensions of the individual. When harmony of the two dimensions is achieved, the per-son’s actions become infused with sincere intention, and the words and actions accord with the degree of belief the person has attained.In speaking about truthfulness, AbdurRahman Mahdi mentions that Imam Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet, pointed out the impact of truthfulness on others by saying, “Whosoever does three things with regards to people, they will necessitate three things from him: whenever he speaks to them he is truthful; whenever they entrust him with something he does not betray them; and whenever he promises them something he fulfi lls it. If he does this, their hearts will love him; their tongues will praise him; and they will come to his aid.” 4 Th ese words refl ect an ethic that is essential for members in any movement, faith-inspired or not. It promotes trust among the members of the movement and, in turn, the movement with the communities they serve. Others will regard the members and the movement as trustworthy and reliable. Th e Prophet exemplifi ed this ethic even before he received the revelation. Th e people of Mecca used to call him Al-Amin, the trustworthy one."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"98 • R adhi H. al-MabukConcern for the Local and the GlobalTh is dimension, oft en referred to as “glocal ” in Hizmet circles, refers to the dual focus of the movement on immediate concerns and issues in the local commu-nity as well as on the needs beyond the community and outside the borders of one’s country in a warm embrace of all humanity. It is this ethic that so appeals to people who encounter Hizmet for the fi rst time—its ready tendency to dem-onstrate its “social conscience” and to share its blessings enthusiastically with others. Members of the movement have expressed their sympathy for the suff er-ing of others by providing relief help and attending to the poor and needy both in Turkey (the original context of the Hizmet movement) and in Central Asia, Southeast Asia,*** the Balkans, Africa, the Middle East, and many other parts of the world. In essence, contributing to the well-being of the world has become the concern and ambition of Hizmet. Building bridges of friendship and good-will with the peoples of the world is a daily activity and project for the Hizmet movement. Hands are extended and arms are stretched to embrace and wel-come anyone who is willing to engage in dialogue and cultural exchange.In the “glocal” context, the underlying ethic is derived from this saying of Prophet Muhammad: “Th e best amongst you is the person who serves other people.” Worthy of emphasis is the Prophet’s reference to “people,” which includes Muslims and non-Muslims alike. From this teaching, the move-ment takes its “glocal” ethical dimension. In fact, Gülen describes the world as the stage of God’s love. Going beyond one’s geographical boundaries and familiar settings takes courage as well as intrapersonal and interpersonal skills. One must cultivate and nurture good character and disposition to be able to develop durable human relations, especially with people who have diff erent cultures, languages, traditions, and customs as well as religions. Also, one must persevere and always be buttressed by faith and hope in the face of diffi culties. Fatimah Abdullah maintains that engaging in the global stage requires ethical attributes such as mercy and its attendant manifesta-tions of love, empathy, compassion, tolerance, and forgiveness.5 Th ese are the loft y human tools that would enable “servants of the globe” to surmount the potential hardships invariably and inevitably encountered along the way.Concern with the Temporal and EternalTh e fourth and fi nal ethical spectrum of Hizmet speaks to one’s actions in this life and one’s hopes and yearning for the aft erlife. In this arena, sincer-"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Ethics in the Theory and Pr actice of Hizmet • 99ity, faith, patience, and other related dispositions and virtues are put to the test as the meaning of life and one’s purpose in it are pondered. Gülen asserts that the “purpose of our creation is obvious: to reach our utmost goals of belief, knowledge, and spirituality; to refl ect on the universe, humanity, and God, and thus prove our value as human beings. Fulfi lling this ideal is possible only through systematic thinking and systematic behavior.”6 Faith propels the Hizmet volunteer to continue on the path with content-ment that one is serving others for the sake of God. As hardships and obstacles arise, the volunteers rely on their sincerity and purity of intention so that their eff orts are performed for the sake of God and they are awarded for their eff orts whether they succeed or not. Buoyed by feelings of love and tolerance, Hizmet volunteers put these ethics into action by absorbing potentially harsh words and behaviors from critics or antagonists. Th ey understand that serving others in this life can indeed be arduous work and that hard work pays off greatly—if not in this life, then surely in the hereaft er.Hizmet volunteers willingly, willfully, devotedly, and thoughtfully undertakes assigned or chosen duties in the movement and considers it their calling and source of joy and happiness. It is also thought of as a means to eternal life in heaven, which explains why the volunteers forsake some com-forts and materialistic gain in this life. To them, this life is temporary, and its alluring comforts are fl eeting and short-lived. Th e life worth sacrifi cing for is the next, the eternal one.ethical interests: ethics in actionTh e above four arenas of ethical life are demonstrated in the three major initiatives that defi ne the Hizmet movement: waging war against poverty, ignorance, and disunity. Th ese three challenges were identifi ed by Said Nursi in the early twentieth century as the causes of backwardness in Turkey and other parts of the world. Gülen builds on Nursi’s diagnosis of the social ills and tirelessly thinks of ways to address and eradicate them through vari-ous initiatives and programs carried out by the Hizmet movement through-out the world. Th e fi rst initiative and largest of the three is seen in educa-tional institutions, media outlets, and publications. Th e second is manifested in relief eff orts and helping the needy. Th e third is promoting peace and unity through intercultural and interfaith dialogue. In these three domains,"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"100 • R adhi H. al-Mabukthe Hizmet movement puts its ethical ideals into practice. We will examine the specifi c ethics involved in each.War on PovertyTh e peaceful Hizmet movement is opposed to war but, when it comes to pov-erty, wages a thoughtful and aggressive war to eradicate it. Expressions of “kill-ing poverty” or “waging war against poverty” appear in old and new Islamic writings. Imam Ali, the Prophet’s cousin, said, “If poverty were a man, I would have killed him!” Poverty robs humans of their humanity, and thus it is the greatest enemy of humanity. Combating it, therefore, is the highest ethic. By attending to the basic needs of the poor, hopeless, and helpless, humanity is restored. Humanity becomes healthy, hopeful, and whole again.For Hizmet, caring for the poor is a central ethical imperative. Th ose who contribute funds for the poor, those who prepare food and serve them, and on-the-ground relief workers who lend a rescuing hand all demonstrate eth-ics in action. Th e Hizmet servant, more so in this domain than in any other, is implored to render this holy service with deep devotion and the intention of pleasing God. Th e obligatory-supererogatory, temporal-eternal, local-glo-bal, and internal-external considerations and motivations off er Hizmet vol-unteers an opportunity to reinforce and strengthen their belief, sincerity, and love for humankind.Th e fi ght against poverty within Hizmet is exemplifi ed in the humani-tarian work of the Kimse Yok Mu (which means, Is Anybody Th ere?) aid organization, which was offi cially inaugurated in 2004. In the relatively short period of its existence, Kimse Yok Mu has helped thousands of people in Turkey and in at least forty-two other countries. Th e work started aft er the 1999 earthquake in Turkey that claimed the lives of many people. A Turkish television program by the name of Kimse Yok Mu on Samanyolu Channel gradually transformed into an aid association in 2002 and was for-mally recognized as a humanitarian aid organization in 2004. Its aims epito-mize the highest ethical ideals. Th ose aims, shared on its seventh birthday, included aid for disasters, aid for health, aid for education, aid given during holy occasions, individual aid programs, aid for Africa, and Sister Family Aid. Th e Sister Family Aid is focused on addressing family needs in Turkey and will undoubtedly globalize just like Hizmet’s other initiatives.Th rough its war against poverty, Hizmet is guided morally and ethically by the Islamic primary and secondary teachings, which exhort Muslims to"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Ethics in the Theory and Pr actice of Hizmet • 101provide compassionate care for the poor everywhere. One must not only sympathize with the suff ering of the poor but also go beyond aff ects and cognitions to action—conscious and sincere action.Crusade against IgnoranceEradicating ignorance by providing educational access to people is the larg-est of the three initiatives of the Hizmet movement. Th is initiative was the original emphasis of the movement and is expected to remain one of its cen-tral aims. Th e importance of education is highlighted in the following words of Gülen: “If you wish to keep the masses under control, simply starve them from knowledge. Th ey can escape such tyranny only through education. . . . [T]he road to social justice is through adequate, universal education.”7 Also, educational institutions including prekindergarten through grade 12 as well as higher education are believed by Hizmet to be the key to solving the poverty and disunity issues that are pervasive in the world. Until 1980, Hizmet focused on building schools in Turkey and Central Asia. Hundreds of schools were opened in former Soviet republics such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgistan, and Turkmenistan, and then the movement extended the educational project to other countries in Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Australia. Th e movement is willing to provide access to education wherever possible. Highlighting the importance of edu-cation, Gülen said that what society needs is not more mosques but more schools.Th ere are many striking features of Hizmet schools, including the high academic achievement of its students owing to the selfl ess devotion and eff ectiveness of their teachers and school administrators. Th e teacher expresses the Islamic ethic by enlightening and opening minds and hearts. Another feature is Hizmet’s philosophy of blending science with spiritual-ity. Th e curriculum used in almost every Hizmet school is a governmental and oft en a secularly based one. Th e openness and versatility of the Hizmet movement allow it to function extremely well in secular settings.In addition to schools and universities, Hizmet’s educational eff orts expanded to the realm of media through encouraging and establishing media organizations to disseminate information and serve as a means of educating people. Professional, intellectual, and cultural organizations were established for the purpose of promoting knowledge and cultural exchange."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"102 • R adhi H. al-MabukTh e single most important ethic that threads through all of Hizmet’s educational activities is selfl ess service, which, when unpacked, comprises love, compassion, sincerity, devotion, and goodwill. Service is the outward illumination of these internally active ethical dynamics. Th e Hizmet teacher is an exemplary model for students and is both a teacher of content knowl-edge as well a shaper of character. Th e teacher inculcates in students an ethic of responsibility for self and others, which, in turn, passes the spirit of serv-ice onto the young generation. Students in Hizmet are gradually given opportunities to practice and internalize the ethic of service.It is through this kind of education that Hizmet infuses and inspires ethically guided attitude and behavior in students, which Gülen envisions will produce the Golden Generation—a generation that will carry the torch of knowledge and Islamic ethics and lead others to the path of goodness, happiness, and advancement. Th rough their selfl ess and ethically guided actions, they will eradicate evil, ignorance, and disunity and create a peace-ful world for all of humanity.Combating DisunityHizmet has been described as a civic movement without borders. Of course, borders invariably exist in the world, whether they follow or create lines in the physical or geographical setting or are cultural or psychological in dimension. To operate in a bordered world, one needs the means to tran-scend those boundaries. Th e Hizmet movement does this by tr ying to extend its arms to embrace all fellow human beings. Th is takes a willingness and ability to reach out and connect with others. Gülen identifi es two ethics: tolerance and dialogue as indispensible tools to waging peace and promot-ing unity. He recognizes that the path to unity among communities and people of the world is fraught with diffi culties. It is “heart” work, and as such Gülen instructs the Hizmet volunteers to be heart-full and compas-sionate while engaging in goodwill and peace building. Th e operational directive that Gülen gives to the Hizmet peace-wagers is this: “Without hands against those who strike you; without speech against those who curse you.”Th e most common vehicle for promoting unity in the Hizmet movement has been through interfaith/intercultural dialogue. Th e overarching impe-tus for such dialogues is the profound belief of Gülen and Hizmet in the harmony, collaboration, and peaceful coexistence among civilizations. Th is"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Ethics in the Theory and Pr actice of Hizmet • 103position is decidedly a rational and natural reaction to the clash-of-civiliza-tions theories that have become popular in the past decade. Th e Hizmet movement believes that world peace and harmony are not only possible but inevitable, and all must strive toward this humanitarian goal. Th e capacity for people to change for the better is always basic to assumptions in the movement.International, national, and local conferences dealing with interfaith and intercultural dialogues have been convened by Hizmet on almost every con-tinent. Seminars, presentations, and other eff orts to engage in dialogue with people of diff erent faith traditions and cultures are ongoing. Th ese eff orts have been productive and eff ective. For example, in an interview with the Chicago Tribune’s John Kass, Greek Orthodox ecumenical patriarch Patrik I. Bartolomeos spoke very highly of Gülen’s and Hizmet’s eff orts in promot-ing dialogue and building bridges among cultures in Turkey and around the world. Referring to his friend as Hocaefendi, the patriarch said, “He builds bridges, and religion should build bridges. Th is is why we need the dialogues. Not to have religious fanatics who divide people. Th e idea is to bring people of faith together for the benefi t of humankind.”8Gülen has talked about a Golden Generation of heroes and heroines who, though they come from diff erent cultural and religious backgrounds, would be united in their goal of achieving world peace through dialogue. Hizmet, according to Walter Wagner (an adjunct professor of World Religions at Moravian Th eological Seminary in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania ) “is the start of that generation of dialoguers and doers.”9Within this ethical interest of promoting unity, the temporal-eternal, glocal, inner-outer, and obligatory-supererogatory dynamics are operative. Th e Hizmet volunteer must mobilize the ethics of love, mercy, goodwill, and tolerance to perform the needed work with sincerity and dedication.conclusionWith the four ethical realms (inner-outer, obligatory-supererogatory, local-global, and temporal-eternal) and Hizmet’s three ethical interests or imper-atives (education, alleviating poverty, and promoting unity) in mind, we turn now to answering the two main questions posed at the beginning of the chapter. First: Does one promote ethical discourse independently of various versions of Islam?"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"104 • R adhi H. al-MabukTh e general answer is in the affi rmative, with certain conditions. Th e dif-ferent versions of Islam will dictate the scope of the ethical ideals one embraces and actualizes. Some versions or interpretations of Islam may emphasize education and compassionate concern for the poor as long as the audience and recipients live in one’s immediate locality or are of the same faith. According to this version of the Islamic ethic, charitable work starts at home and may not extend beyond it. Th e ethical precepts may be per-formed out of a sense of strict or grim obligation, carried out for the sake of one’s own salvation (earning more blessings), and done for the sake of earn-ing enough credits to enter Paradise. Such ethical discourse gravitates toward the limited, parochial, and self-centered. Such a view would be con-sidered incomplete by many Muslim scholars, Gülen certainly among them. He would argue that the sphere of Islam is the entire world, its message of mercy is for all humanity, and thus one’s concern must be for all human beings.Some versions of Islam may carry out humanitarian and educational mis-sions for political gains and to expand one’s group or party’s infl uence. Hizmet is decidedly apolitical and insists on and persists in being a civic movement without borders.Th e second question is: Can other religious systems or nonreligious net-works learn from the Hizmet movement? Again, the answer would be “yes.” In particular, they can learn from the comprehensive and global vision of Hizmet’s projects. Th e ethic of selfl ess service, the name and the spirit of the movement, is inspiring. Service shows the ideals of a movement, and even a cursory review of Hizmet reveals an organization that is always in action. Th e members are expected to be thoughtfully engaged and involved in the various outlets, branches, networks, initiatives, and programs of the move-ment throughout the world. Others can learn from the brotherhood and sisterhood that bind the members of the movement to each other and to others in their communities. Th e generosity, truthfulness, genuineness, and sincere goodwill that members of Hizmet share with their fellow citizens of the world are endemic. Th us, others can learn from Hizmet’s program of ways of shaping human character and giving it purpose and meaning. Moreover, others can join hands with Hizmet and collaborate with it in the gigantic task of solving the world’s problems. Hizmet’s Kimse Yok Mu has sounded the call for collaboration as follows: “We build bridges made of mercy for the world. Is there anybody who says, ‘Here I am!?’ ”"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Ethics in the Theory and Pr actice of Hizmet • 105notes1. “Sayings of Imam Husain,” compiled and translated by Syed Zainulabedin Razavi, http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=9917.2.

Th e line comes from the poem “Adamant” by the American Th eodore Roethke. In many ways, the adamantine truths of Fethullah Gülen’s philosophy have prevailed over several decades and today are most evident in successful schools inspired by him around the world. Like Roethke, Gülen is a poet. He is a “philosopher of education” in the sense of how that phrase denoted, in the nineteenth century, a Ralph Waldo Emerson or others who strongly infl u-enced the thinking and action of both administrators and teachers of stu-dents. Gülen is a theologian, a scholar of Sufi sm, and one who is deeply infl u-enced by the poet Rumi. For four decades, Gülen’s words have challenged thousands in a similar manner to the way President John F. Kennedy’s inau-gural address summoned fellow Americans to “Ask not what your country can do for you but rather what you can do for your country.” However, for Gülen, the call to action becomes “what you can do for humanity.” sevenGülen as an EducatorTo m G a g eAs is made plain throughout this volume, Hizmet is a Turkish-based movement with a glo-bal impact. Its dual character is never more evident than in its commitment to education. Th e presence of schools sponsored or infl uenced by Fethullah Gülen and his followers has for decades been visible and vivid in Turkey, but now schools motivated by the concepts associated with hizmet (service) are prospering, and their numbers are growing in nations far from Turkey, including in North America, where Muslims are in the minority. Tom Gage (professor emeritus of English at Humboldt State University) accounts for the accent on teaching and research in these schools and connects the educational ideas and ideals of Hizmet with the larger cultures, wherever they are found."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"108 • Tom GageTh ose thousands inspired to serve are identifi ed collectively as the Hizmet movement, the Turkish word in this book’s title, which denotes selfl ess serv-ice to humankind. Among Hizmet’s many fi elds of service, and foremost in the public’s attention, is education.1 Gülen’s infl uence on education in the United States has recently attracted coverage in the media, some of it mis-leading and even distracting from his peace-building educational mission.2 His approach deserves careful examination and fair representation, which this chapter is intended to provide.Gülen’s impact on education needs to be diff erentiated into several endeavors. First among these are the schools, both public and private, at ele-mentary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Another important division of his eff orts includes tutorial assistance for poor students from remote areas who are adapting to urban universities. Th ird is encouragement of projects that highlight student achievements in science, like the Olympiad, and in writ-ing, like the Youth Platform, which celebrates young authors from the United States as well as many international high schools. Th e topics of these essay contests oft en focus on peace making.3Th is discussion entails an account of the positive eff ects of the philosophy of Gülen on education around the world, along with a review of critics’ charges, covering the situating of Gülen in the context of literary genre the-ory. Th e fi rst Gülen-inspired schools were in Turkey, where he began teach-ing near Izmir, opposite the Aegean Isle of Chios where Homer composed. From there, schools began to appear elsewhere, including across Asia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, south to Cambodia and the Philippines, and throughout Africa, such as in Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Morocco. Th e astonishing spread of Gülen’s infl uence extends to South Africa and Europe (particularly France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Ireland) and to the Americas (especially Mexico, the United States, and Canada).Some Gülen-inspired schools are private and tuition-funded, like Brooklyn’s Amity School. Others are publicly supported, and still others are innovative hybrid programs adjoined to schools in public districts. In every case, both private and public schools are nondenominational and do not include teaching religion. Th is fact is key, and its importance warrants expo-sition, since some critics misunderstand and other misrepresent the Hizmet schools as challenges to the separation of church and state. Because the U.S. constitutional tradition does not allow for public education to include reli-gious practices and accents, the “separation” concern is more focused there,"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Gülen as an Educator • 109but it has also been raised in other locales such as Kosovo and Australia. We shall deal with some of these concerns later in the chapter.In this writer’s view, Gülen’s name will someday be included among other international educational philosophers who have deeply infl uenced American education, like the Italian Maria Montessori and the Russian Lev Vygotsky. To this point, Gülen is recognized for the ways he advances and elaborates a fusion of Eastern and Western humanism, one that is underval-ued today.Nasser D. Khalili, an Iranian entrepreneur and now a citizen of the United Kingdom, claims that “Islamic art and culture has made a huge con-tribution to the West.” 4 Scholars in many fi elds acknowledge the huge debt that the West owes the Muslim world, whether in the sciences, the arts, medicine, or concerning the very cosmos.5 It is from this heritage that Gülen derives his teachings in order to benefi t learners across the world. Th ose who acknowledge that most Greek science entered Europe from Arab lands merely credit Muslims as transmitters, but Muslims were and are far more than mere cultural transmitters. For instance, although the West inherited much from an attenuated classical past, its curriculum is fused, mostly unconsciously, with the Islamic tradition, where its participation in provid-ing a common cultural ground is not generally understood.Th ose people educated in the U.S. and European elementary and second-ary schools may not have been introduced to the ways that Christian art and literature of the Middle Ages and early Renaissance melded Roman and Islamic cultures; the latter is not oft en credited or understood. Another way to consider the amalgam of modernity is that the West acquired the prod-ucts of Greek genius as they were upgraded and extended by Muslims from the tenth through the sixteenth centuries.Over that time, such as during the Renaissance and under the infl uence of fi gures like Petrarch, this classical heritage was recognized as a sole cul-tural source, as if “the grandeur that was Rome” should receive all the credit for civilization’s march forward. To tease out but one illustrative paradox, consider Aristotle’s “Poetics.” Th e only source used was fi rst translated into Latin from Arabic a few years aft er Columbus set sail. Th en, a decade later, it was translated back into the supposedly seminal Greek of Aristotle.Authors like Chaucer, in Th e Canterbury Tales, or Dante, in Th e Divine Comedy, acknowledged the importance of Ibn Rushd, among a host of other Muslim scientists. Like the education of Montessori, a Christian, or of Vygotsky, a Russian Jew, Gülen’s teaching of only the temsil (secular) subjects"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"110 • Tom Gageis commensurate with that practiced in public, tax-funded schools in the United States today. We note how today’s elementary and secondary school curriculum is not only the temsil subjects of music, grammar, arithmetic, astronomy, geometry, composition, and thinking but also algebra and trigo-nometry, which demonstrate add-ons from Muslim traditions and cultures. In practice, teaching only temsil, those secular sciences, in schools, as is done in Gülen-infl uenced schools, and teaching religion only in churches, temples, and mosques avoids infringing on the human rights of minorities and is con-gruent with the practices following the U.S. Constitution.Th e subjects taught in schools as well as other Gülen-inspired enterprises, enumerated by Helen Rose Ebaugh’s sociological analysis of the Hizmet movement,6 are f urther evidence of our common heritage and, in some cases, of Western debt to Islamic innovations. Among these institutions are hospi-tals, banks, media outlets, disaster relief eff orts, and investigative journal-ism. Following the Dark Ages, a newly literate Europe appropriated much from Islam by operationalizing disciplines into similar service institutions that Gülen has envisioned and has realized by his contemporary Hizmet enterprises. As Fernand Braudel wrote in his infl uential study of the Renaissance and Mediterranean world, “Our Middle Ages were saturated, shot through with the light of the East, before, during, and aft er the Crusades.”7 Th at light mutually illuminates Gülen’s heritage and the mod-ern world, shining still today in peace-building schools.gülen’s influence and the criticsTh is summary of innovations in the Muslim world that were imported and then developed in the West provides a key to understanding the Gülen-inspired schools and their educational projects in their diverse forms. It also opens the subject of how the media have responded to a Muslim imam infl u-encing American education. A host of books and occasional mass media representations show how Gülen reformulated the message of his tradition to address modern needs by encouraging dialogue, tolerance, and the build-ing of schools rather than of mosques. Beyond the world of Islam, Gülen’s vision of education manifests itself at the following six levels.First, it is a move from a passive endorsement of education, occasionally modifi ed positively and negatively by media sensationalism, to a public embracing of those who teach and of institutions hosting interaction by its"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Gülen as an Educator • 111stress on commitment to and support of learners. Th is shift so values teach-ers and education that young Gülen-school graduates in Turkey8 and, one hopes, young American graduates will soon, in increasing numbers, be pur-suing careers in teaching.Second, Gulen’s vision is congruent with the earlier American traditions in which the education of children is, to a greater extent, under the aegis of local authority. Increasingly, state and federal administrations have linked student outcomes (with respect to curricular achievement components) with percentages of funding sources. From the viewpoint of those who embrace Gülen-style educational models, that is a faulty alignment. Such cost-benefi t accounting, they observe, has oft en led to miseducation that expunges the magic of classroom learning. As money comes increasingly from more and more remote sources, the neighborhood school and its class-room teachers have less say in what is taught, how that material is taught, and how to measure learning. Th e sum of grade point averages via teachers’ subjective assessments has been the best predictor of future successes, better than the additional expense of supposedly cheap quick-fi xes by state and federal assessments that purport to save tax-payer dollars but seldom do.9Th ird, this vision is inspiring students leaving universities and citizens at large not to invest in materialist pursuits and to give increasing priority to altruistic agencies that serve humankind. Th is service may require one’s relo-cation, sometimes to remote and challenging environments; it also encour-ages entrepreneurs who draw on Gülen’s Islamic tradition, leaders whom he valorizes, to provide needed fi nancial support for education.Fourth, it conceives of the family model, rather than the factory model, for education. Th e factory model was revealed in such educational diction as the “superintendent” who heads the enterprise and of the school setting as the “plant.” Th e family model means involving teachers, parents, and off -spring in the learning process that returns education to a rapport that neces-sitates shift s in its stance.10Fift h, this vision sets out to realize Gülen’s project of forming centers for harmonious and tolerant dialogue among all participants. Th is requires opt-ing for education not as learning from delivery or debate—in which there are winners and losers—but from a symposium of mutual respect and good will for all. Th e language in such cases is characterized by tag lines of “yes/and” rather than “yes/but.” In Gulen’s vision and practice, the “yes/and” approach better bonds the learner’s heart and the mind, the study of science, moral behavior, and the valuing of the past.11"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"112 • Tom GageSixth and fi nally, in addition to his reliance on the past, Gülen explicitly advocates education that addresses the needs of modernity with a focus on science, humanities, digitization, and ethics. Th ese ideas anticipate imple-menting goals for the post-modern classroom of computers and handheld tools that have replaced styluses, compasses, and chalkboards. For the global economy of the technological age, modernity demands new strategies for acquiring knowledge and morality in updated confi gurations.Given the boldness of their proposals and approaches, Gülen, Hizmet, and Turkish Americans who are involved with education have come under scru-tiny. Messages and linkages on the Internet range from adulation at one extreme to paranoia at the other. For example, a Texas network in the Houston area known as the Harmony Public Schools is cited in many of these critical reports, including a New York Times article and a 60-Minutes story.12 (Harmony emerged when several Turkish graduate students at universities in Texas found the state of science and math education to be deplorable, a situa-tion also recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Answering this need, they organized the Harmony charter school to provide a focus on sci-ence, math, and engineering.) Harmony has addressed allegations that the schools include teblig (religious topics) with responses or arguments like these: If religion has indeed been taught at any of the Harmony campuses, one would expect that in a free and pluralistic society, someone—be they students, par-ents, or teachers—would have reported this to the authorities. As for occa-sional allegations that the teaching of religion in the schools occurs but is not reported: With more than 99 percent of the Harmony student body and their parents being non-Muslim, non-Turkish Americans, one must ask, would such a practice truly go unnoticed? Allegations of teaching Islam are rooted in fear-mongering, offi cials at Harmony argue, with the intention of perpetuating religious and racial prejudice.13Th ose who are critical of either Gülen or Hizmet point to, for example, the lack of transparency and accountability, plus the presumed intimidating power as well as the ineff ability of the founder. Some claim that Turkish teachers in the American schools were underprepared, or that their dialects were challenging to students, and they were accused of having slipped into the United States as if to form a cell. Th ese are allusions that refl ect the cli-mate of fear that has so oft en shadowed American life. Still another accusa-tion was that the schools are staff ed with faculty members who are in America on visas, but, according to the Harmony response, only 10 percent were. Criticism aimed at how public monies are spent always warrants inves-"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Gülen as an Educator • 113tigation, but, in the case of Harmony Public Schools in Texas, the allega-tions were credibly responded to. Criticism from teacher unions needs also to be addressed, since the private character of Hizmet schools can be a chal-lenge to unions. As a member of the American Federation of Teachers for half a century, I have good reason to be alert to this. But, in my view, the language of the majority of critical writers during the time of controversy over these issues has been full of innuendo. It hinted that investigations, both federal and local, were pending and forebode dire consequences. Since 2010, when the attacks were made, it has become clear that nothing of con-sequence has turned up.In all of the attacks on Gülen schools, the words “Turk” and “Turkey” appear regularly, which is an eff ort to identify the education provided in the Gülen schools with the Republic of Turkey. Refl ecting on my own encoun-ters with Hizmet events since 2007, I have dealt with many Turks, as one would expect, since Gülen emerged with his earliest audience from Turkey. One of the teachers from Turkey counts more Greeks than Anatolians in his ancestry. I have met others who are several-generational Americans, one of whom can identify sixteen progenitors that include Anglo, Turk, and Native American ancestries. I have met Kurds, others from Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazahkstan, a Kosovar, an Australian, and an American, part Japanese and English, who taught in Vietnam. Clearly, the Hizmet movement embraces an international membership.Regarding other positive contributions of the movement, in the title essay of Statue of Our Souls Gülen enumerates the competencies needed by stu-dents who will be future leaders. In that essay, he concentrates on a variety of means to achieve integrative harmonious personalities. He describes such learned attributes that relate to “turning to science with a trio of reasoning, logic, and conscience”; pursuing knowledge of the universe; understanding with mathematics how humanity and natural phenomena relate; and appre-ciating art.14 Gülen’s generalizations are heuristics; further specifi city only limits them, for the attributes, though general, have pragmatic implications. More concrete specifi cs of what should be taught are up to the schools but always in conformity with the directives of the education departments of the state. Nowhere are a society’s values more codifi ed than in its educational curricula and its assessments of such in outcomes-evaluations. Gülen-inspired schools in the United States respect the local and state authorities, and they likewise trust in the will of elected and appointed offi cials to serve the publically determined good."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"114 • Tom GagetransitionsMuch of what I have stressed in this discussion may sound abstract, but I have practical aims. Let me draw upon a theoretical assessment in my book Gülen’s Dialogue on Education; using Gülen as a center of a Venn diagram, I explore overlapping commonalities with major educational theorists, includ-ing Montessori, Vygotsky, John Dewy, Jean Piaget, and a variety of social educational constructionists.15 In addition to these valid comparisons, Gülen accents love, openness to dialogue, respect for others, and resilience in the face of ambiguity—these being attitudinal components too rarely addressed in the educational literature. Th is stance and these strategies are congruent implicitly with prominent education theorists—whether con-servative, like Karl Bereiter, or progressive, like Robert Reich, former U.S. secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton. Instead of a teaching model that is just the delivering of facts assessed subsequently on multiple-choice tests, the goals of teaching today include improving skills for collaboration, developing expanded and deepened system thinking, honing competence and sophistication for abstract thought, and increasing one’s repertoire for experimentation, all prioritized by academics and informed by signifi cant laypersons as well. Implicitly, Gülen values these student outcomes, which, like the powerful infl uence of the family, derive from a nourishing but per-plexing environment.Gülen enumerates as learned attributes—or abilities that must be acquired by those he calls “Inheritors of the Earth”—the competence to think abstractly (that is, to infer the microcosm from the macrocosm and to be able to extrapolate from the microcosm to the macrocosm), to engage col-laboratively, to be well grounded in math, science, and aesthetics, to exhibit initiative; and to experiment in systemic patterning. Gülen has in mind those future highly educated leaders of business and government as well as all voting citizens of a democracy. He elaborates this last objective, which is “collaboration,” in a chapter entitled “Consolation” in Statue of Our Souls. Th is he sees as an essential requisite for cooperation, whether on the part of the rulers or the ruled, by adults or young students; it is “one of the prime dynamics which keep the Islamic order standing as a system.”16 Gülen elabo-rates further:Even if a person has a superior nature and outstanding intellect[,] if they are content with their own opinions and are not receptive and respectful to the"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Gülen as an Educator • 115opinions of others, they are more prone to make mistakes and errors than the average person. Th e most intelligent person is the one who most appreciates and respects mutual consultation and deliberation (mashwarat), and who benefi ts most from the ideas of others.17As with the family’s infl uence, Gülen values knowledge acquired when learners and teachers learn simultaneously in group work to identify, broker, mediate, and solve problems via engaging cooperatively with shared, learned strategies of how to advance a project that entails assigned stages. I contend that this thrust toward consultation, collaboration, and systems-thinking is crucial for U.S. education at every level. For too long, among those infl u-enced by the Gülen perspective, the culture has been mired in subjective individualism, keyed to self-reliance and autonomy, concepts that have been inherited from the American past but, unless transformed and reconfi gured, are ill-fi tting for the global economy. Th roughout the United States, specifi c zones of enterprise sustain catalytically our economy among world markets and are unmatched in internet technology, communications, space explora-tion, computer security defense, and molecular biology and biotechnology in areas like Silicon Valley, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Cambridge, Massachusetts; and Fayetteville, Arkansas. Th ese and many other geographic pockets are composed of women and men engaged in con-sultation and in the above-described collaborative endeavors. To attain sta-tus in these positive zones of productivity, one must broaden any local cen-trisms, whether Amero-centric or Eurocentric for the multi-centrism of the global citizen. In my half-century of experiences in Turkey, I fi nd of late many catalyzers of synergy among the Hizmet movement, those whom Gülen calls “aksiyon insanlar,” or “people who act.” Th ese are agents whose collaboration with others makes a diff erence through their writing, teaching, or working as aid volunteers responding to those in need aft er disasters.Gülen’s foundation is love, which he sees as an attribute of altruism grossly needed in an economy that encourages and, too oft en, feasts on greed. Th ese components of Gülen’s educational philosophy undergird needed attitudes lacking in all the present subject disciplines. Consider, for instance, the example of education for engineering, as spelled out by Yetkin Yildirim: “In preparation for unseen challenges of the future, Gülen understands that sci-entists and engineers must be made accountable and aware of the ethical dimension of their work. For this reason, new models for scientifi c education,"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"116 • Tom Gagemodels that welcome the involvement of ethical and moral perspectives, must be explored.”18Gülen stresses positive attitudes—among several themes—as founda-tional in today’s education, because the learner’s attitude will signifi cantly shape his or her future in the marketplace, and yet attitude cannot be meas-ured by standard accountability testing. For several semesters at Humboldt State University in California, I investigated with both undergraduate and graduate students the causes for local employers to terminate their employ-ees. Students interviewed more than a hundred employers in businesses along the north coast. Overwhelmingly, the data indicated attitudinal causes for fi rings, such as inability to deal with aged clients, lateness, not lis-tening, dishonesty, and blaming others for errors. In rare cases, perhaps 2 percent of them, reasons for termination were because of the employee’s lack of so-called skills, the acquiring of which has oft en been seen as the sole purpose of education. Research by the U.S. Center for Research and Development in Higher Education that focused on personality over a half-century supports the importance that Gülen prioritizes.19 Gülen’s message is to expand from the authority of the self as part of a family to being a respon-sible member of a larger community.As a caveat relating to Gülen’s culture, it may be wise at this point to dis-cuss reading his philosophy in translation. I write about Gülen’s education theories with the guidance of some who read him in Turkish. However, all translation misrepresents the source to a certain extent. Gülen’s exposition reveals contrasting rhetorical strategies and literary genres remote to Western eyes, a thesis corroborated by recent studies of Muslim discourse.20 Gülen’s craft of composing entails diff erent aims and audiences, depending on whom he is addressing. Th ese are not general but specifi c to the ummah, or Muslim congregations.21 Like, perhaps, in the case of the rhetoric of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose metaphors may appear to the jaded as fl ow-ery, Gülen’s images can fi lter into English as awkward. For example, the word “tolerance,” derived from the Turkish, implies in English hegemonic/subaltern relations. Can one ask of a street person to be tolerant? Such con-notations belie the semantics of the Turkish source, which is best rendered into English as “not feeling discomfort in the presence of diff erence.”Along with the problem of translation, those who deal cross-culturally with Gülen’s thoughts and strategies also have to address with the issue of genre.

As Dwight Reynold explains: “[C]ontents of autobiographies refl ect a widespread conceptualization of life as a sequence of changing con-ditions or states rather than as a static, unchanging whole or a simple linear progression through time.”24 He elaborates:Although it is fi lled with narratives of diff ering lengths, the work as a whole rejects the concept of ordering a life into a single narrative, a life “story” in the literal sense.

It refers to the legacy of the American founders, who authored in 1776 the Declaration of Independence and, later, in 1787 and 1789, the Constitution with the Bill of Rights. Some political factions who today advocate a “Christian America” create the impression that these founders were all orthodox Christians trying to invent a republic that privileged their particular faith. Although most of these founders were, in fact, Christians of one sort or another, much of their thinking on consti-tutional and educational matters refl ected their variety of religious infl u-ences as well as a desire to begin separating church from state.

Th ese articulations have led to his arrest though never to a conviction of guilt for undermining the Turkish state.28 Although Gülen has consistently raised issues about how the Republic of Turkey centralized the administration of education, he has also consistently advocated that the schooling of youth address only temsil subjects and, further, that schools and teachers conform to what B. Jill Carroll calls “a state-mandated curriculum and to submit themselves to state review.”29Some scholars, Carroll among them, consider Gülen a humanist in the tradition of Erasmus (1466–1536). Both of these thinkers reveal an openness and piety in contrast to scriptural authority as conceived in their times. Enlightened leaders of their times welcomed each, but their goals of peace were frustrated when militant members in the faith communicants embraced violence.30 Humanists like Erasmus and Gülen likewise exegete the basic scriptures of their religions in order to apply age-tested wisdom to contemporary life, seeking peace.31Th e word humanism warrants scrutiny when applied to Gülen in order to clarify ambiguities addressed by another Gülen scholar and by returning to historical origins.32 Helen R. Ebaugh frames Gülen’s interest in science and faith as complementary and compatible, and, far from being in contention, they were conceived as agencies for pursuit of knowledge to link one’s outer world with inner experiences.33 Gülen’s worldview provides a context for secular learning because he “rejects religion as blind faith and criticizes those who fail to use their reason and to explore and analyze the observable uni-verse. Th erefore, he sees the necessity of reconciling faith and reason rather than disparaging either of them.”34Th e present comprehensive embrace positions Gülen in the humanist tradition that is inherent in Islam as well as in the humanist tradition from the Renaissance.

However, humanism in many forms are also at home in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam alike, a common element in each great religion.Since the Enlightenment, the West has increasingly emphasized secular learning while downgrading religious disciplines and approaches to knowl-edge. Th is approach does have philosophic benefi ts but, in the eyes of many critics, a philosophic downside as well. Today, for some interpreters, the con-cept of humanism connotes a reduction or abolition of the dominant station of religion. Th ere is also the common understanding that humanism denotes a valuing of life, (that is, of humans as well as other sentient beings). In the case of homo sapiens, a seminal corollary is that each person warrants the opportunity to achieve his or her full potential, which for Gülen shares the ancient Aegean understanding that, in acquiring knowledge of the world, one actualizes the latent excellence of humans.Apprehending the paradox of church and state, Gülen envisions a separa-tion similar to that which Th omas Jeff erson elaborated late in his life to clarify the intent of his fellow Founding Fathers in establishing religious freedom in the new United States. Jeff erson described this discourse as a “mantle of its protection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo, and Infi del of every denomination.”35 Th is humanism was (and is) not unique to the West; indeed, it draws from the fusion of the religious secular approaches of Islam.Refl ecting on the above, it can be said that Gülen-inspired educators and the Hizmet movement itself derive from the same historical sources as the West. Spatial diff erentiation, dress, and manners of expression may blur the perception of some in modern times. Although Gülen has been targeted by both the over-reactive and the well-intentioned but misinformed, the United States is already benefi ting from a new ethos—which, ironically, is not so new. Gülen believes that every person is responsible for acquiring knowl-edge, for acting to better the world, and for holding true to adamantine verities.In Statue of Our Souls, Gülen advances only those temsil subjects that—as implied in the metaphor of the book’s title—craft a person’s representa-tion, which is in turn sculpted by good deeds. In this image, one’s lasting “statue” results from (in Gülen’s phrase) the emergence of aksiyon insani, or “the person of action,” who actualizes moral behavior.

Th e U.S. media’s nearly exclusive focus on negative images presented as exemplifying the circumstances of all Muslim women’s lives results from the dearth of knowledge about Muslims and Islam among viewers and jour-nalists alike, coupled with an agenda to promote fear and hatred of Muslims and to expand readership and increase profi ts. Acts of violence perpetrated against non-Muslims in the name of Islam by some radical reform groups, and oppressive practices targeting women in some Muslim contexts, both of which are erroneously labeled Islamic, dominate the media, whereas the vision of Islam that informs the practices, comportment, and lifestyles of most Muslims receives little or no coverage.Th is chapter seeks to elucidate some of these misconceptions by examin-ing the status and roles of women as they are understood and lived by one Muslim community—namely, the affi liates of the Hizmet movement.

However, one problem raised even by many who sympathize with the movement has to do with the historic and contemporary under-standings of the role of women. People who know little else about Muslims “know” that it denigrates women and forces them to accept male leadership.

Th is notion also consti-tutes one dimension of secular feminists’ general rejection of religion as irreparably patriarchal. With regard to Islam, it derives from the lack of knowledge not only about Muslim women’s historical and contemporary societal roles but also about the way such practices as the wearing of head coverings by women, gender segregation, gender-based divisions of labor, and polygyny are presented in the foundational sources, the Qur’an and Hadith. Perceived as religiously sanctioned by some non-Muslims and Muslims alike, these practices are frequently criticized and inextricably linked to Muslim women’s submission and oppression. Moreover, these same stereo-types informed early European Christian critiques of Muhammad’s multiple marriages and the distorted images of harem life in paintings and inaccurate descriptions produced by later European male artists, writers, and travelers.Impelled by the abundant media attention and scholarly focus on gender, Islamic reformers of all stripes feel obliged to publicly articulate their views in response to, or in spite of, these stereotypes. Not surprisingly, many of these articulations, including those of Gülen, compare the historical and contemporary status, roles, and rights of women in Muslim and Western contexts. Whether addressing local, national, or global audiences, some reformers clarify that these gender-related practices are matters of personal choice. To other reformers, they are indeed viewed as religious obligations. In Iran and Saudi Arabia, for example, laws requiring women to wear pre-scribed forms of head coverings and restricting their mobility in the public"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Women and the Hizmet Movement • 125sphere are strictly enforced. By contrast, the wearing of head coverings by women employed in the civil service or university students in Turkey was prohibited from 1982 until 2008, and it is currently banned in France for public school students, teachers, and staff , and in Germany for public school teachers. Polygyny, while illegal in some Muslim countries but permitted with formal consent by a current wife or wives elsewhere, is relatively rare except among the wealthy in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and parts of Africa, where it remains unrestricted.For nearly a century, scholars worldwide—Muslim and non-Muslim alike—have sought to bring clarity to these issues. Many of them underscore the fact that women’s oppression derives from cultural, social, and economic realities and that it continues to exist worldwide. Some scholarly research on the wearing of head coverings by women has documented its origins in Greece and Persia and later proliferation among Muslims (as well as Christians and Jews) in the Middle East, and subsequently worldwide. Other scholars have demonstrated that the foundational Islamic sources, the Qur’an and Hadith, do not explicitly require veiling, gender segregation, and women’s seclusion and limited mobility; still others cite the same sources to assert the opposite. With regard to polygyny, most scholars agree that it initially aimed at addressing the needs of widows.Understandings of these practices have varied widely among Muslims around the globe, as have scholarly approaches for investigating them. Whether deemed religiously sanctioned, considered matters of personal preference, or enforced by law, they have been the focus of heated debates among women complying with them, their detractors, and scholars from diverse backgrounds and fi elds. An important question that arises is whether or not they are necessarily emblematic of women’s submission and oppres-sion. Responses from women, who have adopted them voluntarily in increas-ing numbers since the 1980s, or who comply with them under coercion, vary considerably. Furthermore, the approaches and terminolog y employed by scholars who study Muslim women and their daily lives and religious prac-tices have undergone considerable revision in recent decades.Th e term feminist has been used to designate Muslim women actively seek-ing to improve the status, roles, and rights of women in their communities and societies, with the understanding that their activism constitutes resistance to patriarchy.1 Furthermore, liberal secular feminist scholars such as Saba Mahmood have emphasized the need to broaden the spectrum of actions labeled feminist.

Mahmood’s results reveal that key to assessing the practices of the par-ticipants in Islamic revival and other religious and social movements is a thor-ough grasp of their perceptions of their practices, of the self-transformative processes that they enable, and of the impact of those processes on their every-day life circumstances as well as of the principles and values that underpin them.

He rejects the belief that Muslim women should be treated as inferior with regard to legal testimony and inheritance. Citing Qur’an verses on these topics and the his-torical contexts of their revelation, he contends that the testimonies of two women were equated with that of one man in the case of fi nancial contracts, as the latter were historically beyond women’s scope of experience. Th at this rule also applied to rural male inhabitants who were likewise unfamiliar with urban business practices proves that it was not based on women’s infe-riority but instead on their lack of familiarity with the subject matter. Similarly, inheritance laws gave men twice women’s portion to ensure that the men upheld their legal obligation to support their families and all needy female relatives, not to degrade women. Based on these and other rulings, Muslim women were not denied but rather guaranteed equal rights with regard to freedom of expression and socioeconomic status. Th oroughly investigating rules and guidelines, along with the historical contexts of their inception, reveals their intent to maintain and promote gender equality and social justice.However, not all of Gülen’s approaches to practices regarding women fi nd their grounding in Qur’an verses and the historical context of their origination. He considers, for example, the wearing of head coverings to be compulsory for women, although no formal guidelines explicitly regulating practices pertaining to external appearance exist. Such practices are situated under the designation furuat, he explains, meaning that they are of lesser or secondary importance and are thus subject to individual interpretation, dis-cretion, and preference. In his view, embodying such Islamic values as com-passion, modesty, generosity, and devotion through daily life comportment is more important than complying with dress codes. Further, he asserts that there are no offi cial restrictions on women’s access to the public sphere in their communities and that their participation in the workforce is permissi-ble as long as the work conditions are suitable.3Freedom is a basic human right, in Gülen’s view, but the misguided means for its pursuit today disturbs him. He is critical of freedom when it is defi ned by sexual liberty or relegates women to objects of pleasure, entertainment, and advertisement. Furthermore, he rejects the argument that men are natu-rally disposed to oppress women. In his view, Muslim women live free lives and have been full participants in daily life in societies that are not con-taminated with non-Islamic customs. According to Hanafi jurisprudence, he explains, women have sometimes been permitted to serve as judges,"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"128 • Margaret J. Rauschparticularly for cases on female issues, since their understanding of the latter exceeds that of men. Furthermore, he reminds readers that early Muslim women prayed in mosques together with men, led armies, engaged in busi-ness, and could voice their opposing views with regard to judicial matters at a time when Christians were debating whether women were human beings with souls or were devils. To exemplify this contrast and underscore the notable discrepancies between women’s roles and status in Islam and Christianity, Gülen refers to the writings of Lady Montagu, who accompa-nied her husband on his diplomatic mission to the capital of the Ottoman Empire in the early eighteenth century.4 Lady Montagu challenged contem-poraneous European male scholars’ inaccurate accounts of Muslim women by recording the observations she made during home visits. She praised the superior hygienic conditions of women’s lives, their participation in many spheres of social life, and their right to personally possess and manage wealth and property. Gülen points out that the right to own property, though guar-anteed to Muslim women from the beginning, was denied to European women until the late nineteenth century.On the issue of polygyny, he clarifi es that neither the Qur’an nor Hadith encourage Muslim men to take more than one wife. Instead, the Qur’an mentions polygyny as an option intended to protect and support women who are deserted or widowed. It requires equal treatment of all wives, which makes taking more than one very diffi cult, if not impossible, and therefore strongly recommends taking only one.5Regarding gender roles, Gülen asserts that, while there is no obstacle to equal rights and responsibilities for women and men, they nonetheless dif-fer. Gender roles have developed in accordance with these diff erences, but they should not be used as the basis for any form of gender hierarchy. Islam does not distinguish between men and women’s status, he argues, since both are fundamentally human. In Gülen’s view, men and women are not the same but, rather, complement one another like two sides of a coin: men are oft en physically stronger and more oft en capable of bearing physical hard-ship, whereas women are more compassionate, delicate, and self-sacrifi cing, predisposing them for bearing the responsibilities of motherhood. As he articulates it, God bestowed upon women the unique and honorable posi-tion of being the fi rst nurturers and educators of each new generation.6Education, according to Gülen, is a life-long process that begins with childhood upbringing. Although mothers are the initial and primary nur-turers and educators, fathers are encouraged to provide aff ection, care, and"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Women and the Hizmet Movement • 129guidance to their children in keeping with the Prophet’s example. Both par-ents educate their children directly and indirectly through their words and deeds, which should refl ect their values and principles. According to Gülen’s writings, modeling constitutes an essential component of education during this—and subsequent—phases. As elucidated in the following excerpt, teachers (by which, though not explicitly, he includes women and men) do not simply impart knowledge:Th e real teacher . . . is occupied with what is good and wholesome. [Th ey] lead and guide the child in his or her life and in the face of all events. . . . [A] child is cast in his or her true mould and attains to the mysteries of personal-ity. . . .

In addition to setting a good personal example, teachers should be patient, . . . know their students well, and address their intellects and their hearts, spirits, and feelings . . . , not forgetting that each individual is a diff er-ent “world.”7Gülen emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and developing the whole individual in all its facets. Education therefore encompasses guiding children—girls and boys—in the cultivation of essential values and princi-ples. He advocates equal participation for women and men as parents, teach-ers, and pupils.Education continues beyond formal schooling as a kind of self-transfor-mation that occurs naturally in society, in Gülen’s view. Among men and women affi liates, it entails the individual and communally supported pur-suit of self-perfection, which comprises the acquisition of character traits and propensities such as self-supervision (muraqaba), self-scrutiny (muha-saba), and limiting one’s relationship to material things (zuhd). It centers on self-renewal through emulation of peers and advanced-level affi liates. It pre-pares affi liates to off er service to others as a means of addressing societal problems linked to widespread animosity and lack of compassion for others, which are understood to arise primarily from excessive materialism."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"130 • Margaret J. RauschGülen envisions self-perfection as a means to revitalize compassionate acceptance of others, which is central to true humanism. His approach con-sists of empowering one’s spirituality against one’s carnal self (nafs) instead of shunning the material world. In his view, other people constitute equals, not opposites. Compassion, dialogue, and a mutually supportive existence are central to self-perfection and to the discovery of one’s “true identity.” Essential components of the process are action and thought, which are inte-grally linked to serving and guiding others, as articulated in the following excerpt:[T]he way to true existence is action and thought, and likewise the way to renewal, individual and collective.Action in this context then means embracing the whole of creation with full sincerity and resolve, aware of journeying to an eternal realm . . . ; it means expending all one’s physical, intellectual and spiritual faculties in guiding the world to undertake the same journey.As for thought, it is action in one’s inner world. Any truly systematic thinking entails seeking answers to all questions arising from the existence of the universe as such. In other words, truly systematic thinking is the prod-uct of a conscious mind relating itself to the whole of creation and seeking the truth in everything through its language.. . . [T]he realization of such noble aims depends on the existence of guides and leaders able to both diagnose our external and inner misery and to be themselves in constant relation with the higher worlds. . . . Th us, all the insti-tutions of life will be remoulded. . . . Sciences will progress hand-in-hand with religion, and belief and reason combined will yield ever-fresh fruits of their cooperation. In short, the future will witness a new world built in the arms of hope, belief, love, knowledge, and resolve.8Although gender is not explicitly mentioned, Gülen is addressing both men and women affi liates. In the following excerpt, he implicitly elaborates the role of language as a further dimension of self-perfection:Language is one of the fundamental dynamics in the composition of a cul-ture. Language is an important tool for humankind in our eff orts to better understand the cosmos and events both holistically and analytically. Th e more richly and colorfully a nation can speak, the more they can think; the more they can think, the broader is the span their speech can reach. Every single society leaves behind what they speak and think today for its validity to be probed, tested, and protected by future generations. In this way, a huge reserve of experience and learning are saved from being wasted; the knowl-edge and ideas of the past are utilized for the benefi t of the present; what was"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Women and the Hizmet Movement • 131right or wrong in the past is compared with the rights and wrongs of today so that we do not tread the same path and suff er from the same errors. Th is is valid for all nations of the world; the capacity of a language to express a thought is related to the level of development it has achieved, and a thought can become the instrument by which the language is tuned to this level of development. From every aspect, language plays a defi ning role in the forma-tion of our culture.9Self-perfection is facilitated by group spiritual conversations (sohbetler), where more advanced men and women affi liates serve as role models and supervise the progress of novices. No formal, explicit guidelines exist for conducting sohbetler or for monitoring progress. Instead, Gülen’s writings off er a new “language and culture” and attributes to be cultivated to create the ideal men and women models of an awaited “Golden Generation.”Th e members of the Golden Generation “will put might under the com-mand of right, never discriminate on grounds of colour or race” and “unite in their character profound spirituality, wide knowledge, sound thinking, a scientifi c temperament, and wise activism. . . . Never content with what they already know, they will continuously increase in knowledge—knowledge of the self, knowledge of nature, and knowledge of God.” Th ey will attain “true life” by applying the attributes developed through self-perfection as follows:Th e true life is the one lived at the spiritual level. Th ere is a mutually sup-portive and perfective relation between one’s actions and inner life. . . . Attitudes like determination, perseverance, and resolve illuminate one’s inner conscience, and the brightness of this inner conscience strengthens one’s will power and resolve, stimulating him or her to ever-higher horizons. Th ey will always seek to please the Creator and humanity . . . and enjoy orderliness, harmony, and devotion to duty in their outer worlds. At the same time, they increase the pure light of their inner worlds. . . . Th eir intel-lect can combine . . . all current knowledge . . . and thereby obtain new syn-theses. Th ey are so modest that they see themselves as just ordinary people among others. Finally, their altruism has reached such a level that they can forget their own needs and desires for the sake of others’ happiness.10Th ese attributes and character traits enable spiritually advanced men and women to confront societal problems worldwide.Th e resolution of these problems lies in awakening others and off ering them guidance, according to Gülen. He elaborates this process as follows:In order to awaken the people and guide them to truth . . . those young peo-ple . . . implant hope in our hearts, enlighten our minds and quicken our"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"132 • Margaret J. Rauschsouls. . . . Th ey will visit every corner of the world . . . and pour out their reviving inspirations into the souls of the dumbstruck people.11As the excerpts cited above reveal, affi liates continuously pursue self-perfection in preparation for, but also in conjunction with, off ering service and guidance to others. In Gülen’s vision, all three dimensions—cultivating self-perfection, off ering service, and guiding others—are equally accessible to men and women, and both genders are capable of contributing to the res-olution of world problems. Most important, in Gülen’s view, is that every action be undertaken in the hope of pleasing God.gender in hizmet practices and institutions and in affiliates’ daily livesAffi liation with the Hizmet movement encompasses implementing the ideas and practices and cultivating the values and character traits advanced by Gülen in pursuit of God’s pleasure. Th ese ideas, practices, values, and char-acter traits include the wearing of head coverings by women, gender segrega-tion, and gender-based divisions of labor. In the context of Gülen-inspired institutions and practices as well as in everyday situations, many affi liates observe these gender-related practices. Nonetheless, their observance is con-sidered a matter of personal preference and should not result from social pressure or coercion. Noncompliance does not hinder women’s equal par-ticipation in movement activities, nor does compliance prevent them from pursuing degrees in higher education and professional careers. On the con-trary, covering their hair and other body parts deemed erotic, and avoiding inappropriate contact with members of the opposite sex, enable affi liates to decide to reserve acts of amorous aff ection and sexuality for one’s future spouse. Th e practices enable women to concentrate on developing other fac-ets and attributes of their selfh ood. Th ey do not consider them to be forms of gender discrimination. Th e sole practice that can be viewed as discrimina-tory with regard to gender is women’s exclusion from admission to the select circle of affi liates who undergo advanced training in the Islamic sciences with Gülen in his private residence.Religious ritual observance and personal spiritual refl ection are two occa-sions when gender segregation is the most strictly maintained. Many women"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Women and the Hizmet Movement • 133affi liates feel that the presence of members of the opposite sex is inappropri-ate and undesirable, as it would impede their capacity to adequately concen-trate on the experiences encompassed by spiritual refl ection and ritual observance. Th ese experiences are personal and emotional, and thus better suited for the intimacy of a gender-segregated space, according to these women affi liates. Furthermore, whereas male affi liates perform ritual prayers as a group in unison with one of them serving as prayer leader, women pray individually or side-by-side in small groups without designating a leader. Th is is the only gender-based distinction between men and women’s separate participation in these two activities.Both take place communally in the context of gatherings for spiritual conversation (sohbetler) and retreats (yaz kamplar:, or summer camps). Th e term sohbet (sing.) refers to a gender-segregated gathering for spiritual refl ec-tion and discussion commonly held once a week by affi liates. Reading aloud from a text by Gülen or Said Nursi or watching a video of Gülen preaching serves to stimulate this refl ection and discussion. Th e topic of focus depends on participants’ stage of development and interest. An advanced-level affi li-ate, referred to as big sister (abla; pl. ablalar) or big brother (abi; pl. abilar), leads the gathering and serves as a role model and source for answers to ques-tions on doctrine and practice. One affi liate recalled her earliest sohbet expe-rience in Turkey:Th e abla read from a book. It was either by Gülen or Said Nursi. We dis-cussed the reading and tried to fi gure out its implications and ways it could be applied to real life. Sohbetler are interactional. Th ey were not lectures. Each woman explained what she had understood. Th ere was a nice, harmoni-ous atmosphere. Sometimes we would go jogging, eat delicious food and have fun together aft er the sohbet. When in college, during the daytime, I was busy with courses and worldly issues. Th e abla kept me focused on the other world and the idea of struggling to be a better person. I felt like I was getting my spiritual food from sohbetler.12Th e role of ablalar and the gender segregation of sohbetler were described by another affi liate in the following way:Ablalar help students to improve themselves. Th ey try to motivate them and help with their homework. Th ey also try to teach them something about reli-gion, if possible. But the most important and benefi cial way to learn some-thing from an abla is by observing her. Her attitude and behavior are more eff ective than what she says. And it is important that she is a woman, and"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"134 • Margaret J. Rauschthat the group is all women. Women can relate better to other women, and share their inner thoughts and feelings better with other women. Gender segregated gatherings have a variety of advantages.As described above, sohbetler are usually followed by a light meal or snack and friendly conversation as well as other activities on some occasions. Th e ulti-mate purpose is to cultivate the attributes necessary for the self-perfection process by discussing them and observing a same-gender living role model who embodies and enacts them, but it also constitutes an opportunity to get to know and build friendships with other same-gender affi liates.Th ere are no offi cial guidelines regarding attire for sohbetler or other movement-related activities, much less other daily life situations. However, both men and women are expected to dress modestly, and women are required to wear head coverings while performing daily prayers. Modesty for men entails wearing loose garments covering their torso from their shoulders to their knees. Short-sleeved shirts and short pants are deemed permissible, but most men prefer long sleeves and long pants even in the summer at formal events—and at informal mixed-gender gatherings. Modesty for women may vary to an even greater extent in accordance with personal preferences and depending on whether an activity or event is gen-der mixed or gender segregated. Many women affi liates cover their entire bodies except for their hands and face at all times, except to bathe, at bed-time, and when they are in their own homes, the homes of relatives or close friends, or in certain gender-segregated settings. By contrast, other women affi liates cover their heads exclusively during prayer. Many women affi liates choose to wear long skirts, whereas others feel that wearing pants is a satis-factory means for maintaining modesty.Sohbetler also occur daily during kamplar (retreats), which are held in the summer (yaz) in Turkey and during the winter break in the United States. Th e retreats for single students in Turkey are always gender segregated. Participants need not be movement affi liates. Retreats for married students, teachers, and professionals in other fi elds also take place in Turkey and the United States. A ffi liates usually attend as married couples, with or without families. Most activities are held in gender-segregated groups, but some family-oriented events occur. As with sohbetler, the activities occurring dur-ing retreats correspond to the participants’ levels of advancement toward self-perfection. One affi liate described her fi rst retreat experience in Turkey as follows:"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Women and the Hizmet Movement • 135I attended my fi rst yaz kamplar while living in an ışık evi (movement subsi-dized dormitory). Every day we gathered in groups for sohbet, followed by diff erent activities and snack time. I got close to the other women by sharing my feelings and ideas and enjoying fun activities with them. I learned a lot from them, especially from the ablalar. Th ey explained things and guided me. More importantly, they demonstrated the behavior I was trying to learn. It is pleasant and benefi cial to be surrounded by women pursuing the same goals. I cannot imagine achieving the same development and having the same enjoyment if there were guys present. I would have felt intimidated and distracted, and I would not have been able to explore so many diff erent emo-tions and inner thoughts.Bringing along a friend not affi liated with the movement is permissible, she explained further. Modesty is expected for all participants in retreats, but the degree of observance varies according to personal preference. Ya z k a m-plar constitute occasions for more concentrated doses of spiritual refl ection and growth, as other distractions are absent.Dormitories, known as ışık evleri (lighthouses) extend access to higher education to Turkish youth whose parents are without the necessary fi nan-cial means. Th ey are built near high schools and universities in urban centers with funding provided by movement affi liates. Th e ışık evleri off er sohbetler and organize yaz kamplar for student residents. Many students have no prior experience with or knowledge of the movement. Th eir residency does not obligate them to participate in the sohbetler and yaz kamplar or to be affi li-ated with the movement in any way. Nonetheless, many eventually become movement affi liates. A woman affi liate who is currently pursing her Ph.D. in the United States recounted her initial experiences in an ışık evi as follows:My introduction to Hizmet was aff ected by terms used by Hizmet affi liates, such as abla, abi and tevafuk (by the will of God), which were familiar to me from childhood. In Turkey, younger cousins call older ones by their names plus abla or abi depending on gender. I was very impressed by my older cous-ins’ knowledge. Th eir response to my insistence that things happen by chance was to teach me about God’s will. Th ey would say: “Th ere is no such thing as chance. Th ere is only tevafuk!” I was reminded of these childhood experi-ences when I stayed in an ışık evi during col lege . I k new it belonged to Hizmet and was unsure of what to expect. Th e abiler and ablalar were wiser than me and also spoke of tevafuk. I eventually grew to love it more than any other place. My abla always insisted that I stay at the ışık evi as much as possible even on weekends. At that time, my parents became prejudice[d] against Hizmet and were afraid of losing me. People told them that the Hizmet peo-ple would brainwash me. When I learned about Gülen-inspired schools"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"136 • Margaret J. Rauschworldwide, I told my parents I wanted to teach abroad. Th ey were terrifi ed. My father asked to speak with my abla. Th e following weekend, I brought home a DVD about the schools for him to watch. While watching it, his eyes fi lled with tears. He said: “You should work in a Turkish speaking countr y in Central Asia! Th ey need our help!” Th e voice of Hocaefendi [aff ectionate appellation for Gülen meaning honorable teacher] recorded on CDs and DVDs was always audible in the ışık evi. I missed it when I went home, so I began taking home DVDs to watch with my family. At the time, I wished I could be a student and live in ışık evleri forever. Th ose were the most beauti-ful years of my life.Th rough gender segregation and the presence of abiler and ablalar, the ışık evleri off er residents a morally acceptable atmosphere that is already familiar to them in some ways. In addition, they are immersed in an intimate envi-ronment where central values and ideas permeate daily life. Members of the opposite sex, such as residents’ family members and repairmen, enter only on special occasions with prior notifi cation of all residents. Male and female students in adjacent ışık evleri sometimes take part in gender-mixed events, but they sit or interact in gender-segregated spaces. Modesty is required in communal spaces in all ışık evleri, but most female students cover their heads only during prayers.During events and activities geared toward reaching out to people outside the movement, strict gender segregation is not maintained; however, gender-based divisions of labor and other limits are noticeable. Unlike men affi li-ates, women affi liates rarely serve as organizers for or speakers at interfaith dialogue dinners, academic conferences, and other events, though they are frequently present. At interfaith dialogue dinners, they are oft en assigned seats next to their husbands or, if single, next to another woman affi liate, but they interact freely with male and female nonaffi liates seated at the same table. Th ey also participate in meals with guests at group breakfasts, lunches, and dinners at academic conferences organized by the movement. Th ey rarely present papers or chair panels but are present in the audience and may participate in the question-and-answer sessions. Another dimension of their participation entails greeting and handing out nametags and programs to the nonaffi liated dinner and conference guests as they arrive at these events. Th us, while such gender-based divisions of labor do not hinder women affi li-ates’ access to public visibility and freedom to interact with both female and male guests at these events, they reserve roles and tasks typically belonging to leadership positions exclusively for male affi liates."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Women and the Hizmet Movement • 137When questioned about their attitudes toward leadership and the possi-bility of women holding leadership positions in the movement, women affi liates’ responses diff ered considerably and off ered several alternative understandings of it. Some focused on leadership as a concept; others looked more critically at the tasks it entails. Interestingly, gender as a factor in choosing leaders surfaced fairly infrequently in their responses.In fact, only three of the respondents spoke to the question of whether gender played a role in determining who is eligible to serve and who is not. Th e fi rst woman based eligibility for leadership squarely on gender, connect-ing the assignment of leadership roles to male affi liates with an allegedly innate male capacity for the tasks characterizing it. However, she also rejected the idea that those tasks should be elevated above the kinds of tasks in which, according to her, women tend to excel, and she believed that the latter should not be viewed as passive. In addition, she underscored the fact that all of the tasks performed by affi liates are important in ensuring the success of events and activities, and she asserted that women’s contributions are greatly appreciated:Th ere are diff erences between men and women in terms of leadership, but one is not above the other one. Th ese diff erences arise from their nature. Women are better at some things than men. People should work in their area of specialization. Most men are better at leadership and most women are bet-ter at organizing. Women appear to be passive, but without them most activi-ties could not happen. Th ey work in the background. People in the move-ment appreciate this a lot.Th e second woman spoke indirectly to the question of gender in relation to leadership by simply rejecting the idea that a hierarchy exists within the movement and arguing that all tasks are equally important and distributed based on individual daily life situations:Th ere is no hierarchy in the Hizmet movement. Everyone’s task is equally important as long as one is working for the common good and not for per-sonal gain. People make choices according to their situations.Th e third woman fl atly rejected the idea that the preference of men over women was the issue and instead perceived gender segregation as the decid-ing factor. She argued that the need for interaction among those affi liates who serve as leaders, which presupposes that all leaders be either female or"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"138 • Margaret J. Rauschmale, is the reason for women’s exclusion from leadership roles rather than women’s lack of propensity for or ability to carry out leadership tasks:Having no women as administrators does not mean that they cannot do the work. It is because men and women should not mix. All of the administra-tors could be women, but most women are studying, working and caring for their children and have no time for that work.She continued by providing examples of women successfully organizing and leading events—all of which, however, were intended exclusively for women. Interestingly, male respondents also rejected the idea that a hierarchy exists among affi liates and that women are unable or less or not at all disposed to serve as leaders. Th us, the notion that gender plays a signifi cant role appears to be generally downplayed by affi liates.Th e responses in a second category focus on the fact that leadership roles involve considerable responsibility, hardships, and broader repercussions for the personal lives of the male affi liates serving in them. Th e fi rst respondent pointed out that leaders have a heavy workload, but she also inferred that their wives share the burden since most of them may have to postpone their pursuit of higher education or employment as a result:Th e men who organize interfaith dinners and other events are overloaded with work. Most of them are single or have wives who are not studying or working.With a similar focus on the disadvantages of serving as a leader, the second respondent expressed relief. Holding a leadership position, as she implies in her response below, would interfere with child rearing and the pace of her studies:I am glad not to participate in administrative functions. I have children and I am studying. I can take good care of my kids and fi nish my studies faster.Th e third respondent addressed questions surrounding leadership by criti-cizing what she refers to as “radical feminism” for devaluing the tasks per-formed by wives and mothers. According to her, spouses, since they are ulti-mately performing the same tasks but for practical reasons in diff erent locations, are essentially collaborating and working together toward the same vision:Th ese equality questions are oft en approached from a wrong angle. Being equal does not mean doing the same things. Radical feminism has devalued"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Women and the Hizmet Movement • 139women’s role. We should ask: Why aren’t more men running homes or cook-ing for movement events? People undervalue these responsibilities and ele-vate employment outside the home. Essentially, both groups are doing the same kind of job, but in diff erent places, and the main reason is practicality. Administrators are responsible for large events that take weeks to organize. Th is requires counseling, advising and being gone from home for days. A mother cannot neglect her children and their emotional wellbeing just to compete with a man, when there are others who can do the job. Women and men have the same vision and work together, yet apart, toward that vision.According to her, mothers’ concern for the emotional well-being of her chil-dren is the main hindrance to competing with men and serving in leader-ship roles.Most frequent were responses that sought to deconstruct the concept of leadership. Th eir alternative vision encompassed a rejection of the usual ele-vation of leadership roles and tasks as if they were superior in status to or required a higher level of skills than other forms of involvement in move-ment events and activities. According to one woman, leadership essentially confl icts with one of the core character traits that are cultivated by affi liates in their pursuit of self-perfection—namely, humility. She used Gülen’s vision of leadership, and his intent to relinquish it for that reason, as an example:No one should strive to be a leader. Th e best leaders are the most humble ones, who become leaders naturally because others see them as leaders. Hocaefendi [Gülen] rejects being viewed as a leader. He considers himself a servant.Th e alternative view of leadership in the following response recognizes that role modeling, which is central to all forms of service performed by affi liates, can be perceived as a form of leadership:All the men and women in the movement lead by serving as models for oth-ers to follow. You don’t have to speak at an interfaith dinner to be a leader.Echoing the underlying message of this response, another woman under-scored the expertise acquired by women affi liates through higher education and the fact that this expertise is practically applied not only in child rearing but also in their interactions with their husbands. In her opinion, their con-tributions on both of these levels are essential in enabling the growth of the movement:"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"140 • Margaret J. RauschOne does not need public visibility to infl uence others. Higher education produces strong and wise women for raising children, not only for seeking employment. It entails attaining knowledge, wisdom and a well-balanced life. For mothers, acquiring knowledge is a must. It is an invaluable resource for child rearing and community development. Women’s wisdom also guides husbands in the right direction. Women are infl uential at the administrative level through wise interaction with husbands. Women’s knowledge, dedica-tion and willingness to execute their roles completely allow the movement to thrive and continue to grow in a sustainable manner.In this response, the existence of a gender-based division of labor is acknowl-edged. However, it is perceived not as an indication of women’s oppression or a hindrance to women’s pursuit of higher education but rather as an arrangement for ensuring that affi liates as spouses can establish a well-balanced home environment in which to raise their children and collaborate in furthering the aspirations of the movement. In fact, the wife’s “wisdom” and advice, in her view, are quintessential to the husband’s ability to eff ec-tively fulfi ll his administrative functions, on which the movement’s future depends. Th us, without offi cially serving as leaders, affi liates are nonetheless able to directly or indirectly guide others in their own way on diff erent levels and ultimately have an impact on the communities and societies in which they live through the movement.From the alternative visions of leadership presented in the above responses, it is evident that these women affi liates do not view their exclu-sion from offi cial leadership positions as a hindrance to their engagement in the movement, but instead consider the role modeling that all affi liates per-form in a variety of contexts as a form of leadership. Th ey also perceive all types of service, including raising their children and pursuing their higher education and career goals, as both necessary and equally important to advancing the goals and ensuring the future success of the movement.In their private lives, affi liates make their own choices regarding gender-based segregation and divisions of labor. As one woman affi liate articulated it, “Not everyone views Hocaefendi [Gülen] as a leader to the same extent. Some follow his guidance to a ‘T,’ others not much at all, and still others somewhere in between.” Many women affi liates are intent on pursuing higher education and career goals. Th erefore, careful refl ection on priorities, conscience cooperation among spouses, and intricate management of house-hold and child-rearing duties are a must. Although some female affi liates"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Women and the Hizmet Movement • 141may have to insist on their rights, many male affi liates enthusiastically par-ticipate in the rearing, care, and supervision of their children and voluntar-ily shoulder various other household responsibilities. When entertaining other affi liates in their homes, some affi liates insist on the strict mainte-nance of gender segregation, while others do not. Whether or not unmar-ried women affi liates are not invited or turn down invitations depends on the perspective of hosts and guests. In either case, affi liates are willing to accommodate each other’s preferences.Gender-based segregation, division of labor, and the wearing of head cover-ings, even when strictly implemented, do not prevent women affi liates from pursuing the main goal of the movement, which is hizmet (s er v ic e). Hizmet was summed up by women respondents as “the lens through which I view eve-rything I do”; “a fulfi lling way of life”; “the most important aim of my life”; “simply serving my family for the sake of God”; “being a good example in eve-rything I do”; and “seeking God’s pleasure in everything we do.” Emphasizing sincerity and purity of intention, which, in her view, can transform the sim-plest act into a form of worship, another woman defi ned it as follows:Hizmet encompasses 1) self-development, understood as seeking peace of heart and mind and developing good character, 2) sacrifi ce and serving peo-ple, almost to the point of living for others’ wellbeing, 3) teaching through words and 4) setting a good example. But all of these are meaningless with-out pure intention and sincerity. Pure intention and sincerity turn simple acts into worship.Her defi nition mentions additional facets, specifi cally self-sacrifi ce “almost to the point of living for others.” Th ose affi liates who would prefer to remain in their countries of origin but nonetheless commit to spending one or more years abroad experience this self-sacrifi ce the most emphatically, even if they are able to combine their movement commitments with the pursuit of higher education and career goals.Formulated more explicitly, this dimension of hizmet comprises off ering service to, engaging in interfaith and intercultural dialogue with, and pro-moting compassionate acceptance of others. It is undertaken through vari-ous means and in diff erent contexts. Th e following quote illuminates the way one female affi liate understood her eff orts to spread knowledge about Islam and Muslim women and consequently promote interfaith and inter-cultural understanding in the United States:"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"142 • Margaret J. RauschI am a Muslim lady with a headscarf. I came to the US alone for my MA program. I have a job and attend social activities. Th e fi rst impression should be that being a Muslim lady does not isolate me from the world and is not an obstacle for my career. My situation might help non-Muslims to change the stereotypes about Muslim women (such as uneducated, slaves of men, sup-pressed, etc.). I also try to be a nice, moral and kind person and interact with non-Muslims as much as possible so that they notice that we Muslims are not that much diff erent from them. I have also given public presentations and lectures about Islam and Muslim women on campus. I think they learn more from watching me than from what I say since being a living example is more infl uential than trying to impose your ideas.Similarly, another respondent relates that she and her husband employ their interpersonal interaction in public to dispel misconceptions about Muslim women, specifi cally the way their husbands treat them, as a means to spread knowledge and promote understanding:My husband and I usually hold hands in public in the US because we like doing it, but also because it is the image we want to project about Muslims, instead of CNN images of men walking ahead of women covered from head to toe in black.In keeping with these two responses, both of which suggest that actions speak louder than words, another respondent underscores the importance of pursuing self-improvement both as an end in itself and as a facet of and means to prepare for performing hizmet:Since participation in weekly meetings known as sohbetler is also viewed as part of hizmet, eff orts toward self-improvement are considered hizmet indi-rectly. Honestly, I feel that the biggest service one can off er society is to take the time to improve oneself to a certain degree before lecturing others.According to many women affi liates, striving to cultivate, embody, and model the values and attributes put forward by Gülen in his writings and through his living example as consistently as possible in daily life is consid-ered as much a part of hizmet as actually performing acts of service. Th ey feel that cultivating, embodying, and exhibiting them in daily life are equal in importance to the public speaking roles and administrative positions held by male affi liates. In their view, the ultimate aim of hizmet is to focus every thought, word, and deed on exemplifying and striving to proliferate the compassionate acceptance of others as a means to please God, alleviate suf-fering, and promote peaceful coexistence."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Women and the Hizmet Movement • 143conclusionAs revealed in the above examination of Gülen’s vision of gender, education, and self-transformation and of the ways that Hizmet movement participants interpret and apply the ideas, intentions, and values gleaned from that vision in their practices, activities, and daily lives, their central aim is to serve oth-ers. At the core of their preparation for service is the cultivation of compas-sionate acceptance of others, which goes hand in hand with refi ning specifi c character traits and values. Since this process begins with the individual and his or her interaction with other affi liates, achieving clarity regarding all facets of the self is essential, to which the importance of community cannot be overemphasized. Th e wearing of head coverings by women, gen-der segregation, and gender-based divisions of labor create an optimal envi-ronment for pursuing self-perfection since they highlight the realm of human instincts related to acts of amorous aff ection and sexuality. Observing these practices, while seen by those who comply primarily as one means to seek God’s pleasure, also facilitates reaching and adhering to the decision to reserve these acts for marriage. Gülen encourages their observ-ance as a way to exercise modesty, but he also considers it, like daily life prac-tices, to be a matter of personal choice. Nonetheless, he feels, as do many affi liates, that their observance enhances rather than hinders women’s par-ticipation in the movement and their ability to access and advance in other domains of life.notes1.

Hizmet principles promoting values beyond mere short-term fi nancial goals comport with (but pre-date) the 2010 principles announced by the United Nations Global Compact on Supply Chain Sustainability. For the U.N. and other associa-tions of business entities now pursuing corporate social responsibility as their modus operandi, this new direction owes more to pragmatism than idealism. Acting with concern for the operating environment, including workers and their communities, makes supply-chain disruptions less likely.Th e Hizmet movement, however, pursues something more. It seeks to bring morality and community service to the marketplace. Other organiza-tions, particularly in Islamic countries, have undertaken similar goals. Th e nineTh e Hizmet Movement in Business, Trade, and CommercePhyllis E. BernardTh e Hizmet movement attracts even the attention of people who live spiritually far from Sufi Islam, which is the starting point for Imam Fethullah Gülen. Beyond the zones of “interfaith dialogue” and “education,” which have been surveyed in preceding chapters, Gülen and many of his affi liates are very much at home in the worlds of business, commerce, and fi nance, which are alien territories to many who are steeped in sacred texts and devo-tionalism. Yet Gülen’s critiques of the economic order and practices have attracted diverse participants. Phyllis Bernard, the Robert S. Kerr, Jr. Distinguished Professor of Law at Oklahoma City University School of Law, tried out some of Gülen’s ideas in conversations that, she says, included “self-described atheists, agnostics, lapsed and practicing Catholics, secular and observant Jews, devout and disaff ected Protestants, [and] some Zen practitio-ners.” Inspired by Hizmet discourse, she also presents for comparison an option from his-tory that she favors: Quaker capitalism.

Any group achieving such success in commerce will inevitably change the social order, in small ways and eventually large. Th is prompts some observers to view Hizmet idealism with apprehension.Th e Hizmet model of capitalism does something radical: it puts people before profi ts. As an act of praxis—contemplation in action—the Hizmet approach continually calls on the followers of Gü len to ask in virtually every aspect of their business culture and decision making: “What is the right thing—the ethical thing—to do?”Unlike the shareholder capitalism model of business management, the Hizmet company is not driven by pressures to achieve quarterly earnings goals so that projected dividends can be paid. Instead, this Sufi paradigm for commerce measures achievement in terms of servant leadership and stew-ardship—not only within the company but also in the larger community.comparisons to quaker capitalismUsing faith to guide business decisions may sound like folly to most Westerners. Th at is, until one considers, as one example, the history of Quaker capitalism, which facilitated the accumulation of immense wealth combined with eff orts to uplift humanity. Barclay’s Bank, for instance, was founded by devout Quakers committed to the virtues of plain living and piety. However, aft er several generations, those principles could not with-stand the allures of modern industrialism.1Th e English Quaker Cadbury family was famous not only as chocolatiers but also as ethical employers who sought to create a capitalist workers utopia—something that their American Quaker competitor, Hershey, also attempted. In both businesses, the overt Quaker presence eventually trans-muted into early icons of modern corporate social responsibility but now are diffi cult to distinguish from other multinational corporations.By comparison, the Hizmet model thus far seems to keep idealism alive among followers even as they prosper fi nancially. Business people commit-ted to the cause work together to underwrite projects of spiritual signifi -cance that benefi t the larger public. To facilitate adherence to the move-ment’s altruistic goals, business people organize themselves into “circles” for peer support, providing mutual encouragement, advice, and assistance."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Hizmet in Business, Trade, and Commerce • 147Outsiders know little about the actual structure and day-to-day opera-tions of Hizmet circles. Compare this to the copious records left by English and American Quakers, who had maintained since the seventeenth century stringent rules for the conduct of business, fi nancing, and enforcement of those rules through fi nes. When examining the conduct of Quaker meet-ings that guided business dealings among the Friends, we clearly see the overarching paradigm of control to ensure truth and trust.2Modern-day Hizmet circles seem more akin to bands of trusted compan-ions sharing a quest. Th e Hizmet businessperson’s aim is two-fold: to carry out business according to eternal verities, and to contribute substantial sums of money, labor, and in-kind donations to support Hizmet projects for health care and education. Interestingly, this quest echoes the pioneer Quaker belief that “your own soul lived or perished according to its use of the gift of life.” Th us, spiritual wealth was more important than accumula-tion of possessions.3Invariably, people who are not already followers of Gü len question both motive and method: How/why do businessmen dedicate so much of their for-profi t endeavors to underwriting Hizmet philanthropy? Are their moti-vations benign? Are they sincere? As the Hizmet movement gains greater infl uence, are increasing numbers of business people attracted more to the peer group opportunities for business referrals than to fellowship with the faithful?fractals: using the micro to understand the macroSuch questions about the “true” nature of the Hizmet network cannot be answered by reference to the abstract model alone.

However, as James Harrington explains in another chapter in the present volume, when addressing attacks on Gü len and his followers one must consider the source of those attacks and the intended audience. Some negative judgments refl ect political manipulation of information. Others derive from a healthy skepticism about the role of idealism, faith, and trust in commerce—challenges that might equally apply to a network of avowedly Christian businessmen in America.

We shall use the following reference points as the framework to discuss the Hizmet movement in business, trade, and commerce.Although prominent and the subject of this book, the circles and confed-erations of Hizmet businessmen are not the only faith-based organizations that encourage Turkish businessmen to engage in private ventures while promoting the public good. Indeed, this approach to trade grows from the historical roots of many bazaars (marketplaces), which developed, in part, to support the adjacent masjid (mosque). In turn, this intertwining of com-merce with charitable works facilitated the fulfi llment of the obligation of zakat, one of the pillars of Islam.Th at being said, where a government provides few services to the under-class—in terms of education, health care, or provision for the poor—chari-table works inevitably assume political signifi cance, whether intended or not.5 Th e faith-inspired works of well-organized Muslims who take zakat seriously (similar to Christians who take seriously the obligation to tithe and to provide for the needy) can overshadow episodic or smaller scale eff orts by persons opposed to religion in the public square. Businessmen openly committed to zakat risk being labeled as “Islamist,” perhaps largely by comparison to a wholly profi t-driven model of capitalism where charita-ble works play no role.In the last quarter of the twentieth century, Turkey implemented policies that restructured and privatized the economy. Control shift ed away from so-called “family cartels” that dominated the industrial sector and away from state enterprises widely seen as ineffi cient. Th is process created oppor-tunities for a new generation of business leaders from “lower and middle class families” who found energy and empowerment through their faith communities.6 Were these “Islamists” as connoted by conservative Western media and politicians? Th at is, were such business groups—sometimes referred to as “Islamic brotherhoods”—merely part of a political strategy to build “extensive networks of charity and philanthropy” to recruit the disen-franchised lower classes to support a new theocracy?7It is intriguing to note this overlap in terminology. Th e term “Islamic brotherhood” might not necessarily denote a political party that American security analysts and politicians routinely identify with dangerous, funda-mentalist radicals. Instead, brotherhood (small cap) can be used as a generic term to describe social and business groups that Westerners might other wise recognize as a “lodge” or “club,” similar to Rotary International. Th e"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"150 • Phyllis E. Bernardinadvertent or intentional use of this loaded term raises the specter that Hizmet business groups pave the way for the return of caliphate “hard power” in the form of Shari‘a law.the “soft power” of purposeful philanthropyTo date, however, the Hizmet movement exemplifi es modern Turkey’s “soft power” of sharing culture, education, and infl uence—teaching by example a positive model of tolerance and modernism. Its network of schools builds interethnic and inter-religious tolerance person-by-person, community-by-community, over the span of time. Th e soft power includes programs for cultural exchanges, bringing hundreds of American educators, students, public offi cials, and non-Muslim clergy to Turkey every year. Stateside, Hizmet interfaith dialogue organizations introduce Americans to Turkish hospitality as a model of Islamic moderation. Hizmet businesses provide massive amounts of fi nancial support for these activities.A key characteristic of businessmen inspired by Gü len is the commit-ment to “quality education for the development of the human person and, simultaneously, for bringing Turkey into the modern era.”8 Businessmen support these eff orts through donations that average 10 percent of their annual income; many persons contribute as much as one-third of their income to support Gü len schools, hospitals, and other Hizmet activities.9Solid data on the number of such institutions, benefi ciaries, budgets, and amounts contributed are elusive. Other chapters in this volume address it more directly. Here, we focus on how this commitment to philanthropy grows from the Hizmet view of the role of commerce and education in society. Th at view sees the three elements—commerce, philanthropy, and education—as a dynamic triad that energizes the long-term eff ort to uplift humanity.Interviews I conducted in 2010 among members of Hizmet provided spe-cifi city that concretized general statements found in other texts. Business colleagues in Hizmet circles support not only their local Gü len-inspired school or college but also projects overseas. Th ey contribute money, personal time, and—it was stressed to me—prayers and friendship. One circle may adopt a school in Angola; another circle will choose a school in Haiti; and so on.

Parents must also be willing to encourage the education of females and for their children to take instruction from female teachers.As an example, businessmen of Kutahya (a rural city of fewer than 200,000 persons) contribute the equivalent of U.S. $15,000 per month to support a Hizmet school in Kyrgyzstan. Th is school’s mission is to educate a new generation of Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, and Russians who will be less likely to tolerate or participate in long-standing violent confl icts.10Such disciplined and purposeful philanthropy can trigger in some quar-ters a whiff of envy mixed with unabashed suspicion. Consider, for example, a description of the Hizmet movement as a sort of “cult” that is moving “increasingly mainstream”—with “tentacles” that “expand relentlessly.”11 Th is characterization comes from a self-described nonpartisan publication based in Israel, voicing common fears about any movement perceived as nur-turing anti-Israeli sentiments. Yet, little in Gü len’s statements or approach suggests an anti-Israeli agenda; rather, they promote peaceful coexistence with Israel as with the rest of the world.A more temperate analysis recognizes that the Hizmet movement follows a path previously laid by Said Nursi and the Nur community. Gü len and his followers ultimately exceeded the Nur circles paradigm. How? Th e Hizmet movement consciously and continuously reached beyond locality and social station to rear a new generation of entrepreneurs who pursue principled capitalism on a global level.12 Th e timing could not have been better. Viewed in historical terms, the maturing Hizmet movement in trade and commerce blended with currents that brought Turkey into the mainstream of interna-tional manufacture, mining, energy exports, and textile production.Th e growth of today’s global supply chains roughly paralleled growth of the Hizmet movement in commerce. Is there a connection? Perhaps. Th e Hizmet focus on education and ethics created a critical mass of highly edu-cated persons able to interact fl uidly with the West while honoring tradi-tional norms. Th is created a path that bridged traditional and modern, secu-lar and sacred, building capacity on all sides of the business transaction. Perhaps inevitably, Hizmet in commerce has grown to such a size that it is now viewed by many as a signifi cant factor in Turkey’s economic-political life, with infl uence that extends far beyond the stated, nonpartisan inten-tions of Gülen."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"152 • Phyllis E. Bernardbridging modern commerce and ancient traditionsSome years ago, most discussions about globalization accepted unquestion-ingly the theory that modernization (through international business deals) and secularization go hand in hand. Standardized templates of law and business practices would not only harmonize the law but also eventually nullify the impact of religion. Faith would have little eff ect on commerce except perhaps among the less educated, less sophisticated, lower-class masses.Emerging reality has not tracked past theory. Globalization and moder-nity thrive in a secular world but do not require jettisoning cultural values rooted in religious tradition.13 Granted, commercial transactions seeking short-term gains from episodic contractual arrangements may operate satis-factorily without focusing on deep cultural context. However, entrepreneurs seeking long-term, self-sustaining international business partners want and need more. Especially if markets involve suppliers, manufacturers, fi nanc-ing, or labor rooted in Islamic cultures, the businessperson seeking maxi-mum satisfaction strives to understand the human geography of the operat-ing environment and how to navigate through it.Standard westernized/Americanized templates for conceptualizing busi-ness “fl atten” the human terrain, enforcing a false homogeneity. Explicit reference points to “landmarks” of Western clothing, education, and tech-nology are taken as implicit assimilation of Western material values. Not so.

Although these visitors were seasoned professionals, they knew little if anything about Gü len, had generally never been in a country with the azan call to prayer, and most were not yet famil-iar with the idea of “three cups of tea” as a ritual of relationship building. (I refer here to the widespread tradition of tea and friendship in the Middle East, not merely the discredited popular book of the same name.)Th is dialogue created a fresh lens by which to view the Hizmet move-ment. Among other things, it revealed that one’s understanding of Hizmet in business, trade, and commerce would be strongly impacted by whether one already had an appreciation for Islamic cultural values, generally, and for trade, specifi cally. Th e concept of a certain line of trade as a way of life, binding together families and communities over the course of generations, is something that few Americans have encountered. Yet this is the essence of commerce in the Middle East.Th e dialogues then pursued the question: “What role does your faith play in how you conduct your business aff airs?”monetized versus spiritualized worldviewsTh ese dialogues with Hizmet members created formal opportunities for informal discussions where teachers and scholars could become learners—asking questions that otherwise might seem intrusive, and allowing more revealing responses than would otherwise be considered polite. Aft erward, some conference participants described the dialogues as “moving,” “illumi-nating,” and “one of the most powerful experiences” in their memory. For most, if not all, the dialogues were a surprising, refreshing, oft en unsettling encounter with “the Other.”Included among the dialogue participants were self-described atheists, agnostics, lapsed and practicing Catholics, secular and observant Jews, devout and disaff ected Protestants, some Zen practitioners, and many who would describe themselves as “spiritual” but not “religious.” Small groups of three to fi ve, accompanied by a Turkish translator from IID, traveled to an"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"154 • Phyllis E. BernardIstanbul business where they met members of Hizmet local circles. (Most businessmen actually understood English but felt more comfortable having a translator available.) Approximately 50 percent of IID members are profes-sionals and businessmen, many of whom completed education in the United States.To comprehend the complex layers involved in a discussion of morals, culture, and business, let us focus on the quintessential business deal: testing idealism in action.In analyzing feedback from conference participants, who were very knowledgeable and sophisticated but highly westernized professionals, I concluded that much wariness concerning the Hizmet approach derives from fundamental—and perhaps irreconcilable—diff erences in worldviews. Th e dominant Western view sees the world as wholly monetized. Everything has a price. Everything can be negotiated. Th e point of a business negotia-tion is to fi nd what price a person will pay or accept. Period. Th is model does not include room for the ineff able.When something is not already overtly a commodity—to be bought, sold, or traded—then standard commercial negotiation training teaches business people how to make it so. Intangibles such as sentiment, loyalty, identity, and values matter only insofar as they can be manipulated to achieve the one goal that matters: the best price.Th e model of negotiation I have promoted in the Rethinking Negotiation series seeks to retire the commodity orientation.15 Th e U.S. military has determined that this kind of orientation is essential to navigate the human geography of the Middle East. But, even if not dealing specifi cally with busi-nessmen committed to the Hizmet movement, not everything is negotiable. Not everything has a price. Sometimes a businessperson’s values—including reputation and religion—matter more than any price. Th e standard, mone-tized orientation to business deals teaches people how to negotiate (that is, how to lead people to compromise) personal values. Th is assumes that such values have only illusory or manipulative signifi cance—if they are paid attention to at all.A shift in orientation would recognize that such values actually shape the business landscape. Cultural and religious values make meaning for interna-tional trading partners, whether the unstated implications of that meaning are fully appreciated or not, and whether they involve the Hizmet move-ment or not."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Hizmet in Business, Trade, and Commerce • 155hospitality as business custom and sacred obligationOne of the most important lessons learned in the course of the dialogues was that Westerners seeking to understand the Hizmet movement in busi-ness must fi rst understand Islamic cultural values as they shape the content and conduct of business dealings. It was necessary to understand that the business deal is the relationship between people, not the piece of paper on which a contract is written; that business is done among people whom you can call friend; that friendship carries with it a set of commitments much more profound than in America or Western Europe; and, fi nally, that the method of developing relationships in business revolves around the ritual of serving and drinking tea.Much of the learning was contextual. Each group learned by experience the bedrock of Islamic business customs: hospitality. In Turkey, as throughout the Middle East, hospitality means far more than mere courtesy. It is an expres-sion of sacred obligations dating to times that some believe even pre-dated Islam. Under Islam, however, these bonds and rituals gained enriched value. Hence, the “courtesies” of sharing tea are not merely secular but also sacred.Embodied in the rituals of hospitality are fundamental principles seri-ously at odds with the monetized worldview of business dealings. Instead, Islamic business arrangements are formed through three key traditions: tempo, tea, and trust.Th e tempo of negotiations is far slower than is usual in America and much of Western Europe. Th e pace allows time for parties to understand each other, their stated and unstated interests. Th e slower tempo allows time to consult with and consider the needs of others whose interests are aff ected by the transaction, which is part of the Hizmet obligation of stewardship.Sharing tea is an icon of business transactions in Islamic cultures. Whether initiating a sale of products or services to a customer, or initiating a supplier-purchaser, manufacturing, or trade agreement, traditions dating from days of the Silk Road dictate that all business discussions begin with a pot of tea. It might be mint, apple, or black tea, or coff ee, accompanied by juices and sweets. Regardless, the guest has a reciprocal obligation to accept graciously the proff ered hospitality.Th is social ritual serves a strategic purpose. Parties use this opportunity to gauge the level of trust essential to create a business deal that is self-enforcing,"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"156 • Phyllis E. Bernardeffi cient, ethical, and hence profi table. In Islamic cultures, friendship—not a paper contract—binds parties in a commercial transaction. Classically, the sharing of tea can describe degrees of friendship, which also describes the qualities of relationship essential for business success: What is their depth of knowledge about each other’s character? What obligations would they undertake on behalf of each other? How much trust is there?Trust strong enough to support a sustainable commercial venture can neither be rushed nor compressed to fi t an artifi cially limited (Western) timeframe. Timing must be relatively leisurely, a pace and measurement described proverbially according to the cups (or pots) of tea consumed dur-ing conversation that reveal character, worldview, and capacity—not capital budgets.16One cup of tea represents the mere threshold of politeness owed any stranger or customer. Over the second cup (or pot) of tea, business persons explore the contours of compatibility, not only regarding each other directly but also regarding extended families and communities expected to vouch for credibility and completion of obligations. Th e third cup (or pot) of tea marks the threshold of a true friendship, one strong enough to merit action in reliance on the other’s word alone; no written contract required.17Standard guides to international business practices and travel books rou-tinely describe tea hospitality in Islamic culture as matters of cross-cultural etiquette. But the roots run deeper than secularism alone. Arising from sacred obligations established in Islam and Buddhism, these practices on the ancient Silk Road developed a reliable merchant network extending across ethnic and religious lines, as does the Hizmet movement today.Trust is the essential ingredient. Without trust, no business will be con-ducted. Th e higher one’s earned reputation for being reliable and trustwor-thy, the greater value the person’s name can carry. Business transactions everywhere require some degree of trust to be self-enforcing. In Islamic cul-ture, the duty to perform extends beyond the individual to that person’s extended family. Do the Hizmet circles increase the pressure and the guar-antee of reliability? An outsider can only speculate.Notwithstanding, the custom is not limited to the Middle East or to the Hizmet movement. Some Westerners still operate or remember operating on similar principles. For example, among “old school” New York City busi-nessmen, there is a quiet but fi rm recognition that “pride, reputation and good will” are important in negotiations and “although . . . intangible . . . are absolutely real.”18"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Hizmet in Business, Trade, and Commerce • 157the three t’s in actionOur IID host, Hossein Gü zell, operates the family business Gü zella, Inc., an international high fashion design and textile business. He taught his visitors by “total immersion”—demonstrating the “three T’s” in action. We observed many teaching moments, which he graciously explained. But one key resource was not displayed in a manner that facilitated easy access: it was a framed poster situated across from his desk, out of the line of sight for visi-tors, yet directly in his view. Translated from the Turkish, “I Say to Myself (Th e Way of Life)” articulated principles of servant leadership that many business people might recognize, including those from humanist Western or observant Christian or Jewish backgrounds.Gü zella as a business presents a fractal pattern that demonstrates the essence of the Hizmet model in action.Te m p oTwo seemingly contrasting concepts demand equal respect: industriousness and neighborliness. Th e poster across from Güzell’s desk reminded us: “Be punctual, straightforward and just”; “Work hard, persevere, and look at the lives of those who are successful”; “Don’t waste your time. God doesn’t like those who kill time.” Th is would suggest support for a tempo and profi t-driven focus similar to the fast pace and goals of Western commerce.However, much more emphasis is placed on how to prioritize one’s time, which also sets the pace to conduct work. Th e overarching guideline is to remember: “Th e things that you do today should serve today and tomorrow. Th e things that you do in this world should serve this world and the hereaf-ter.” In today’s world, one must take the time to serve others. It is seen not only as a duty but also as a source of happiness. “Live for the other more than yourself; happiness is a perfume that makes you more aromatic if you shower it on the ones around you.”Th ese concepts are synthesized in the Turkish understanding of neigh-borliness, where persons are expected never to be in such a rush that they cannot take time to show caring and compassion for others no matter how “thin” the relationship may be. Virtually everyone acts in relationship to/with others.

Bernardand engage in conversation as a sign of respect and membership in the community.Te aIn a Western world that admires multitasking, where Tweets and text mes-sages oft en constitute conversation among family members and intimate friends, the concept of taking time to give one human being undivided, face-to-face attention becomes less and less familiar. Yet this is what the ritual of tea as part of business negotiations achieves. On the surface level, the lengthy process of drinking tea together carves out time and space for people to engage in mindful conversation. In this process, people can begin to build relationships.On a deeper level, the ritual of tea is a modern iteration of an ancient tradi-tion, born from nomadic cultures where life depended on mutual assistance, later reinforced and given a spiritual dimension by Islam. Conference partici-pants who visited a Turkish business host were lavished not only with tea, coff ee, soft drinks, and pastries but also with full meals and gift s. Th is phe-nomenon is common throughout the Middle East. Oft en Westerners either take the hospitality for granted or react skeptically, questioning whether it is merely a gimmick to lay the foundation for getting the best price.Rather, Turkish generosity springs both from sincerity and from the desire to be virtuous in the eyes of God. Hospitality is open-ended, not tied to a commercial result. Th is may be diffi cult for some Westerners to accept unless they know the deep roots of the modern practice. Turkish oral tradi-tions describe the underlying principle, which pre-dates Islam: “If a stranger knocks at the door, s/he should be invited inside, given ample food and shel-ter for three days; and only at the end of three days should the cause of the visit be asked.” A guest who arrives unexpectedly should be considered “a guest from God.” Th e tradition has a touch of pragmatism, however. Aft er three days a guest becomes family and is expected to help with chores.More frequent than the tradition of household hospitality that confers family status upon guests is the third cup of tea, which similarly marks the crossing of a threshold. With the third cup of tea, the relationship amd the trust have built to a point of mutual obligations that extend beyond merely completing the terms of a commercial contract. Th ey mark bonds of unques-tioned loyalty and integrity—levels of performance that few Western busi-nesses contemplate in an ostensibly straightforward business deal."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Hizmet in Business, Trade, and Commerce • 159How much should one rely on these constraints, especially in regions famous not only for hospitality but also for treachery? In a follow-up visit to Turkey on a trip hosted by the IID in 2010, I addressed this issue directly with businessmen who were part of the Hizmet movement but engaged in commerce in the legendarily corrupt areas of construction and mining in Central Asia and Russia. Th eir answers blended idealism and pragmatism. I venture to summarize:You cannot do business with thieves, period. Even if a deal sounds enticing initially, over time the problems that inevitably arise will outweigh any benefi ts.Th erefore, you need to be ready to not do business at all in some areas. So be it. Short-term profi ts are not worth long-term regrets.When dealing with persons who are merely “slippery” but not treacherous, do not take a step without good legal counsel.19Th e theme can best be summed up in the popular Islamic proverb: “Trust God, but tie your camel.”Tr u s tTrust in business deals in Turkish culture goes well beyond soft sentiment. Among other reasons, integrity is vital because transactions are traditionally handled based on a person’s word, their reputation. Cash is the preferred method for doing business. Th ousands, even millions of dollars will transfer from person to person across vast distances based solely on a verbal request. How? Why? Because the sender knows that the receiver—and the receiver’s family—will fulfi ll the obligation no matter what. It is diffi cult to imagine a Western business with the same expectations about commitments.Trust serves as a guiding principle not only outside but also inside the company. Th e Gü zella human resources model puts into action a consulta-tive, shared notion of power in the workplace. It sounds nearly “New Age” or classic Quaker but actually stems from a commitment to Islamic concepts of leadership. A leader, including an offi cer of a for-profi t business, must ful-fi ll a sacred duty of trust whereby all decisions are made with an eye toward protecting the best interests of the entire organization, as a community.

Th ere is no doubt that this movement is rooted in “the sacred,” rich as it is in devotion to scriptures, devotions, and ethical discourse. Th ere is also no doubt that its environment in Turkey has provided one of the best case studies of “the secular,” which in this case has meant a studied and severe attempt to rule out any devotion to “the sacred.” Ihsan Yilmaz, professor of Political Science at Faith University Istanbul, brings a scholarly perspective that promotes fairness and on-the-scene experience, and he helps to ensure an informed representation of Hizmet’s reli-gious implications.

Th e Rousseauian understanding of civil “religion” was an instrument that would be used to ensure allegiance to the state through a sort of “secular” faith. Émile Durkheim also wrote about civil religion, but his was a bottom-up civil religion unlike the Rousseauian top-down construct. Robert Bellah’s understanding of religion is similar to Durkheim’s in the sense that it has a bottom-up focus but it is much more “religious”;7 he has underscored that America was exceptional in melding religion and nationhood. In the Turkish case, the Kemalists combined Rousseauian and Durkheimian approaches. On the one hand, the Turkish state wanted to use the already existing religion as a helping hand with a Durkheimian mentality;8 on the other hand, with a Rousseauian approach, it tried to create a top-down new version of civil religion that I call “Lausannian Islam.” By using this term, I want not only to emphasize the fact that the Kemalists tried to create an offi cial version of Turkish Islam within the borders of Turkey as defi ned by the Lausanne Treaty in 1923 but also to imply that, by deferring to the spirit of the Lausanne Treaty, this Turkish version of Islam jettisoned Islam’s tran-snational and inter-religious dimensions.9 For instance, Lausannian Islam did not care about inter-religious dialogue until Fethullah Gülen and the Hizmet movement took the initiative in this area.10 To subordinate religion to the political establishment, the Kemalist state endeavored to manufac-ture a state version of Turkish Islam, in which there is already no confl ict"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"164 • Ihsan Yilmazbetween the religion and Turkish modernity that covers the modern nation-state, secularism, and democracy.11 All imams and preachers are employed by the state’s Directorate of Religious Aff airs, and, other than these civil servants, private imams, preachers, sermons, religious education, and tutor-ing are not allowed. All texts of the Friday sermons are written in the direc-torate headquarters in Ankara and have to be read verbatim throughout Turkey by more than 80,000 imams and preachers who are state employees. Th e directorate is so precious for the Kemalist establishment that even today, according to the Political Parties Law, political parties are not allowed to off er any change in the directorate’s constitutional status. Asking for any modifi cation is legal grounds for a closure case. Th is is understandable, given that its role, as defi ned by the Kemalists, “has been to control and to shape Islam in accordance with the needs of the secular nation-state to the eff ect of creating a secular, modern, national, offi cial Lausannian-Islam.”12 Kemalist hegemony tried to create a normalcy centered on the Lausannian-Islam or a Bourdieuian secular/nationalist/religious doxa by using the directorate in addition to several other Gramscian apparatuses such as the organic intellectuals, media, and schools. All other public Muslim religious mani-festations that did not conform to Lausannian Islam were demonized, vilifi ed, and even criminalized. During the AKP period, this has not changed much, and further research is needed to analyze the recent “Islamist” developments.Lausannian Islam envisages a Muslim type that adores the state and is secularist, Turkish nationalist, and Atatürkist. A good Lausannian Muslim is one who does not have any transnational cultural aspirations and who accepts that the state, not the ulema or the Sufi s, knows best about religion. A Lausannian Muslim practices his religion either privately at home or in a mosque but not in the public sphere, and he does not base his arguments or demands on religion.13Th e Kemalists’ ideal citizen is encapsulated by the acronym LAST, which is similar to WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant). LAST stands for Laicist, Atatürkist, Sunni, Turk. Laicist does not mean a secular-minded person; rather, it refers to a person who is aggressively secularist and is not pleased with public manifestations of Islam even though he does not care much about other religions’ public visibility. Atatürkism is a soft er version of Kemalism, and, as long as one loves Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, deeply respects him, and does not think he made mistakes, one is considered an Atatürkist.14 To be a fi rst-class citizen, one needs to be a nonpracticing Sunni Muslim"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The Sacred and the Secular in the Hizmet World • 165who belongs without practicing15 and an ethnic and nationalist Turk. All others outside of these parameters are not fully trusted by the Kemalists and their state. Non-Muslims, practicing Muslims, non-Atatürkists such as left -ists and liberals, Alevis, and Kurds have always been discriminated against by the Kemalist state whenever these identities become manifest in the pub-lic sphere.Th e state has worked hard to socially engineer these perfect citizens or “LASTmen,” and the directorate has been given an important role in this Rousseau-Durkheimian project.16 As a matter of fact, recent research by Nezir Akyeşilmen has shown that the directorate’s Friday sermons focus on concepts such as “country, nation, national and Turk.”17 In 150 Friday ser-mons between 2003 and 2005, the directorate chose “the love of God” only 5 times as the main topic, whereas “the love of the country” was chosen 6 times. Th e words “country, nation, national and Turk” were used 263 times, but “human rights, equality, freedom and Islamic brotherhood” were men-tioned only 29 times.18 Th e word “war” was used 135 times in a positive sense, such as “one must sacrifi ce one’s life for some noble values and national honor”; it was negatively referred to only 9 times.19Being children of “Kemalistan,” Turkish Islamists also shared the Kemalist (Rousseauian) idea of top-down social engineering and a Jacobinist state-centric view of religion. Th ey envisaged a top-down religio-cultural transformation aft er coming to power by democratic means.20In contrast to the Kemalist and Islamist attitudes toward religion/state relations, Gülen’s ultimate concern in this life focuses on the hereaft er, spir-ituality, and worship.21 He strongly arg ues that Islam is more than a political ideology: “When those who have adopted Islam as a political ideology rather than a religion in its true sense and function, review their activities and atti-tudes they claim to be based on Islam, especially political ones, will discover that they are usually moved by personal or national anger, hostility, and other similar motives.”22 He understands the problems and challenges fac-ing Muslims in the contemporary age, and he deals “with them but he does not believe that politics is the most eff ective way to do so in the twenty-fi rst century.”23 Gülen’s ummah “is a transnational socio-cultural entity, not a Utopian politico-legal one.”24 He “does not see the world in political terms and does not draw imaginary boundaries.”25 Gülen “eschews politics in the belief that it leads to social divisiveness and distraction from the essential issues of values and principle. In fact, the movement opposes the creation of political parties founded on religion in general, believing that they end up"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"166 • Ihsan Yilmazcompromising or contaminating religion and that they only serve to create social strife damaging to the position of religion in society.”26He advocates working “in the interests of domestic social transformation by striving to outperform rivals in the market, rather than to overcome them in political confrontation.”27 Th us, he opposes the ideology of Islamism:Th is vision of Islam as a totalizing ideology is totally against the spirit of Islam, which promotes the rule of law and openly rejects oppression against any segment of society. Th is spirit also promotes actions for the betterment of society in accordance with the view of the majority. Th ose who follow a more moderate pattern a lso believe that it would be much better to introduce Islam as a complement to democracy instead of presenting it as an ideology. Such an introduction of Islam may play an important role in the Muslim world through enriching local forms of democracy and extending it in such a way that helps humans develop and understanding of the relationship between the spiritual and material worlds. I believe that Islam also would enrich democracy in answering the deep needs of humans, such as spiritual satisfaction, which cannot be fulfi lled except through the remembrance of the Eternal One.28Gülen has repeatedly stated that there is no particular model for either the method of election or the system of administration. He explains, “[I]n Islam it is not possible to limit the concept of governance and politics into a single paradigm, unlike the principles of faith and the pillars of Islam.”29Gülen underscores that the Qur’an is not a political book or project:Th e Qur’an is a translation of the book of the universe. . . . It is an explana-tion of the refl ections of the divine names on earth and in the heavens. It is a prescription for the various problems of the Islamic world. It is a guide for bliss in this life and in the life to come. It is a great guide for the travelers in this world moving towards the hereaft er. It is an inexhaustible source of wisdom. Such a book should not be reduced to the level of political discourse, nor should it be considered a book about political theories or forms of state.30He emphasizes that “Islam does not propose a certain unchangeable form of government or attempt to shape it. Instead, Islam establishes fundamen-tal principles that orient a government’s general character, leaving it to the people to choose the type and form of government according to time and circumstances.”31 According to Gülen, fundamental Islamic political princi-ples are a social contract and election of a group of people to debate common issues.32 He puts it that, “[i]n Islam, ruling means a mutual contract between"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The Sacred and the Secular in the Hizmet World • 167the ruler and the subject and it takes its legitimacy from the rule of law, and from the principle of the superiority of the law.”33 He is of the fi rm opinion that “it is impossible to prove in any way that Islam opposes democracy.”34Some have argued that the Hizmet movement is also a political move-ment. Yet this depends on what one means by “politics.” On this, I agree with Graham Fuller:Th ere is no doubt that the movement quite explicitly aspires to transform society through transformation of the individual, a process that could ulti-mately lead to collective calls for the creation of national and social institu-tions that refl ect belief in a moral order. In a very loose sense, it is possible to call this a political project if we consider any attempt to transform society to be a political project. But I would argue that it is just as much a social and moral project. Indeed, the term “political” loses its meaning if applied equally to all eff orts to transform society, regardless of means. Promotion of change through teachings, education, and information does not really become political until it formally and institutionally enters the political process.35It must be added that, even though the Hizmet movement is not engaged in daily politics but works in the realm of civil society, it has concerns, of course, that need to be addressed in the political sphere. For instance, for the sake of more freedoms, the movement has been lobbying for the European Union accession project of Turkey and for a new democratic constitution. Moreover, unlike the Islamists, Hizmet never legitimizes politics in the name of Islam. Even though Gülen has been discouraging his followers from entering politics, in the fi nal analysis, in this movement of volunteers, indi-viduals have the freedom to enter daily politics in their individual capacity, not as representatives of Hizmet or Islam. If they enter politics, they will be expected to jettison any representative role they might have within Hizmet.gülen on rights, freedom of religion, and secularismWhile explaining the Islamic theological reasons why people are responsible for their own fate, Gülen also talks about free will and freedoms:Islam considers a society to be composed of conscious individuals equipped with free will and having responsibility toward both themselves and oth-ers. . . . Th e Koran (13:11) says: “God will not change the state of a people"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"168 • Ihsan Yilmazunless they change themselves [with respect to their beliefs, worldview, and lifestyle].” In other words, each society holds the reins of its fate in its own hands. Th e prophetic tradition emphasizes this idea: “You will be ruled according to how you are.” Th is is the basic character and spirit of democracy, which does not confl ict with any Islamic principle. As Islam holds individu-als and societies responsible for their own fate, people must be responsible for governing themselves.36Gülen is an advocate of Shatibi’s Maqasid al Shari’a (Major Objectives of Islamic Law): “[R]eligion, life, reproduction, the mind, and property are basic essentials that everyone must protect. In a sense, Islam approaches human rights from the angle of these basic principles.”37 He emphasizes that:Islam upholds the following fundamental principles: 1. Power lies in truth, a repudiation of the common idea that truth relies upon power. 2. Justice and the rule of law are essential. 3. Freedom of belief and rights to life, personal property, reproduction, and health (both mental and physical) cannot be violated. 4. Th e privacy and immunity of individual life must be maintained. 5. No one can be convicted of a crime without evidence, or accused and pun-ished for someone else’s crime. 6. An advisory system of administration is essential.38Gülen is a staunch advocate of human rights, political participation, pro-tection of minority rights, and the participation of individuals and society in decision-making institutions:Everybody should be allowed to express themselves with the condition that no pressure should be made on others through variety of means. Also, mem-bers of minority communities should be allowed to live according to their beliefs. If these sorts of legislations are made within the norms of interna-tional law and international agreements, Islam will have no objection to any of these.39On secular law-making, Gülen makes it clear that “[i]n Islam, the legisla-tive and executive institutions have always been allowed to make laws. Th ese are based on the needs and betterment of society and within the frame of general norms of law. On domestic issues in the Islamic community and its relationship with other nations, including economic, political and cultural relations, Muslims have always developed laws.” 40He claims that, in a real secular system, everybody can and should be able to freely express and live his or her religious sentiments and ideas.41 In"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"The Sacred and the Secular in the Hizmet World • 169Gülen’s thinking, “[R]eligion is not reduced to a private or personal aff air, but can have a collective character and can freely intervene in society. Believers can publicly express their faith, organize, and develop diverse activities.” 42 Th is conforms to the Habermasian understanding of religion in the public sphere. Gülen asserts that, if secularity could function as it is in the West, nobody would reject it.43 He does not see any contradiction between Islamic ideals and a democratic republic, as it is a system that can protect freedoms, human rights, and dignity: “A true republic is a form of rule by elevated spirits and is the most suitable for humanity’s honor. . . . Th e republic can be the mother or governess of freedom, for it nurtures and raises generations in love with freedom. . . . As our spirit, which has an innate desire for freedom, rejects all forms of domination, it reacts to any limits to be placed on its freedom of thought, behavior, and expression.” 44He underscores that Islam “recognizes right, not force, as the foundation of social life.” 45 In his view, Islamic principles of equality, tolerance, and jus-tice can help democracy to reach its peak of perfection and bring even more happiness to humanity.46 With regard to religious freedom, he is unequivo-cal: “As for those who don’t believe in Islam, leave them to their own under-standing and lifestyle, for Islam’s commands are obligatory only for Muslims. If there is anxiety that people will be forced to do this when Islamic princi-ples are carried over into public life, it should be understood that such a forceful act is not Islamic.” 47Gülen does not oppose the idea of mutual autonomy of state and Islam.48 He argues that, “[i]f a state . . . gives the opportunity to its citizens to prac-tice their religion and supports them in their thinking, learning, and prac-tice, this system is not considered to be against the teaching of the Qur’an. In the presence of such a state there is no need to seek an alternative state.” 49 He “advocates a total separation between the religious and political in con-temporary Muslim societies. He thinks that the domination of the state over religious aff airs has greatly harmed the cause of Islam in the present time and thus advocates the freedom of the religious realm from political authority.” 50 In Gülen’s thinking, one can also fi nd traces of what Alfred Stepan calls “twin tolerations.” 51 First of all, Gülen makes clear that “Islam has nothing to do with theocracy.” 52 He continues that, if human rights including freedom of religion are respected by the state, then there is no need for an “Islamic” state. He has made it clear that “one can practice authentic Islam without needing to live in an Islamic political system.” 53 In his view, “If a state . . . gives the opportunity to its citizens to practice their"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"170 • Ihsan Yilmazreligion and supports them in their thinking, learning, and practice, this system is not considered to be against the teaching of the Qur’an. In the presence of such a state there is no need to seek an alternative state.”54 With regard to religious demands in the public sphere, he advises self-sacrifi ce: “If the religious people are thinking of living peacefully in this country, they should not contribute to the expansion of the confl ict by challenging the fragile issues. Peace in a society can be achieved by mutual self-sacrifi ce. It seems better to leave some issues to the interpretation of time.”55 It is obvi-ous that, in such an understanding, there is room for Stepan’s toleration: religious authorities must “tolerate” the autonomy of democratic parlia-ments without claiming any constitutionally privileged prerogatives to man-date or veto legislation and public policy.56 Without labeling it as such, Gülen seems to talk about twin tolerations in a speech that he made many years ago: “If secularity is understood as the state not being founded on reli-gion, hence it does not interfere with religion or religious life; and as the faithful living his religion does not disturb others; and furthermore if the state will accomplish this task in a serious neutrality, then there is no problem.” 57conclusionUntil the sudden eruption of religion into the public sphere in many parts of the world in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a relatively widespread consensus had existed in the sociology of religion discipline over the privatization the-sis.58 Since then, it has been realized “that diff erentiation did not necessarily mean that religion would remain in its assigned place in the private sphere and not enter the public arena.” 59 Some scholars, such as José Casanova, have argued that during the course of the past few decades a process of “dep-rivatization” of religion has taken place in the world, and even though a his-torical process of religious diff erentiation has occurred in the West, institu-tional diff erentiation does not necessarily result in the marginalization and privatization of religion.60Casanova divides the modern democratic polity into three—state, politi-cal society, and civil society—and he argues that in principle there can be public religions on all three levels.61 But, in his view, only public religions at the civil society level are compatible with the modern principle of citizen-ship. By contrast, in his elaboration on John Rawls’s political theory, in par-"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The Sacred and the Secular in the Hizmet World • 171ticular concepts of the “public use of reason” and “translation provisio,” Jürgen Habermas has objected to this restrictive idea of the political role of religion and argued that, other than the state level, public visibility of reli-gions could be allowed at civil society and political society levels.62Rawls argues that “reasonable comprehensive doctrines, religious or non-religious, may be introduced in public political discussion at any time, pro-vided that in due course proper political reasons—and not reasons given solely by comprehensive doctrines—are presented that are suffi cient to sup-port whatever the comprehensive doctrines are said to support.” 63 In response, Habermas emphasizes that “religious communities and movements provide arguments for public debates on crucial morally-loaded issues and handle tasks of political socialization by informing their members and encouraging them to take part in the political process.” 64 However, each time they have to “fi nd an equivalent in a universally accessible language for every religious statement they pronounce” as part of the duty of civility.65 Th is epistemic burden results in a sort of self-censorship. It is obvious that “many religious citizens would not be able to undertake such an artifi cial division within their own minds without jeopardizing their existence as pious persons.” 66 Habermas concludes that “the liberal state, which expressly protects such forms of life in terms of a basic right, cannot at the same time expect of all citizens that they also justify their political statements independently of their religious convictions or world views. Th is strict demand can only be laid at the door of politicians, who within state institutions are subject to the obliga-tion to remain neutral in the face of competing world views.” 67 Citizens must agree “that only secular reasons count beyond the institutional threshold that divides the informal public sphere from parliaments, courts, ministries and administrations.” 68 Religious citizens, too, can agree to this “institutional translation provisio” without splitting their identity into a public and a pri-vate part when they participate in public debates and discourses. Th us, they should “be allowed to express and justify their convictions in a religious lan-guage if they cannot fi nd secular ‘translations’ for them.” 69A convergence between Gülen’s idea that passive secularism is compatible with Islam and a Habermasian understanding of religion in the public sphere can be observed. Th is convergence could even amount to an overlap-ping consensus, to use Rawls’s concept. Here, a secularist (Habermas) agrees with an Islamic scholar (Gülen) that religion could be practiced in the pub-lic realm, that religious demands could be made in the public sphere, and that the state is equidistant to all religions."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"172 • Ihsan YilmazGülen’s conception of Islam-friendly democracy is key to understanding his approach to sacred and secular relations. He does not see a contradiction between Islam and democracy, and he reasons that Islam establishes funda-mental principles that orient a government’s general character, leaving it to the people to choose the type and form of government according to time and circumstances. With regard to state/society/religion issues, he has argued, unlike the Islamists, that passive Anglo-Saxon secularism which guarantees human rights and freedoms, including freedom of religion, could provide a wider framework for Muslims to practice their religion comfortably where other religious minorities also benefi t from human rights. In his view, the faithf ul can comfortably live in secular environments if secularism is relig ion-friendly and understood as the state not being founded on religion. Hence, it does not interfere with religion or religious life, and the state is equidistant to all religions in a neutral manner. It can be argued that Gülen’s approach to sacred/secular relations is similar to the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ”) since he has highlighted that Islam does not need a state to survive and that civil society or the civilian realm in liberal-democratic settings is suffi cient for its individual and social practice. Th is understanding of “Islamic secularism” or “twin tolerations” resonates with Habermas’s “religion in the public sphere,”70 which argues that the faithful can have demands based on religion in the public sphere and that, in the fi nal analysis, it is the legislators’ epistemic task to translate these demands into a secular language and enact them accordingly.notes1.

It is a faith-based movement, although scrupulous in presenting itself as having no religious agenda at all, being strictly a humanitarian enterprise.Religious-based movements seldom display themselves as proponents of democracy, tolerance, inclusion, and dialogue. Many religious groups his-torically have oppressed, even killed others in the name of their “truth.” Th is is not to say, however, that religion is always the motivating factor in the strife and confl ict perpetrated in its name. Quite oft en, it is a convenient tool manipulated by political and economic forces to accomplish their goals.Hizmet is diff erent. Associated with religious scholar Fethullah Gülen, it is a leading moderate Islamic reform movement in Turkey. It is a distinctly Western-oriented, contemporary blend of mysticism and hospitality, drawn elevenPolitical Implications of the Hizmet MovementJames C. HarringtonAlthough Fethullah Gülen concentrated on the religious and philosophical theories that have became central to the Hizmet movement, he also—by design and inevitably—was drawn into the world of practical politics. He has characteristically kept some distance from formal political parties and expressions, but his involvement in civic culture has oft en led him to be critical of existing political structures and those who administer them in Turkey. Similarly, he necessarily had to involve himself with attempts to bring elements in the politi-cal order into line with humane concerns. Such endeavors drew strong opposition among the political leaders who ruled Turkey—and among those who rule it today. James Harrington, former adjunct professor of Law at the University of Texas, deals in this chap-ter with the emerging political spheres where Gülen, as reformer, was suspect and where, as visionary, he has attracted followings that help him project a more open political scene than that favored by those in authority."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Political Implications of the Hizmet Movement • 177from the country’s deep Sufi tradition that promotes education, science, modernization, and technology for their benefi ts to society.Although business entrepreneurs, middle-class people, and students shape the Hizmet nucleus, it attracts a larger group of adherents within Turkey and has a grassroots following. Gülen promotes a cosmopolitan, multinational, and multicultural Turkish identity that appeals to his com-patriots, and his non-nationalist views and steadfast stand against terrorism resonate with moderate Turks, who reject Islamic extremism.Th e Hizmet movement also has attracted non-Muslim followers. Th ere is no accurate account of how many people are active in Hizmet to some deg ree or other, but it clearly has considerable supporters worldwide. Th ere is little question that Hizmet has greatly aff ected Turkey’s politics and has helped build civil society in a country once dominated by military and autocratic regimes.Th is chapter focuses on the cultural, intellectual, and institutional projects promoted through Hizmet. It also looks at the movement’s part in bringing greater democracy to Turkey and its interactive role in Turkey’s eff orts to join the European Union. Th at long (and still incomplete) acces-sion process culminated in the constitutional referendum in 2010 that over-whelmingly adopted civil liberty protections, improved the judicial system, expanded economic and social rights, and created legal accountability for previous coup d’état leaders.Th is overview covers Turkey’s recent history, how and why Hizmet has become a force in civil society, and Hizmet’s interaction with current politi-cal realities, including how Turkey’s former prime minister and current president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has become a foe of civil liberties and of Hizmet.turkey’s historical contextA quick historical synopsis of modern Turkey is critical to understanding the political and social importance of Hizmet and its projects for helping democratize that nation. Kemal Atatürk founded the Republic of Turkey in 1923 and served as president until his death in 1938. He had emerged as a brilliant Turkish military commander and nationalist rebel leader, and he led the armed struggle to liberate Turkey from the Allies’ occupation aft er defeating the Ottoman regime in World War I."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"178 • James C. HarringtonAtatürk initiated an ambitious array of political, economic, and cultural reforms. An admirer of the Enlightenment, he sought to transform the country into a modern, democratic, and secularist nation-state. Th e princi-ples of his reforms fall under the rubric of “Kemalism,” the “six pillars” or “six arrows” of which are republicanism, populism, nationalism, secularism,1 statism, and revolutionism.Atatürk’s presidency is a stunning saga of modernization, matched in few other nations. With indefatigable energy and a sometimes heavy hand, he moved the country to a new political and legal system, made both govern-ment and education secularist, gave equal rights to women, replaced Arabic with the Latin alphabet for writing the Turkish language, Westernized per-sonal attire, and advanced the arts and sciences.Even though Atatürk admonished the armed forces not to meddle in politics, Turkey has had the historical misfortune of a series of military coups d’état since its fi rst democratic elections in 1950. Th ere have been three “hard” coups (1960, 1971, and 1980), in which the military seized direct control of the government, and a “soft ” or “post-modern” coup in 1997. Th ese coups severely thwarted the country’s path toward democracy and weakened the institutions of government and civil society.Th e 1960 overthrow was ruthless and bloody. Th e junta executed the country’s fi rst democratically elected prime minister, Adnan Menderes, two of his ministers, and thousands of others—and prominently published a photograph of Menderes on the gallows. Many more victims suff ered tor-ture and imprisonment. Menderes was very popular and had served two terms in offi ce, but the strongly secularist military fretted over his populism. Even though he was apparently a nonobservant Muslim, the military painted him as attempting to transform the country into a theocratic regime.Th e 1971 overthrow, known as the “coup by memorandum,” which the armed forces delivered in lieu of sending out tanks, came amid worsening domestic strife and violence. Th e military forced the government to resign, and it installed its own prime minister to form a new administration. Many people, especially intellectuals across the political spectrum, underwent investigation, prosecution in special martial law courts, torture, and impris-onment for their political views. Many others perished or languished in jail.Th e 1980 military regime came during a period of intense confl ict among student groups that fought each other for political reasons.

Th e coup was brutal, bloody, and broad. Th ousands were put to death or tortured. A constituent assembly draft ed a new constitution, which voters approved in November 1982 as the only way to move again toward democracy, however slowly. Martial law gradually lift ed, but eff ective military oversight continued.Th e 1997 unarmed coup overthrew a coalition government headed by the Islamist-leaning Welfare Party. It received the “post-modern coup” moniker because, diff erent from earlier coups, the military merely fl exed its muscle and directed the outcome. Th e military attempted to eliminate all reli-giously motivated movements deemed a threat to the secularist regime. It was a sophisticated, bloodless, and eff ective operation.Apart from meddling in politics, the armed forces over time developed their own economic prowess, evolving into a “mercantile military,” a mili-tary/industrial complex showcase. In particular, the Turkish Armed Forces Foundation became emblematic, receiving subsidies and tax exemptions from the government and increasing its economic strength.Two contemporary, protracted, and complex trials, “Ergenekon” and “Sledgehammer (Balyoz),” have been ongoing in Turkey, dealing with inter-active corruption among the military, banks, and corporate enterprises (including some media outlets), allied as the “Deep State.” Th e cases, which began in 2008 and 2010, respectively, have revealed continuing scenarios of wide-ranging political machinations and even a prospective coup. Some of the extensive allegations involve conspiracy activity against Gülen and Hizmet.Despite the interruption of the 1997 post-modern coup, Turkey had begun its transition from an authoritarian regime toward liberal democrati-zation under Turgut Özal, who served as prime minister of Turkey and then as president until he died under suspicious circumstances in 1993. Özal transformed Turkey’s moribund economy into a powerhouse by beginning privatization of many state enterprises and moving the country to an export-led drive toward free enterprise.the hizmet movement and gülenOther chapters in the present volume have detailed many aspects of the career of Gülen and of the Hizmet movement, but I believe it will be helpful in this political context briefl y to consider salient aspects of the movement"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"180 • James C. Harringtoninsofar as they bear on its underlying philosophy and impact on politics and civil society, both in Turkey and in the larger global community. Th ey also help explain why Hizmet has gained political traction in Turkey.Gülen is the movement’s spiritual “soul.” He is a prolifi c writer, widely read, self-educated, and respected as an intellectual. He has lived in the United States since March 1999, when he came seeking medical attention and eventually took up residence in a secluded rural retreat in Pennsylvania. However, his relocation has not diminished his infl uence.As we have seen in other chapters, the thought of Kurdish scholar Said Nursi (1877–1960) on accommodating Islam to modern life and harmoniz-ing science and religion greatly infl uenced Gülen, although he rejected Nursi’s intense nationalism. Nursi’s understanding of Islam, upon which Gülen built, combined Islamic values with advocacy of human rights, democ-racy, the rule of law, secularism with respect for religious rights for all, regard for cultural diversity, science, and ecumenical dialogue. Nursi himself suf-fered decades of arrest and imprisonment and harassment for his modern views.Sufi ideas also course through Gülen’s thinking. One belief—that God, humanity, and the natural world are all linked—has practical consequences, such as its stress on loving and respecting humanity and the natural world as one would God, regardless of people’s faith or lack thereof.Gülen has attempted to present a moderate Islam to Jews and Christians and, in turn, to present those other religions to Muslims. He was the fi rst Islamic leader to have formal discussions with the Alevis, Christians, and Jews in Turkey, and he weathered fi erce criticism from hard-line co-religion-ists for meeting with those outside their Islamic tradition.Science and technology are important to Gülen, and he views the under-developed condition of many Islamic countries to be a result of their neglect-ing contemporary scientifi c knowledge. He sees no confl ict between reason and revelation. For him, the Qur’an does not contain all that is necessary for scientifi c understanding, but each informs the other.Gülen’s personal charisma goes hand-in-hand with good organization by his followers and an appealing message that one can be at home in the mod-ern world and still embrace traditional values like faith in God and com-munity responsibility. He oft en notes that 95 percent of religion is about one’s personal life and that community advancement comes through progress in one’s spiritual life. Social leadership—that is, civil society—is more important than political leadership."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Political Implications of the Hizmet Movement • 181Gülen is credited with more than seventy books, along with tapes and videos of an estimated 4,000 talks and sermons (most privately recorded), and a science and spirituality magazine translated into various languages.2For others, not surprisingly, Gülen is a controversial fi gure. For radical Islamists, he is too “soft ” on Christians and Jews and not Muslim enough because he prizes a person’s moral life more highly than ritualistic prayer or fundamentalist constructs. For neo-nationalists, he is a threat to the repub-lic’s secularist nature, although Gülen insists there is no turning away from democracy in Turkey.Gülen’s social thinking supports democratization, civil liberty, and sepa-ration between secular and religious spheres. His social justice values, how-ever, do not play well with those in the deep-rooted, pro-authoritarian estab-lishment who resist the country’s expanding pluralism, encroachment on their brand of secularism, and mobilization of the middle class.As might be expected, Gülen had to undergo political prosecution, and he has experienced it twice. Th e second and most signifi cant trial, in absen-tia, lasted from 2000 to 2008 amid a blistering media campaign against him. He was acquitted, and won on appeal, thanks in part to changes in Turkey’s legal system, which the European Union helped bring about, as will be discussed below. Th e trial and appellate judges summarily rejected the myriad charges that had alleged he was undermining the republic.3An advocate of nonviolence, Gülen was the fi rst Islamic leader to publicly condemn the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States. He took out advertisements in the New York Times and Wa s h i n g t o n Po s t imme-diately aft er the event and gave interviews to major newspapers.Th ose who consider themselves inspired by Gülen refer to themselves as part of Hizmet, a volunteer civil society service movement. Th ey believe in educating youth, fostering interfaith and intercultural dialogue, earning money to assist the less well-off in society, contributing to global peace, and promoting humanitarian projects. Th e movement draws support from all walks of life: intellectuals, political leaders and government offi cials from every shade of the political spectrum, academicians, working people, business entrepreneurs, writers, professionals, and even members of the military.Hizmet followers tend to be from Turkey’s aspiring middle class in the Anatolia region. Gülen reassures his compatriots that they can merge the goals of Atatürk’s republic with traditional but fl exible Islamic faith. Financial success is a worthy endeavor, in his view, since it allows individuals"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"182 • James C. Harringtonto support good causes. Gülen appeals to well-off people to assist the poor, for the benefi t of all. Society, he argues, improves as people lead good lives and help others rather than just themselves. Th e movement springs from, and helps expand, the rising middle class, which has led to democratization and economic opportunity.For all their emphasis on individual integrity, Hizmet participants are taught and expected to be forbearing of others and nonjudgmental. Although personally religious, they see themselves not as making up a formal religious community but rather as fi rm subscribers to a democratic secular society that promotes traditional civil liberties, including freedom of religion. Gülen him-self famously commented that society needs more schools, not more mosques.Hizmet followers are not revolutionaries. Rather, they put energy into seeking greater equity in society. Education is one of their main tools, and they are at home with technology, markets, multinational business, and modern communication, which they adeptly use to “spread the word.”People in Hizmet, as indicated in Tom Gage’s chapter on education in this volume, have established numerous educational institutions, such as elementary and secondary schools and universities around the world, though many are in Turkey. For them, education and literacy are “levelers” in soci-ety, forming a way to bridge the rich/poor gap. Th ese endeavors, under way since the 1960s, hold themselves out as alternatives to the more dogmatic, sometimes radical, and educationally limited madrasah schools.Hizmet schools have been important in southern Turkey and the Kurdish region because of the shortage of educational facilities there, and they pro-vide opportunity for less fortunate youth. Many schools have dormitories for poorer students from outlying areas. In southeast Turkey, the schools off ered an alternative to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its violent activities. Th ey provide an opportunity for young women where traditional culture reinforces early marriage and child-bearing duties.Th ese schools are nonreligious and sponsored by entrepreneurs in Turkey and the Turkish diaspora in other countries. Th ey are expected eventurally to become self-suffi cient and to be supported by those whom they educate as they themselves graduate and enter business. Th e schools contribute to the movement’s credibility and popularity.Th e Hizmet aid organization Kimse Yok Mu (“Is Anyone Th ere?”),4 established with Gülen’s encouragement, has helped victims of natural calamities around the world. Hospitals set up by Hizmet doctors and busi-ness people bring medical services to underserved countries."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Political Implications of the Hizmet Movement • 183Gülen-inspired media institutions, such as the top-selling newspaper in Tu r k e y (Zaman), one of the most watched television channels (STV), and weekly magazines, try to set the example of being family-friendly and free of excessive violence, depictions of drug use, and obscenity. Zaman is widely respected for its breadth of coverage and promotion of civil society and democracy,5 and it is a major player in Hizmet.Th e self-supporting movement relies on volunteers, charitable donations, and fi nancial underwriting. It is a characteristic Islamic practice to tithe, based on income, to charitable organizations. Individuals in Hizmet tend to give from 7 to 15 percent or more, depending on ability, to Hizmet charities and projects.Because of the movement’s loose-knit “nonstructure,” precise statistics of its work and its fi nancial outlay do not exist, but estimates are consistently substantial. A comprehensive study by University of Houston sociologist Helen Rose Ebaugh indicates that 20,000 Gülen-supporting businesses and other endeavors may yield as much as $1 billion annually, with some indi-viduals contributing millions of dollars each.6Gülen supporters organize around the view that humans have the poten-tial to do better than refl ected by the current state of world aff airs. In sync with Sufi thought, Gülen posits greed, whether individual or collective, as the real foe of peace and harmony, not the diff erences in religion, ethnicity, or ideology. Greedy individuals and groups achieve their objectives by manipulating people’s fear, individually and socially. Ignorance and misin-formation fuel paranoia and personal and collective acts of aggression.Th us, for Hizmet, person-to-person communication is key to social toler-ance. Dialogue is not compromise, conversion, or integration. Rather, it is the coming together of people who are committed to their respective reli-gious paths (or who have no faith but are living a good life) to better know and communicate with one another and, in due course, work together. Th is dynamic helps strip away false prejudices, dissipates fear and antagonism, and lays a foundation for trust, peaceful coexistence, and cooperative undertakings.To advance these goals, Hizmet people promote conferences, symposia, seminars, luncheons and dinners, and grassroots activities. Besides dialogue for dialogue’s sake, these meetings can help shape policy and civil society. Th ey also organize and help underwrite hundreds of intercultural dialogue trips to Turkey for community leaders, political offi cials, and religious peo-ple around the world."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"184 • James C. HarringtonTh e most prominent dialogue eff ort inside Turkey is the Abant Platform, founded in 1994 and coordinated by the Journalists and Writers Foundation, which Gülen helped organize. Th e platform is a major discussion forum for scholars, writers, and leaders of all backgrounds who focus on recurring issues in Turkey, such as religion, government, ethnicity, Islam, secularism, democracy, and their interrelationship. Th e fi rst Abant Platform convoca-tion, in 1998, helped propel Gülen’s political trial.A movement with ambitions and practices like those of Hizmet, which would consider the review in this chapter to be idealistic, naturally attracts opponents. Th ey tend to articulate four general themes, with varying degrees of logical coherence and grounding in facts. First, Hizmet seeks to take over Turkey through its economic prowess and by infi ltrating the military and government and converting the country into a religious regime. Second, because the movement is atypical in not having formal organizational struc-tures, it lacks transparency and is therefore suspect. Th ird, Hizmet is cult-like and “brainwashes” people. And fourth, Gülen really represents some other, disguised, power. Th is last point shift s, according to the audience. Sometimes he is accused of being a CIA operative, a subversive of some for-eign county (usually Iran, China, or Saudi Arabia), or even a “secret cardi-nal” under the pope.7Th e lack of transparency theme garners most traction. Given that Turkish prosecutors have twice made attempts to shut down all Gülen-related enti-ties and seize their assets, as part of the political trials mentioned earlier, the wisest self-defense has seemed to be not to formalize an organizational structure. Th is kind of prosecution in Turkey has happened historically to organizations disfavored by the government in power. Th e lack of typical hierarchical organization is also a Sufi characteristic. Th e movement seems increasingly sensitive to the criticism and has begun to open its doors a bit, albeit slowly. Of course, there is more transparency in countries with disclo-sural regulations, like the United States.As to the “infi ltration” fear, what actually may be occurring sociologi-cally is that economic and social integration is increasing and that growing numbers of people, as they become educated, seek secure and better-paying employment in the police, military, and government.Given all that Gülen has spoken and written over many years promoting democracy and civil society, his foes have found little on which to rely when they make their accusations. Many of the charges expressed by his oppo-nents were systematically dismantled in the 2000–2008 trial."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Political Implications of the Hizmet Movement • 185the expansion of democracy and civil society in turkey and hizmetTo be sure, there are substantial problematic areas with which Turkey is wrestling, such as respecting the rights and self-identity of the Kurdish pop-ulation, decentralizing state administration, strengthening local govern-ment, and depoliticizing the judicial system. Th ere are other crucial issues, too, which are summarized below.Hizmet’s Relationship to the GovernmentGülen does not involve himself directly in partisan Turkish politics, although he does interject his message on diff erent issues in the name of civil society, which, of course, has political ramifi cations. He promotes address-ing issues through the democratic system but not aligning with a specifi c parliamentary party.Gülen has opposed political Islam, helping halt its rise in Turkey, arguing that religion is about private piety, not political ideology. He was a vocal critic of the Islamist Welfare Party, which, in the late 1990s, briefl y led a coalition government with the conservative True Path Party, until the “soft coup.” Even though Gülen has always supported the established order and the organs of state, many secularists do not trust him, and they see his fre-quent evidences of support for projects of the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) as proof that he is a Trojan horse for political Islam.Aft er an initial period of tension, Gülen and the AKP leaders, who took power in 2002, came closer in their approach to common issues, although they have diff erent social bases: AKP’s is the urban poor, Gülen’s the provin-cial middle class. Encouraged by Gülen, the AKP, with its conservative cul-tural background, had soft ened a tendency toward Qur’anic literalism and embraced the need for expanding human rights.Th e movement generally supported earlier AKP reforms, though not uncritically, and sometimes spearheaded reforms that the AKP adopted under Prime Minister Erdoğan. In recent years, however, as Erdoğan has begun to show a more marked authoritarian streak, the Hizmet movement has become more critical, particularly through its newspaper, Zaman. Erdoğan has begun a very verbal war on Hizmet, accusing it of being a tool of the United States, manipulated by the CIA, and seeking to overthrow the"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"186 • James C. Harringtongovernment—all the usual canards used by Turkish government leaders of the past against agents of change.Joining the European UnionHizmet has always strongly supported Turkey’s eff orts to join the European Union, which had been in progress, with varying degrees of intensity, since the mid-1980s.Although the principal motivation originally was economic, accession eff orts provided a fortuitous opportunity for political and constitutional reform because the EU insisted on a series of changes that dramatically aff ected Turkish politics, including: abolishing state security courts (which had taken the place of military courts) that exercised jurisdiction over politi-cal dissidents; ending capital punishment; establishing civilian control over the military; enacting some standard civil liberty protections for the press, religious freedom, due process, and political speech; and halting political prosecutions (such as had happened to Gülen).8 Th is brought about an astonishing democratization impetus in Turkey.Th e accession process has since come to a crawl, and the AKP’s interest in making changes necessary to join the EU have cooled, partly because of Erdoğan himself and partly because Turkey sees little economic gain and fears having to help fi nancially to shore up faltering EU states, particularly its his-torical foe, Greece. Nor is Turkey happy with the EU’s insistence on adjusting its occupation of northern Cyprus. To be sure, ample blame lies with Germany and France and the historical Islamophobia of many inside their countries.Even though the EU’s “soft power” over Turkey has dissipated, the elec-torate, on September 12, 2010, thirty years to the date of the 1980 bloody coup, by a 58 percent to 42 percent margin (with 74 percent of eligible voters casting ballots), adopted a series of constitutional amendments that expanded people’s economic and social rights, guaranteed union collective bargaining, enhanced civil liberty and individual freedoms (such as privacy, due process, equality and affi rmative action, and religious freedom), adopted judicial reforms, and opened the door to prosecuting former coup leaders. Civil society and Hizmet strongly supported this referendum.Ultimately, a core problem is that pluralist democracy has yet to develop fully in Turkey. Although there is majority rule, there are no strong opposi-tion parties, generally because of their own ineptness and ties to the old establishment. Turkey, though a democracy, is essentially, at this point, a"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Political Implications of the Hizmet Movement • 187one-party state. Th is lack of pluralism deeply troubles the EU and is cited as a major reason for the slowdown in Turkey’s accession process in recent years, although, as noted, less noble reasons are also at play. Pluralism is a legitimate concern, nevertheless.Th e movement and the AKP diff er substantially—and are at odds—on how vigorously to push for accession. Hizmet’s concern is that the further Tu r k e y d r i ft s from Europe, the further it will stray from democracy.Accession talks started up again in 2013, aft er a three-year hiatus, having been postponed earlier because of the Gezi Park crackdown of dissenters by the military, although Erdoğan’s follow-up caustic remarks are hardly help-ful. Th ey are now further imperiled by Erdoğan’s crackdown on civil liber-ties, discussed further below.Freedoms of Speech, Protest, and AssemblyHow the government handled the 2013 Gezi Park demonstrations raised grave questions about its respect for civil liberty. Th e protests initially con-tested an urban development plan for the Istanbul Taksim park and quickly intensifi ed over outrage at the brutal eviction of protesters doing a sit-in at the park. Subsequent solidarity protests and strikes took place across the country, protesting a wide range of concerns, such as freedoms of the press, expression, and assembly and the AKP’s encroachment on Turkey’s secularism.As demonstrations spread, excessive police use of tear gas and water can-nons caused thousands of injuries, some critical (like loss of sight), and some deaths. Th ere were more than three thousand arrests.Prime Minister Erdoğan again showed his irascible, authoritarian side in justifying the brutal crackdown, despite more conciliatory eff orts by President Abdullah Gül. Erdoğan drew strong international censure for the extreme force and absence of dialogue during the protests, which he sum-marily and brusquely rejected. And he drew criticism from Hizmet.A New ConstitutionTurkey had been in the process of draft ing a new constitution, which Hizmet strongly backed, to address many of the issues raised in this chapter and incorporate the changes the country has already adopted. However, Erdoğan and the AKP essentially stymied the endeavor, particularly over Erdoğan’s unsuccessful attempt to create a strong presidency, which he"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"188 • James C. Harringtonintends to seek again aft er the June 2015 parliamentary elections, if the AKP’s electoral margin is large enough.Freedom of the PressTurkey is also struggling with freedom of the press, especially given the media’s past complicity with the military/industrial complex, as coming to light in the Ergenekon and Sledgehammer conspiracy trials. Both of these trials involved conspiracy eff orts by various “Deep State” actors to derail progress toward liberal democracy. Scores of Turkish journalists are in jail; hundreds more are under prosecution or investigation; and some media out-lets are claiming AKP retaliation.It is not unlikely that some media people were actually complicit in the conspiracy activities. But Erdoğan’s bombastic reactions to criticism, partic-ularly from Europe, help cement his critics’ views about a press crackdown and intimidation. Th ese reactions have attracted extensive international criticism and contributed to Turkey’s ranking as a “partly free” country in the 2012 report of the Washington-based Freedom House. Th is pro-democ-racy watchdog group evaluates countries according to the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights (generally, free elections, multiparty democ-racy, rule of law, and equality of opportunity). Turkey has been stuck at “partly free” on the scale since 2005.Similarly, in 2011, for the third consecutive year, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) found that Turkey had the highest number of vio-lations of the European Convention on Human Rights.9 Turkey consist-ently ranks low out of 179 countries in terms of press freedom.On a diff erent press issue, there is considerable legitimate concern about the government’s use of political power and economic leverage to structure a more compliant and less critical media. Th e government likewise is embroiled in Internet freedom issues and has drawn broad criticism for fi ltering politi-cal opposition sites and blocking those contrary to “Turkish values” (and, for a while, blocking Darwinian evolution sites). Internet freedom and civil soci-ety groups are contesting the censorship regimen in the Council of State, Turkey’s highest administrative court, and also challenging a plan to require Internet users to choose one of the government’s four content-fi ltering pack-ages as unconstitutional and violating the right of free expression.Civil society representatives recognize that the high profi le cases under way, namely those dealing with Ergenekon, Sledgehammer, and the Internet,"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Political Implications of the Hizmet Movement • 189are of great consequence to the future of Turkey’s democracy; it is thus criti-cal that they be handled in accord with universal legal rules and human rights norms. Otherwise, the outcome will be counterproductive and lack integrity. Zaman has been highly outspoken on this position.Other Issues Relating to Civil Liberty and DemocracyErdoğan has lit other fi res, as well. Right aft er the Gezi Park protests, he told women to have three children because “birth-control mechanisms for years . . . nearly castrated our citizens. . . . Th eir objective was to reduce the popu-lation of this nation and for this nation to lag behind in the competition of nations. We are disrupting this game. We have to.”10 Th is nationalist pater-nalism ignited intense disparagement about meddling in citizen’s private lives.Undeterred, Erdoğan has since moved to end mixed-gender college stu-dent houses, saying such was the duty of his “conservative” government. And, in what has set off Hizmet’s alarm bells and drawn direct criticism from Gülen, the government has passed legislation that would close all pri-vately funded preparatory schools in 2015,11 many of which are Hizmet-operated. Educational institutions, unions, parent/teacher associations, trade advocacy groups, and opposition parties are against the plan, saying that shutting the schools would be a blow to free enterprise and the right to an education. Th e law also prohibits study centers that assist students pre-pare for high school and university examinations, another extensive Hizmet operation, which runs about 1,000 of the 4,000 such schools.12Th en, on December 17, 2013, a major corruption scandal broke, implicat-ing nearly fi ft y people, including members of the AKP administration and, later in the month, Erdoğan’s son. Aft er that, Erdoğan began a full-scale attack on Hizmet specifi cally and on civil liberties generally, a scenario still playing out. For example, he has moved further to censor the Internet, pun-ish nonconformist journalists, pack the judiciary, transfer thousands of police and offi cials to undercut the corruption investigations (and even charge some of them in criminal courts with very public arrests), terminate suspected Hizmet civil servants, and ally himself with the military. Despite the fact that his party won the spring 2014 local elections, chiefl y because there was no credible opposition, Erdoğan, rather than seek reconciliation, promised a vendetta against his foes, even seeking to extradite Gülen from the United States."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"190 • James C. HarringtonWhether this is an eff ort by the AKP to diminish Hizmet’s political infl uence and curtail its increased criticism of Erdoğan—and whether Hizmet can successfully resist this eff ort in a one-party democracy—will be a test well worth watching for its outcome. Will Hizmet be able to make the AKP back off , despite’s Erdoğan’s apparent intransigence on the matter? Will it end up in a de facto position of seeking an alliance with other politi-cal parties and thus perhaps strengthening pluralism? It is a conundrum that Hizmet surely never expected, or wanted.conclusionTurkey’s road toward full democracy has had a long and painful history, and Hizmet has been a major journey-partner in that struggle. However, there are still many, many miles to go. As Noam Chomsky noted,I know of no other country where leading writers, artists, journalists, academ-ics and other intellectuals have compiled such an impressive record of bravery and integrity in condemning crimes of state, and going beyond to engage in civil disobedience to try to bring oppression and violence to an end, facing and sometimes enduring severe repression, and then returning to the task. It is an honorable record, unique to my knowledge, a record of which the country should be proud. And one that should be a model for others.13Th e question on the table is the extent to which Hizmet and other civil soci-ety advocates can keep the government on track to honor and fulfi ll the dreams of those who have sacrifi ced to bring Turkey to where it is now, and to move forward and not change course. How much further democracy can extend in Turkey is now a very real challenge.notes1. “Secular,” in the Turkish context, is diff erent from the traditional American view of “separation of church and state,” which accepts religious freedom. In Turkey, “secularism” expresses a model of the state opposing various forms of reli-gious expression, most notably in public employment and education. Th e contro-versial head-scarf ban, which was relaxed in late 2013, is an example of this.2.

Headquartered in Turkey but worldwide in reach and gaining in infl uence daily, the Gülen movement hides its true intentions with a decentralized, diff use organizational structure that defi es tracking, so loose are the affi liations between its media outlets, educational institu-tions, and (multi-million dollar) business enterprises. “Lack of transpar-ency” is an accusation heard oft en from its critics. Yet the movement is also a public relations juggernaut, driven by relentless eff orts on the part of local representatives and foundations to court politicians, professors, and corpo-rate leaders, and to project itself as a modern, Western, democracy-promot-ing bridge between enlightened Islam and secular science. “Tolerance” is the mantra of the Gülenists, invoked with a regularity that seems rehearsed.In truth, however, the Gülen movement wears tolerance as a mask con-cealing its will to power—the power to roll back hard-won Turkish twelveDueling Narrativesthe gülenists of the hizmet movementR.

We asked the authors to explain and even critique many of the movement’s fea-tures, because we wanted readers to be aware of both the criticisms such movements evoke, as Hizmet certainly does, and what we might call advertisements for Gülen and ventures associated with him. R. Scott Appleby, dean of the Donald R. Keough School of Global Aff airs at the University of Notre Dame, has chosen to deal with the movement through the device of listening to and portraying “dueling narratives” in a masterful and succinct work of synthesis. Appleby and I (M.E.M.) have been associates for decades, having edited a number of volumes in Th e Fundamentalism Project (University of Chicago Press), where we employed “the hermenutics of suspicion” in respect to all the authors in those books.

Led by Fethullah Gülen, a reclusive, charismatic “mystery man” whose one mistake was allowing himself to be caught on tape urging his disciples to insinuate themselves gradually into the corridors of power without being detected, the Gülenists have succeeded in infi ltrating Turkey’s police force, in co-opting segments of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), and in using their infl uence to spy on and bully their political opponents, many of whom have been arrested on fl imsy charges. Indeed, Gülen shares with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s former prime minister, head of the AKP, and current president, a direct connection to the wave of renewal movements that shaped modern Islam in post-Ottoman Turkey. (Erdoğan’s Naqshbandi background parallels Gülen’s participation in Said Nursi’s Nur movement.)In 2013, Gülen and Erdoğan underwent a very public “ugly divorce,” as one Turkish pundit described their falling out over the prime minister’s increasingly authoritarian policies. Erdoğan rankled Gülen for, among other punitive moves, weeding out thousands of Gülenists embedded in the secu-rity services, government ministries, and judiciary of Turkey, offi cials who constituted, in Erdoğan’s words, “a parallel state.” Th is episode altered but did not fundamentally change the anti-Hizmet narrative; indeed, in the eyes of some Gülen detractors, it only confi rmed their depiction of the move-ment as having been unduly and secretively infl uential in the aff airs of state.Further proof that the modern sheen of the movement is no more than artifi ce can be found in the gender segregation practiced by the Gülenists, who exclude women from the select circle of affi liates admitted for advanced study with the founder.Hoping to spread their version of political Islam far beyond the borders of Turkey, the Gülenists have established schools across Asia, Europe, and the Americas, with a growing presence in Africa. Th at these schools are intended as the spearhead of a transnational cultural empire with political clout is evident in their staffi ng, funding, and business practices, all of which bear the distinct marks of the Turkish operation. In the United States, their charter schools and Turk-dominated faculty have come under scrutiny.

In this telling, it is inappropriate to call the movement “Gülenist,” because Gülen, by his own admission and the testimony of his colleagues, is neither a cult leader nor a chief executive in charge of even one of the institutions regularly associated with his name. Rather, those millions of men and women inspired by the preacher’s voluminous writings and video lectures are devoted, ultimately, not to him but to his ideas—including the idea that ideas are useless abstractions if not given life in prac-tical, eff ective action. Th us, they are best described as members of the “serv-ice in action” or Hizmet movement. Some are uneasy even with the term “movement,” to the extent that it connotes an explicit socio-political agenda.In the eyes of Hizmet members and admirers, the movement is the polar opposite of an Al Qaeda–style jihadist group, and Gülen bears comparison not to Osama Bin Laden but to the Dalai Lama, the global icon of peace and tolerance. Far from targeting “the other” for annihilation, the Gülenists actively reach out to other Muslims and to other religious and secular groups, practicing dialogue as a journey of mutual discernment and self-correction designed to identify common ground and make polemics a thing of the past. Emphasizing his love of learning and deep desire for dialogue, Gülen himself has met frequently with spiritual leaders, from the pope to the Sephardic chief rabbi of Israel. He has condemned terrorism at every opportunity, proclaimed repeatedly that no true Muslim can be a terrorist, and emphasized the centrality of love, nonviolence, and unconditional com-passion in the Sufi tradition that informs his practice of Islam and fi nds counterparts in Jewish and Christian mysticisms.Countering the accusations of secrecy and cult-like devotion to the preacher in exile, the Gülenists point to their lack of a centralized command and coordinated organizational structure as evidence of the voluntary and independent nature of the various initiatives in education, business, and"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"196 • R. Scott Applebymedia. Hizmet people make their own decisions rather than take orders from a guru; Gülen himself, aging and beset by diabetes and heart problems, shrugs off concerns about how the movement will survive his death. And, while acknowledging the Gülenists’ growing prominence in Turkey’s pres-tigious Police Academy and their infl uence in the ruling AKP, supporters point to the excellent preparation for professional life provided by the Gülen schools: Hizmet members earn their way into the upper echelons of society, where they are not afraid to voice their own ideas and opinions, even when these off end government offi cials. Rumors of a rift between the AKP leader-ship and the Gülenists reinforce this declaration of Hizmet independence. Such rumors were substantiated in 2013, when a decisive break apparently occurred between Prime Minster Erdoğan and the Gülen movement, aft er Gülen himself publicly criticized Erdoğan’s increasingly authoritative rule.2In Turkey (this narrative of benevolence continues), Hizmet represents a much-needed middle way between the extremes of Kemalist secularism, with its hostility to Islam (or any religion) having a voice in the public sphere, and religious extremism, with its betrayal of the inner, defi ning core of Islam, which Gülen portrays as eternal love. Indeed, Islam, properly under-stood, reveals and celebrates God’s purpose, which is to bring full realiza-tion of the wonders of creation through human agency. First and foremost, Hizmet serves the nation by helping Turkey to end its internal polarization between these extremes, to secularize fundamental religious questions, and to open the country to the larger world.For those believers inspired by Gülen’s preaching and lectures, seculariza-tion is the glorious end of religion, in that it extends the fundamental reli-gious insight and commitment to all of society. Th is does not lead to uni-formity but to plurality, anchored in God’s ongoing creative purpose. Secularism in this mode is not a threat but an opportunity, an invitation to genuine unity, achieved through service. Accordingly, the emphasis falls not on religious content per se but on the scientifi c study of God’s creation, on schools rather than mosques, and on education rather than indoctrination. “Science” (knowledge) and “Commerce” (constructive interaction) refl ect the very nature of the divine presence; Hizmet members are therefore enjoined to advance these frontiers, to plunge into the divine whirlwind, in order to elicit what is best and most promising in the modern world.Perhaps most thrilling to Hizmet members and admirers is the claim that this divinely ordained evolution of human agency and society toward greater realization of freedom and compassion is being anticipated and led"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Dueling Narr atives • 197by Muslims. Science, business, communication, democracy, promotion of pluralism, dialogue among peoples: these actions constitute Islam, and the Hizmet movement is the vanguard of the reform.3the benefit of the doubtTh e authors of this volume straddle these competing narratives but lean in the direction of the latter. “Something remarkable is going on in Turkey,” James C. Harrington observes, in a chapter that amounts to an encomium for the “mod-erate Islamic reform movement” that is promoting pluralism, a soft er form of secularism, and the mobilization of the middle class. Th e political prosecution of Gülen was to be expected, Harrington argues, given the threat that the pop-ular preacher posed to the military’s grip on state power. And he (Harrington) praises the movement’s participants as forbearing of others, nonjudgmental, and steadfastly nonviolent. Notwithstanding considerable evidence to the con-trary, the author concludes that the members of Hizmet “do not see themselves as making up a formal religious community, but rather as fi rm subscribers to a democratic secular society that promotes traditional civil liberties, including freedom of religion.” Harrington notes, and rejects, the criticisms of the opposi-tion; for example, the charge of “infi ltration” is better understood, he claims, as indicative of the social and economic integration of large numbers of previously marginalized citizens, now empowered by their affi liation with the Gülenists. And, far from leveraging their infl uence with the AKP to punish their enemies, Gülen supporters in government civil service have themselves suff ered employ-ment discrimination. Recently, the Hizmet movement has become more criti-cal of Erdoğan and the AKP, resulting in verbal attacks on the movement and other forms of state-sponsored discrimination.Harrington’s analysis draws on and mirrors that of the sociologist Helen Rose Ebaugh, whose 2010 study of the Gülenists is subtitled “A Sociological Analysis of a Civic Movement Rooted in Moderate Islam.” Like many other U.S. academics, the present author included, Ebaugh encountered the move-ment as its guest on a tour of western Turkey, where she “came to admire the many service projects sponsored by the movement, including the quality schools, top-notch hospitals, a thriving relief agency and the numerous interfaith events that were a hallmark of the movement.” 4Ebaugh devotes only a few pages of her monograph to an issue many Americans would likely not “come to admire” readily, namely, the role of"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"198 • R.

But she reports, from her interviews, pat-terns of gender interaction and a diversity of perceptions and evaluations about them that are familiar to scholars such as Lynne Davidman and Shahla Haeri,5 who have studied gender relations among other traditional religious communities (Orthodox Jews and fundamentalist Shi’ites, respec-tively): outsiders describe women as assuming roles “subservient” to men, while female insiders describe their situation as “liberating.” What, precisely, is their situation? Within the Hizmet movement, according to chapter author Margaret J. Rausch, the wearing of head coverings by women, gender segregation, and the division of labor based on gender is typical—though supporters emphasize that such practices are elective, not obligatory. Th ey give expression, Rausch explains, to the Islamic teaching, echoed in Roman Catholicism, Orthodox Judaism, and evangelical Christianity, that the dif-ferences between the genders are substantive, not superfi cial, rooted in nature and revelatory of God’s will. Within the Hizmet movement, this traditional view of human nature is fi ltered through and amplifi ed by a Sufi /Gülenist emphasis on the goal of self-perfection. Perfection is achieved in and through nature, and gender identity is essential to one’s humanity.Rausch, in keeping with this volume’s pro-Hizmet trajectory, acknowl-edges but attempts to refute feminist and other “Western” criticisms. Th us she underscores the absence of offi cial restrictions on women’s participation in the public sphere and dismisses any necessary link between Hizmet gen-der practices and the “oppression” of women—and, indeed, Gülen and his followers consistently stress individual interpretation and expression of Islamic and movement norms. Other authorial interventions on the Gülenists’ behalf are perhaps less compelling. Rausch accepts without com-ment, for example, the offi cial Hizmet position discounting the possibility of social pressure or coercion, however inadvertent, and she likewise recites the party line, which holds that the exclusion of women from advanced study with Gülen is “the only practice that could be considered to be dis-criminatory.” Such judgments seem not to refl ect a mature understanding of what might be called “the dynamics of compliance” operating within a movement like Hizmet.In similar fashion, Phyllis E. Bernard’s chapter on the business practices of the movement opens by posing a question that amounts to, “Is it too good to be true?” But Bernard does not leave the reader long in suspense. “Th e Hizmet model of capitalism,” she declares in paragraph three, “does some-thing radical: it puts people before profi ts.” Support for this judgment is"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Dueling Narr atives • 199found in studying individual examples of Hizmet commerce and trade, because the business model is “fractal,” a pattern whereby the smallest unit is replicated over and over, producing eventually a global network of schools and businesses. Th e values inspiring Hizmet businesses derive from Islam’s emphasis on provision for the poor, exemplifi ed in the obligation of zakat—whereby Hizmet businessmen contribute between 10 and 30 percent of their annual income to movement institutions and activities. Th is charitable impulse, moreover, is wed to a modifi ed free-market ethos that rewards rela-tionship building and makes room for lower- and middle-class families to participate in the creation and expansion of transnational business and phi-lanthropy networks.Bernard lauds this approach as central to the exercise of “soft power” by Hizmet and by Turkey as a whole, accompanied as it is by unspecifi ed but “massive” amounts of fi nancial support for the programs of cultural exchange that bring thousands of non-Muslims, including a constant stream of Americans, to Turkey. As guests of the movement, the foreigners are treated to the fi nest Anatolian hospitality, and they are invited to engage in dialogue on the road to profi table longer-term cultural and economic rela-tionships. Th e Hizmet brand of cultural diplomacy is remarkably eff ective, not least in framing the movement along lines congenial to its most passion-ate advocates.Missing from this otherwise rosy picture are details—reliable data on benefi ciaries, institutions, and budgets. Bernard’s account raises other ques-tions, as well. How do Hizmet businessmen navigate the world of invest-ment and interest, given the Islamic prohibition on usury? A Western reader might be stunned by the following statement: “Cash is the preferred method for doing business. Th ousands, even millions of dollars will transfer from person to person across vast distances based solely on a verbal request.” Yet we are no longer trading in the bazaar: by all accounts, the Hizmet business, education, and media empire is impressively modern, effi cient, and elec-tronic. How is this marriage of personal networks, “moral management,” and high-tech industry remain competitive within a global corporate milieu driven by a distinctly alien ethos?In sum, the authors of the present volume perform the invaluable service of surveying the horizon of Hizmet and formulating the critical questions swirling around the movement.

In short, the appreciative mur-murs uttered by the authors must be placed in social and historical con-text—contexts that function as interpretive lenses for those who ask: Whither modern Islam?Th e most immediate context for construing the Hizmet movement is the legacy of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the hero of the Turkish War of Independence and founder of the Turkish republic in 1923. So central was Mustafa Kemal’s leadership to the transformation of the former Ottoman Empire into a modern, westernized—and surpassingly secular—nation-state that the principles of his reforms are known as Kemalism, and he him-self was granted the title Atatürk (“Father of the Turks”) by the Turkish parliament. Atatürk abolished the caliphate, outlawed the fez and the veil, imposed Swiss civil law in the place of Shari‘a, and substituted the Latin alphabet for Ottoman Arabic script. His military background and emphasis on state security established the conditions that led, aft er his death, to what many Turkish citizens refer to as “Deep State”—the coalition of military and fi nancial elites that propped up successive Turkish governments and then intervened, with soft or hard coups, when the national politicians threatened the interests of the military-industrial complex, failed to repress Kurdish secessionists or Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries, and/or enabled the return of Islam to a position of infl uence in national politics.Kemalism shaped modern Turkey, but it did not displace Islam entirely, nor did it undermine a hierarchy of Turkish values in which serenity, pleas-ure, respect, and family loyalty are at least as prominent as money or career. Th e journalist Stephen Kinzer’s vivid analysis of the dazzling diversity and contradictions of contemporary Turkish society, Crescent and Star, refl ects the long-standing frustration of many Turks and their friends with Turkey’s inability to achieve its democratic potential. Turks, Kinzer writes, have been “taught since time immemorial that authority is something distant and irre-sistible, and that the role of the individual in society is submission.” 6Yet Kinzer’s account ends before the rise of Erdoğan and the AKP to power in 2003, and today, more than a decade aft er that fateful election,"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Dueling Narr atives • 201Turkey has been transformed, at least for the time being. Th e most startling and unexpected development has been the AKP’s seeming success in disman-tling “Deep State”—and few, if any, observers deny that the followers of Gülen played a signifi cant role in that achievement, notwithstanding the aforementioned split with Erdoğan and the AKP in late 2013. During the period of the AKP’s ascendancy, Hizmet members have served in the govern-ment and promoted Turkey’s eff orts to join the European Union. Not least, the movement mobilized its education, business, and media networks—including one of the nation’s leading daily newspapers, Zaman—in support of the AKP’s legal and political battles to erode the power of the army’s shadow government, to advance democracy, and to enhance pluralism, most notably through creating an opening to a revitalized Islamic presence in the public square. Th e collaboration between the Gülenists and the AKP culmi-nated in the remarkable events of September 12, 2010, when the electorate adopted a series of constitutional amendments that, in Harrington’s words, “expanded people’s economic and social rights, guaranteed union collective bargaining, enhanced civil liberty and individual freedoms . . . adopted judi-cial reforms, and opened the door to prosecuting former coup leaders” (i.e., the operatives of Deep State). Th e world celebrated the referendum as a land-mark in the strengthening of democracy, human rights, and civil society, and the Gülenists count it as a major victory in their quest to reform modern Tu r k e y — a n d m o d e r n I s l a m .Not every Turk sees things quite this way. While few mourn the undoing of Deep State, millions of Turks, not least a generation of empowered femi-nists, fear Islamic politics of any kind and continue to prefer the Kemalist variety of secularism. Th ese secular liberals are among the fi ercest detractors of the Gülen movement. Yet millions of Turks, constituting the majority of the electorate, continue to support the AKP and Erdoğan, despite some of the latter’s high-handed policies and infringement on civil liberties and due process. One stream of support for the Hizmet movement clearly comes from this constituency, which applauds the Gülenists’ rejection of Deep State’s tendency to abrogate civil liberties and to regard citizens as subjects, opposition as treason, and any assertions of religious or alternate ethnic identity as threats to Turkey’s territorial integrity.A second context explaining the relative enthusiasm for the Hizmet movement is the progressive face it places on Islam, represented by the fol-lowers of Gülen as a congenial home to modern science, philosophy, inter-cultural dialogue, and human rights.

Scott Applebyand global ambitions arrive at a time in world history when Islam, divided by a bitter and violent religious civil war raging from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Syria, Palestine, and Nigeria, is perceived as antithetical to the basic principles of democracy, just war, human rights, and peaceful coex-istence . Bold ly, the Hizmet movement cla i ms that Isla m, properly constr ued , is not merely a willing participant in the dialogue of civilizations and the progress of nations but also a potential leader. In the minds of many west-erners, the priority given by Gülenists to reason informed by ethics, and to science unfettered by superstitious “medievalism,” is an encouraging alterna-tive to the spectacle of imams in Africa refusing to allow vaccinations for HIV-AIDS, or mullahs in Pakistan prohibiting life-saving organ trans-plants—rulings based on a scientifi cally illiterate reading of “Islamic law.” And to peacebuilders, the Hizmet dedication to dialogue and cultural exchange with non-Muslims and nonbelievers is the essential fi rst step on the path to the nonviolent resolution of religious and ethnic strife.A tactical and generational shift under way worldwide among “post-fun-damentalist” and “post-Islamist” Muslims provides a third and related con-text for receiving the Hizmet movement gladly. Rejecting the violence of the jihadists and the failures or compromises of the Islamist politicians, a new generation of transnational Muslim movements seeks economic, cultural, and social infl uence leading to long-term transformation of societies. Can this process of transformation properly be called Islamization? Th e answer is unclear, as cosmopolitan and universalist sensibilities, carried aloft through cyberspace, are recasting notions of Islamic identity and eroding the reli-gious/secular binary that “enlightened” politicians from Th omas Jeff erson to Atatürk worked so hard to construct and reify.Th e French intellectual Olivier Roy argues that Muslim religiosity is being privatized in the wake of “the failures of political Islam,” 7 but other scholars refuse to equate the weakening of the appeal of Islamist political categories such as the nation or the ummah (global Islamic community) with the abandonment of the quest for an alternative political order. Rather, writes the international aff airs scholar Peter Mandaville, “transnational Muslim solidarities represent an intermediate space of affi liation and socio-political mobilization that exists alongside and in an ambivalent relation-ship with the nation-state.” 8In light of the 2013 repression of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the suff ocating of the Arab Spring elsewhere, and the Gülenists own break with the AKP in Turkey, the push to take control of the state is hardly the only, or"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Dueling Narr atives • 203the most eff ective, way of triggering constructive social change. Mandaville argues that the coming generation’s focus on individual freedom and desire to achieve prosperity according to Western standards signals neither the end of the social and public functions of religion nor the desire of younger Muslims to abandon the collective dimensions of fi nding social meaning in religion. “What we are seeing in the Muslim world today,” he suggests, “is the rise of a number of heterogeneous networks and groups organized loosely and oft en fl exibly around a particular discursive referent (‘justice,’ ‘development,’ ‘social change through proper Islamic observance,’ etc.).” 9 Th is array of “eve-ryday social movements,” led by new religious intellectuals, has arisen in tan-dem with—and oft en in some tension with—a new generation of Islamist political parties such as the new Muslim Brotherhood and the AKP.Mandaville quotes the Italian sociologist Alberto Melucci to the eff ect that participation in these new socioreligious movements is considered an end in itself: the members’ everyday practice enacts the future they envision. Th is practical focus on what can be achieved in the present moment is “a way of being in the world” rather than a means of advancing a particular politi-cal objective—though the way itself will inevitably aff ect politics and other sectors of society. A case in point is the Hizmet movement. Th e neoliberal pra c t ice s (e . g . , con s u mer i sm) a nd st r uc t u re s (e . g . , g loba l ma rket s) a dopte d by the Gülenists, facilitated by their negotiation and contestation of tradi-tional Islamic norms, signals their focus on a prize “bigger than”—more consequential than—state power. Rather than viewing the Islamization of society as entailing participation in or control over political parties sepa-rated from everyday life, the Gülenists pursue “Islamic normativity” within the pragmatic spaces of quotidian activity. Th ereby “Islam is not rendered an external ideology,” Mandaville concludes, “but instead is lived.”10what’s not to like?If this analysis is correct, the rise of movements like Hizmet—and Hizmet in particular—is a potentially promising development in the world of Islam and for socially relevant religion in general. How to account then, for the intense opposition of the detractors?I have already mentioned concerns arising from the practices and proce-dures of the Gülenists themselves. Among the most intractable of these, the ones for which the movement itself bears some responsibility, are, fi rst, the"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"204 • R. Scott Applebylingering sense outsiders have of a hidden agenda, and, second, the challenge posed to every traditional religious movement by feminist and other human rights advocates who disapprove of the way in which gender relations, and especially women’s agency, are managed within the movement.As to the fi rst obstacle, there may be no “hidden agenda” whatsoever, and the Hizmet affi liates are certainly remarkably transparent about their values and goals. Yet they are also aggressive “proselytizers,” albeit in their typically nonreligious mode, and are unapologetically eager to produce their bona fi des to their progressive interlocutors and potential partners. Does that zeal lead at times to the cutting of corners and a degree of self-misrepresentation? (Seeing a Hizmet promotional brochure with my name and photo alongside a comment of endorsement I had never made, I confess, did give me pause.) And, given the mountain of suspicion the Gülenists must overcome, would it be “good business” in the long run to err on the side of full transparency with regard to budgets, resources, and the like? Similarly, the controversy surrounding gender-related practices is an opportunity for the followers of Gülen to underscore their commitment to pluralism by putting on greater display both the freedom of choice within the movement and their vision for a society in which “radical feminists,” atheists, and additional potential “others” enjoy equal access to the same privileges and rights as the true believers.Beyond the adjustments Hizmet members might make to reassure their critics, there are external factors to which there is no short-term solution. Th e most debilitating of these is Islamophobia, bias against Muslims rooted in stereotypes drawn from profi les of a minority of violent jihadists and theocrats who distort the meaning of Islam and its practice by more than one billion Muslims. “Guilt by association” is not a new way people discrim-inate against those perceived as diff erent, nor is it restricted to the opponents of Islam. In the aft ermath of September 11, 2001, however, few outgroups have taken as much abuse as Muslims. And Islamophobia certainly raises the “too good to be true” bar for the Gülenists: any group that would acknowledge its defi ning commitment to the fundamental principles of Islam, especially a movement that proclaims its compatibility with many of the most cherished Western values and aspirations, dare not make the kind of bureaucratic or individual mistakes—typical errors of judgment, miscom-munication, and lack of discipline—to which every human enterprise is routinely subject. Indeed, there is no benefi t of the doubt for the Muslim “mystery man” and his “disciples.”"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Dueling Narr atives • 205In this last, most diffi cult context, the Hizmet movement has emerged—not unscathed, perhaps, but commanding the attention and close study of those Americans who recognize that the challenges faced by humanity in this century can only be met by an alliance of religious and secular actors and institutions. It also appeals to those who perceive a promising way for-ward in partnering with an expression of modern Islam that opens itself to sustained and mutually transformative dialogue with anyone who is serious about advancing the spirit and practice of compassionate service.notes1.
