The school of illu-mination, headed by Suhrawardi, held the view that ‘essence’ not ‘existence’was the only reality. Nothing in the external world corresponded to ‘exis-tence’, and hence ‘existence’ remained an empty concept and an intellectualproperty, whereas ‘essence’ was real and primary. By contrast, Sadr al-DinShirazi (1571–1640), known also as Mulla Sadra,1spoke of the primacy ofBeing (asalat al-wujud) and promoted a new ontology.From the twelfth century CE, the school of illumination occupied a focalplace in the intellectual life of Muslims, particularly in the Persian-speakingworld. The philosophical thought of this school marked a vivid departure fromrationalism to Gnosticism, or knowledge by illumination (al-ishraq). Shahabal-Din Suhrawardi (1171–1208), the founder of this school, believed thatknowledge of an object in the world came only through revealing its essence orquiddity. The Being of the object, unlike its essence, was a mental concept andhad no external reality. To prove this point, Suhrawardi developed theargument that there were two possible ways of understanding the meaning ofBeing: either as a universal concept shared by all existent beings or as aparticular being. In the first case, Being remains a mental concept, but in thesecond it depends on its essence to exist because a particular being is equiv-alent to its essence, which makes the being the way it is.2A universal concept such as ‘blackness’ is conceived only in respect of aparticular black object; existence, then, as a universal concept, reveals itselfthrough a particular being. Thinking of existence as a universal concept, andthen of its reliance on a particular type of being for its existence is similar toAristotle’s understanding of the relationship between universals and partic-ulars. Aristotle, in rejecting the Platonic view of reality, argued for thedependence of universal determinations on particular beings and against theontological status of universal determinations. In projecting his own views,Suhrawardi, on one hand, relied on Aristotle’s argument, and, on the other,reversed the argument. He came closer to Plato by insisting on thedependence of particular beings on their universal determinations, not viceversa.3Suhrawardi’s thought influenced the dominant philosophical tradition inIsfahan, where Mulla Sadra studied. Mulla Sadra’s teacher, Mir MuhammadBaqir al-Astarabadi (d. 1630), also known as Mir Damad, was one of theleading figures of the doctrine of illumination. But it seems that Mir Damad1"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"was not a blind follower of Suhrawardi, because he tried to reconcile theGnostic ideas of Illuminationism with Ibn Sina’s ontology, or, as Nasrremarks, he provided the illuminationsit interpretation of Ibn Sina.4MullaSadra, at the beginning of his philosophical career, and under the influence ofMir Damad and this dominant philosophical trend in Isfahan, advocated thedoctrine of the primacy of essence and was one of the followers ofIlluminationism. To understand his turn from or criticism of Suhrawardi’smetaphysics it is also of the utmost importance to take into account theinfluence of Ibn Sina (979–1037) and Ibn al-‘Arabi (1163–1240) in MullaSadra’s project of a new type of metaphysics based on the primacy of Being.This project meant destroying the foundation of essentialism in pursuit of aserious ontological investigation into the truth of Being. To achieve this,Mulla Sadra had to admit his disillusionment with essentialism and abandonthe notion of the primacy essence.Mulla Sadra belonged to the ishraqiphilosophical tradition. He changedhis position and became a defender of the doctrine of the primacy of Beingunder the influence of ‘spiritual inspiration’ rather than a rationalisticdiscourse and logical investigation. He clearly states ‘until my God guidedme and showed me his proof’, which expresses the occurrence of a mysticalexperience for Mulla Sadra. From then on, Mulla Sadra devoted his time todefending his ontological position and the general principles of his tran-scendent philosophy. The ‘darkness of illusion’ described here is indicative ofthe domain of Suhrawardi’s metaphysics, in which a state of untruth reignsover the whole of reality so that the meaning of Being becomes unattainable.It is reflected in the ‘abandonment of Being’ or ‘nihilism’ discussed by MartinHeidegger (1889–1976), and is a philosophical position from Plato toNietzsche representing a history of negligence of the question of Being.5Inboth the Western philosophical tradition and Suhrawardi’s metaphysics, whatis lost or abandoned is the being of beings as a whole, which has led to the‘disintegration of truth’ or the ‘forgottenness’ of truth and the thinking ofBeing as ‘essence’.6Turning from this type of metaphysics became a serious philosophicalenterprise for Mulla Sadra after his departure for Kahak, a village near Qum,and his choosing a solitary life for more than a decade. The overcoming of the‘darkness of illusion’ would be achieved by deconstructing Suhrawardi’smetaphysics and in reconstructing an ontology based on the primacy ofBeing. The new ontology dealt with the primordial philosophical question ofthe meaning of the being of beings, rather than with familiarity with beings oressence. Overcoming Suhrawardi’s metaphysics meant a radical change torecognizing the priority of the question of the meaning of Being.The reason for Mulla Sadra’s self-imposed exile was reportedly political.His fame in Isfahan had met with jealousy on the part of a group of religiousscholars who were politically ambitious and determined to gain patronage2Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"from the rulers of the day.7There was, however, more to this opposition thanjealousy. Fazlur Rahman stated that, in addition to his sympathy for Ibn al-‘Arabi’s doctrine of the Unity of Being, Mulla Sadra’s ideas were too radicalfor the religious circle of the time.8The political position of his father at theSafawid court played an important role in saving him, but he was forced tomake a choice between defending his views and turning to seclusion. Hechose the latter, with a sense of disillusionment with the rational method ofthe Peripatetic Neoplatonic philosophy and essentialism of the school of illu-mination. After his time in solitude, he returned to Shiraz, where he founded aschool, where he taught thinkers such as Mulla Muhsin Fayd Kashani and‘Abd al-Razzaq al-Husayn al-Lahiji. In later centuries, Persian Muslimthinkers such as Mulla Hadi Sabzawari, Mulla Ali Nuri and Mulla AliMudarris Zunuzi came under his influence. Today, Muslim thinkers such asAbdul Hasan Qazwini, Muhammad Kazim Assar and Muhammad HussainTabatab’i adhere to Mulla Sadra’s philosophy.9As mentioned earlier, the turn from the primacy of essence to the primacyof Being in Mulla Sadra’s thought belonged to his period of solitude and to histeaching in Shiraz. During that time the question of Being rather than essenceproved to be ‘the foundation of the principles of philosophy’.10For him, theprimacy of Being was fundamental in the sense that Being and not essencewas the only reality on which the multiplicity of beings (essents) stands.Certainly, what Mulla Sadra tried to prove in his ontological enterprise ofdiscovering a unified ground had been discussed earlier by Aristotle in theMetaphysics, Book VII. For Aristotle, the diversity of the modes of Beingleads to the question of its underlying unity. But the difference betweenAristotle and Mulla Sadra arises with the doctrine of the categories and theepistemological significance of this doctrine for knowing reality. Aristotleproposed ten categories, of which the most fundamental was substance, withothers, for example quantity, quality, relation, place, time, posture, state,action, and passion, dependent for their existence on substance. These cate-gories are classes or genera, the application or which makes possibleknowledge of every mode of being and reality. Mulla Sadra’s metaphysicsasserts the realm of this principle of unity beyond the domain of the cate-gories. For this reason, Being remains indefinable.11It is neither a genus foranother entity, differentia, or species, nor a common or specific accident.Understanding its meaning cannot be based on anything more prevalent thanitself.12This negative approach, however, does not mean that nothing aboutBeing or this unifying principle can be known. The indefinability of Beingpoints out the inherent shortcomings of Aristotle’s logic and rational appre-hension; meanwhile the inability of this type of logic and epistemologyshould not eliminate the question of its meaning. The failure of the rationalapprehension of Being was not an obstacle to Mulla Sadra’s ontologicalenterprise or to inquiry into its meaning. He denounced pure rationality, andIntroduction3"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"relied instead on intuition or mystic experience for knowing the inner realityof Being:As it has been stated the reality of existence is neither genus, nor species, noraccident, since it is not a natural universal. Instead, its inclusion happens inanother mode of inclusion, and no one has gnosis of it except the mystics, i.e.‘those who are firmly grounded in mystical knowledge’ [3:7]. Sometimes it isinterpreted as the spiritual soul [i.e. Holy Spirit], other times as that grace ‘whichextendeth to all things’ [7:156]. Sometimes [it is as the] ‘reality from whichentities have been created’, according to the mystics. [Also, it is] the expansion ofthe light of existence to the structures of contingent entities, and the essences,which are receptive to it; finally [they speak of] its descent towards the abodes ofinner natures.13The rationalist preoccupation with epistemology does not constitute areawakening of the question of Being because it presupposes a subject–objectdichotomy. It depends on having turned away from Being to beings. MullaSadra’s epistemology is significant for eliminating the subject–objectdichotomy and reawakening the question of Being. According to FazlurRahman, it also shows a resemblance to the epistemological positions ofPlotinus (205–270) and Henri Bergson (1859–1941). The latter, for example,insists on the point that ‘duration’ as an experience cannot be rationally appre-hended and is a matter of intellectual intuition.14It is worth mentioning that,in inquiring into the meaning of Being, Mulla Sadra agreed with Suhrawardithat Being was not apprehended rationally and that the Aristotelian logicfailed to reveal its truth, whereas essence was conceived rationally. Essencedid not exist by itself but arose in thinking when a particular mode of Beingwas conceived. For this reason, essence should be thought of as a mentalphenomenon that exists in thinking and for thinking and not as an externalreality or something with its own ontological status.Mulla Sadra’s criticism of Suhrawardi’s metaphysics became explicit inhis philosophical turn when he formed the contrary philosophical view thatBeing was not a mental property but an objective reality outside the domain ofrational thinking. For this reason, Being could be perceived and understoodthrough its illuminative presence by a new cognitive tool. Only in this waywas doubt about the inner nature of reality superseded. Based on such intu-itive experience, Being appeared the most evident of all things. It was theprinciple without which even ‘non-being’ was unthinkable.15This ontologicalenterprise parallels in some ways that of Martin Heidegger, except that MullaSadra’s ontology is entangled with theology. Otherwise, both thinkersadvocate the primacy of Being. Heidegger, in interpreting the history of meta-physics, thinks that the abandonment of Being is rooted in Platonism; forMulla Sadra it was inherited in Suhrawardi’s thought. Meanwhile, they sharethe view that Aristotle’s logic is incapable of revealing the meaning of Being.4Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Reliance on the Aristotelian system of logic brings shortcomings into ourontological inquiry. According to Heidegger, for instance, this reliance led thepost-Aristotelian thinkers to neglect Being and to turn towards studying onticentities instead.16For Mulla Sadra, the doctrine of the primacy of essence led to theconcealment of the truth. Its advocates neglected fundamental philosophicalquestions in favour of investigating the nature of something less fundamentalor grounded that could not exist by itself. The reason for this, as explained byMulla Sadra, lay in the reliance on the rational apprehension of Being.17Heidegger, in Being and Time(1927), concurs, arguing that the postAristotelian thinkers accepted the dogma of negligence, and withdrew them-selves from the genuine philosophical question about the meaning of Being,for three reasons. First, they thought that Being was the most universalconcept, and that its universality ‘transcended’ any universality of genus.Second, since Being is the most universal concept, and is not an entity, it istherefore indefinable and escapes all attempts to define it in accordance withthe rules of ‘definition’ provided in Aristotelian logic. Third, Being is self-evident.18Heidegger rejects the three presuppositions and argues against thepost-Aristotelian thinkers that the universality of the concept of Being doesnot guarantee the clarity of its meaning, and that the meaning of this conceptis still the darkest of all. He also, like Mulla Sadra, says that Being is not anentity and is thus indefinable, and that Aristotle’s concept of definition ‘defi-nitio fit per genus proximum et differentiam specificam’ is not applicable to it.Heidegger also believes that the indefinableness of Being does not invalidatethe question of its meaning, and should not hinder us from investigating thatmeaning.19There are, however, three ontological positions in dealing with the primacyof Being or essence. Either Being is prior to essence or posterior to it, or theyco-exist. When Being is thought of as prior to essence, it signifies that Beingcan stand by itself without, or prior to, its essence. If, however, the primacy ofessence is accepted as true, it implies that essence exists without Being. Butfor this, essence has to exist or needs another existence to rely on, and forMulla Sadra this is a vicious regress. The third position is that existence andessence co-exist. This ontological view involves the notion that essence iswith existence and not in it. In this case, essence again relies for its existenceon another existence. As a consequence of this, essence cannot be withoutprior existence.20In arguing against these three ontological positions, Mulla Sadraconcluded that the qualification of essence by existence, unlike the qualifi-cation of a body by colour, is an intellectual operation. Neither existence noressence is prior to the other, nor do they have a state of simultaneity, sincenothing can be prior, posterior or simultaneous to itself. Both are ontologi-cally inseparable and differ only in thinking:Introduction5"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"What has been said earlier is sufficient to refute this claim, for existence is iden-tical with essence in the external [realm] but different from it mentally. Therefore,there is no relation between them except in intellectual consideration. In [such anintelligible] consideration, the relation will have existence which in its innerreality is identical with it, but is different from it in the realm external [to themind]. This kind of as infinitum is stopped when the intelligible consideration isceased.21What, then, does the primacy of Being mean if these three positions arerefuted? How can we talk about the primacy of Being? In answering thesequestions, we can think of the primacy of Being over essence and its modeslike the primacy of a ground over the grounded. Mulla Sadra believes thatBeing and essence, like the ground and the grounded, are ontologically insep-arable; they are different realities in thinking only.22When a being isconceived and analysed into its determinations, the Being of this beingappears in thinking to be distinct from these determinations. This intellectualapprehension does not coincide with the inner reality of Being, becauseessence is not distinct from Being, nor is existence an addition to essence. It isonly in thinking that the priority of one over the other, in particular of essence,becomes evident, because thinking analyses each entity into existence andessence. The latter appears as the prior factor due to its nature as a universaldetermination and something apprehended by the intellect, whereas existenceis not apprehended. Here, the primacy of essence becomes a mental factor,and Being remains an ontological ground inaccessible to rational thinking.The distinction between Being and essence in the intellectual sphere is notsimilar to that between an object and its accident. Instead, it is like theconnection that exists in the species between a genus and its differentia.23Being is a being of an object; when we abstract an essence from it that essencewill not subsist. Although an accident seems to be identical to the existence ofan object, it is not the being of that object. Mulla Sadra supports this view byrelying on Ibn Sina’s ontology, agreeing with him that an accident needs anobject to become existent, whereas the case with existence and essence isdifferent.24Being for Mulla Sadra has four characteristics:iBeing stands as a unitary ground for its own modifications or thegrounded.ii Being is separated from essence in thinking.iii Being is equivocal or systematically ambiguous.iv Being is dynamic and changes itself substantially.In arguing for the primacy of Being and searching for a unitary ground, MullaSadra holds the view that essence is what distinguishes all entities from oneanother and limits them. When we say ‘p’ is ‘q’, the predicate ‘q’ distin-guishes and limits ‘p’ by excluding other possibilities that can be predicated6Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"of it. Once the implication of this view is taken into account and Being isthought of as a mere mental concept, as advocated by Suhrawardi and hisfollowers, we realize the following. First, there will be limitation in reality.Second, God’s existence as pure Being will not only suffer limitation by Hisessence but will also become a mental concept that has no ontological statusbut is ‘unlike everything, which is other than it [lit. non-existence i.e.,essence], because every other thing, to be existent requires that existence betaken into consideration and joined to it’.25According to the first characteristic, Being stands as an ontological realityfor all kinds of ontic entities or modes of Being. This relationship betweenBeing and its ontic modifications is also similar to that between phenomenonand appearance in Heidegger’s ontology. Heidegger makes a distinctionbetween phenomenon and appearing. Phenomenon is something that showsitself or is manifest.26This showing itself is the way in which a phenomenonappears and is apprehended. The relationship between these two ontologicalspheres is illustrated in the metaphor of ‘Krankenheitserscheinungen’(symptoms of illness). The symptoms of influenza, such as high temperatureand bodily pain, indicate a phenomenon that does not show itself, namelyinfluenza. The phenomenon of this illness announces itself through itssymptoms or signs. Appearing is, therefore, not a phenomenon but anannouncing of a phenomenon, and a phenomenon is that which announcesitself through its appearance.27In understanding the ontological division ofBeing into the ground and the grounded, or Being and its modes when it isunderstood in the light of emanation, we arrive at the conclusion that exis-tence requires the grounded or its manifested modes to announce itself and tomake itself intelligible, while the grounded depends on the ground for itsexistence.28Being, in this regard, is not one but many. The multiplicity of thegrounded is based on the oneness of the ground. This describes Being asequivocal, as something used ambiguously in more than one sense (tashkikal-wujud).29The systematic ambiguity of Being represents the truth of Being asbecoming and is also systematic and a perpetual progression without repeatingitself. It is an intentional progress from the more indeterminate to the moredeterminate or concrete mode of Being. Thus, Being is a unitary ground thatmanifests itself in a variety of modes and gradations, vertically as well as hori-zontally. The modes of Being are different from one another in terms of priorand posterior, perfection and imperfection, strength and weakness.30As aconsequence, Being is neither unity nor diversity, but unity in diversity. Thedegrees of diversity are different in intensity and perfection. Being continuesbeyond this diversity without ceasing to be a unity. To elucidate this point,Mulla Sadra utilized the Sufi interpretation of the unveiling of God (al-tajalli).From God, all modes of Being flow constantly in all realms of the microcosmand to the prime matter, which is capable only of accepting forms. In this wayIntroduction7"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Mulla Sadra conjoins a multi-dimensional conception of reality itself, whichhas become an open field, with possibilities. His ontology is, thereby, intendedto be opposed to the monolithic system.Since Being is equivocal and the only reality, it acts as the principles ofidentity and difference. The modes of Being are identical in their inner realitybut different in terms of prior and posterior, perfection and imperfection,strength and weakness. This relationship between these two principles ofBeing becomes clear when the modes of Being are interpreted as gradationsin terms of less and more perfect. For example, plants are less perfect thananimals and animals less perfect than human beings. Being, therefore, hastwo different poles of perfection, but at the same time it can be achieved whenBeing shows itself as pure existence rather than essence.Even at the level of regional ontology or ontic entities, the existence–essence dualism remains a mental factor. The systematic ambiguity of Being,as we see, is downward (tanzil), from pure to concrete modes of Being. Thisirreversible process, when it is understood in light of emanation, becomesproblematic. Emanation, as a vertical systematic ambiguity, begins with thehighest form of Being to the lowest. In this respect it cannot be seen asprogress, but as a journey towards darkness and the unreal, while thesystematic ambiguity of Being is an irreversible progress from less perfect tomore perfect. In this case, it is not a journey towards the dark corners of exis-tence, but rather a movement similar to the dialectic movement of GeistinHegel’s philosophy for accomplishing absoluteness. Only in this context ofunderstanding it dialectically can the systematic ambiguity of Being be seenas progress.31Although Hegel, unlike Mulla Sadra, sees the world as rationaland holds the view that human inquiry must grasp this rationality in order tohave an adequate apprehension of reality, the dialectic movement of Geistshares commonality with the ambiguity of Being. This commonality,however, does not deny the fundamental ontological differences betweenHegel and Mulla Sadra’s thought. For Hegel, reality is a range of universalthought determinations or categories: ‘Metaphysics is nothing but the rangeof universal thought determinations and is as it were diamond-net into whichwe bring every thing in order to make it intelligible.’32In considering realityas ‘the range of universal thought determinations’, Hegel lapses into the‘darkness of illusion’ or ‘nihilism’ in the Heideggerian sense. For Aristotle and Muslim peripatetic thinkers, substance, unlike accident,is unchangeable. Substance cannot become more or less substance. We canthink of change in quality or of an object’s becoming more or less white, but asubstance such as an animal cannot become more or less animal. The species‘animal’, despite changing qualities, remains the same. Keeping substancealoof from change and from all accidental qualities under the sway of changeis, for Mulla Sadra, again based on the illusion of subject–object dualism,which he refutes. Since this dualism is a mental factor, the dynamic character8Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"of Being should be described as a substantial change (al-haraka al-jawhariyyah), according to which everything is continuously transformed.Such transformation implies that change is not limited to the four accidentalcategories of quality, quantity, place and position. In addition, there is a morefundamental change, that of substance itself.33Under the influence of change,Being transforms itself without losing its identity or unity. This transfor-mation should be understood in the light of the principles of identity anddifference mentioned earlier. Based on this view, Being passes throughinfinite accidental forms and substantial changes in an evolutionary manner. From this survey of Mulla Sadra’s doctrine of the primacy of Being, we seethat his turn is as significant to Western thought as was Martin Heidegger’s.Unfortunately, Mulla Sadra has received little attention in the West. This, to agreat extent, as Nasr remarks, is due to the fact that the works of this Muslimthinker, unlike those of Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd, were not translated intoLatin.34Mulla Sadra’s ontology is important for understanding the devel-opment of Muslim philosophy in the post Ibn Sinan era. It brings a new philo-sophical insight in dealing with the nature of reality and creates a majortransition from essentialism to existentialism.Mulla Sadra’s ontological turn is dealt with in this book in six chapters.Chapter One is an introduction to the nature of this investigation and outlinesthe conflict between the doctrines of the primacy of Being and the primacy ofessence. Chapter Two explores the philosophy of Suhrawardi and his doctrineof the primacy of essence. It discusses his arguments justifying this doctrineand the influence of the doctrine on the Islamic intellectual life in Isfahan. Italso explains Suhrawardi’s interpretation of the history of philosophy andPlato’s influence on Suhrawardi’s metaphysics, which has great significancefor understanding Mulla Sadra’s ontology and for comparing Mulla Sadra’sontology with that of Heidegger. Chapter Three deals with the development ofthe Isfahan school of philosophical thought during the Safawid dynasty.Mulla Sadra was a student of that school. Chapter Three also explores theideas of thinkers such as Mir Damad, Mir Findiriski and Shaykh Baha’i, theSuhrawardi tradition in the school, the life and philosophical development ofMulla Sadra and the major changes in his metaphysical position, namely histurn to the doctrine of the primacy of Being. The chapter concludes withMulla Sadra’s influence on the subsequent philosophical development inPersia and other parts of the Muslim world, particularly the rise of the philo-sophical schools in Teheran and Sabzawar during the Qajar period.Chapter Four focuses on Mulla Sadra’s ontological turn and his doctrine ofthe primacy of Being. This is compared with the ontological enterprise ofHeidegger. The similarities between them are explained on the ground ofthree points: their criticism of Platonism, the primacy of Being, and the short-comings of the Aristotelian logic and rationalistic discourse for under-standing the meaning of Being. Also explained is how Mulla Sadra’s ontologyIntroduction9"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"differs from that of Heidegger. Chapter Five investigates the nature of trans-substantial change as one of the central doctrines in Mulla Sadra’s ontologyand his interpretation of change as a clear departure from Platonism. Trans-substantial change is also compared with Hegel’s and Bergson’s under-standing of the constant renewal of the world. The religious and philosophicalconsequences of this doctrine and its impact on the human understanding oftruth, values and knowledge are considered. Chapter Six explores Mulla Sadra’s interpretation of knowledge by boththe presence and the failure of the rationalistic apprehension of Being. MullaSadra’s rejection of pure rationality and his reliance instead on intuition ormystic experience for knowing the inner reality of Being is explained. Theanalysis includes the nature and different kinds of intuitive knowledge (al-idrak), beginning from sense-perception to intellectual perception. Twomajor epistemological issues discussed by many Muslim philosophers apartfrom Mulla Sadra are also addressed in this chapter. These are the unity of theintelligent and the intelligible, and God’s knowledge of the world. MullaSadra’s analysis of these issues is a significant part of the chapter.Chapter Seven crystallizes the book and presents the contribution of MullaSadra’s philosophy to the development of intellectual life in the Muslimworld. His significance is seen in terms of his ontology in dealing with thedoctrine of the primacy of Being, the gradations and trans-substantial changeof the modalities of Being, and finally the role of his metaphysics in deter-mining the unity of the intelligent and the intelligible, which makes realityaccessible to the human mind. In interpreting Mulla Sadra’s main philosophical doctrines I have tried tocompare them with philosophical views and doctrines of some Westernphilosophers such as Hegel, Heidegger and Bergson. At a number of placesthe similarity between the existentialist views of this Muslim philosopher andthe ontological enterprise of Heidegger are elucidated. It should also beremembered that Mulla Sadra and these Western philosophers, in particularHeidegger, not only come from different cultural background; their meta-physical objectives will remain parallel. I have used the original works ofMulla Sadra in Arabic and in working on this project over the last two years Ihave benefited from the writing of Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Fazlur Rahmanon Mulla Sadra in English. Although few works are published on Mulla Sadrain English, recently much interest has been shown in rereading of hisphilosophy. In 1913 Max Horten wrote Das Philosophische System vonSchirazi. This was followed by Henry Corbin’s edition of a selection of MullaSadra’s writings in French. Thinkers such as William Chittick and OliverLeaman have contributed articles on Mulla Sadra’s epistemology in theJournal of Transcendent Philosophy, a special issue on Mulla Sadra (Vol. 1,No. 1, June 2000). In 1981 James Morris translated Mulla Sadra’s al-Hikmaal-‘Arshiyyah(The Wisdom of the Throne) into English.

However, the onlysystematic work to date in English is Fazlur Rahman’s The Philosophy ofMulla Sadra(1975).

In 1992 ParvizMorewedge translated Mulla Sadra’s al-Mash‘irinto English, a work thatsummarizes Mulla Sadra’s metaphysical system. An investigation into thephilosophy of this Muslim thinker, as we see, is beset with some difficulties.Mulla Sadra’s major philosophical work Al-Asfar, which presents his entirephilosophical system, has not been translated into Persian and Urdu but notinto English. With the exception of Fazlur Rahman’s work no comprehensivebook on his philosophy is available. In addition to this limitation in accessingMulla Sadra’s philosophy in English, his style of writing is sophisticated andcomplex. It covers a broad area of metaphysics, Gnosticism and theology. Itdeals with the views of Mulla Sadra’s predecessors critically Mulla Sadra’snew philosophical ideas are presented or constructed. Despite these diffi-culties it should be remembered that Mulla Sadra’s philosophy is the productof the sixteenth century but quite relevant to our understanding of reality andcontemporary society. His doctrine of the trans-substantial change and hisviews on novelty and constant transformation of history could play aprofound role on our ethical as well as political life in the Muslim world.

The school of Illuminationism, which is significant for our understandingof Mulla Sadra’s philosophy, was founded by Shahab al-Din Yahya b. Habashb. Amirak Suhrawardi, known also as Shaykh al-Ishraq, the master of illumi-nation. Suhrawardi’s date of birth is not known precisely. We only know thathe was born in Suhraward or ‘Suhrabard’, a Kurdish village between Zenjanand Bijar. According to Mulla Salih Ibrahimi, Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi wasoriginally Kurdish and the nephew of Mulla Omer Suhrawardi, anotherKurdish Muslim scholar from the same village and of Sunni-Islamic origin.Mulla Omer and Shahab al-Din also wrote poetry in Kurdish; some poems ofthe latter were published by Ibrahimi. It is also reported in Nuzat al-arwah erawzat al-afrahby Shams al-Din Shahrazuri that ‘Shuraward’ was a Kurdishvillage.2In the tenth century, the village was destroyed by the Mongols.According to Noldeke and Marquart, its name derived from Suhrab, who wasa Persian governor of Hira.3Today, Suhraward (Suhrabard) is located in themunicipality of Azerbaijan in Iran. For this reason, some people, withoutknowing the ethnic make-up of the region, think that Suhrawardi was origi-nally Turkish or Persian.Shahrazuri states that Suhrawardi was born in 1166 or 1171.4Nasr alsogives two dates. In one of his early works, Nasr says that Suhrawardi was bornin 1153;5later, in his introduction to Opera Metaphysica et Mystical, he indi-cates that Suhrawadi was born in 1171.6After receiving an Islamic education,Suhrawardi travelled through Persia to Anatolia and Syria. He was a contem-porary and classmate of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi; the two had studied underShaykh Mujjad al-Din Jili and later under Zahi al-Din Qari in Isfahan. On oneof his journeys from Damascus to Aleppo, the capital city of the AyyubidSunni dynasty,7Suhrawardi met Malik Zahir, the governor of Aleppo and the12"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"son of Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi, who patronized him and engaged him inconversation on thorny philosophical and theological issues with a cluster ofthe ‘ulama in Aleppo.8Another reason for travelling to Aleppo – a centre ofthe new political conflict between Islam and Christendom – rather than to apeaceful region, might be seen in Suhrawardi’s ethnic affiliation with theAyyubi family.The political situation in Syria at that time could be defined as crucial and inturmoil. The Shi‘ite Muslims who had long ruled Syria and North Africa, partic-ularly Egypt, lost their hegemony to the Sunni Muslims. Salaha al-Din destroyedthe Fatimid Shi‘i dynasty in Egypt and Syria. In addition to this internal conflictbetween Sunnism and Shi‘ism over political hegemony, the Crusaders appearedas an eminent external force against the Muslim world. Salah al-Din Ayyubi,who represented the Sunni political hegemony, was seen as the only one withauthority to protect the interest of Sunni Islamic civilization from these externaland internal rivalries. Under such unfavourable circumstances for the devel-opment of philosophy, it seems that, by travelling to the heart of this turmoil,Suhrawardi chose a wrong direction and time to advocate his philosophicalideas. The Sunni Islamic world, facing threats from Christendom represented bythe Crusaders and from Shi‘ism, was not resilient to change and could nottolerate innovation. The Sunni ‘ulama, considering themselves the guardiansand protectors of Islamic faith and identity, were looking at any philosophicalinclination or intellectual contention with suspicion. Suhrawardi’s philosophicalideas, in the court of Malik Zahir, were seen in this political context; on themwere visited the hostility and rejection of the institution of the ‘ulama. The‘ulamabranded Suhrawardi’s ideas as heretical and asked Malik Zahir to put theyoung philosopher to death. Malik Zahir was reluctant to do this against hismaster and friend, so the ‘ulamaapproached Salah al-Din, who ordered his sonto act. Suhrawardi was finally executed in 1208 at the age of thirty-eight.According to Shahrazuri, there are several accounts of his death. One reports thathe was starved to death in prison. Another states that Suhrawardi himself fasteduntil he died. Some held the view that he was suffocated, executed or thrownfrom the wall of the fortress and then burned.9The term ‘ishraq’, which is Arabic for ‘illumination’, was used beforeSuhrawardi by Ibn Sina in his Mantiq al-Mashriqiyyan, where he talks aboutthe oriental wisdom as a superior source of knowledge to the rationalisticdiscourse. Suhrawardi was aware of the significance of Ibn Sina’s view butbelieved that Ibn Sina was unable to comprehend the importance of orientalcognition as he did not have the proper epistemological tools or access to thesources of ishraqi wisdom (Gnosticism). He states in his treatise Risalehsafari Simurghthat seeking the Truth through rationalistic discourse is likeseeking the sun with a lamp.10In Suhrawardi’s view, the history of philosophy did not begin with Thalesin 600 BC. Instead Hermes is considered by this Muslim thinker to be theIlluminationism and the Primacy of Essence13"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"father of illuminative philosophical thinking or wisdom. Hermes wasfollowed by sages from Greece, Persia and the Muslim world. In Greece, thistype of philosophical thinking came to an end with Aristotle, who replacedthe cognitive tool of illumination with the rationalistic discourse. But the illu-minative philosophy continued to develop in Persia, and after the advent ofIslam was continued by Muslim Sufis such as Dhu al-Nun al-Misri, Abu SalihTustari, Abu Yazid Bistami, Mansur al-Hallaj, Abu Hassan Kharraqain andfinally Suhrawardi himself.What is important for us in understanding the history of philosophydescribed by Suhrawardi and for developing our argument is that this Muslimthinker acknowledged the connection between Plato’s thought and his ownmetaphysics. The depiction of this connection is significant when we try tocompare Mulla Sadra’s metaphysical background and criticism ofIlluminationism and Heidegger’s interpretation of ‘nihilism’ in the West bytracing them back to Plato. To demonstrate similarities between MullaSadra’s opposition to Illuminationism, in particular the doctrine of theprimacy of essence, and Heidegger’s negative attitude towards nihilism, weneed to highlight the relationship between Plato’s metaphysics andIlluminationism. We begin by explaining how Suhrawardi, in his introductionto Hikmat al-Ishraq, refers explicitly to Plato and the place of his ideas in thedevelopment of the illuminative philosophy,In all I have said about the science of lights and that which is not based upon it, Ihave been assisted by those who have travelled the path of God. This science isthe very intuition of the inspired and illumined Plato, the guide and master ofphilosophy, and of those who came before him from the time of Hermes, ‘thefather of philosophy’ upon Plato’s time, including such mighty pillars ofphilosophy as Empedocles, Pythagoras, and others.11It is customary in the history of Western philosophy to begin with Thales (aMilesian philosopher of 640–546 BC) as the father of Western philosophy.To understand the development of Greek philosophy we must also distin-guish between the pre-Socratic and the post-Socratic periods. But forSuhrawardi, philosophy began with Hermes and Plato rather than withThales. For Suhrawardi, this was the demarcation between two stages ofdevelopment in the history of this type of philosophical thinking. Thescience of light or the illuminative philosophy came down from Hermes tothe sages of ancient Iran and Egypt and thence to Plato. Greek, ancientIranian, Egyptian and Islamic sources have become the foundation of thistype of philosophy. In dealing with these historical roots and sources,Suhrawardi mentions the ancient Iranian religion, Zoroastrianism, severaltimes. But as John Walbridge argues, this in no way indicates a revival ofpre-Islamic religious belief or an endorsement of metaphysical dualism inSuhrawardi’s philosophical system.12This Muslim thinker also describes14Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"the original form of Zoroastrianism as monotheism, to which KingGushtasp later introduced dualism.13He believes that Zoroastrianism as areligion is different from the teachings of the Zoroastrian sages that hefollows, such as Kiumarth, Faridun and Kaikhusraw, who guided theircommunity towards the light by their illuminated wisdom, and who were inturn different from the so-called Manichaeans.14As far as Greek thought is concerned, Plato’s metaphysics and his allegoryof the cave were an inspiration for Suhrawardi.15He sees the ascent of thehuman being from the cave towards the light as a real liberation from thedomain of shadows of the contingent world. Attaining the Truth is determinedby this journey of the seeker of the Truth who attempts to liberate him/herselffrom the dogma of the cave and look into the light. In Plato’s philosophy,those who liberate themselves from the shadows of the cave and areunshackled will be able to see the sun. In his short treatise Al-Qissa al-Ghurbat al-Gharbiyyah(Story of the Occidental Exile), Suhrawardi pursuesPlato’s allegory with some modification. In this work, the seeker of the Truth,like the prisoner freed from the cave, must undertake the spiritual journey ofhis/her liberation from the occident, which is the world of darkness andmaterial existence, to the orient, the world of light and archangels. InSuhrawardi’s allegory, human beings are not shackled in a cave but areimprisoned at the bottom of a well and left in total darkness. These prisonerswere originally from Yemen (a land between the occident and the orient of theMuslim world), and were sent into exile to Qirawan, a city in Tunis, in thewest of the orient. Like the prisoner unshackled from the cave, the escapeefrom the well will return to the well after seeing the light of the orient becausehe has not discarded all his bonds. In the context of Plato’s metaphysical analysis, according to Suhrawardi,the rationalistic approach of Aristotle broke the chain of continuity of thePlatonic philosophical tradition. Discursive knowledge and rationalisticthinking replaced intuitive knowledge. For this reason and due to the domi-nance of Plato’s metaphysics in the history of Illuminationist philosophy,thinkers like al-Jurjani define the adherents of Illuminationism as “philoso-phers whose master was Plato’.16In al-Talwihat, Suhrawardi, besidesdiscussing his doctrine of the principality of essence, presents a critical studyof Aristotle’s categories. First he argues that the categories were discoveredby Archytas (a Pythagorean thinker) before Aristotle. Second he reduces theirnumber from ten to four and adds ‘motion’ as a new category.17In this work,Suhrawardi encounters Aristotle (the master of discursive knowledge) in astate between dreaming and being awake; it is in this state that theirdiscussion on the origin of Illuminationism, the distinction betweendiscursive and intuitive knowledge, takes place.18Suhrawardi not only incorporated Plato’s metaphysics into his own but healso considered his philosophy of illumination as the continuation ofIlluminationism and the Primacy of Essence15"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Platonism. He recognizes Plato not as a philosopher but as one of the mastersof Illuminationism:Plato and his companions showed plainly that they believed the Maker of theuniverse and the world of intellect to be the light when they said that the pure lightis the world of intellect. Of himself, Plato said that in certain of his spiritualconditions he would shed his body and become free from matter. Then he wouldsee light and splendour within his essence. He would ascend to that all-encom-passing divine cause and would seem to be located and suspended in it, beholdinga mighty light in that lofty and divine place.19At another place, Suhrawardi compares Plato’s philosophy with the allusionsof the prophets,20and describes himself not as the founder of Illuminationismbut as a follower of masters such as Hermes and Plato.21In classifying seekersof knowledge, Suhrawardi also places Plato among those who possess perfectdiscursive knowledge and illumination. A philosopher like Plato, inpossession of these two faculties of knowledge, is the vicegerent of God and aperson wise enough to be a leader or ruler of society and a philosopher king.By contrast, the rationalist philosophers such as Aristotle, proficient only indiscursive knowledge, are not suitable candidates for such elevated positionsin society.It is worth mentioning that, although it does not have a direct relationshipwith the essence of things, Suhrawardi still considers discursive knowledge tobe one of the cognitive tools. But for Suhrawardi, a true philosopher is onewho is capable, like Plato, of possessing discursive as well as intuitiveknowledge and using both, in particular the latter, for understanding thenature of reality and knowing the Truth. Suhrawardi’s opposition to Aristotle,and to Muslim Peripatetic thinkers such as al-Farabi and Ibn Sina, can thus beelucidated in the light of Aristotle’s metaphysical position, his criticism ofPlato, and his reliance on discursive knowledge in his epistemology.Aristotle’s philosophy is seen as a philosophical tendency hostile towardsPlatonism and as a philosophical position yielding a distorted notion ofreality.Plato assumed that the plurality of individual objects could be unifiedunder common essences or Ideas.22The essences have their own reality asobjective essences rather than mere universal concepts that exist only inthinking. To Plato, referring to the universal concept or quiddity of an objectalso means referring to its objective essence. Besides, essences do not rely onindividual objects to exist, because they are transcendent and spatiallydetached from them. The essences constitute the reality of individual objectsbut do not reside in them in the sensible world. How does the human mind know and reach these transcendent essences?In the Symposium, Plato describes a procedure or ‘itinerary’ for this. Forexample, one can arrive at realizing the essence of ‘beauty’ by ascending16Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"from beautiful objects to the pure notion of beauty and thence to the form ofthis essence, which is universal and self-subsistent.23Individual objects,which are detached from these essences, are objects of ‘opinion’ and ‘sense-experience’. In contrast, the essences are not in the domain of ‘opinion’ and‘sense-experience’ but objects that can be ‘known’. Here and in the Platoniccontext, true knowledge corresponds to the apprehension or intelligibility ofthe essences when the human mind is turned upwards in the method ofascent.24This kind of knowledge and way of knowing became in theRepublic a prerogative of the philosophers who seek to turn their mindsupwards in order to see the universal transcendent essences. A philosophershould not be interested in a multiplicity of individual objects of the sensibleworld but in their unified essences or the source of their existence in the idealworld. For Suhrawardi, this upward turn or the sight of the sun in Plato’stheory of cognition is illumination (al-ishraq) and the source of trueknowledge through which the human mind can apprehend the transcendentreality.There is more than a convergence of views between Platonism andIlluminationism; in my opinion the latter has a parasitical relationship withthe former. Further similarity between these two philosophical schools can befound in Plato’s analogy of the idea of Good with Light. Among all essences,the Form of the Good is both supreme and the source of all other essences.This notion of the Good is also compared to the sun or the ‘Light’, shiningupon all other essences and making them visible and intelligible:This, then, which imparts truth to the things that are known and the power ofknowing to the knower, you may affirm to be the Form of the good. It is the causeof knowledge and truth, and you may conceive it as being known, but whileknowledge and truth are both beautiful, you will be right in thinking it other andfairer than these. And as in the other world it is right to think light and sight sun-like, but not right to think them the sun, so here it is right to think both knowledgeand truth like the good, but not right to think either of them the good. The state ornature of the good must be honoured still more highly.25The Form of the Good is to an extent the foundation of all other essences. Theirexistence and intelligibility are thinkable only in their relation to the Good. Inunderstanding this relationship Heidegger remarks that ‘the highest idea,although itself barely visible, is what makes possible both being and unhid-denness, i.e. it is what empowers being and unhiddenness as what they are. Thehighest idea, therefore, is this empowering; the empowering for being which assuch gives itself simultaneously with the empowerment of unhiddenness asoccurrence.’26This empowering is the characteristic and the essential qualityof the Form of the Good, which corresponds to the symbol of light. Similarlyfor Suhrawardi the world is made up of contingent light, which depends for itsexistence on the ultimate light or the Light of lights (nur al-anwar): ‘AccidentIlluminationism and the Primacy of Essence17"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"light is not light in itself, since its existence is in another. Thus, it can only belight due to another. The incorporeal pure light is light in itself. Therefore,everything that is light in itself is incorporeal pure light.’27The world is indebted to the Light of lights or the form of the Good notonly for being visible and comprehended but also for what it is. The cominginto being and ceasing to be of everything in the contingent world isempowered by the Light of lights. In the realm below the empowering Lightthere are four forms of light: immaterial, luminous, accidents and bodies. Theimmaterial light is the cause of the other three lights and is also a self-conscious substantial light. God, the intellects of the spheres, human intellectand animal soul are all immaterial lights, which cause the other three forms oflight to exist. Since the contingent lights belong to a lower ontologicaldivision, they are less bright. They also share the same essence, as all of themspring from the same source. They are also gradations of the same reality butdifferent in their intensity and perfection in brightness. This ground formaking a distinction between one contingent light and another is not the real-ization of their ‘differentia’ or ‘accidents’. It is due to their rank in the hier-archy of emanation. Two contingent lights are different because they vary inperfection or the intensity of light. Human beings, for example, are moreperfect than animals. They both belong to two different ranks of existence.The vertical emanation from the Light of lights goes from the Intellects of thecelestial sphere to the individualization of light in accidents and bodies.Based on the relationship between the immaterial light and the other threeforms, the immaterial light is divided into dominating and managing light.The former functions like the Platonic Forms and the latter is the individualsoul in an individual body:Even though the managing light comes from one of the exalted dominating lightsand accepts many illuminations, it is not like a dominating light in perfection ofits substance. The dominating light brings into being the managing incorporeallight only due to perfections of the barrier acquired from the mighty lords and inorder to manage it in the way appropriate for controlling barriers of finite power.By this, it strengthens its connection with the barrier.28In explaining this relationship among various forms of light, Suhrawardithinks in line with Plato, but at the same time he does not repeat the Platonicdoctrine of Ideas without alteration. For him, the dominating light isconcerned with species. Every species that exists as a dominating light has auniversal form called ‘Lord of the Species’. These Lords of Species or Formsare not universal essences shared by all particulars. They exist at a higherrealm and are independent of particulars. Their universality is determined bythe same relationship to all particulars of the same species. The Lords ofSpecies are the causes of the particulars and are universals in the sense thatthey have this causal relationship to all particulars of the same species. For18Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"example, the universal Form of ‘cat’ has the same causal relationship to allindividual cats in the material world. This can be seen as a difference betweenSuhrawardi’s understanding of the universal Forms and that of Plato. Anotheressential difference to be noted here is that Suhrawardi, unlike Plato, believesthat the domain of the Forms is beyond the cognitive capacity of reason and isto be apprehended intuitively. In this way, Suhrawardi followed Plato but atthe same time offered his own point of view and contribution to the doctrineof the Forms. He accepts the doctrine but thinks of the Forms as causes ofindividual beings, not as a universal predicate shared by all of them. Thequestion that arises here is how a multiplicity of contingent lights can arisefrom the simple and indivisible nature of the Light of lights.Suhrawardi found a Neoplatonic answer to this question: from the Light oflights emanates the lower levels of contingent lights, the angelic order, andthe archetypes. The Light of lights is the single origin of all things and givesconstant illumination to them. It is the highest in the metaphysical hierarchyof being, not only in terms of rank but also as the most perfect source andorigin of all contingent lights. The emanated realms, unlike the Light oflights, are different in their degree of perfection and remoteness from theirilluminating source. They are either self-subsistent or dependent on some-thing else. In addition to this classification they can be distinguished by theirdegree of self-consciousness. A self-conscious being is either self-subsistent,as in the case of the Light of lights, the angels and the human consciousness,or depends on something other than itself for its self-awareness, as in the caseof stars or fire. Another division of the lights is based on their degree of self-awareness. A light is either self-aware of or obvious to itself. The self-awarelight is either self-subsistent or depends on something other than itself inorder to become aware of itself. The classification continues and the differ-ences between all things at various levels of this hierarchy of light depend onthe intensity of light manifested in each kind of being. But the illuminatingsource or the Light of lights is not affected by this multiplicity of its ownmanifestation and gradation:Multiplicity cannot conceivably result from the Light of lights in its unity, nor canany darkness be conceived to result from a dusky substance or state, nor yet twolights result from the Light of lights in Its unity. Therefore, that which first resultsfrom the Light of lights must be a single incorporeal light. This then cannot bedistinguished from the Light of lights by any dark state acquired from the Light oflights. This would imply the multiplicity of aspects in the Light of lights in contra-diction to the demonstration that the lights, particularly the incorporeal lights, donot differ in their realities. Therefore, the Light of lights and the first light thatresults from it are only to be distinguished by perfection and deficiency.29The descending process of emanation of the multiplicity of contingent lightsfrom a single indivisible source can best be understood against the hierarchyIlluminationism and the Primacy of Essence19"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"of being in the ontological system of other Muslim emanationists such as al-Farabi (c. 870–950). According to this Muslim philosopher, the firstemanation from the ‘One’ was not a multiplicity of contingent beings but thefirst intellect capable of knowing the ‘One’ as well as itself. The secondintellect emanates from the first intellect and the third from the secondintellect, which gives rise to the sphere of the fixed stars. This process ofemanation continues until the emanation of the tenth intellect is reached, andwith it the corresponding spheres of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the sun, Venus,Mercury and the moon. At the lowest level of emanation lies the ‘primematter’. This contains the four elements of water, air, fire and earth. Theseinclude minerals, plants, animals and finally human beings.30Similarly, fromthe Light of lights emanates the first light, and from this the incorporeal lightand barrier. This emanation continues until there are the nine spheres and theseries of lights from which no other incorporeal light emanates. Suhrawardialso believes that emanation is a pre-eternal process because the Light oflights neither changes nor withers away.31His analysis of human existence isalso based on his understanding of reality. As a thinker who believes in thereality of the incorporeal realm, he divides human beings into two parts:incorporeal (soul) and corporeal (body). These two parts represent light anddarkness. Nor is a relationship between them necessary. The incorporeal soul,although attached to the body, is independent and survives without embod-iment. The corporeality of human existence has at the same time anattachment to darkness, which is a barrier that foils the human soul’s access toknowledge of the reality. Identifying the human soul with light and the bodywith darkness represents for Suhrawardi two aspects of human existence,which are essentially distinct and belong to two different ontological ranks.The human soul is also in constant struggle to keep itself aloof from theinfluence of the body in order to reach perfection, which can be obtained bygiving up worldly pleasure and the demands of corporeal life. This is ajourney in human life towards the abode of pure light and the Sufi path of self-purification and elevation.32As mentioned earlier, Suhrawardi acknowledges his debt to Plato, underwhose influence he rejects the question of the primacy of being and treatsbeing as nothing, and develops arguments for the primacy of essence (asalatal-mahiyyah). For him, something exists when its essence becomescognizant; its reality relies on its essence. The arguments in vindication ofthis metaphysical position rotate around the philosophical conviction thatexistence is conceptual and has no reality of its own in the external world. Ithas no representation outside the human mind. Before explainingSuhrawardi’s main arguments it is important to mention some considerationsdiscussed by him in Section Three of the Third Discourse (‘Concerning theIlluminationsit Judgments on Certain Points’) in Hikmat al-Ishraq. Theseconsiderations are:20Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"•Against Muslim Aristotelian–Neoplatonic thinkers he argues that ‘Thereis nothing in existence, which is itself the quiddity of existence; for assoon as we conceive its concept, we may wonder whether or not it hasexistence.’33This will eventually result in an infinite regress, because exis-tence would have another existence and so on.•If we think that essence has existence, then it should have a relation to it.This relation would also need existence, which stands in a relation to theprevious relation and so on. This would continue to infinity.34•If existence were in entities and were not an essence, then it wouldbecome a state in them. In this case existence would become dependent onthem. ‘Thus its locus would be actualized, but it would exist before itslocus. Its locus could not be actualized simultaneously with it, since itslocus would exist with the existence, not by the existence – which isabsurd.’35•According to Muslim Aristotelian–Neoplatonic thinkers, the locus is priorto an accident. Thus, as pointed out by Suhrawardi, the existence would beprior to existence; this is not only absurd, but also impossible.36•Muslim Aristotelian–Neoplatonic thinkers such as al-Farabi and Ibn Sinabelieved that ‘existence’ was added to ‘essence’ of an entity as an accident.But, according to Suhrawardi, if we think of existence as an accident, itshould subsist in its locus. In this case existence would need its locus forits realization. Since the locus is existent, then its subsistence would becircular, and this is again absurd for Suhrawardi.Let us now turn to Suhrawardi’s main argument for the primacy of essence. Inthis argument he tries to prove that existence is either a universal concept or aparticular. If it is a universal concept and shared like any other universalconcept by all particular existents, existence remains in the domain ofthinking as something conceptual. If existence is a particular, it is dependenton its essence. Let us say that ‘existence’ is a universal concept because allthings that exist do so equally – or they share existence. In this case, ‘exis-tence’ as a universal concept becomes a universal nature. But there are otheruniversal concepts such as ‘blackness’ or ‘whiteness’ of the same nature.Could we say that existence, like these universal concepts, is a universalessence? If the answer to this question is ‘yes’, then existence becomes auniversal concept; otherwise we have to think of it as a particular entity.37Ifexistence is thought to be a particular entity, it still remains a mental concept,and essence becomes real in which a particular existence is actualized. Aparticular existence is nothing more than its essence. As Suhrawardi argues,‘existence’ is conceived in respect to a particular existence and the particularexistence is also equivalent to essence. Existence is thus contingent on aparticular existence. To clarify this metaphysical position Suhrawardi states:Illuminationism and the Primacy of Essence21"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Next we argue that if blackness is non-existent, then its existence is not actual.Therefore its existence is not existent, since its existence is also non-existent. Ifwe do intellect existence and judge that it is not existent, then the concept of exis-tence is distinct from the concept of existent. We might say that blackness, whichwe had taken as non-existent, now exists and that its existence was not yet actualbut then becomes actual. If so, the actuality of the existence would not be theexistence itself, and the existence would have existence. This same argumentapplies to the existence of existence, and so on to infinity. But a simultaneousordered infinity of attributes is absurd.38What we understand from this is that ‘existence’ cannot be a primordial onto-logical condition for a thing. That primordial ontological condition is‘essence’, which occupies a primary position on which the existence of allthings relies and which supports the contingency of existence.In Suhrawardi’s philosophy ‘essence’ is also equated with ‘light’. God,who is the Essence of the essences, is the Light of lights. Here we find a luciddistinction between the Light of lights as the cause and empowering light ofall lights and the contingent or caused and empowered lights. The Light oflights cannot be thought of as another contingent light; all contingent lightsare dependent on something other than them to exist and the Light of lights istheir final cause, which has no cause. It is that being that does not fail to existand so is necessary. This argument, which is originally Aristotelian, is alsoused by Muslim theologians and philosophers in a variety of forms to provethe existence of God. The Light of lights provides constant illumination andbrings all contingent lights into existence. These lights are either self-subsistent, for example incorporeal lights, or they are accidental and theirsubsistence relies on something other than themselves.The individual self, which is a contingent light, is more illuminated as itnears its source. This increase in the intensity of illumination occurs with theabolition of the ontological distance between the Light of lights and the self.Suhrawardi calls this proximity to the Light of lights ‘presence’, theawareness of which is ‘knowledge by presence’, which is considered to be themost reliable source of cognition. ‘Knowledge by presence’ or intuitiveknowledge, however, had a significant impact on Mulla Sadra’s episte-mology, which is discussed in Chapter Six.The thinkers who were responsible for the early transmission ofSuhrawardi’s ideas and were known for their writings on Illuminationismwere Shams al-Din Muhammad al-Shahrazuri (d. 1288), Sa‘ad b.

IbnKammunah wrote on Suhrawardi in al-Talwihat, a book studied widely by theadvocates of Illuminationism in Persia.

Itleft a great mark on the development of intellectual life in the Muslim world.Its influence can be found in Persia and the Indian subcontinent to the presentday. The magnitude of this influence will be discussed in the next chapter onthe Safawid period in Isfahan, when Mulla Sadra came under the sway of thisphilosophical tradition at the beginning of his philosophical training andvocation.Illuminationism and the Primacy of Essence23"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEThe School of Isfahan and Mulla Sadra’sDeparture from Suhraward’s TraditionSuhrawardi died young but the impact of his philosophy on Muslim intellectuallife was outstanding. He advocated the doctrine of the primacy of essence andestablished harmony between discursive and intuitive knowledge, with anemphasis on the latter as a reliable source of knowing the Truth. The predomi-nance of Suhrawardi’s philosophy was greatly felt in Persia and his school,namely Illuminationism, flourished in Isfahan during the Safawid dynasty(1051–1732), attracting a number of Shi‘ite thinkers, including Mulla Sadra. Tounderstand the popularity of Illuminationism during that period it is helpful todiscern the origin and development of the Safawid dynasty and to explain whythe Safawid rulers patronized this type of philosophy in their dynasty.The Safawid was originally a Sufi order whose founder, Shaykh Safi al-Din (1252–1334), was a Sunni Sufi master descended from a Kurdish familyin north-western Iran.1Nasr, in his article ‘The School of Isfahan’, does notmention the ethnic and sectarian origin of the order, but he gives the titleArdibili to the founder because the family of Safi al-Din had settled at Ardibiland Shaykh Safi al-Din died there.2At another place, Nasr acknowledges thatthe order belonged originally to Sunni Islam as an offshoot of the Qadiriyyahorder founded in Baghdad.3According to Percy Sykes, however, the dynastytraces its descent from Musa al-Kazim (745–799), the seventh Shi‘i imam forthe Twelvers. Sykes does not say whether this Shi‘i genealogy of the orderwas given by Shaykh Safi al-Din or was fabricated at the later stage of theencroachment of the order into Shi‘i Imamism.The political orientation of the order and the transformation of the sect toShi’i Islam began with Shaykh Junayd (d. 1460), the grandson of Shaykh Safial-Din, and his son ‘Ali (d. 1496). Shaykh Junayd advocated the idea of jihad(holy war) against non-Muslims as well as corrupt Muslim rulers in Persia.He recruited supporters from Turkish and Kurdish tribes and called themQizilbash(those who wore red headgear with twelve gores for the twelveShi‘i imams). But the total conversion of the order to Shi‘i Islam and theestablishment of the dynasty took place at the time of Isma‘il (1487–1524),also known as Shah Isma‘il, the grandson of Junayd who marched on Tabrizin 1501 and designated himself a king (shah).4The conversion of the order byShah Isma‘il, as it is seen in the political history of the order, provided a terrafirmafor consolidating Shah Isma‘il’s own political hegemony. Relying onthe notion of the messianic or the Shi‘i doctrine of the imamate, Shah Isma‘il24"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"claimed to be imam al-muntazr(Awaited One) or the Mahdi. On this matter,Nasr asserts that the veneration of ‘Ali in the inner tendency of the order wasresponsible for this conversion:Both Shah Ni‘mat Allah who came to Persia from Aleppo, and Shaikh Safi al-Dinfrom Ardabil were at first Sufis of Sunni background such as the Shaziliyya andQadiriyya brotherhoods. But the inner belief in the valayatof ‘Ali graduallytransformed the outer form of the orders as well into thoroughly Shi‘i organiza-tions, although the inward structure of these orders, being sufi, remained abovethe Shi‘i–Sunni distinctions.5In my opinion Shah Isma‘il combined political and divine authority byseeking absolute power and devotion from his followers. This claim,however, was challenged by the followers after Shah Isma‘il’s defeat by theSunni Ottoman Empire during the reign of Selim I (r. 1512–1520) at the battleof Chaldiran in 1514.6To neutralize the tension and avoid humiliation beforehis followers the defeated Shah Isma‘il adopted a softer theological positionby making Twelver Shi‘ism the official religion of the state. He also began toforce the Sunni population to convert in the areas he controlled in Persia.Many Shi‘i scholars such as Shaykh ‘Ali b. Abd al-‘Ali Karaki, Shaykh Bahaal-Din ‘Amili and Ni‘mat Allah Jaza’iri were invited from Iraq, Lebanon andBahrain to participate in the establishment of Shi‘i educational institutions inPersia. Further to this, the Safawid state embarked on a plan to eliminate therival sects, in particular those with antagonistic attitude towards Shi‘ism. Themessianic–extremist Shi‘i sects and Sufi orders such as Naqshabandiyyahand Khalwatiyyah were banned; Sunni Muslims and other religious minoritygroups were persecuted. It was during this time that Persia was transformedfrom a predominantly Sunni Islam to a Shi‘i Islamic dynasty.7There were, however, three groups that contributed to the foundation of theSafawid state and its development: the Qizilbash, who represented thepopular Sufi movement; the institution of the ‘ulamaor salaried clergy; andfinally, at the top, the ruler. The first group was gradually suppressed forpolitical reasons and the second group drew closer to the royal court. With theadvent of Shah Tahmasib (1524–1576), the state openly supported the ‘ulamaagainst the Qizilbash and other Sufi orders. Shah Abbas I (1571–1629)recruited many ‘ulamain different administrative positions. But his supportfor the scholars of Gnosticism and real Sufis never ceased. The developmentof philosophy in Isfahan is indebted to Shah Abbas’s patronage of scholars oftheology and Gnosticism. It was during his reign that the philosophy of illu-mination received official recognition and was advocated by some influentialShi‘i thinkers who remained close to the monarch. As we see, on one side theSafawid dynasty stood hostile towards Sunni thought and Sufism, while onthe other side it did not curtail the development of illuminative philosophy ofSuhrawardi and theological debates on various religious matters.8The School of Isfahan and Suhraward’s Tradition25"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"This Shi‘i state, like other Islamic states, was supportive of a philosophicaldiscourse favourable to the metaphysical foundation of its political power.Intellectual endeavour was consequently subject to the favour of despoticrulers who were either for or against it. This was characteristic of the politicalenvironment in which ideas were shaped in the Muslim world. Philosophy,unlike religious discourse, never enjoyed a long-term engagement and rela-tionship to the state and was forced by the clergy to stand outside the educa-tional institutions most of the time. Nevertheless, there were reasons for therevival of Illuminationism during the Safawid dynasty. As mentioned earlier,the Safawid was a gnostic Sufi order that was transformed into a politicalmovement. Unlike other Islamic dynasties it was not based purely on militaryinsurgence. It was expected to incline towards a type of metaphysics thatcould easily be manipulated for political ends. Illuminationism, as AminRazavi remarks, provided such a philosophical foundation for the politicalconvictions of the dynasty.9The contribution of some great Shi‘i thinkerswith political influence was to promote Suhrawardi’s philosophy; this playeda remarkable role in having Illuminationism recognized as an influentialphilosophical trend of the time.During the Safawid dynasty, Muslim thinkers in Persia continued the postIbn Sinan intellectual tradition. They were able to establish systems ofthought that were neither purely philosophical nor gnostic but a combinationof both. They intended to develop a theosophical tradition rather than a ratio-nalistic philosophy based purely on discursive knowledge. Thinkers such asGhyas al-Din Mansur and later Mir Damad interpreted Ibn Sina’s Peripateticdoctrine in the light of the illuminative philosophy of Suhrawardi. Otherthinkers, such as Abd al-Razzaq Kashani, Sa‘ad al-Din Hamuya, Aziz al-DinNasafi, Fakhr al-Din Araqi, Auhad al-Din Kirmani and Abdul Rahman Jami,were influenced by Ibn ‘Arabi’s doctrine of the unity of being. They incorpo-rated this gnostic doctrine into their philosophical systems.10In the fourteenthcentury, Sayyid Haider Amuli, Ibn Abi Jumhur and Rajab Basri, whose theo-sophical doctrines were developed under the influence of Ibn ‘Arabi,contributed to the integration of Gnosticism in Shi‘i Islam during the Safawidperiod. Sayyid Sharif Jurjani and Jalal al-Din Dawani also tried to bridge thegulf between philosophy and theology.11Among these Muslim Shi‘i thinkers, Mir Damad is of great importancebecause, with Mir Findiriski and Shaykh Baha’i, he belonged to the firstgeneration who were the main thinkers behind the establishment of theSchool of Isfahan. The name of this school was employed recently by HenriCorbin, Nasr and Ashtiyani. Corbin includes Mir Damad, Mulla Sadra andQadi Sa‘id Qummin as its main figures. Nasr gives a longer list of names butemphasizes Mir Damad, Mir Findiriski and Shaykh Baha’i as the forerunnersof the school. These three thinkers were also patronized by Shah Tahmasp andShah Abbas, the Safawid ruler. It is reported that Shah Abbas visited them26Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"frequently at their place of residence and developed a kind of friendship withthem.12Mir Burhan al-Din Muhammad Baqir Damad was known as Mir Damadand was also given the title of ‘Third Teacher’ following Aristotle and al-Farabi.13Another title by which he was known was Sayyid al-Afdil, ‘Masterof the Most Learned’.14This Muslim thinker was born in 1561 in Ashtarabad.His father, Mir Shams al-Din, was the son-in-law of Shaykh ‘Ali b. Abd al-‘Ali Karaki, a distinguished Shi‘i cleric (d. 1538) and the author of the theo-logical discoure al-Najmiyyahand several other commentaries on religioussubjects. Shaykh ‘Ali Karaki migrated to Persia after the establishment of theSafawid dynasty and during the reign of Shah Tahmasp (r. 1524–1576)enjoyed patronage and power. Mir Damad gained his education in the majorShi‘i cities of Persia. He studied philosophy, transmitted sciences (‘ulum al-naqliyyah) and natural sciences and closely studied Ibn Sina’s philosophicaltexts. He became the leading authority on philosophy, theology, jurisprudenceand natural sciences. During the time of Shah Abbas he went to Isfahan toteach, where he attracted a large number of disciples. Among them wereMulla Khalil Qazwini, Sayyid Ahmed ‘Alawi, Qutb al-Din Ashkiwari andMulla Sadra.15Mir Damad wrote various religious and philosophical titles inArabic and Persian; for example Qabasat, Taqdisat, Taqim al-imam, al-Siratal-mustaqimand al-Ufuq al-mubinwere in Arabic. He also wrote JazaratandSirat al-muntahain Persian. These works included discussions on philo-sophical matters such as being, time, eternity, the relationship between eternaland temporal, creation and God’s knowledge of particulars. He also wrotepoems under the pen name Ishraq. At the age of twenty, Mir Damad wasrecognized as a philosopher and was admired by people in the intellectualcircles of Mashad and Isfahan. In 1631 he died on his way to Kerbela and wasburied in Najaf, a city in present-day Iraq.It should be remembered that philosophical discourse in the Muslim worldhas always been looked at with suspicion. The powerful, dogmatic and politi-cally greedy clergy thought of philosophy as poisonous to the religious mind.During the Safawid dynasty, the hostility towards intellectual discoursecontinued and the Shi‘i clergy, like the Sunni clergy, expressed no sympathywith philosophy. The establishment of the School of Isfahan can be attributedless to intellectual tolerance and freedom of expression in the Safawiddynasty than to other factors such as the political position and power of thefamilies of Muslim thinkers like Mir Damad and Mulla Sadra in Shiraz andIsfahan. Mir Damad’s father and grandfather were among the influential Shi‘iclergy of their time and enjoyed the patronage and support of the Safawidrulers. Mir Damad also was known for his devotion and religiosity. He washighly revered by the ‘ulamaand by the seekers of irfan (Gnosticism). Hisstyle of writing was also complicated and difficult for the clergy to under-stand, particularly those who were not familiar with theosophy andThe School of Isfahan and Suhraward’s Tradition27"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Gnosticism. Nor should we forget Shah Abbas’s personal interest in intel-lectual debate and philosophy and his encouragement of learning and hisfriendship with Mir Damad, Mir Findiriski and Shaykh Baha’i. All thesefactors contributed to the establishment and development of the School ofIsfahan and rescued its founders from persecution by the clergy.Mir Damad’s philosophy is characterized by a fusion of Suhrawardi’sIlluminationism and Ibn Sina’s ontology. For him, there is a clear distinctionbetween Hellenistic philosophy and Islamic thought. Islamic thought is thesource of illumination and theosophy, whereas Hellenistic philosophy repre-sents rationalistic discourse. Illuminationism, as explained by Suhrawardi inHikmat al-Ishraq (see Chapter Two), was the continuation of a philosophicaltradition from Hermes to Plato and then to Eastern thinkers such as himself.16Mir Damad, however, kept Platonism outside Hellenistic thought, becausePlatonism belonged to the philosophical tradition of the illuminativephilosophy. Nasr also mentions that eternal creation, huduth-i dahri, is thecentral idea of Mir Damad’s thought.17This idea is better understood in lightof Mir Damad’s division of essence based on Suhrawardi’s metaphysics,which eventually leads to different concepts of time. Admittedly, in dealingwith the idea of eternal creation, Mir Damad endeavoured to solve the contra-dictions between the views of Muslim philosophers on creation. He putforward an answer to the question of whether the world was created in time oris eternal. This issue was discussed from the beginning of the rise of Muslimphilosophy by thinkers such as al-Kindi, al-Farabi and Ibn Sina. SomeMuslim philosophers stated that the world was created in time, while othersheld that it was eternal. The second view was also attacked by al-Ghazali inhis Tahafut al-falasifa; he branded it heretical. Mir Damad took another meta-physical position by synthesizing these two antagonistic claims and advo-cating the idea that the world was eternally created. For him, the essence ofGod is absolutely simple and transcends all distinctions, limitations and qual-ities. It is the source of divine attributes, which are one with it and at the sametime different. The divine essence and divine attributes enjoy a necessary andunchangeable relationship, which is eternal or sarmadi, having neitherbeginning nor end.18The divine attributes are similar to the universal Forms in the ideal world inPlato’s metaphysics. Even they have a similar relationship to the particularobjects of the material world: they are unchangeable but are capable of gener-ating change. The relationship between this unchangeable sphere of thedivine attributes and the changing world leads to the rise of another form oftime called dahr. The third form of time, called zamanby Mir Damad, is themeasure of the quantitative change in the material world.19What is the signif-icance of this division of time? How does Mir Damad solve the contradictionbetween the views of those who advocate the paradigm of creation in time andthose who believe in the eternity of the world?28Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Mir Damad’s solution to the relationship between dahrand zaman is thatthe two forms of time belong to two different spheres of existence. The formertime is for the unchangeable and necessary relationship between the divineattributes and the material world. For this Muslim thinker, as for Plato, thematerial world is distinct from the divine attributes (or the universal Forms inthe ideal world). The material world also relies on the divine attributes for itsexistence. The creation of the world is, therefore, preconditioned by thedivine attributes, but it did not occur in the form of time called zaman (time asa quantitative change), because zamancannot exist without the materialworld or before the creation of material objects. The world, which exists inzamanand depends on the divine attributes, is also outside the sphere of dahr.Conversely, the divine attributes are in dahrbut not in zaman. Something thatexists in zamanis non-existent in dahr, and vice versa. Above them, sarmador the temporality of the divine essence transcends both forms of time. Thedivine essence is neither in dahrnor in zamanbut is aloof from them and theirinfluence.20Divine essence is the source of everything and everything asessence is identified with light. Following Suhrawardi’s doctrine of theprimacy of essence, and thinking of everything in the world as the originatedlight, Mir Damad believes that the essence is the only reality and existence isan accident. Accepting the emanationist doctrine of Neoplatonism, hebelieved that the world came into existence in the process of emanation. Thisprocess is characterized by a descending and ascending order. From thedivine essence emanated the divine attributes or the archetypal lights, and theuniversal intellect was the first component of this emanation. From thisemanated the heavenly soul, of which the universal soul is a member. Fromthe universal soul emanated the natural souls. In the final stage, matteremanated. This process is described as a descending order from the most tothe least perfect form of existence. At the lowest stage of emanation theprocess takes an ascending order from minerals to animals and the humanspecies.21Sufism also inspired Mir Damad. In Jadhawat, he describes theascending journey undertaken by the seekers of redemption to employ intu-itivemystic knowledge (‘irfan) for understanding the Truth and to devote timeto serious spiritual contemplation.Another Muslim thinker who played a role in Mulla Sadra’s intellectuallife in Isfahan, and who was a member of the School of Isfahan, was MirAbdul Qasim Findiriski (d. 1641). Mir Findiriski taught philosophy, mathe-matics and medicine. Many of his students, for example Rafi‘a Gailani, AqaHusayn Kundsari, Mulla Muhammad Baqir Sabzwari and Mulla Rajab ‘AliTabrizi, became well-known scholars. However, according to Nasr, it isdebatable whether Mulla Sadra studied under him. Mulla Sadra, however,was introduced to Mir Findiriski and the two knew one another well. MirFindiriski lived longer and died in the same year as Mulla Sadra or one yearlater.22Mir Findiriski was acquainted with non-Islamic religious and philo-The School of Isfahan and Suhraward’s Tradition29"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"sophical traditions in India and Persia. He travelled to India and studiedHinduism as well as Zoroastrianism. He wrote Usul al-fusulon Indianphilosophy and a commentary for the Persian translation of the Yoga Vasisthaby Nizam al-Din Paniputi. He was also interested in the fine arts and wroteSana‘iyyah, a treatise on the arts and sciences in society.23He wrote poetryand lived simply, mixing with the common people and identifying with them.Nasr narrates a story from Riyad al-aarifinthat Mir Findiriski’s attitudetowards the common people annoyed Shah Abbas. One day Shah Abbas said,‘I hear some of the leading scholars and sages have been attending cock-fights in the bazaar.’ Mir Findiriski, realizing that the remark was meant forhim, replied, ‘Your majesty, rest assured, I was present but I saw none of the‘ulamathere.’24Another important figure of the first generation of scholars of the School ofIsfahan was Shaykh Baha al-Din ‘Amili, known also as Shaykh Baha’i. Hisfather Shaykh Husayn, the son of Shaykh Abdul Samad ‘Amili, was origi-nally an Arab from Lebanon, and was sent at the age of thirteen to Persia. Hebecame one of the leading theologians and jurists of his time, a Sufi, a poet,and the leader of the ‘ulamain Isfahan.25He was also a close friend of MirFindiriski and Mir Damad. The friendship between these three thinkers isrevealed in a fresco in the ruins of a Safawid royal building in Isfahan.This fresco depicts a famous story, according to which one day Mir Damad andtwo of his prominent contemporaries, Shaykh Baha’i and Mir Findiriski, weresitting in a royal hall, engaged in a philosophical discussion. Suddenly a lion thathad escaped from the royal zoo enters the hall. The fresco depicts Shaykh Baha’ias collecting himself with signs of fear on his face, Mir Damad as prostrating ingratitude, and Mir Findiriski as utterly indifferent to the lion’s presence. Thethree distinguished friends were later obliged to provide an explanation of theirimmediate reactions. Shaykh Baha’i is reported to have said that by the power ofreason he knew that unless the lion was hungry, it would not attack him, and yetinstinctively he was moved to protect himself. Mir Damad explained that, beingthe descendant of the Prophet, he knew that the lion would not attack him, so heprostrated himself and thanked God for being a descendant of the Prophet. AndMir Findiriski is reported to have said that he mastered the terrifying beast by thepower of his inner serenity and self-control.26This story, besides disclosing the friendship between these three thinkers, isindicative of the three forms of discourse, namely rational thinking, doctrinalfaith and mystical tendency, combined in the intellectual tradition of theSafawid period. The writings of Shaykh Baha’i on theology and astronomy,and his commentaries on the Qur’an and on Arabic grammar were widelyused in Persia. He wrote poems under the influence of Rumi (1207–1273), aPersian Sufi and poet and the founder of the Mawlawiyyah Sufi order.27Likehis two friends, Shaykh Baha’i was Gnostic and believed that intuitiveknowledge was superior to discursive or rationalistic knowledge. Needless to30Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"say, these three thinkers played a remarkable role in the flourishing of theSchool of Isfahan. The theosophical activities of the school attracted manystudents from other cities in Persia; Mulla Sadra belonged to its second gener-ation of students.Mulla Sadra (Sadr al-Din Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. Yahya ShiraziQawami), also known as Sadr al-Muta’allihinand Akhund, was born inShiraz. Although the exact date of his birth is unknown he was probably bornin 1572 because it is recorded that he died in 1640 at the age of seventy on hisseventh pilgrimage to Mecca. He was buried in Basra, a city in southern Iraq.His father, Mirza Ibrahim b. Yhya Qawami, was a religious scholar and aShiraz noble. He was also said to have held a ministerial post in thegovernment of Fars province. Shiraz was the capital city of Fars, and, likeIsfahan, was well known for its cultural and educational tradition. MullaSadra, being the only child of a wealthy, educated and politically powerfulfamily, received the best education possible under the tutelage of his father.Later, after the death of his father in 1587, the adolescent decided to go toIsfahan to pursue his religious studies.28The intellectual life in Isfahan, inparticular under the influence of Shaykh Baha’i and Mir Damad, enabledMulla Sadra to develop a keen interest in philosophy and Gnosticism (‘irfan).He studied the transmitted sciences (‘ulum al-naqliyyah) with Shaykh Baha’iand philosophy with Mir Damad. According to Mulla Sadra’s confession in al-Masha‘ir, he was a followerof Suhrawardi’s metaphysics and advocated the doctrine of the principality ofessence.29His subsequent dissatisfaction with this philosophy, however,suggests that the foundation of his conviction was not firm. His philosophicalinterest changed from the primacy of essence to the primacy of being. Hebecame more concerned with Ibn Sina’s ontology, and later in his book Tarhal-kawnayn he engages himself with Ibn ‘Arabi’s doctrine of the Unity ofBeing.30But the change in Mulla Sadra’s thinking was received with hostilityby the ‘ulamain Isfahan. Some interpreted Ibn ‘Arabi’s doctrine of the Unityof Being as the identification of God with nature, or belief in an immanentGod, contrary to the concept of the transcendent God accepted by themajority of Muslims. Also, the philosopher Ibn ‘Arabi belonged to the Sunnitheological tradition and was venerated by some Sunni Sufi orders, forexample the Naqshabandiyyah, who were hostile towards Shi‘ism. This maybe seen as one of the reasons contributing to the marginalization of Ibn‘Arabi’s theosophy by the Shi‘i ‘ulamaand to the condemnation of his meta-physical views as heretical.For Ibn ‘Arabi, the ‘Unity of Being’ means that there is only one Being, andexistence is nothing but the manifestation or outward radiance of that OneBeing.31In this regard, being rather than quiddity becomes the ruling prin-ciple of and reason for the existence of everything. Being is also one andmanifests itself at all ranks of existence. Apparently, this multiplicity is notThe School of Isfahan and Suhraward’s Tradition31"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"the negation of unity but gradations of the manifestation of the unity. WilliamChittick, in Ibn ‘Arabi’s Metaphysics of Imagination, tries to explicate themeaning of this doctrine, first by relating the ‘Unity of Being’ to ‘theprofession of God’s Unity’ (al-tawhid) in Islam, and second by making adistinction between this Sufi doctrine and pantheism in occidentalphilosophy. It is noteworthy that the concept of the unity of God (al-tawhid) isdistinct in connotation from the concept of the Unity of Being (wahdat al-wujud). The latter identifies God with Being or renders God and Being assynonymous. The Qur’anic concept of the Unity of God does not mean thatnothing other than God exists. It is a simple denial of the polytheism that wasa common belief among some Arab tribes of the pre-Islamic period: ‘YourGod is One God. There is no god but He, the Compassionate, the Merciful’;32‘Allah bear witness that there is no god but He, and so do the angels and menof learning. He upholds justice. There is no god but He, the Mighty and WiseOne.’33The statement “There is no God but Allah” (la ilaha ila Allah) vividlyexpresses the existence of one God. It stresses monotheism and rejects otherdeities beside Allah. The advocates of the Unity of Being altered the first partof this statement ‘There is no God . . .’ (la ilah) to ‘There is no being . . .’ (lamaujud). The original Qur’anic verse is the denial of polytheism, and the Sufiversion of the unity is an assertion that there is no existence except God,which is an emphasis on the immanence of God rather than His transcen-dence. Fariduddin al-Attar (1119–1230) illustrated this unity by the analogyof water, saying that: ‘Water is water in the boundless ocean; and in the jugtoo it is the same water.’34Again for al-Attar, that which unites the multipleparticularization of Reality is being and not quiddity. Likewise all the variousgradations of being such as human beings, animals, trees and so on enjoy thisunity. In Fusus al-Hikam, Ibn ‘Arabi also considered God to be the totality ofbeings: ‘God, by virtue of being, is the same as the things that are, becausethere is no existence other than His Being.’35William Chittick’s distinction between the Unity of Being and pantheismin occidental philosophy is not convincing. In my opinion these two doctrinesare similar in several ways. Both of them put away duality without insistingon the identification of God with the world. For Spinoza, one of the advocatesof pantheism in the West, everything exists through the ‘Substance’, andbeings are particularizations of the manifestation of the attributes ofSubstance. Meanwhile, Substance is, and at the same time is not, a being:‘God (Deus) I understand to be a being absolutely infinite, that is a substanceconsisting of infinite attributes, each of which expresses eternal and infiniteessence.’36He adds: ‘Whatever is, is in God, and nothing can exist or beconceived without God.’37Spinoza rejects the notion of transcendent God; forhim, God’s causality is immanent causality, in the sense that God is anindwelling power, but is not identical with his creation or gradations. It is truethat Spinoza’s concept of God as the only Reality (which is also the view of32Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"the advocates of the doctrine of the Unity of Being) can be mistaken for theidentification of God with nature, but nature for Spinoza is one of the infiniteattributes of God. Furthermore, Spinoza makes a distinction between naturanaturans and natura naturata, an indication of a certain self-differentiation inGod, implying two distinguishable though inseparable aspects of the samereality.38In the face of the hostility from the official ‘ulama, Mulla Sadra was leftwith two options: to defend his philosophical position or to retreat frompublic life. He chose the second and in 1610 left Isfahan for isolation inKahak, a village near Qum. According to Fazlur Rahman, there was more tothis intense opposition and criticism. In fact, the ‘ulamawere offended byMulla Sadra’s philosophical ambition. This is shown by the apology offeredby the publisher in the introduction to al-Asfarstating that the philosopher’sideas in the work represent nothing to do with religious essence.39It is alsoreported that Mulla Sadra was critical of the official ‘ulamaand attacked themfor using their political position for worldly and material gains. He calledthem ignorant of the states and stations of the human soul. His relationshipwith and attitude towards the institution of the ‘ulamacan be described asaggressive and un-compromising.40He removed himself from public life for adecade, and focused on strengthening the foundation of his philosophicalthought and spiritual life. This period of solitude and retreat from public lifewas the most fruitful time in the intellectual development of Mulla Sadra: ‘Hewas, therefore, in search of a method that would give him certainty and wouldtransform rational propositions into experienced truth.’41His intellectual situ-ation, as Fazlur Rahman describes it, was similar to that of al-Ghazali andalso of Descartes (1596–1650) when the latter was writing the Meditations.The difference was in al-Ghazali’s fierce opposition to philosophy andDescartes’s reliance on rationalistic discourse. Mulla Sadra neither tried tobase truth on dogmatic theology nor accepted the validity of rational prin-ciples beyond doubt and limitation. Not much is known about Mulla Sadraduring his stay in Kahak, but it is obvious that, although he was forced tochoose solitude, this period in his life was significant for the development ofa new philosophical ground and for his breaking away from Suhrawardi’smetaphysical tradition.42He refers to this in al-Masha‘ir, where he describesthe shift from Suhrawardi’s doctrine of the primacy of essence to the doctrineof the primacy of Being as turning away from the ‘darkness of illusion’ to thedaylight:In the past, I used to be firm on the defence of the principality of essence, makingexistence a [mentally dependent] abstract entity, until my God guided me andshowed me his proof. It became clear to me that the issue is opposite of what hasbeen conceived and determined.

Existences are genuine [deter-minate] realities and essences are the eternal ‘thisnesses’ which have neverinhaled the perfume of real existence at all. These existences are merely the raysand reflected lights of The True Light and of the Eternal Existence. Exalted BeHis Sublimity! However, each of them has essential predicates and contains intel-ligible concepts called essences.43This confession is the confirmation of Mulla Sadra’s turn from the philo-sophical position of essentialism and his departure from Illuminationism,which affirms the primacy of essence and the nullity of being. It is the totalconversion from the metaphysical position of Suhrawardi and his ishraqifollowers to a position where being becomes primary. In this new philo-sophical position, essence rather than being is considered predicated orconceptual. This turn is seen by Mulla Sadra as a departure from the ‘darknessof illusion’ to the ‘light of the day’, which in my opinion has Platonic over-tones. It resembles the journey of a liberated prisoner from the cave towardsthe light of the sun.In 1625, at the age of fifty-three and having spent more than a decade insolitude, Mulla Sadra decided to return to his own city, Shiraz, on the requestof the governor of Fars, Allahwirdi Khan (d. 1613) to teach in a religiousschool (madrasa) that he had recently established. The philosopher resumedteaching and writing and trained a number of notable disciples, among them‘Abdul Razzaq al-Husayn Lahiji and Muhammad al-Murthada, known also asMulla Muhsin Fayd Kashani and Hakim Mulla Muhammad Aqa Jani. Lahijiis also known as Fayyadh. He married Um Kalthum, the eldest daughter ofMulla Sadra who was also a scientist and poetess. Lahiji studied in Mashadand travelled to Qum where he met Mulla Sadra and became his student. Hehas written on philosophy and theology. His main works include Shawariq al-ilham, Gohar murad, a commentary on Suhrawardi’s al-Nurand Sharhiisharat. Faydh Kashani was an expert on Islamic jurisprudence, hadith(theTradition of the Prophet Muhammad), Gnosticism and ethics. He also studiedunder the instruction of Mulla Sadra in Qum and travelled to Shiraz with hismaster and married his daughter (Zubaydah). Fayd Kashani returned to hisown town, Kashan, where he established a school to teach philosophy andtheology. He wrote Gnostic poems and a number of books in Arabic. Amongthem are Mafatih, al-Wafi, Usul al-ma‘arifand al-Mahajj al-bayza. MullaMuhammad Aqa Jani is known for his commentary on Mir Damad’s book al-Qasabat.Mulla Sadra’s philosophical development can be divided into threeperiods: in the first period he studied in Isfahan with Shaykh Baha’i and MirDamad and came under the influence of Illuminationism. Mulla Sadradescribes this period in al-Asfaras a time of intensive research and investi-gation of the ideas of Greek philosophers, of Muslim Peripatetic Neoplatonicthinkers such as al-Farabi and Ibn Sina, of Muslim philosophers from Spain34Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"(al-Andalus) represented by Ibn Bajja, Ibn Tufayl, Ibn Rushd and Ibn ‘Arabi’stheosophy, and of the wisdom of the Illuminationists.44In al-Masha‘irthisperiod of his intellectual development is identified with disillusionment withthe doctrine of the primacy of essence. It was also at this time that MullaSadra faced hostility from the ‘ulamain Isfahan. The second period, inKahak, is characterized by deep philosophical meditation and solitude. Thethird period was marked by his return to society and the commitment to writeand teach in Shiraz, which he did until his death. Although these three periodsare interconnected and equally important for understanding his philosophy,the second and the third represent Mulla Sadra’s authentic way of under-standing reality on a new philosophical ground and the maturity of histhinking. His metaphysical position designates not only a conversion but alsoa new beginning or a new episode in Islamic philosophical tradition in which‘Being’ is not the needfulness of essence; rather, it is the ground withoutwhich nothing is thinkable.Although no definitive chronological order has been established for MullaSadra’s writings, a list of thirty-three treatises on religion and philosophy isprovided by Shaykh Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar in his introduction toMulla Sadra’s al-Asfar.45Nasr listed forty-six works of Mulla Sadra and sixtreatises whose authorship remains uncertain.46Professor S. M. Khameneiprovided a list of thirty-nine works.47Abu Abdullah al-Zanjani also listedtwenty-six philosophical works by Mulla Sadra in hisLife and MainPhilosophical Teaching of the Great Iranian Philosopher Sadr al-Din al-Shirazi.48Since Mulla Sadra’s ontology is our primary interest, the presentbook deals with the writing of the third period of the philosopher’s life.Nevertheless, it should be remembered that even his religious treatises, suchas his commentaries on the Qur’anic verses, are related to his philosophicalconviction. His major philosophical work and the fountainhead of his thoughtis Al-Hikma al-muta‘aliyah fi al-asfar al-‘aqliyyah al-arba‘a, known also asal-Asfar(it is referred to in this book as al-Asfar).49This work was firstpublished in four volumes in 1865, with a commentary by Mulla HadiSabzawari on three volumes. The most recent edition, by Rida Lutfi, waspublished in nine volumes in 1958. It was also published in Teheran with aPersian commentary by Ayatullah Abdulla Jawadi Amili in 1989. One ofMulla Sadra’s early works before al-Asfarwas Tarh al-kawnayn, which waswritten under the influence of Ibn ‘Arabi’s pantheistic philosophy and markedthe beginning of Mulla Sadra’s move away from Suhrawardi’s philosophicaltradition; this work was also branded as heretical by the institution of ‘ulamain Isfahan. The book was later published under the title Risalat seryan al-wujud. Other important philosophical works include al-Masha‘ir, which is asummary of Mulla Sadra’s philosophical project in al-Asfarand waspublished in 1897.

Thisbook was also published in Tunisia in 1972 by Nur al-Din al-Ali, and by theIranian Academy of Philosophy in Teheran in 1975. The book has two mainsections: the knowledge of God and Resurrection. In the last part of thesection on Resurrection under the title ‘Prophecy’, Mulla Sadra deals with therelationship between religion and politics. Al-Shawahid al-Rububiyyahis asummary of his teachings and was published for the first time in 1869. It isconsidered to be his last work.50The book was recently edited by Jalal al-DinAshtyani and was published with Mulla Hadi Sabzawari’s commentary in1967. A collection of his treatises was published in 1996 under the titleMajmu‘a rasa’ile-falsafi Sadr al-muta’ahilin, with an introduction in Persianby Hamid Naji Isfahani. This collection includes important philosophicaltreatises by Mulla Sadra such as Risalat itihad ‘aqil e ma‘qul, Risalat isalatja‘il al-wujudand Risalat shawahid al-rububiyyah.Mulla Sadra’s major philosophical work, Al-Hikma al-muta‘aliyah fi al-asfar al-‘aqliyyah al-arba‘a, or al-Asfar(The Transcendent PhilosophyConcerning the Four Intellectual Journeys of the Soul), stands as the mostvaluable philosophical product. It is a work that has remained unknown to agreat extent in the West. This work not only contains Mulla Sadra’s philo-sophical system but presents his rich understanding and evaluation of theearlier Muslim philosophical, theological and Sufi traditions. The title of thiswork indicates four intellectual journeys, which lead human existence fromthe lowest to the highest rank. These journeys complete one another anddescribe Mulla Sadra’s philosophical system. The four intellectual journeysare:•A journey from creation to the Truth or Creator•A journey from the Truth to the Truth•A journey that stands in relation to the first journey because it is from theTruth to creation with the Truth •A journey that stands in relation to the second journey because it is fromthe Truth to the creation.36Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The first journey, from creation to the Creator, deals with general principles ofphilosophy or rather metaphysical questions in order to found the tran-scendent philosophy as a divine science. This journey also addresses philo-sophical issues such as the definition and meaning of philosophy, the primacyof Being over essence, the gradation of Being, the trans-substantial change(al-Haraka al-jawhariyyah), Platonic ideal forms, time, and the dichotomy ofthe subject–object relationship. The second journey represents Mulla Sadra’snatural philosophy and his criticism of Aristotle’s doctrine of the categories. Itexplains the existence of natural entities, matter and forms, substance andaccident and the hierarchy of the natural beings in the world. It includes MullaSadra’s views on the problem of the creation ex nihiloand the eternity of theworld. It explores the views of the Greek philosophers such as Thales,Anaximenes, Empedocles, Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle. At the end of thisjourney Mulla Sadra discusses the relationship between nature and its meta-physical principles. He advocates his own opinion of change as thecontinuous renewal of the world. In the third journey, Mulla Sadra constructshis own theological ideas or a divine science in a particular sense. It includesthe nature of God’s existence, divine unity and attributes, God’s knowledgeof the world, good and evil and the divine law. He also gives different proofsfor the existence of God, God’s knowledge of the world, the nature of divinewill, and the role of love (ishq) in the evolutionary process of change. Thefourth journey is the end of the intellectual progress of Mulla Sadra where heexplains his own understanding of rational psychology and eschatology. Itbegins with a discussion on different types of the soul, the proofs for its exis-tence, and the possibility of the separation of the soul from the corporealworld. Mulla Sadra also deals critically with the doctrine of the transmi-gration of the soul. He explains the condition of the human souls who residein heaven and hell quoting from Ibn ‘Arabi’s al-Futuhat al-makiyyah at theend.These four intellectual journeys in al-Asfarare not only descriptive ofMulla Sadra’s philosophical ideas, but also critical of almost all views held byhis predecessors. Fazlur Rahman describes this style of Mulla Sadra as hyper-critical because all alternative solutions to the philosophical problems arerejected; meanwhile the new solutions he suggests seem not to be essentiallydifferent or in disagreement with those of his predecessors. For example, inhis discussion on eschatology he rejects al-Ghazali’s solution but his ownsolution on physical resurrection is not distinguishable from that offered byal-Ghazali. The only texts and thinkers that did not come under Mulla Sadra’scritical scrutiny were the foundation texts of Islam, the views of the Shi‘iimams, and Ibn ‘Arabi.51The third period of Mulla Sadra’s intellectual development gave rise to anew type of ontology based on the doctrine of the primacy of Being. Thisontology, although it had similarities with Ibn Sina’s ontology and IbnThe School of Isfahan and Suhraward’s Tradition37"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"‘Arabi’s theosophy, offered a new philosophical foundation distinct from thatof Illuminationism. Although not recognized immediately by the intellectualcircle of its time, Mulla Sadra’s philosophical achievement graduallyinscribed its effect in the Muslim philosophical tradition, particularly duringthe Qajar dynasty. Today it is almost impossible to understand the devel-opment of Muslim philosophy without understanding Mulla Sadra’s onto-logical enterprise and his influence in the Persian-speaking world.The influence of Mulla Sadra’s transcendent philosophy and the doctrineof the primacy of Being was felt later in the post Isfahan era. This era is char-acterized by the political changes to Shi‘ite Islamic power after the collapseof the Safawid dynasty in 1732 and the shift of the centre for Islamic philo-sophical studies from Isfahan, capital of the Safawids, to Teheran followingthe establishment of the Qajar in 1779 by Agha Muhammad Khan.52TheSafawid dynasty witnessed the culmination of the Shi‘ite political and philo-sophical fusion, but it remained a target of sectarian antagonism by the Sunnineighbouring political hegemony and tribes. It is reported that Mir Vais, aSuuni Muslim leader of the Ghilzai tribe in Qandahar, travelled throughIsfahan on his way to Mecca in 1707. He collected some material containingmatters repugnant to Sunni Islam. After showing them to the Sunni ‘ulamainMakkah he obtained a fatwa(religious verdict) from them authorizing jihad(holy war) against the Shi‘ites and their dynasty in Isfahan. The holy warbegan with an attack on the Shi‘ite minority in Qandahar and ended with thefall of Isfahan in 1722. In 1723 another fatwawas issued against the Shi‘itesby the Shaykh al-Islam (of the chief ‘ulama) in Istanbul,53in which it wasstated that the blood of male Shi‘ites was to be shed and even their womenand children to be taken captive.54In 1743, in this hostile atmosphere, NadirShah tried to promote a revised form of Shi‘ite Islam. He sponsored a meetingbetween Shi‘ite and Sunnite ‘ulamain Najaf and later succeeded in havingthe Shi‘ites recognized as the followers of the Ja‘afari School of law(mazhab), the fifth Islamic school of law, by the Ottoman empire.Unfortunately Nadir Shah was assassinated soon after this achievement.55The Qajar dynasty, unlike the Safawid, was characterized by constantinternal tension between the political hegemony of the monarch and the insti-tution of the ‘ulama. The Qajar monarchs did not claim religious authority forthemselves through alleged imamate descent. They, however, sought thefavour of some ‘ulamaby patronizing the Shi‘ite holy shrines of the imamsand offering other services.56The Qajar monarchs’ alienation of the official‘ulamafrom the political hegemony and the tenuous relationship between thestate and religious authority made the ‘ulamastronger as an opposition so thattheir religious actions were intensified politically in the community. Variousreligious schools were established for promoting religious studies. Sufiorders such as Shaykhis, Ni‘mat Allahi, Zahabis and Khaksar gained popu-larity.57The Shaykhi order eventually became the birthplace of the Babi38Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"movement with its doctrine of the messianic return of the hidden imam,which later developed into Baha’ism.58The ‘ulamastressed the externaldimension and rituals of the faith in light of the instructions of the imams,while the Sufi movement justified the significance of the internal dimensionof the faith, but again for its effectiveness turned to the teachings of theimams.Parallel to this development in the Qajar period, the teaching of MullaSadra’s philosophy added another element of diversity to the cultural progressof Shi‘i Islam. The school of Isfahan, where Mulla Sadra studied under thedirection of Mir Damad, Mir Findiriski and Shaykh Baha’i, was dominatedby the ‘Essentialism’ of the ishraqimetaphysical tradition of Suhrawardi. Bycontrast, the philosophical school of Teheran flourished under the sway ofMuslim ‘Existentialism’ or the metaphysical tradition of Mulla Sadra. Thismetaphysical tradition became ‘central to the intellectual life of Qajar Persiaand was of great importance not only for those who considered themselves ashis followers, but even by those who opposed him, as is seen in the writings ofShaykh Ahmad Ahsa’i, the founder of the Shaykhi movement and SayyidMuhammad the Bab, the founder of Babism.’59Although the school ofTeheran was founded at the end of the eighteenth century with the advent ofthe Qajar dynasty, the teaching of Mulla Sadra’s philosophy actually beganwith Mulla Ali Nuri (d. 1830–1831) in Isfahan, the former Safawid capital ofPersia in the early Qajar period. Mulla Ali Nuri was a great Islamic scholarand his teaching of Mulla Sadra’s philosophy in that city continued withoutopposition from the official ‘ulama.60Ali Nuri also wrote commentaries onal-Asfar, al-Masha‘irand Sharh usul al-kafi. His pupils included MullaMuhammad Isma‘il Isfahani, Mulla Abdullah Zunuzi, and his son Mulla AliMudarris Zunuzi, Mulla Muhammad Ja‘afar Langarudi, Mulla Isma‘ilKhajaw’i, and finally Mulla Hadi Sabzawari, who studied philosophy forseven years in Isfahan and was responsible for the revival of the Existentialistschool of Mulla Sadra in the Qajar period.61The philosophical school ofTeheran, however, became the centre for studying Mulla Sadra’s philosophyon one hand and Islamic esotericism or Gnosticism on the other. The latterwas advocated by Sayyid Radi Larijani, known also as Malik a-Batini(theProfessor of the Esoteric).62Mulla Sadra’s philosophy was also taught on the Indian subcontinent forthe first time by Muhammad Salih Kashani, a disciple of Mulla Sadra whomigrated to India. Indian Muslim scholars such as Muhammad Amjad al-Sadiqi (d. 1727), Mulla Hasan Laknawi (d. 1783), Muhammad A‘lam Sindili(d. 1834) and Abdul Ali Bahr al-‘Ulum (died in the nineteenth century) wrotecommentaries on the works of Mulla Sadra.63As mentioned earlier, one of themost influential figures in the promotion of the philosophy of Mulla Sadraduring the Qajar dynasty was Mulla Hadi Sabzawari. This Muslim thinkerwas born in 1797 in Sabzawar in north-eastern Iran. He studied metaphysics,The School of Isfahan and Suhraward’s Tradition39"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"logic, mathematics and jurisprudence in Mashhad. He then moved to Isfahanto study philosophy with Mulla Isma‘il Isfahani and Mulla Ali Nuri, the inter-preter of Mulla Sadra’s philosophy of that time. Although he studied withMulla Ali Nuri for about three years, Sabzawari hints in his autobiography at“illuminati” rather than Mulla Sadra’s philosophy as the motive behind hisinclination for philosophy and traveling to Isfahan: I spent a total of ten years in the pious circle of the late Mulla [Mulla HusaynSabzawari in Mashhad], until the time that my passion for learning was inten-sified. From Isfahan the whisper of the ‘illuminati’ reached my heart, at a timewhen, by the grace of God, I found great pleasure as well as competence in theo-logical studies. I then left Khurasan for Isfahan leaving behind a considerableamount of property and goods. I stayed there for eight years gaining, with God’said, an ascetic temperament, free of excessive passions, as well as success in mystudies of the sciences and the shari‘a; however, I spent most of my time studyingphilosophy of the illuminationsit school. For five years I studied with thatsupreme doctor of theology (glory of truth seekers, shining light of savants andteachers, possessing the virtuousness of the divines – nay the virtues of God, thatknower of the Truth), Akhund Mulla Isma‘il Isfahani (may al-Sharif (God)sanctify his heart).64After the death of Mulla Isma‘il Isfahani, Sabzawari studied with Mulla AliNuri: ‘When I returned to Khurasan, I continued my studies of fiqh (jurispru-dence) and tafsir (commentary) for five years, for scholars (there) favouredthese two subjects and offered deep understanding of hikmat(philosophy). Forthis reason I rely mostly on hikmat, especially ishraqi(Illuminationism).’65After returning from pilgrimage to Mecca, Sabzawari spent the rest of his lifein his own town teaching philosophy and theology. He soon earned a repu-tation as a great thinker of the Qajar dynasty; even Nasir al-Din Shah (theQajar king who died in 1896) visited him in 1867. Sabzawari died in 1873 andwas recognized as the founder of the Sabzawar philosophical school. He wascalled, as Henri Corbin states, ‘the Plato of his time’, and was also said to be itsAristotle.66One of the most famous philosophical works of Sabzawari isGhurar al-Fara’id, in which he gives a systematic account of Mulla Sadra’sexistential philosophy together with Sharh al-manzumahin poetic verses.Mulla Sadra’s doctrine of the primacy of Being, modalities and the systematicambiguity of Being are discussed in the first part of this work. Sabzawari wrotethree other commentaries onAl-Shawahid al-rububiyyah, al-Mabda’ wa al-mi‘adand Mafatih al-ghayb. Another work, Asrar al-hikma, deals in detailwith the origin of being, eschatology and the esoteric meaning of liturgicalpractices. At the request of Nasir al-Din Shah (the Qajar monarch) Sabzawariproduced a summary of this work entitled Hidayat al-talibin.67In modern times, Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Tabatab’i (professor at thetheological University of Qum) is considered to be one of the philosophersand Gnostic thinkers of Persia who were inspired by Mulla Sadra’s40Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"philosophy. He was born in Tabriz in 1903 and died in 1981. He wrotenumerous books, one being a new edition of Mulla Sadra’s al-Asfar.Tabatab’i was also engaged in a philosophical debate with Henri Corbin from1958 to 1977. These debates were arranged by Sayyid Hossein Nasr (1933–)and conducted before a small audience. Among those who attended wereAyatollah Mutahari and Sayyid Jalal al-Din Ashtiyani.68Many other PersianMuslim thinkers have followed Mulla Sadra’s philosophy. Among them areSayyid Abu al-Hasan Rafi‘i Qazwini, Sayyid Jalal al-Din Ashtiyani (1925–),a professor of theology at Mashhad who edited Mulla Sadra’s Al-Shawahidal-rububiyyah, al-Mazahir al-ilahiyyah and Sabzawari’sMajmu‘ai i-rasa’il,and Sayyid Muhammad Kazim ‘Assar (1885–1975), professor of theology atthe University of Teheran, Mahdi Illahi Qumsha‘i, professor of philosophy atthe University of Teheran, and ‘Allamah Muhammad Salih Ha’iri Simnani.69At present, Sayyid Muhammad Khamenei, the director of Sadra IslamicPhilosophy Research Institute in Teheran, and Gholam Hossein EbrahimiDinani, a professor of philosophy at the University of Teheran, are workingon Mulla Sadra’s philosophy. Mulla Sadra’s philosophy is also studied widelyat the universities and religious schools (madrasa) in Iran.The School of Isfahan and Suhraward’s Tradition41"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURThe Doctrine of the Primacy of Being:An Ontological TurnAs a dedicated and critical thinker, Mulla Sadra investigated deeply intoalmost the entire corpus of philosophical, theological and mystical Islamicthought. Under the influence of his teacher, Mir Damad, he became one of thefollowers of Illuminationism.1Like his teacher, he was also interested in IbnSina’s ontology and studied Ibn ‘Arabi’s theosophy. Suhrawardi, Ibn Sina andIbn ‘Arabi had a notable impact on Mulla Sadra’s thinking and played asignificant role in facilitating his ontological turn from the doctrine of theprimacy of essence to the primacy of being and in his development of a newontological system. Mulla Sadra’s ideas were formed in the matrix of thedominant philosophy of Suhrawardi in the school of Isfahan. As discussedpreviously in Chapter Two, Suhrawardi held the metaphysical view that beingwas a mere mental concept and that essence was the only reality. Humanknowledge of an object was also possible only through the revealing of itsessence. A relationship was suggested between Suhrawardi’s Illuminationismand Plato’s metaphysics; this relationship was seen as important in comparingMulla Sadra’s ontology with that of Heidegger.From the second period of his intellectual development, Mulla Sadra beganto express dissatisfaction with the metaphysics of Illuminationism, in particularwith the doctrine of the primacy of essence and declared, on the contrary, thedoctrine of the primacy of Being. This ontological turn could not have occurredwithout the influence of Ibn Sina and Ibn ‘Arabi. Mulla Sadra’s teacher, MirDamad, also tried to combine Suhrawardi’s ishraqithought with the PeripateticNeoplatonic philosophy of Ibn Sina. The philosophical tradition of the Isfahanschool could not be characterized by blind imitation of Suhrawardi’sIlluminationism. There was an inclination towards newly creative ideas and anattempt to amalgamate Suhrawardi’s thought with that of Ibn Sina. MullaSadra, however, crossed the boundary set by the official interpretation ofIslamic thought when he expressed his interest in Ibn ‘Arabi’s doctrine of theUnity of Being (wahdat al-wujud). In addition to the influence of this doctrine,another visible influence on Mulla Sadra was the psychological–eschatologicalrole of the realm of images. In this realm, according to Ibn ‘Arabi, images are asreal as they are perceptible. The images in the human soul in the hereafter, sincethey are not attached to material objects, are more vivid and real than the imagesin the material world. This idea was used by Mulla Sadra to prove his view onbodily resurrection in his eschatological doctrine.242"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"For Ibn Sina, existence and essence were both real. Existence was of twokinds: necessary and contingent. He illustrated the difference between themin two ways. First, the necessary being is dependent on itself to exist and itsexistence is inseparable from its essence, or rather it is pure existence. Bycontrast, contingent beings are not self-dependent and derive from necessarybeings. Their essences are also separable or are additional to them.3Following Ibn Sina’s ontological division and his distinction between exis-tence and essence, the problem of whether existence or essence constitutesreality emerged in subsequent philosophical debates among Muslim thinkers.Suhrawardi, as one of the followers of Platonism, argued against Ibn Sina’sontology and insisted on the non-reality of existence and advocated the ideathat essence was the only reality.4Mulla Sadra contradicted Suhrawardi’sdoctrine and rejected the Platonic–Illuminationsit metaphysical view thatnothing in the real world corresponds to existence or nothing exists but ideasor essence. He, on the contrary, believed that nothing is real but existence.In seeking to clarify the similarities between Mulla Sadra and Heidegger inrelation to the doctrine of Being, it is important to note three points: •Mulla Sadra and Heidegger stress the principality of Being and the realityof Being as a pre-ontological condition for the existence of all beings.•Both thinkers argue against Plato’s metaphysics, which reduces every-thing to ideas or their essences.•They hold the view that Aristotle’s logic and rationalist cognition are inca-pable of revealing the meaning of Being. As a result, a new cognitiveinstrument is required to apprehend the meaning of Being.Mulla Sadra conceived of no more difficult task than marking a departurefrom the dominant philosophical tradition of his time and developing a newontological system capable of rendering being meaningful. The task could beaccomplished, however, by being essentially critical as well as creativethrough challenging Illuminationism. A new philosophical beginning wasrequired, which should begin with a shift to the doctrine of the primacy ofBeing. In Chapter Three the shift in the direction of his thought from thesecond period of his intellectual development was described as a ‘turn’ fromthe core elements of Suhrawardi’s metaphysics which neglected fundamentalphilosophical questions in favour of investigating the nature of something lessfundamental or grounded that could not exist by itself. Heidegger, in Beingand Time(1927), similarly sought a new ontological system based on under-standing of the meaning of Being as the most fundamental philosophicalconcern. In order to prove this, Heidegger argues that the post Aristotelianthinkers accepted the dogma of negligence or the abandonment of Being.They withdrew themselves from the genuine philosophical question about themeaning of Being, for three reasons. First, they thought that Being was theThe Primacy of Being: An Ontological Turn43"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"most universal concept, and that its universality ‘transcended’ any univer-sality of genus. Second, since Being is the most universal concept, and is notan entity, it is therefore indefinable and escapes all attempts to define it inaccordance with the rules of ‘definition’ provided in Aristotelian logic. Third,Being is self-evident.5Heidegger rejects these three presuppositions andargues against the post Aristotelian thinkers that the universality of theconcept of Being does not guarantee the clarity of its meaning, and that themeaning of this concept is still the darkest of all. He also, like Mulla Sadra,says that Being is not an entity and is thus indefinable, and that Aristotle’sdefinition by genus and difference, ‘definitio fit per genus proximum et differ-entiam specificam’ or connotative definition, which is the most importantkind of definition, is not applicable to it but appropriate only for definingbeings. Heidegger also believes that the indefinableness of Being does notinvalidate the question of its meaning, and should not hinder us from investi-gating that meaning:Being cannot be derived from higher concepts by definition, nor can it bepresented through lower ones. But does this imply that ‘Being’ no longer offers aproblem? Not at all. We can infer only that ‘Being’ cannot have the character ofan entity. Thus we cannot apply to Being the concept of ‘definition’ as presentedin traditional logic, which itself has its foundations in ancient ontology andwhich, within certain limits, provides a quite justifiable way of defining ‘beings’.The indefinability of Being does not eliminate the question of its meaning; itdemands that we look that question in the face.6To clarify Mulla Sadra’s view on the indefinableness of Being, Mulla HadiSabzawari states that even the positive attributes by which we try to defineBeing will neither render a definition nor a description, because whateverattribute is employed is not applicable to this reality. Sabzawari’s argument isbased on the notion of the ‘simplicity’ of Being. Since Being is simple, it hasno differentia or genus on which its definition will become possible.Attaching positive attributes to Being cannot be a description because Beinghas no accidental properties to ascribe to it.7As a result, Sabzawari suggeststhat the meaning of Being will be understood through negative attributes.Being, for example, is neither a substance nor an accident. Substance isessence and since it has no substratum cannot be an accident. Another way ofunderstanding the meaning of Being is that Being has neither an opposite noranything with similarity, because Being has no genus or differentia. It is notdistinct or different from anything. That is why there is nothing to be opposedto it. Because Being also has no essence to share with another being, it is notpossible to think of anything similar to Being. We can also say that Being isnot a part and has no parts.8The negative attributes listed here reveal someaspects of the nature of Being; but again, like positive attributes, these areneither definitions nor descriptions of Being.44Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Mulla Sadra describes the metaphysics of Suhrawardi in his book al-Masha‘ir(the illusion of darkness, or the concealment of the truth):Existences are genuine [determinate] realities and essences are the eternal ‘this-nesses’ which have never inhaled the perfume of real existence at all. These exis-tences are merely the rays and reflected lights of the True Light and of the EternalExistence–Exalted Be His Sublimity! However, each of them has essential predi-cates and contains intelligible concepts called essences.9The ‘darkness of illusion’ is indicative of Suhrawardi’s metaphysics. It is thestate of untruth that reigns over the whole of reality in such a way that themeaning of Being remains unattainable and concealed. For Heidegger, the‘darkness of illusion’ is the ‘abandonment of Being’, which led to ‘nihilism’in the occidental thought of Plato, whom Suhrawardi considered the master ofIlluminationism, and finally of Nietzsche. It represents a history of negli-gence of the most fundamental philosophical question. In An Introduction toMetaphysicsHeidegger states: Where is nihilism really at work? Where men cling to familiar essentsandsuppose that it suffices to go on talking about essents as essents, since after allthat is what they are. But with this they reject the question of being and treat beinglike a nothing (nihil) which in a certain sense it is, insofar as it has an essence. Toforget being and cultivate only the essent – that is nihilism . . . By contrast, topress inquiry into being explicitly to the limits of nothingness to draw noth-ingness into the question of being – this is the first and only fruitful step toward atrue transcending of nihilism.10In Contributions to Philosophy (Enowning)Heidegger explains this meta-physical position in detail and points out four forms of nihilism: actualnihilism, the greatest nihilism, the most disastrous nihilism, and finally crudenihilism.11These forms of nihilism have no historical sequence as any one canemerge in one historical epoch together with the abandonment of Being.Nihilism is also described as the epoch of total lack of questioning in whichproblems will pile up and rush around, those types of ‘questions’, which are notreally questions, because their response dare not have anything binding aboutthem, insofar as it immediately becomes a problem again. This says exactly andin advance that nothing is immune to dissolution and that deconstruction[Auflösung] is only a matter of numbers regarding time, space, and force.12The reconstruction of new metaphysical thought based on the principality ofBeing means destroying the foundation of nihilism; this should be the priorityof this project for Mulla Sadra as well as for Heidegger. Ontology needs tobecome the foundation of philosophical thinking; even philosophy has to bedefined as an inquiry into the meaning of Being: ‘Initially and throughout thelong history between Ahaximander and Nietzsche, inquiring into being isThe Primacy of Being: An Ontological Turn45"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"only a question concerning the being of beings.’13Both Mulla Sadra andHeidegger developed, by revolting against the dominant Platonic tradition, anew ontology at two different times and against two different cultural back-grounds. At the end of this revolt, Suhrawardi for Mulla Sadra and Nietzschefor Heidegger represent the final stage in the development of an antagonisticmetaphysical tradition. The ‘darkness of illusion’ or ‘abandonment of Being’is not simply an effacement for these two thinkers, but a serious philosophicalproblem that reigns over the whole domain of thinking in such a way that thetruth of Being recedes into the darkness or, as Heidegger states, into the‘disintegration of truth’ and finally the thinking of Being as essence.14Beginning with Plato, Being was understood as ‘Idea’ and was interpreted asmere representation in the domain of thinking. As a consequence, in Plato’smetaphysics, the Being of beings as a whole was relegated to darkness. InHeidegger’s view, the concealment of truth about the reality of Being in thehistory of occidental thought from the time of Plato is like ‘the process inwhich the light of a star that has been extinguished for millennia will gleambut its gleaming nonetheless remains a mere appearance’.15Overcoming thistype of metaphysics is possible only by turning to, and not in a mereconversion of, the metaphysics of Being by positing the most fundamentalphilosophical question concerning the meaning of Being and its principality.It is possible to turn to the metaphysics of Being, as described by Heideggerin Being and Timeand Contributions to Philosophy, by making Being thegrounding question and by allowing the re-emergence of the truth of Being asthe only inner reality of all ontic beings. For Mulla Sadra, as he writes in al-Masha‘ir, this is a departure from the ‘darkness of illusion’ to the daylight ofthe Truth.The theme of ontology in Mulla Sadra’s philosophy is the sum of the multi-plicities of being grounded on the principle of unity. In this kind of system, inwhich unity and multiplicity are taken into consideration, the relation of unityto multiplicity and of identity to difference is decisive. In this system ofontology, the principal reality, Being, unlike Plato’s universal Forms in theideal world, is not multiple. It is a unity or identity manifesting itself inmultiple gradations (difference). In this case this unity in multiplicity oridentity in difference is best understood in the light of Hegel’s dialectic logicrather than Aristotle’s, because it is not abstract identity. It is not a simpleunity of Being with itself but a relation to itself. By virtue of this relation ofidentity, beings or the multiple modalities of Being exist, and Being becomesthe unified ground for them. In identity, Being and the modalities of Beingbelong together. This metaphysical principle is one of the most general andencompassing determinations on which all modalities of Being depend.Precisely, it indicates that Being functions as the foundation on which we cangrasp the nature of the relationship between unity and multiplicity. It showsthat unity and multiplicity are two different aspects of the same reality. Unity46Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"contains multiplicity and vice versa. But taking Being as a unified ground ofgrounded multiplicity resembles to a great extent Aristotle’s understanding ofBeing in the Metaphysics. For Aristotle, general ontology must study unityand its varieties. He insists that there is a unity beneath the diversity ofphenomenal objects and that unity is Being quabeing. There is also a singlescience known as ‘general ontology’, which investigates Being as well as itsvarieties. But the difference between Aristotle and Mulla Sadra arises with thedoctrine of the categories and the rationalistic apprehension of this unifiedground or Being quabeing. Aristotle listed ten categories, of which the mostfundamental was substance. The other categories, such as quality, quantity,relation, place, time, posture, state, action and passion, are dependent onsubstance to exist and cannot be by themselves. Meanwhile, these categoriesare classes or genera and their applications render our knowledge of thephenomenal world possible.16In Mulla Sadra’s ontology, Being, as the prin-ciple of the unity beneath the multiplicity of the phenomenal objects, isbeyond the domain of the applicability of these categories. Hence Beingremains indefinable. It is not a genus, differentia, species or a common andspecific accident. In this case, understanding the meaning of Being cannot bebased on anything other than itself:It [existence] cannot be described [defined], because description is due to either adefinition or a [distinguishing] mark. Thus, it cannot be described by definition.Since it has neither a genus nor differentia, it does not have a definition. Nor canit [be described] by a distinguishing mark, since its understanding cannot besupplied by anything more manifest and prevalent than it. It is a mistake toattempt to describe existence, for it would need to be described by somethingmore hidden than the [entity] itself – unless the aim were to [approach it by]either an indication or a notification, or some description; the latter is merely asyntactical [lit. linguistic] inquiry.17Being is then not conditioned by any sort of determination and limitation. If itis defined it is limited and conditioned by its determinations, for every affir-mation is a negation. Kant, in the second and third part of the Critique of PureReason, draws a similar conclusion. He limits the application of the cate-gories to the multiple forms of the phenomenal world, and the ‘thing-in-itself’ or noumenonis kept beyond the applicability of the categories ofhuman understanding and hence remains unknowable. These two conclusionslook similar as each recommends the employment of the categories forrevealing beings rather than their inner reality; but Mulla Sadra andHeidegger disagree with Kant on the unknowablity of reality. For them, theshortcoming in the application of the categories to the realm of Being doesnot hinder an investigation into the meaning of Being. The unknowability andindefinability of Being, as indicated here, refer to the inherent shortcoming ofAristotle’s logic and rationalistic apprehension, which becomes an explicitThe Primacy of Being: An Ontological Turn47"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"problem in the epistemological inquiry of Kant. Nevertheless, this short-coming does not negate the task of ontological inquiry. Mulla Sadra andHeidegger searched for a new epistemological tool and methodology that wasdifferent from the Aristotelian form of cognition. Mulla Sadra, in particular,relied on intuitive knowledge or knowledge by presence for investigating themeaning of Being. It is a cognitive tool associated with the mystic way ofapprehending the reality: As it has been stated, the reality of existence is neither genus, nor species, noraccident, since it is not a natural universal. Instead, its inclusion happens inanother mode of inclusion, and no one has gnosis of it except the mystics; i.e.those who are firmly grounded in mystical knowledge. Sometimes it is inter-preted as the spiritual soul [i.e., Holy Spirit], other times as the grace ‘whichextendeth to all things’. Sometimes [it is interpreted as the] ‘Reality from whichbeings have been created’, according to the mystics. [Also, it is] the expansion ofthe light of existence to the structures [lit. figures] of contingent beings, and theessences which are receptive to it; finally, [they speak of] its descent towards theabodes of inner-natures.18For Heidegger, the universality of Being is also not a natural universal like theuniversality of ‘whiteness’. Its universality ‘transcends’ any universality ofgenus. Those who follow Aristotle’s rule for definition arrive at a negativeconclusion in defining Being, simply because Being is not a genus and has nodifferentia. But does this mean that no further attempt should be made tounderstand the meaning of this indefinable reality? Indeed, if the horizon ofthinking is limited by Aristotle’s doctrine of the task and application of thecategories, the answer to this question is in the affirmative. Mulla Sadra andHeidegger, although inspired by Aristotle’s ontology, denounced his logic andhis rationalistic apprehension of Being. An inquiry into the meaning of Beingis not in the scope of rational epistemology or regional ontology, becauseBeing is distinct from beings. Similar to Aristotle’s First Principle, it is a priorcondition not only for beings but also for all scientific inquiries, yet it cannotbe studied scientifically. ‘Fundamental ontology’, which takes Being intoaccount, is substantially distinctive and its subject matter is neither this northat kind of being but Being per se: ‘Basically, all ontology, no matter howrich and firmly compacted a system of categories it has at its disposal,remains blind and perverted from its own most aim, if it has not adequatelyclarified the meaning of Being, and conceived this clarification as its funda-mental task.’19Mulla Sadra also believes that the question of the meaning ofBeing becomes a prior condition and the foundation of all kinds of scientificdiscourse and knowledge:The question of existence is the foundation of the principles of wisdom, the basisof philosophical theology, and the nexus of [concern] of those in the circle [lit. themillstone; i.e., the centre] of the sciences of unity, the resurrection of souls and48Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"bodies, and of much else that only we have developed and articulated. It givesthem a synthesis [lit. a unity] through its explication. Anyone who is ignorant ofthe gnosis of existence is also ignorant of the major subjects and most significantquests and misses the refinements of gnosis and its subtleties, the science of thedivine and the prophets, the gnosis of the soul, and its connection and return to the[primordial] source and destiny [i.e., telos].20As discussed earlier in Chapter Two, in Hikmat al-Ishraq, Suhrawardiacknowledges his debt to Plato and considers him to be one of his spiritualmasters and a great Illuminationist sage and thinker. However, Mulla Sadra’sattack on Suhrawardi’s philosophy is a direct criticism of Platonism.21Inaddition, while Mulla Sadra and Heidegger came from different culturalbackgrounds, the similarity in their thought is within the framework of theirontology and criticism of Platonism; that is, represented by Illuminationismof Suhrawardi in Persia and the nihilism of occidental thought. These twophilosophical traditions, one Eastern and one Western, belong to Platonism,which has led to the ‘abandonment of Being’. They stand in opposition to thetype of metaphysics founded and advocated by Mulla Sadra and Heidegger.The new ontological enterprise of Mulla Sadra is explained in the firstjourney of al-Asfarand is continued in al-Masha‘irand al-Shawahid al-Rububiyyah. Mulla Sadra was convinced that Being is self-evident; in al-Masha‘ir, in the Third Prehension, under the title ‘An Analysis of the[Extra-Mental] Existence Having a Determinate [Concrete, Fully Determined]Status’, he tried to prove the principality of Being in eight ways or by eightarguments that he called evidences.The First Evidence‘The reality of anything is its existence, which ranks with its effects andimplications. Existence, therefore, must be the most real of all things for it isthe possessor of reality, because whatever possesses reality possesses realityonly due to it.’22Being in this evidence becomes an a prioriontologicalcondition for the existence of all things. Everything finds its way into the lightof being or the objective reality only through Being and by relying on Beingrather than its essence.The Second EvidenceIn this evidence, Mulla Sadra states that when the principality or the reality ofessence is affirmed there will be no distinction between external and mentalrealities, but that ‘this however is absurd’. He also states that if somethingexists in the external world or intellectually, it does not signify that these twoThe Primacy of Being: An Ontological Turn49"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"domains (external and intellectual) stand for that thing as containers in whichthe existence of that thing is established. It simply means that it has an exis-tence from which some effects and consequences are derived.23The Third EvidenceIf the reality of things is in their essences, then it is impossible to predicateessences of one another. Predication is the union of two concepts. Thisimplies that when one thing is predicated of another, the two will be united inexistence but be different from one another in their essences:If things exist by their essences and not by the [mediation] of something else, itwould not be possible to predicate them on each other, such as ‘Zaid is an animal’or ‘Man walks’. It is so, because the use and the truth of predication is a unionbetween different concepts in existence. Thus the judgment made of somethingpredicated on something else is an expression of their unity in existence, thoughthey be diverse as concepts and in terms of their essences.24If the reality of a thing is its essence, then there will be no distinction betweena subject and its predicate on the bases of unity and diversity.The Fourth EvidenceHere Mulla Sadra supposes that if Being is non-existent then nothing hasexisted. Since the non-existence of things is false, the non-existence of exis-tence is necessarily false. Also, if we think of essence as not in a union withexistence, then it is non-existent in any mode. If there is no existence, then thepredication of an essence is impossible, as affirming a predicate presupposesthe existence of the subject. The adjunction of a non-existent thing to anothernon-existing thing has no validity.25The Fifth EvidenceThis evidence is another version of the previous evidence. Before, Mulla Sadrastates that without Being nothing can exist; here he holds the view that if Beinghas no concrete form or external actualization, then no species will have partic-ulars or individuals: ‘If existence is not realized in the individuals of a species,no one of the [individuals of the species] is realized in the external realm.’26Forthe actualization of an individual a species is required, which also relies onexistence to be, and nothing (for example, another universal concept) otherthan existence can qualify as a necessary condition for this purpose.50Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Sixth EvidenceAgain, in proving the principality of Being, Mulla Sadra argues that there aretwo kinds of accidents: accidents of existence such as ‘whiteness’ for a body,and accidents of essence such as differentiafor a genus. Some thinkersbelieve that the qualification of essences by existence, and the presentation ofexistence to the essences, is not a case of an external type of qualification oran occurrence of an accident to its subject, because this implies that the objectof qualification enjoys a certain degree of reality. The occurrence of accidentsof essences (differentiato genus) does not contradict their unity in the realworld. This can be held true for the relationship between existence andessence. Existence as an accident of essence must be united with it, and thisimplies that existence as an objective reality should be realized: ‘Existence,therefore, must be something by the mediation of which an essence exists andwith which it is united in [the externally determined realm of] existence.’27The Seventh EvidenceIn this evidence, the reality of existence is explained through the relationshipof an accident with its subject. It is believed that the existence of an accidentis nothing in itself but is something for its subject; that is, the existence of anaccident is ‘identical with its incarnation [i.e., instantiation] in its subject’.28This incarnation of an accident in its subject takes place in the real world. It isalso clear that the subject of an accident is not included in its essence or itsdefinition but in its existence. The category of accident depends on somethingother than itself, namely a subject, to be manifest. Keeping this in mind, wecan conclude that if existence (the subject) is not real, then the accident is amental concept. The existence of blackness, for example, would be a conceptrather than an incarnation in a body, which is an actual base for the meaningof blackness. This also leads to the denial of the separation of existence fromessence in the realm of accident, whereas the reality of this separation hasalready been agreed upon.29The Eighth EvidenceAgain, if existence is a mental concept and not real, as stated by Suhrawardiand other ishraqithinkers, then ‘an infinite number of species could berealized between any two limits’. There would be no specific number ofspecific essences, and no specific number of species would be realizedbetween any two limits of intensity, which is necessarily false. According toMulla Sadra, the doctrine of the primacy of Being offers a solution to thisThe Primacy of Being: An Ontological Turn51"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"problem, because it advocates the idea that the structure of all essences standson the foundation of a single unity (i.e., Being) and one incessant form. In thisincessant form, the unity of being is actual and its multiplicities will be in thepotential mode without opposing or negating one another.30It is worth mentioning that these evidences do not explain the meaning ofBeing but only its principality. Being, which reflects the reality of all things,cannot be known rationally or conceptually. It can only be experienced intu-itively. Mulla Hadi Sabzawari also restated these evidences of Mulla Sadra forthe primacy of Being, but reduced them to six. According to Dinani, there is aslight difference between Sabzawari and Mulla Sadra in the evidences. Inreality, the material used by the former is same as that developed by the latter.31Sabzawari also presented six arguments to prove the validity of Mulla Sadra’sdoctrine of the primacy of Being; some of them are not significantly differentfrom those of Mulla Sadra’s evidences. In the first argument, Sabzawari insiststhat the self-evidence of Being becomes the fountainhead of all values inhuman life because values are not attributed to concepts, which are mentallyposited. The second argument is the realization of the distinction betweenexternal and internal (mental) modifications of Being: ‘So if existence is notrealized, and if what were realized were quiddity – and quiddity is kept in bothmodes of being without any difference – there would be no distinction betweenthe external and the mental. But since this consequence is absurd, theantecedent must also be the same.’32The third argument deals with the priorityof cause to its effect in relation to the reality of Being. The cause, as we know,necessarily precedes the effect logically as well as in time. If we suppose thatBeing, as stated by the ishraqithinkers, is not real but is mentally posited, thena specific quiddity of fire as a cause would be prior to the specific quiddity offire as the effect, which becomes posterior. In this manner the generic quiddityof a substance as a cause would be prior to a posterior substance, which iscaused by the former. This will necessitate a priority–posteriority relationshipin the quiddities. In the doctrine of the primacy of Being, Being is consideredto be real, and things, which are prior or posterior, are quiddities; yet onlyBeing can confirm their priority or posteriority.Arguments four and six of Sabzawari are similar. Each deals with thereality of Being as a unity beneath the scattered quiddities and multiplicitiesof beings. In the fourth argument, the primacy of Being is established on thegradual increase in the evolutionary movement of the world. This movement,in which various species with quiddities are posited, is both continuous andinfinite. If the philosophical position of Illuminationism is true and Being ismental, then the species will be bound by the beginning and the end, becauseBeing is one and many in accordance with the things from which the conceptof being is abstracted. In this case, Being will not be present as a single realityand unity and the quiddities will be dispersed without a connection among52Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"them.33The sixth argument takes Being as uniting the multiplicity in thephenomenal world of beings. It argues that Being should be fundamentallyreal in order to be a unitary ground for all beings.34In the fifth argument,Sabzawari says that if Being is a mental reality, then ‘what could have madethe quiddities leave the state of equality, and by what have they come todeserve the predicate “existence”?’35Being is the primordial reality on which everything stands; but the realityof all things cannot be described in common language as something thatexists, because it is not an ontic existent but the Being of beings or ontologicalreality. It is simply existence par excellence.36What is real in everything is itsbeing rather than its essence. In this sense, Being is equivocal, not univocal. Itis a common characteristic of all things or the Being of them but withdifferent intensity and weakness. The Being of beings and beings are not twodifferent realities, but one and the same. The reality of Being is, therefore,objective or an ontological reality of all beings. It is what constitutes the veryBeing of everything. For Mulla Sadra, Being, unlike beings, and unlike theview of al-Farabi and Ibn Sina, is not something accidental occurring to itsessence. Accidents are caused but Being is uncaused and nothing is prior to it.If we think of Being as something accidental, then it should have a cause. Thecause must also be prior to it. If a being that is caused by another being isunified with it, the being that is caused is prior to itself as a cause, or is causasui, which will lead to an infinite regress.37Since Being is not this or that ontic being, it has no describable property. Itsabode is not the mind but outside the human mind; it has a dynamic characterthat creates all modalities of ontic beings, which results in the rise of essencesin thinking. Essence, by contrast, is a mental factor and exists for the mindwhen beings are comprehended.38Although Being is that reality withoutwhich nothing is possible, its meaning is still obscure. It requires furtherinvestigation for Mulla Sadra as well as Heidegger. But in my opinion,Heidegger’s understanding of the meaning of Being is beset with ambiguity.It is for this reason that Heidegger’s commentators have discussed and under-stood the meaning of Being in different ways. Kockelmans interpretsHeidegger’s Being as a process, an activity in which its self-manifestationbecomes a truth:As the clearing process which sheds light on itself and on beings by the very factthat it illuminates everything, Being may thus be correctly called truth. Yet theterm truth here obviously does not mean “agreement”; rather, it means clearing,illumination, original self-manifestation, the emergence of Being and of allbeings.39Kockelmans is convinced that Being, like the Geistin Hegel’s philosophy, is adynamic ontological reality, which has the character of a happening thatcomes to manifest itself as a truth.The Primacy of Being: An Ontological Turn53"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"This interpretation can be supported by Heidegger’s own understanding ofthe meaning of Being in On the Essence of Truth(1930), in which he states:‘The primordial disclosure of being as a whole, the question concerningbeings as such, and the beginning of Western history are the same; they occurtogether in a “time” which, itself immeasurable, first opens up the openregion for every measure.’40The interpretation by Kockelmans becomesadequate and reasonable when Heidegger’s understanding of ‘Time’ and‘Temporality’ is taken into account: ‘In contrast to all this, our treatment ofthe question of meaning of Being must enable us to show that the centralproblematic of all ontology is rooted in the phenomenology of time, if rightlyseen and rightly explained, and we must show how this is the case.’41If Beingis conceived in terms of time, then it should be dynamic and eventful; it onlybecomes concealed in this temporal character and its concealment is an activeprocess through the ecstatic projection of Dasein. Dreyfus rejectsKockelmans’s interpretation. He does not believe that Heidegger regardsBeing as a process or a happening: ‘Heidegger must have been aware of thisdanger, since at the point where he says being is not an entity, he writes in themargin of his copy of Being and Time, “No! One cannot make sense of beingwith the help of these sorts of concepts’. To think of being in terms ofconcepts like entity, or process, or event is equally misleading.’42Richardsontakes the view that in the early works of Heidegger, ‘Being’ and the worldwere considered to be equivalent.43At the same time he suggests that, in Kantand the Problem of Metaphysics(1929), Being is understood as the purehorizon of meaning, within which the process of the clearing described byKockelmans takes place.44The notion of ‘Pure’, which is mentioned here andis used again by Heidegger in ‘Letter on Humanism’, can be understood in theKantian sense. In the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant presents a list of purecategories of understanding within which all material collected by sensibility(Anschauung) becomes thought and acquires meaning.45For example, thesensuous notions of colour, taste and odour can be kept in the pure category of‘Quality’. Quality is called pure because it is independent of all empiricalexperiences. It is neither redness nor sweetness, but a category transcendingall empirical notions.When we say that Being is pure, we simply mean that Being transcends allempirical beings, and that the possibility of understanding the meaning of anempirical entity is conditioned by understanding the meaning of Being.Zimmerman has another interpretation: Being for Heidegger is historyshaping ways in which beings can reveal themselves and become real.46Okrent tried to connect this ‘shaping ways of Being in history’ with the prag-matic signification of each kind of being that shows itself to us.47On thequestion of Being (Seinfrage), Heidegger claims that the question of themeaning of Being constitutes a philosophical inquiry about the meaning ofwhat is asked about. It presupposes guidelines or knowledge, which are54Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"already available to us in some way or another. But raising this question is anindication of our intellectual dissatisfaction with available guidelines, andavailable knowledge. Being, at this stage, is known and yet not known, or it isobscure and concealed.Heidegger explicitly states that the subject matter of this inquiry is theBeing of beings, which is not an entity.48One cannot think of Being as anentity like a tree, a table, a horse or a mountain, and hence it cannot be graspedin terms of empirical concepts; meanwhile, it is also not the summum genusofAristotle’s First Philosophy. For this reason, Being is transcendent and apresupposition, for nothing can be presented to us without having been artic-ulated in its Being.49As a consequence of this, in order to understand anentity, we need to look into its Being. Our philosophical knowledge is incom-plete without apprehending the meaning of its Being. By saying that Being isnot an entity, we draw an ontological distinction between Being and beings,but at the same time Being cannot be distinct because no entity can existwithout it. In ‘Letter on Humanism’, Heidegger raises another meaning ofBeing, defining it as power: ‘As the element, Being is the “quiet power” offavouring-enabling, that is, of the possible’.50He also tries to use Hölderlin’selegy “Homecoming” to interpret the meaning of Being. Finally, in AnIntroduction to Metaphysics, Heidegger states,All things we have named are, and yet, when we wish to apprehend beings, it isalways as though we were reaching into the void. The being after which weinquire is almost like nothing, and yet we have always rejected the contention thatthe essent in its entirety is not. But Being remains indefinable, almost like nothingor ultimately quite so’51Elsewhere, Heidegger takes the view that our attempts to understand themeaning of Being are futile because Being is inaccessible and its meaningcannot be apprehended completely. The reason for this lies in the way Beingreveals itself to Dasein:Manifestly, it is something that proximally and for the most part does not showitself at all: it is something that lies hidden, in contrast to that which proximallyand for the most part does show itself; but at the same time it is something thatbelongs to what thus shows itself, and it belongs to it so essentially as it consti-tutes its meaning and its ground.52In this paragraph, Heidegger clearly states that the meaning of Being iscompletely inaccessible, because it ‘for the most part does not show itself atall’. This hiddenness of Being is not something insignificant or temporary thatwill not influence our philosophical understanding of reality; rather, it isessential and constitutes its meaning. The hiddenness of Being cannot beneglected, but at the same time we find ourselves helpless in our search for itsThe Primacy of Being: An Ontological Turn55"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"meaning as the greatest part of it ‘does not show itself at all’. In addition to thishiddenness, Being can be obscured. Further, a phenomenon that is uncovered atsome point can deteriorate to the point of being obscured again. This deterio-ration or recovering of Being leads to disguise: ‘and the most dangerous, forhere the possibilities of deceiving and misleading are especially stubborn’.53Despite the perplexity of this issue, Heidegger suggests that the meaning ofBeing can be revealed in an existential analysis of an entity that has anontic–ontological significance. That entity is the being of Daseinand has thepower to question the meaning of its own being and Being as such. This inquiryinto the meaning of Being, unlike Mulla Sadra’s ontological inquiry, beginswith a particular type of being. The hermeneutic circle of this inquiry movesfrom a part to the whole, or, more specifically, from the being of a particularentity, namely Dasein, to Being in general. This can be seen as the line ofdemarcation between the ontological inquiries of Mulla Sadra and Heidegger.No matter how similar the two inquiries are, they still differ in methodology andmetaphysical conclusions. For Heidegger, the existential analysis of the beingof Daseinreveals the structure of fundamental ontology. An investigation intothe meaning of Being thus explains the existence of Dasein. The hermeneuticcircle then moves from Daseinto Being and from Being to Dasein.In rejecting the Cartesian analysis of human existence as a thinkingsubstance, Heidegger describes human being as ‘Dasein’ (being-there),because res cogitanspresupposes its own ontological ground and there can beno thinking without being. Daseinis an entity that intends itself and under-stands its own being. This attitude of Daseinis at the same time the realizationof its own possibilities, and its existence is always towards these possibilities.For that reason, and in order to make a clear distinction between Daseinandother beings, Heidegger ascribes ‘existence’ (Existenz) to Daseinrather than‘Existentia’, which describes the being of other beings. Existenz, not exis-tential, captures the unique meaning of human existence because it is incom-plete and dynamic and is a being towards possibilities. On the contrary,Existentia signifies the being of a static existence, a term used by medievalmetaphysicians to describe something actual. With Dasein, its being is atissue; it has to decide about its own being and then comports itself towardsthat. In opposition to res cogitans, Dasein’s authentic existence is possibility,not actuality. This terminology and subdivision of Being into ExistenzandExistentiais not found at the beginning of Mulla Sadra’s ontological inquiry.Instead he uses common philosophical terminology such as Necessary Being,contingent being, existence, essence, substance, cause, effect and accident.Unlike Heidegger, he did not try to invent a new philosophical language forestablishing his new philosophical system and accomplishing his break awayfrom the philosophical tradition of his time.Mulla Sadra rejects the idea that Being is an entity; the being of an entity isnot different from the entity itself. He is also against the description of56Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"‘Being’ as a universal concept, because a universal concept cannot be used torepresent the being of particular beings. This would be equal to saying that‘whiteness’ is a white entity.54The reality of the relationship between Beingand beings is not like that between universals and particulars. The reason forthis, as explained earlier, is that Being does not stand as a genus or species forontic beings. If Being is a genus, it will become an abstract universal conceptwhich can then be apprehended rationally. Mulla Sadra argues from the verybeginning of his ontology that Being is neither a concept (such as genus,species, differentiaor accident) nor conceived rationally: ‘and no one hasgnosis of it except the mystics, that is, “those who are grounded in mysticalknowledge”’.55The reality of every ontic entity is in its being. Being istherefore the real ground of everything, including essences. Essences aredetermined not by their own inner structure but by Being.56This, at the sametime, claims identity between Being and beings or between beings and theirBeing. The dynamic movement of Being in modifying itself and manifestingall ontic beings with their essences also determines its completion. The morewe move towards Being, the less of essence is exhibited. Essence is then thenegation of Being.57In my opinion, Mulla Sadra borrowed this idea from IbnSina, who described God (the Necessary Being) as an existence withoutessence. More specifically, we can say that God’s essence is inseparable fromHis existence. Only in case of contingent beings can essences be distin-guished from their existences. Existence is positive and real while essence isnegative and unreal. For this reason it is more correct to say ‘This is a tree’than ‘Tree exists’, because essence does not exist by itself. It should beattached to existence.58However, this interpretation of the relationshipbetween existence and essence should not be understood in terms of meta-physical dualism. For Mulla Sadra, essences are not real beings. They comeinto existence when Being creates its own modalities or ontic beings, and thenessences arise as the result and are joined to them. In the downwardmovement of Being, when the multiplicity of ontic beings emerges, thesebeings exhibit diverse essences. With the upward evolutionary movement,this duality gradually disappears until, at the end, being can be grasped in itsabsolute positivity without essence. According to Fazlur Rahman, this viewmarks a distinction between Mulla Sadra’s ontology and that of theAristotelian–Neoplatonic Muslim thinkers. The latter believed that a concretebeing is the combination of existence and essence. Each of these two aspectsof a concrete being is real and could exist by itself.59Mulla Sadra advocatesontological monism. For him, there are not two realities such as existence andessence, but only existence. It is worth mentioning that Suhrawardi is also amonist thinker, but for him the single reality is essence rather than Being.Having established the principality and reality of Being, Mulla Sadra dealswith the modality or individuation of Being in his philosophical system. This,in my opinion, should be seen as similar to Heidegger’s attempt to divideThe Primacy of Being: An Ontological Turn57"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Being into various ontological regions because every system of ontologyrequires this division. Generally speaking, in the ontological division ofMulla Sadra there are three modalities of Being: the realm of unity andsimplicity includes the Necessary Being, heavenly spheres and the intellect inhuman existence; the modalities in the realm of diversity and multiplicityconsist of the ontic beings and the perceptive soul in human existence; finally,at the lowest level of ontological division, there is the realm of matter withpure potentiality to receive forms. This realm also includes the human body.Human existence is shared by all three modalities. The human intellect is inthe first realm, the perceptive faculty belongs to the second, and the body tothe third.The modality of unity and simplicity is the realm of Being, which is iden-tified with God. Being, for both Mulla Sadra and Ibn Sina, is Pure Beingbecause it is without essence and at the same time it is the Being of all beingsin the two lower realms of existence. At the rank of Pure Being multiplicity isdissolved, and everything merges into a unity or into a ‘simple’ and ‘One’mode of Being.60It is also important to mention that for Mulla Sadra ontologyis not separate from theology because he thinks of Being as the highestground above all beings, as the grounding ground and cause of all beingwithout having a cause or a ground for itself. This grounding ground of allbeings is also at the same time conscious of both itself and beings and deter-mines their destination. This can be seen as the distinction between MullaSadra’s ontology and that of Heidegger. Here, Mulla Sadra’s ontology couldbe described as onto-theology, a Heideggerian term used to define this type ofmetaphysics.61In Heidegger’s ontology, Being is neither transcendent in thissense nor a rational cause for all beings. It is the Being of beings and theirinner reality. God does not enter into Heidegger’s metaphysics; his meta-physics remains as ontology.In the second division, or the modality of diversity and multiplicity, thereare ontic beings such as heavenly bodies, souls, animals and inanimatebeings. This is the realm of individual beings.62Every ontic being in thisrealm is in constant flux and evolutionary change towards a higher realm toachieve perfection. These beings reach perfection in human existence, ashuman beings are more intelligent than animals. Some human beings reach ahigher rank of existence and become more perfect in their intelligence thanothers; this is the highest form of Being in the realm of multiplicity beneaththe realm of unity.63The lowest degree of modality of Being is the realm of prime matter, whichis nothing more than the potentiality to receive forms.64Following the doctrineof emanation introduced earlier by some Muslim thinkers such as the membersof Ikhwan al-Safa (The Brethren of Purity), al-Farabi and Ibn Sina, MullaSadra believes that prime matter is emanated from Being eternally becauseBeing is not in time. Prime matter represents the lowest level of existence and58Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"becomes existent through receiving specific forms in the evolutionary processfrom potentiality to actuality. It is also the beginning of the movement towardsperfection in the universe, which will be explained in Chapter Five in thediscussion on trans-substantial change (al-haraka al-jawhariyyah). The twolower realms, namely the realms of potentiality and diversity, originated fromthe realm of unity and are dependent on that realm ontologically:All contingent beings, whatever their distinctions and their ranks of [relative]deficiency and perfection, are existentially dependent, being indigent in theirinner-realities towards It, and enriched by It. Thus, these contingent beings arecontingent by virtue of their own inner-realities. Due to the First Necessity, TheExalted, however, they are [conditionally] necessary. They are inoperative andperishable only from the perspective of their own inner-reality [and thus are notcategorically necessities]. They become a reality due to the Absolute Reality[aletheia], [being] the One and the Only: ‘Everything that exists will perishexcept His own face’. His relation to other beings is like sunlight, such that [initself] it depends on its own inner reality, [while other] bodies are enlightened byit; [they, however] are dark from [the perspective of] their own inner-reality.65Mulla Sadra’s division of the ontological realms attributes principality andpriority to the realm of unity. To clarify the principality of this realm, heexplains three ontological positions, in each of which the nature of this prin-cipality is vindicated. He argues that the relationship between being andessence should be understood in three different ways: we think of Being asprior to essence or posterior to it or we state that both of them co-exist simul-taneously. When Being is thought of as prior to essence, it simply signifiesthat Being is independent and can stand by itself without relying on essence.If the primacy of essence is accepted, as stated in the second case, thenessence would exist independent of Being and be prior to it, but then foressence to exist it needs existence to rely on and this is a vicious regress. Thethird position is that essence co-exists with Being simultaneously, and not init; therefore it relies on another existence for its existence. As a consequenceof this, essence cannot be without prior existence:If being exists [lit. if the being of existence were an existent], then either it is priorto the essence or posterior to it, or they are simultaneous. If the first is the case, itsrealization necessarily follows independently without the essence. This impliesthat priority of the attribute is prior to the subject of its attribution as well as itsrealization without it. If the second is the case, it necessarily follows that essenceexists prior to it [existence] before being, which implies a vicious regress. If thethird is the case, it necessarily follows that essence exists with it [i.e., existence]and not in it. Therefore, there would be another existence for it [i.e., for essence];this [state] implies what has been mentioned. The falsity of the consequencesalways implies the falsity of the antecedents.66After arguing for the primacy of Being, Mulla Sadra stresses the view thatessences belong to the realms of potentiality and multiplicity and are insepa-The Primacy of Being: An Ontological Turn59"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"rable from beings ontologically. Their separation is only an intellectual fact,which occurs in the realm of thinking. Beings and essences are united in theworld but separated in thinking:What has been said earlier is sufficient to refute this claim, for, existence is iden-tical with essence in the external [realm] but different from it mentally. Therefore,there is no relation between them except in intellectual consideration. In [such anintelligible] consideration, the relation will have existence which is in its inner-reality is identical with it, but is different from it in the realm external [to themind]. This kind of ad infinitum is stopped when the intelligible consideration isceased.67However, it is clear that the only ontological position accepted by MullaSadra is the affirmation of the primacy of Being and the intellectually positedstatus of essence. What he has argued here, then, or has tried to prove, is thatBeing, not essences, is the sole reality. Essences exist in the mind or only inthinking, not in the external world. The dualism of existence and essencearises only when we think to define a being or understand its nature. Moreprecisely, essences emerge when Being modifies itself in the downwardprocess of further diversified ontic beings. We can talk about essences whenthese ontic modes of Being are perceived or thought about. But graduallyessences disappear when we move upwards to apprehend Being in its pureabsoluteness. According to Fazlur Rahman, this view draws a line of demar-cation between Mulla Sadra’s ontology and that of the Muslim PeripateticNeoplatonic thinkers.68The latter accepted the reality of existence andessence outside the domain of thinking and did not insist on the subjectivityof the latter.69In contrast, essence here is considered a mode of Being thatexists only in thinking; that is, it has mental reality. It is the intellect thatconceives essence and separates it from existence; otherwise, there is onlyexistence and nothing else as an ontological reality and the foundation of allontic modes. It may be possible to find a resemblance between this view ofthe ontological status of essence and the subjective categories in Kant’sphilosophy. Our knowledge of the phenomenal world, as described by Kant,is produced through the application of these subjective categories that definethe essence of every phenomenon with the assistance of sensibility. Thisclaim is an obvious contradiction with Suhrawardi’s metaphysical conviction,in which essence has become real and Being a mere mental concept having noontological reality of its own. Mulla Sadra, again in his arguments against thedoctrine of the primacy of essence, insists that Suhrawardi’s conviction can betaken into account when the dual reality of essence and existence isaccepted.70For Mulla Sadra, Being is real and essence unreal; Being ispositive, light, and makes all essences exist, whereas essence is negative,darkness, and imposes limitation on beings. The essence of each Being,which is other than Being, does not exist by itself. It exists by virtue of Being.60Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Being is, then, an ontological reality while essence lacks that reality and thisrank of existence.71The problem that arises in describing essence assubjective is with the possibility of understanding essence as somethingillusory. What does Mulla Sadra mean by insisting on the principality andreality of being? Is there a unity of being and essence in reality? Does thatunity make them one real thing? Does that unity presuppose their previousontological distinction? In answering these questions the ontological status ofessences and their relationship to Being can be seen from two perspectives:first, the essences are illusory or images in the mind and have a mental exis-tence like the subjective categories of the faculty of understanding in Kant’sepistemology; second, the essences are real and their reality is of the seconddegree and is not equal with the reality of Being.The first perspective is also found as a mystic point of view and analogousto the metaphysical position of some Indian thinkers who consider the worldto be mayaor unreal. Based on this type of metaphysical belief the essence ofan entity or its being in the sensible world is seen as an illusion. But is thisMulla Sadra’s position? Does this Muslim thinker say that the essence of thetable I am now using for writing is only mental and has no reality outside mymind? In my opinion, Mulla Sadra’s understanding of this problem belongs tothe second perspective, which is similar to the view of Ibn Sina and to Hegel’sinterpretation of unity and diversity. Indeed, even explaining some similar-ities between Mulla Sadra’s interpretation of the meaning of Being and itsrelationship with essence with that of Kantian metaphysical dualism will notbe of great help here. The best way to approach this problem is throughHegel’s analysis of the external reality and his interpretation of the world asthe self-manifestation of Geist. In other words, we need to understand Beingas an objective reality that exhibits itself in various forms and gives rise to themultiple beings and their essences. Being in this sense is a dynamic foun-tainhead of all things as well as their essences. This view is also shared byHeidegger, with the exception that Heidegger’s ontology leaves no room for arational teleology. Also, Hegel’s concept of essence should not be taken forthe Platonic Forms or the Kantian noumena. It is the negation of Being and isderived from the last category in the sphere of Being in dialectical logic.Essence, therefore, cannot exist by itself without relying on Being, but unlikeBeing, which is immediacy, essence is mediated and known throughreflection or understanding.72This discussion, in some ways, brings us closerto Ibn ‘Arabi’s doctrine of the unity of being. Mulla Sadra also wrote on thegraded unity of being in order to justify his doctrine of the ambiguity of Being(tashkik al-wujud). In his discussion on the relationship between cause andeffect he draws a conclusion on the personal unity of being in line with Ibn‘Arabi.73This discussion on the causal relationship also leads to the onto-logical division of Being stated by Ibn Sina, because Being that is a cause forits own multiple modality or the emergence of the effects becomes aThe Primacy of Being: An Ontological Turn61"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Necessary Being as in Ibn Sina’s ontology and the effects of possible beings.The existence of a cause does not rely on its effects, because it is independentand self-subsistent. Dependence and reliance on something other than itself isthe character of the effects. The effects become both necessary when they areaccompanied by their perfect cause and impossible in the absence of thisperfect cause. When a cause produces an effect, that effect gives rise to itsown essence in the mind, and in this way essence is derived from the existenceof the effect. An effect, for example the world, is real when it is seen only inits relationship to its cause. This relationship is described as that of a speechto the speaker. The moment the speaker halts speaking, speech becomesimpossibility.74The necessary relationship between a cause and its effectdetermines the existence of the effect but the cause (Being) remains withoutrelying on anything for its existence. Can we say that Being causes essences?What is important to remember here is that essences have no reality for MullaSadra. They exist in the mind or intellectually. Being as a perfect cause givesrise to its effects or possible beings, and essences affect the possible beingsand emerge only in the mind when the possible beings are thought about orconceived. Essences have no existence at all, either primary or attributive.Essences belong to contingent beings in the realm of diversity and multi-plicity. These contingent beings emanate from Being and give rise to essencein the mind.75Existence and essence, as mentioned in al-Masha‘ir, are notseparate in the external world; their separation is merely mental. This,however, does not mean that existence and essence are two different realitieshaving a unity. Mulla Sadra plainly rejects the external reality of essences.For him, essences belong to contingent beings; if these beings have moreessences they possess less being. Yet their being will never vanish, as nothingcan exist as pure essence. The essences become ‘concepts’ through which wecome to know about contingent beings. It is worth mentioning here thatSuhrawardi is right in stating that what is known is essence not existence. Butin Mulla Sadra’s philosophy, knowledge is preconditioned by Being, or epis-temology by ontology. Essences, as internal realities, are dependent on theexternal reality of Being. Although at the highest level of the hierarchy ofBeing there is pure Being, a kind of existence without essence, we cannotstate that at the lowest level there is pure essence or essence without exis-tence. Essences are always with ontic beings and do not exist in themselves.Their relationship as universal concepts to ontic beings (phenomena)remains; as long as one particular or ontic being exists, the essence will alsoexist. This can be seen as a one-to-one relationship.76The ontological division of Being in Mulla Sadra’s philosophy does notdepict the world as an aggregate of ontic beings or a container of them. MullaSadra sees the world as an organic body in which the evolutionary process oftrans-substantial change takes place towards perfection. When an ontic beingis described as something ‘in’ the world, this spatial relationship is not62Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"external like the case of a table in the room. The existence of the table is notdependent on the room, while its existence as an ontic being is unthinkablewithout its being in the world. Mulla Sadra’s understanding of the rela-tionship between Being and beings has similarity with Heidegger’s existentialanalysis of in-der-Welt-sein, where being-in-the-world becomes an onto-logical condition for the existence of Dasein.77Yet this condition does notconstitute the essence of this entity. This relationship between Being andbeings is often elucidated metaphorically. As stated by John Quinn, forexample, it is like the relationship of ink to written words.78One is usually notaware of the ink while reading the words. But in reality it is the ink that is seenand the words do not exist without it. Beings are similarly dual in nature. Theyhave the character of identity as, like the words, they share the ink, but at thesame time they represent multiplicity as the words are different from oneanother in form and meaning. Every being is then identical and different,eternal and temporal, divine and profane, because they are the intensive modi-fications of Being. By reflecting on this distinction and the ontologicaldifference between the realms of Being we find a way to Being. This is MullaSadra’s objective in al-Asfar. His aim is to move away from the ‘darkness ofillusion’ to the daylight of the truth of existence.The Primacy of Being: An Ontological Turn63"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVEThe Systematic Ambiguity of Being andthe Trans-Substantial Change in theWorld OrderAll beings in the sensible world are actual in some ways or potential in others.In the former, they have been changed from potential to actual but do notpossess perfection completely. Their state of actuality is not yet pure andfinal. It is merely a new state of potentiality for another actuality, withoutwhich they will remain immutable without transition from one rank of beingto another. The change from potential to actual will be in a state of constantflux, with beings undergoing sudden or gradual change. The state of poten-tiality, which is prior to the state of actuality, is weak and imperfect. But inorder to become more perfect and reach a higher rank, beings need to becomeactual again. To achieve this, they must be elevated to a higher mode of beingwhere perfection is articulated or actualized.In this discussion about change we encounter one of the most importantphilosophical issues in Mulla Sadra’s ontology: trans-substantial change (al-haraka al-jawhariyyah). This is, in my opinion, the lynchpin of hiscosmology and the key concept for understanding the world order. MullaSadra’s interpretation of the meaning of the world is also based on under-standing of trans-substantial change; hence his interpretation of the world isdeeply rooted in his metaphysical system. In Mulla Sadra’s philosophy, theworld is not a mere material realm like that of Aristotle in which beings arecausally and mechanically connected, but a world with integrated parts of asingle system with a pre-given purpose. The world is not built on blind andaimless regulation and mechanical self-repetition. It is created by a perfectcause that has determined its meaning and destination.In advocating this teleological metaphysics for understanding the worldMulla Sadra draws closer to Hegel rather than to Heidegger, and moves awayfrom Aristotle. For Hegel, the world is the self-objectification of the Geist; itmoves dialectically onward to accomplish perfection and overcome its alien-ation from Geist. The world is seen as an organic whole that changes itself fora purpose predetermined by Geist.1Geistis in a process of transformation inhistory through contradictions that determine the development of the world.Hegel elaborated this process in the Phenomenology of Mindas a temporalstructure, which moves from idea to nature and then back to the idea in abetter form and with richer content. This dialectical movement is carried64"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"forward by the triad of thesis, antithesis and synthesis. Synthesis, which is theunion of thesis and antithesis, is richer than the previous movements incontent because it supersedes both and becomes a new thesis for anotherantithesis, which unites to produce a new synthesis, which in turn becomes anew thesis in a new triad. This dialectic movement from thesis to antithesisand then to unity in synthesis is an irreversible process that continues untilGeist, as the only sovereignty of the world, achieves self-completion at thefinal stage of historical development when the estranged world is appro-priated by consciousness and transformed.What Mulla Sadra explains in his doctrine of trans-substantial change canbe separated from Hegel’s description of the dialectical movement in threeways: first, Mulla Sadra does not advocate the idea of the dialecticalmovement of the world; second, although the emanation of the world is atemporal generation of the modalities of Being, time and change do not affectBeing. Third, God is not immanent but transcendent, so Mulla Sadra’s meta-physics should be understood in terms of panentheism rather than pantheism,the former being the metaphysical view that the world is part of God ratherthan being identical with Him. The world of multiplicity and God are incommunion with each other because the former originated from the latter. Butat the same time God is transcendent and separated from the world. MullaSadra, unlike Hegel, thinks of being in the world as temporality, but thistemporality is external to the realm of Being. This is also in contradiction withHeidegger’s description of Being as temporality. In Hegel’s Phenomenology,as in Heidegger’s Being and Time, temporality is the reality of Geist; forexample Hegal states:Time is just the notion definitely existent, and presented to consciousness in theform of empty intuition. Hence spirit necessarily appears in time, and it appearsin time as long as it does not grasp its pure intuition, i.e. so long as it does notannul time. Time is the pure self in external form, apprehended in intuition, andnot grasped and understood by the self; it is the notion apprehended only throughintuition. When this motion grasps itself, it supersedes its time character,(conceptually) comprehends intuition, and is intuition comprehended andcomprehending. Time therefore appears as spirit’s destiny and necessity, wherespirit is not yet complete within itself; it is the necessity compelling spirit toenrich the share self-consciousness has in consciousness, not put into motion theimmediacy of the inherent nature (which is the form in which the substance ispresent in consciousness); or, conversely, to realize and make manifest what isinherent, regarded as inward and immanent, to make manifest that which is atfirst within – i.e. to vindicate it for spirit’s certainty of self.2The world is not separated from Geist, which functions as an immanent causein the dialectical process of evolution. The actualization of Geisthappensonly in time through stages of development in nature and history. Since theessence of Geistis self-determined, history is the realization of freedomAmbiguity of Being and Trans-Substantial Change65"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"determined by Geist. It is a purposeful transition towards the absolute ideawhere all differences are united in absolute consciousness.Another distinction between Mulla Sadra’s ontology and that ofHeiddegger lies in the doctrine of emanation. Mulla Sadra, following theNeoplatonist Muslim thinkers such as Ikhwan al-Safa, al-Farabi and Ibn Sina,describes the creation of the world as emanation. From the realm of unity orPure Being emanates the realm of prime matter (potentiality) and the realm ofdiversity (ontic beings). Accordingly, Being remains both transcendent andthe origin and grounding of all that is grounded; in other words, the innerreality of all things. The emanation begins from Pure Being and moves down-wards to the lowest level, where the ontic beings, although they do not vanishas beings, are dominated by their essences. Like the dialectic movement inHegel’s logic, this descending process of emanation is from the most generaland indeterminate form to the most concrete, but it loses perfection on theway. Descendance is a gradual distance from perfection. At the abyss of thisdescending process there are beings with more essence but less existence. In the light of the doctrine of emanation all ontic beings are the same andshare identity because they spring from a single fountainhead. In all of them,Being becomes a common character and the inner identity. We can describeall beings in the three ontological realms as things that are. Meanwhile,emanation from Being downwards explains various stages of being withdifferent degrees of perfection. In this case, all beings are not equal or thesame in sharing the reality of Being. This unequal distribution of the characterof Being with different gradations of the Being of their beings is called thesystematic ambiguity of Being (tashkik al-wujud):The relation between generated creatures and the creator is that of deficiency toperfection, and of weakness to strength. It has been established already that whatis realized in a determinate manner are real existents and not essences. Moreover,it has been established that existence is a simple reality which has neither genus,nor a persisting difference, nor species, nor dividing difference, nor individu-ation. Rather, its individuation is due to its simple essence and the essentialdistinction between its units and identity [occurs] only by means of [their] beingthe strongest and being the weakest; and distinction into accidents happens onlyin bodies. There is no doubt that the Creator in existence is The Most Perfect andin realization The Most Complete [in encounter] with the created. The created islike an emanation of its Creator. In reality [the creature] is not even an effect,except in light of its unfolding [lit. modification] by the Maker, in light of ItsUnfolding and Activities.3The systematic ambiguity of Being is another way of expressing the principleof identity in difference and is determined by the descending process ofemanation from Being to the lowest ontic beings. Being, as the reality of allranks of ontic beings, is one and identical in its relation to them, but at thesame time it becomes multiplicitous and different. From the perspective of66Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"this principle, there will be no distinction between diverse ontic beings andBeing, as all of them belong together. They are only different in theirperfection, deficiency, richness and indigence.4It should be remembered thatimperfection and deficiency infect only the realms of prime matter anddiversity. These terms cannot be employed to describe the realm of Beingbecause Being is a unity and pure and has no essence; otherwise, as MullaSadra states, ‘It would not be the case that a Necessary Existent could exist.’5Deficiency and imperfection are not the characteristics of the inner reality ofBeing. They are characteristics of its gradation in the rank of contingent andposterior beings. Deficiency, limitation and privation are the characteristics ofbeings rather than Being. They are generated during the process of emanationbecause ‘It is necessarily the case that the created thing is not equal to thecreator, nor does emanation equal the source of emanation in terms of rank ofexistence.’6The gradation of Being is also systematic because it is purposeful,unidimensional and determined by Being. It does not leave the emanation ofthe ontic beings in the world to the caprice of blind chance.The world of multiplicity and difference is a temporal occurrence and agradation of Being, because everything emanates from Being and is groundedin it. The non-existence of a particular being precedes its existence in time,and is in the state of non-existence prior to its existence caused by Being. Inthis process of creation or coming into being of the non-being, an individualbeing requires a new identity constantly and its existence is not fixed.7MullaSadra supports this view of the constant renewing of being in the world byquoting Qur’anic verses. He believes that the renewal of ontic beings is anecessary, autonomous or innate process, because all ontic beings are in arelation of identity to Being. Their existence is based on the reality of Being:‘The Maker, in virtue of His durability and endurance, created this creaturewhich is self-renewal in terms of its essence and identity.’8The systematic ambiguity of Being is the particularization of Being inwhich Being becomes manifest in its own individual modalities. It is not aprocess similar to the emanation of particulars from the universal PlatonicForms or to Suhrawardi’s Lord of Species, simply because the NecessaryBeing or the source of this particularization is not a universal form but a singletranscendent Being. This can be seen as a significant difference betweenMulla Sadra’s understanding of the Platonic Forms and Suhrawardi’s.Although Plato thinks of the universal forms in the immaterial world as ideasor essences in the Suhrawardian sense, Mulla Sadra insists that they arebeings rather than essences and placed at a higher rank of existence in thegradation of Being. Besides, he believes that they are not universal ideas butindividual beings responsible for generating species at a lower rank of exis-tence. Having discussed the gradation of Being briefly it is useful at this pointto explain more precisely Mulla Sadra’s interpretation of emanation forunderstanding his doctrine of the systematic ambiguity of Being. The processAmbiguity of Being and Trans-Substantial Change67"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"of emanation begins with Pure Being and proceeds to its own particular-ization, which gives rise to the creation of all beings. This pure Being, asstated before, is neither genus nor species, but a mere identity and simplicity.On the ground of identity, its relationship to beings is equivocal. From thistranscendent single and simple Being emanates only one being; the diversityof the ranks belongs to the lower stages of emanation and has no directcontact with the transcendent source. At this stage in understanding MullaSadra’s ontology, we can state that there are two regions of ontology: theregion of Pure Being and that of becoming. The former is characterized byunity and sameness (identity) and the latter by difference, multiplicity andchange. These two regions of being are necessarily connected as the former isan ontological ground for the latter. As a consequence of this necessary rela-tionship between ground and grounded, we can conclude that there is nomultiplicity without unity. The principle of identity in difference becomes anessential characteristic of the two regions of Being and becoming. Differencebecomes possible only on the ground of identity. The presence of unity inemanation is an ontological condition of the equivocal ground for the multi-plicity of the grounded.The systematic ambiguity of Being brings us to the individuation (al-tashakhus) of Being, which is discussed by Mulla Sadra in the second volumeof al-Asfar. The meaning of individuation as understood by him signifies thedivision of a species into undivided units. For example, Socrates as an indi-vidual human being is a member of the human species. The concept of humanbeing can be applied to all members of this species, in which case theuniversal concept cannot become an individuation. On the other hand, anindividual human being is not a universal concept, and cannot be applied to allindividuals. The main characteristic of individuation is, then, its inapplica-bility, unlike a universal concept, to other or multiple things.9The individu-ation of an ontic being is not in its quiddity and it is not something caused byits accident. It is in its existence, which constitutes the reality of its individualexistence even in a material form:The subsequent deficiency is not from the Principle of Existence. But, it is due toits actualization in [its being in] the second rank and thereafter. Deficiencies andprivations happen due to the secondary [existence] due to the fact that they aresecondary and posterior [in relation to the First Existence]. The First Being[exists], since its perfection is complete, [and thus] it has no limit. Privation andindigence are derived from the emanation and creation, because it is necessarilythe case that the created thing is not equal to the creator, nor does emanation equalthe source of emanation in terms of rank of existence.10In the systematic ambiguity of Being imperfection emerges with individu-ation, which compels all beings to undergo the evolutionary changes towardsperfection. Being, as the inner transcendent reality of all beings, is not totally68Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"involved in this evolutionary process, but at the same time it is not detachedfrom it because it is the ontological originator of the beings and their evolu-tionary movement. Being is a unity and a non-conditional origin of all things.Otherwise, it cannot exist necessarily without a beginning. Perfection is incontrast to individuation, and distancing of beings is in proximity to Being.The notion of becoming gives rise to the idea of time or the temporality ofthe realm of multiplicity. As mentioned earlier, Being, as the origin and thecause of becoming, is not affected by time. Time belongs only to the world ofmultiplicity of ontic beings. Mulla Sadra’s understanding of the concepts oftime and change is different from that of Aristotle. In al-Masha‘ir, he statesthat the concept of ‘change’ described by some philosophers as a mediationbetween the realm of Being and becoming does not suit our ontological enter-prise, because they understand change to be .an additional intelligible affair,which indicates the transition of a thing from potentiality to actuality, ratherthan the means by which this transition is made.’11Change, for Mulla Sadra,is a constant transition of substance and time is the measure of trans-substantial change. With this kind of change we encounter an ascendingprocess of evolution towards perfection. Becoming is, then, the reverse of thedescending process of the individuation of Being. The descending process isa movement from Being to the lowest rank of beings with less of being andmore essence. The universality of Being is reduced until it arrives at the stageof individuals where no universality is further possible. The ascendingmovement is from the lowest rank to the highest, from the least perfect to themost perfect rank of existence. The doctrine of the systematic ambiguity ofBeing is nothing more than the increase and decrease of the reality of Beingand identity in all ontic beings. The beings are distributed among variousranks due to their being prior or posterior, perfect or imperfect, strong orweak. There is always less and more of Being in the real world. It should beremembered that Mulla Sadra is not the first philosopher to advocate the ideaof constant flux. Before him Heraclitus held this view on change. This Greekthinker is known for sayings attributed to him such as ‘All things are in a stateof flux’, and ‘You cannot step twice into the same stream’.12Being, in thisconstant flux, particularizes itself and gives rise to multiplicity. Heraclitusalso believed that reality was an eternal vital fire, kindled in measures andextinguished in measures. These philosophical views were in contradiction tothe views of Parmenides and Zeno of Elea, who argued against the possibilityof motion, multiplicity and difference. Parmenides thought of Being asconsisting of the same stable reality. Zeno, the disciple of Parmenides, wentfurther to prove the ideas of his teacher by arguments known as Zeno’s para-doxes.13The foundation of Heraclitus’ ontology, however, has four principles:first, Being is one in many or unity in multiplicity; second, everythingchanges constantly; third, Being as a living fire is governed by logos; andfourth, Being includes non-being and both generate becoming. AfterAmbiguity of Being and Trans-Substantial Change69"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Heraclitus, the notion of becoming became one of the pivotal categories inHegel’s logic. Being and non-being (Nothingness) in dialectical logic areidentical because neither has determinations and both are abstractions andalso different. But it is a contradiction for two things to be identical anddifferent. This contradiction propels the dialectical progress further. As aconsequence of this and as the synthesis of being and non-being, ‘becoming’prevails when being passes into non-being and non-being into being. Thesetwo movements determine the coming to be and ceasing to be of the beings inthe world. Although the notion of trans-substantial change was not used byHeraclitus and Hegel, their interpretation of change and motion, particularlywhere Heraclitus states that one cannot step twice into the same stream, mightbe interpreted as trans-substantial change because one cannot have the samekind of being at different times. In the case of accidental change, it is true thatthe substance remains the same without losing its own identity. For example,when water is cold it receives the form of cold. It becomes hot only when itreceives the form of heat by throwing off its previous form; water cannot becold and hot at the same time. In this kind of change, when a being receives anew form – a bud blossoms and becomes a flower – it does not throw away itsprevious form. The object becomes perfected and elevated to a higher level ofexistence by receiving a new and better form without negating the previousone. We can say, in the Hegelian sense, that the previous form is superseded(aufgehoben), preserved and elevated. The trans-substantial change consistsof preserving the past forms and yet transcending them. But it does not leave‘substance’ without affecting it like its accidents.In Mulla Sadra’s ontology, as in Heraclitus, change is a constant renewaland an evolutionary process towards perfection. It is not a movement fromone place to another like the movement of an arrow in space or a train fromone station to another. It is a substantial change that dominates all beingsin the ontological region of becoming. The causal foundation of this changein beings is not something stable or unchangeable such as substance inAristotle’s metaphysics; rather, it signifies a being that is at the same timeaffected by change. There is in every accidental change a substantial change;to put it another way, change in accidents is caused by change in substance.This change is a fundamental transformation of a being from one rank of exis-tence to another.14All beings come under the influence of this change;nothing remains outside the domain of change and nothing remains the samefor ever. If we think of time as the measure of change, then in this context timefor Mulla Sadra becomes the measure of this trans-substantial transformationof beings. It is a dominant reality in the span of life of every ontic being andconstitutes the ontological structure of the region of becoming.Change in the four categories or accidents, an idea advocated by Aristotleand Muslim Peripatetic Neoplatonic philosophers, is possible with change insubstance. As a consequence of this, with the exception of change nothing70Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"remains durable in the region of becoming. For Mulla Sadra the cause ofchange is a self-moving substance called the inner reality of Being, which isequivocally shared by all beings. It is, as stated by Fazlur Rahman, thespecific nature commonly supposed to create the species in the world.15Thisnature is not stable; it is subject to constant change and brings about acci-dental changes with itself. The arguments developed by Mulla Sadra tosupport his notion of change are easy to understand. He states that, since thechangeable accidents of beings are caused by their substances, substanceitself should be changeable because a motionless cause cannot produce amoved accident. A change in accident should be caused by a change insubstance. Otherwise there would be no causal relationship betweensubstance and its accidents. In another argument, he insists that change is anevolution towards perfection. Perfection is achieved when there is asubstantial change from a less perfect state to a more perfect state of exis-tence, following which there will be no distinction between the accidental andsubstantial changes in the world because every accidental change is caused bysubstantial change. The moving being does not remain the same at themoment of change and throughout the change.For Aristotle, substance is the primary category and is of two kinds:primary and secondary. Primary substance, such as individuals, is neither apredicate of a subject nor in a subject. Secondary substance, such as generaand species, which includes primary substance, is a predicate of a subject in aproposition but not in a subject. All other nine categories are present in thesubject. Substance is also considered a stable nucleus. Changes occur only inthe four categories of quality, quantity, place and position. For this reason,Aristotle talks about four kinds of change: in a being itself, in quality, inquantity and in place. A change involving the being of a thing is generationand corruption; a change in quality is alteration, in quantity it is increase anddecrease, and a change in place is locomotion. These changes will be from acertain status in an entity to its contrary. Substance as the substratum presup-posed by the categories has no contrariety so is not affected by change.16Some Muslim theologians, such as the Mu‘tazilites (with the exception of al-Nazzam), the Ash‘arites, and Muslim Peripatetic Neoplatonic philosopherssuch as al-Farabi and Ibn Sina and his followers, agreed with Aristotle andaccepted the interpretation of the possibility of change in accident. Inrejecting the idea of change in substance, Ibn Sina, for example, states:However, if it is claimed that motion occurs in substance, then this is a figurativeexpression. No motion occurs in substance because if a nature of a substancedeteriorates, it will be sudden. And if it is originated, it is still sudden. There is nomiddle perfection between potency and mere act. Substantial form is not subjectto increase and decrease, nor is it subject to intensity and weakness. The reason isthat if it is subject to these factors, then inevitably either it will remain within theincreasing or decreasing of its species, and the substantial form does not change.Ambiguity of Being and Trans-Substantial Change71"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The change rather occurs in the accident of the form, since what was weak andwas intensified later is annihilated, whereas the substance is not annihilated.17Ibn Sina, in his discussion on the existence of the physical world in al-Shifa,insists that the archetype of the beings remains stable from the beginning tothe end of motion in all situations. If we accept this point, then the substancewill not require change. The resulting change and motion in beings occursonly in one or more than one of the four categories of substance indicated byAristotle.The question that arises here is how can we think of identity when every-thing is subject to constant substantial change? How can we think that a beingwhich undergoes trans-substantial change is the same being or has anidentity? These questions also remind us the problem of personal identitydiscussed by David Hume in his refutation of the Cartesian concept of self-substance. In criticizing the Cartesian theory, Hume argued that nothingremains the same in the world and that resemblance is the cause of themistake in substituting the notion of identity: ‘For when we attribute identity,in an improper sense, to variable or interrupted objects, our mistake is notconfined to the expression, but is commonly attended with a fiction, either ofsomething invariable and uninterrupted, or of something mysterious andinexplicable, or at least with a propensity to such fiction.’18The notion ofpersonal identity in this case is fictitious and a product of our imagination,because the changes that happen in a being are slow and gradual. In trans-substantial change, all beings (corporeal and non-corporeal) changeconstantly. They are originated and renewed at each moment. No single beingremains permanently the same. Every being is different and new at every newmoment. Mulla Sadra’s view regarding this problem is in one respect similarto that of Hume. First, he states that trans-substantial change occurs unnoticedbecause it is gradual and slow. We think that the change has not occurred andthat the being is the same. Second, we attribute sameness to a being becausethe mind employs universal concepts for describing the essences, which arestatic. Trans-substantial change is usually noticed when the being of a beingarrives at a crucial stage of modification or undergoes a sudden change. Inaddition to this, Mulla Sadra believes that the identity of a person relies on theintellectual form of that person, which exists in the mind of God. For God, aperson is the same; otherwise he or she is not the same.19From this interpre-tation, we can conclude that the renewal process of the world is not externallycaused or is not something in contrast to Being. Whatever goes throughchange is one of the modalities of Being, which has a temporal dimension andbelongs to the region of becoming. Since change is the mode of beings, thenBeing, its modalities and the process of becoming are necessarily connected.Change does not take place in beings as an external event; instead, beingsoriginate change internally, and the external conditions, such as being in the72Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"world and being an individuation, facilitate that change. If we understand therelationship between Being and its modalities without making a substantialdistinction between them, all their differences on the ground of their onto-logical unity and identity disappear. A human being, as a combination ofintellect and body, is nothing more than a modality of Being; or, moreprecisely, an individuation of Being aiming at its own transcendence throughthe gateway of self-understanding and approximation to Being. In thisprocess of change, this modality of Being rises above the boundaries of itsown finitude and limitation as it is capable of understanding the meaning ofits own existence and seeks the Truth. It is on the foundation of this ontologyand the gradations of the modalities of Being that the meaning of (humanity)within the intentionality of the upward movement should be understood. Theway in which Mulla Sadra looks at the gradations of the modality of Being inthe trans-substantial change from less perfect to more perfect can be used toaddress humanity in plurality. Within the development of this modalitytowards perfection, and by realizing the end in the ‘perfect human being’, wecome across a range of human existence at different ontological–historicalstages and different kinds of humanity. Particularly in the light of this kind ofchange, it is possible for us to talk about less or more humanity at differentranks of existence in the same way we describe a being as smaller or larger.Mulla Sadra’s ontology, in particular the doctrine of systematic ambiguityof Being, bridges the gulf between monism and pluralism. This can be eluci-dated in considering the principle of identity in difference. Identity is estab-lished on the ground of the reality of Being as a simple reality that containsthe multiplicity of its own modification. The external reality as Being and themodifications of Being, which have less or more of being, are characterizedby unity and diversity. Diversity is a mode of the single and simple reality ofBeing. The multiple modalities of Being do not exist in themselves asseparate realities, as is the case in pluralism. Here, Being is one and all otherthings that exist are the modalities of this reality.Since the systematic ambiguity of Being is nothing more than an increaseor decrease in the intensity of Being, the trans-substantial change is an exis-tential movement. It happens to Being as a change in the intensification ofBeing rather than a change in essence. Nor is change in the categories ofquality and quantity a gradual or continuous intensification of quality andquantity in a particular type of being; it is their replacement by a new one.Here, Mulla Sadra is talking about the definite quality and quantity of abeing.20Intensification of a quality, for example ‘whiteness’ in a body, is notan increase in intensity of the same quality of ‘whiteness’. It is a replacementof the former ‘whiteness’ by another ‘whiteness’ with more intensity in its‘being’ white. This kind of change can be seen as the mutation of the formerdefinite quality and the emergence of a totally new quality. This is the casealso with a definite quantity of ontic beings. In a quantitative change, a newAmbiguity of Being and Trans-Substantial Change73"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"quantity replaces the old quantity. As a result, beings in the world are inconstant change and renewal until they reach their own perfection, where nofurther change is thinkable. What undergoes change but at the same timeendures in this evolutionary process is Being as the being of all beings andtheir unity.21Since beings are the modalities of Being, undergo throughconstant change we can conclude that all kinds of change occur in beings arealso Being and by Being. Being is, therefore, in a self-evolutionary processthat has no cause except Being itself. Being is the origin of change but stillunchangeable. The existential movement of Being begins with emanation or thedescending movement from the realm of unity to the realms of potentialityand multiplicity, which are called the region of ‘becoming’. We also call thisdownward process the particularization of Being. The second phase ofchange, by contrast, is the ascending movement of the particularization ofBeing through trans-substantial change upward towards perfection. Thisdescending–ascending process can also be described as a movement fromperfection to imperfection and then from imperfection to perfection; formBeing to its own particularization and then from the particularization of Beingback to Being. The distinctiveness of this two-fold movement of Being is thatno accidental change takes place without substantial change. Furthermore,the existential movement of Being is both vertical and horizontal. In thevertical direction, the movement is from the lowest rank to the highest and isgoverned by the objective of achieving perfection or arriving at the highestrank of being. Here it seems that Mulla Sadra is in agreement with Proclus(410–485), a Hellenic philosopher of the Anaximander School ofNeoplatonism who subdivides the process of emanation into horizontal andvertical. For both thinkers, the vertical movement ends with arriving at themost perfect state of existence.In his discussion of the ascending process and the vertical movement of allbeings towards the goal of perfection, Mulla Sadra understood the signifi-cance of human existence for the realization of this goal. The foundation ofhuman existence, in the systematic ambiguity of Being, is potentiality.Human existence gradually fulfils itself by moving away from potentiality toactuality. At the start, there is only the realm of pure potentiality emanatedfrom Being, but, in the evolutionary process of vertical trans-substantialchange, human existence moves towards the realm of actuality. The journeyends with the emergence of the perfect human being (al-insan al-kamil), whoattains unity with the Intelligences or divine attributes: ‘These Intelligencesthemselves have little to attain by way of perfection, since all their perfectionsare already realized, for, as Divine Attributes, they are united with God’s exis-tence.’22The other direction of change, namely horizontal movement, deter-mines the transformation of the world through a succession of infinite forms.This movement is infinite in the sense that it has no end and, unlike the74Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"vertical movement, is not determined by the realization of the end. The trans-substantial movement also resembles the idea of the creative evolution advo-cated by Bergson, for whom the world is in a constant, multidimensional andvertical process of creative evolution.Dissatisfied with the mechanistic explanation presented by Laplaceanscientific theory and the Darwinian concept of natural selection, Bergsonargued that ‘mechanism’ was inadequate for understanding reality as itneglected other aspects of reality such as duration and creative evolution. Themechanistic account of evolution was also directionless and an outcome ofmere chance.23For Bergson, the directionality of evolution was a vital field ofconstant renewal and creativity in which ‘duration’ rather than physical timeplayed a significant role in transforming life from a lower to a higher state.Evolution was conceived in terms of an unbroken continuation of life inmultiple directions. Duration, as the temporality of life, was a single indi-visible continuity in which all three elements of past, present and futurebecame integrated parts. To explain this, Bergson presents the analogy ofhuman personality. We are aware of the development in our personality andthis development is not seen as a mechanical change in which one state ofexistence is replaced by another. The change persists and is secured bymemory, which establishes the connection between past, present and future.24The dissimilarities between Mulla Sadra’s trans-substantial change andBergson’s creative evolution arise with directionality and purpose. Theformer kind of change is unidirectional in its vertical movement and culmi-nates in the perfect human being. The latter is multidirectional and infinite.Another dissimilarity is in the teleological conception of evolution in trans-substantial change, which is that evolution fulfils a predetermined plan ofBeing. In contrast, creative evolution in Bergson’s philosophy is a constantgrowth, like a snowball rolling down a slope. This growth is also without apredetermined purpose and is thus an ontological foundation for free will.Mulla Sadra’s doctrine of trans-substantial change is directly related to thenotion of time and the temporality of the ontic beings in the world. It leads atthe same time to the problem of the creation of the world in time. In thehistory of Islamic thought the Qur’anic paradigm of ‘creation ex nihilo’,which is in contradiction to the Hellenistic principle of ‘ex nihilo nihil fit’,created a problem for some Muslim thinkers. Al-Kindi (d. 866) for exampleused Aristotelian principles and self-evident propositions in order to demon-strate the finitude of the world and to vindicate the Qur’anic paradigm ofcreation ex nihilo.25For al-Kindi and the adherents of the Qur’anic paradigm,the world had a beginning and was created in time by God. Al-Farabi and IbnSina found a solution to this contradiction between the Qur’anic paradigm of‘creation ex nihilo’ and the Hellinistic principle in the doctrine of emanationprovided by Plotinus, which enabled them to argue that the world was createdneither ex nihilonor from the eternal prime matter of Aristotle, but emanatedAmbiguity of Being and Trans-Substantial Change75"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"from God eternally. In trans-substantial change, the creation of the world isviewed from the perspective of the doctrine of emanation, but at the sametime this perspective is not void of problems. It is also important to under-stand that in Mulla Sadra’s ontology the world is an event and is originated,which means that it is temporal. At the same time, the emanation of the worldstill appears to be a-temporal simply because God, who is the efficient causeand the source of the emanation, is eternal and not in time. God’s time, asstated by Mir Damad, the teacher of Mulla Sadra, is eternal ‘sarmad’.26Inaddition to this conception of time, Mir Damad refers to ‘dahr’ perpetuity and‘zaman’ cosmological time as two different forms of time belonging to twodifferent spheres of Being. Dahrdescribes the relation between theunchangeable divine attributes and the sensible world. Zamanis used for thetemporality of the ontic beings in the sensible world. Zaman, therefore,cannot exist without the world and did not exist before the creation of materialobjects. The sensible world, which exists in zamanand depends on the divineattributes to exist, is outside the sphere of dahrand sarmad, whereas thedivine attributes are in dahrbut not in zaman.27Since the creation of the worldis in zaman, and the sensible world is real, zamanshould also have anobjective reality. It cannot be a mere subjective notion in the Kantian sense.Mulla Sadra accepted the division of time by his teacher, but believed that itrequired further investigation. On one hand, time is said not to exist objec-tively. On the other hand, the relation of time to the existential movement inthe world provides an ontological ground for the objectivity of time. One canclaim that, since existential movement is objective, time as the measure ofthat movement is also objective. Even the notion of time, which is subjectiveand exists only in the mind, should be caused by something external and musthave a connection with the objective existential movement in the world. This,however, does not mean that time is a quality of the existential movement. Itshould also be remembered that we cannot think of time without the exis-tential movement in the world.28Since the emanation of the world from thedivine attributes of God did not happen in zamanbecause zamanis not priorto the creation of the world, the world is, then, a-temporally originated.In trans-substantial change, the only being not affected is Being, becauseBeing is pure actuality and perfect. It can still be argued, however, that sincethe world is originated from Being and is part of it, then it is Being thatchanges and transforms itself by itself into its own modalities. This view isalso the foundation of the mystic conviction held by some Sufis, who rejectedthe dichotomy of reality and appearance. From this understanding of time itshould be clear that Mulla Sadra’s concept of the temporality of the world isdifferent from the concept of the creation of the world in time. Here the worldis not in time but exists with time or is substantially temporal. The sensibleworld and time co-exist and belong together. Temporality is not an indicationof the beginning and the end of the world because the world does not end in76Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Mulla Sadra’s ontological interpretation. Temporality is simply the measureof trans-substantial change, and the origination of the world should be under-stood as a consequence of this change. Every moment in this trans-substantialchange is a beginning as well as an end, in this constant and endless process ofchange. The world is, therefore, endless or eternal but does not stay the same,since the creation of a new substance is the annihilation of the previous one.The world is temporal as it goes through change but is a-temporal becausechange is permanent and remains for ever; it does not fall into the abyss ofnothingness. In each moment there is a being that did not exist before, and thisdetermines the temporal dimension of existence.Without the objective existence of the existential movement there will notbe an objective space–time continuum. The objectivity of time is a logicalrequirement of the objectivity of the existential movement of Being. At thispoint, Mulla Sadra’s view contradicts Ibn Sina’s understanding of the subjec-tivity of the notion of time, which is derived from movement as continuity orpassage from the beginning to the end as a whole.29But does this mean thattime is something real? If it is real, we need to assert its objectivity just as theobjectivity of the world is asserted. But Mulla Sadra insists that time is notindependent of the existential movement of Being. It is not like a container inwhich all events occur. It is one of the dimensions of the world that cannot beseparated from it.30Elsewhere he states that the existential movement ofBeing is not different from time because ‘the measure and the measured arethe same’.31On one hand, Mulla Sadra believes that time is not independentof the existential movement of the world and not something real like a being;on the other hand, he identifies time as the measure of the trans-substantialchange that accompanies the existential movement. In this way Mulla Sadra’sinterpretation of time is different from that of his predecessors. Time isneither subjective nor objective, because it is not a mere concept or a fancythat has no representation in the external world. nor can it be seen as some-thing that exists outside human thinking. Time is, rather, a subjective–objective, existential and non-existential dimension of reality. It is themeasure of an objective existential movement, and an inherent function of theworld, which is conceived intellectually.Time is also eternal. The temporality of time is eternity for two reasons:first is emanation, through which the world came into existence and which iseternal. Second, whatever is thought to be prior to time is necessarily in time,because priority involves time.32Time, in this respect, is distinct from space,because the finitude of space does not involve space beyond space. The notionof time prior to time involves real time because, as Mulla Sadra believes, thereality of time is in the mind.33Here, Mulla Sadra thinks of time as somethingsubjective. Does his notion of subjectivity prove time to be an essencebecause essence for him is an intellectual property? Time is not a meresubjective notion; it has a reality of its own as well. In this case, the status ofAmbiguity of Being and Trans-Substantial Change77"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"time is not like that of essence. For this reason, Mulla Sadra insists that time issomething positive and has a peculiar existence, and has an essence as well.34Time, therefore, has existence as well as essence. The existence of time is thereality of time inherent in the trans-substantial movement of Being, while itsessence, or the mental concept of time, is the relational factor of the conti-nuity.35Mulla Sadra does not claim that time is subjective or objective; it isonly from his conceptions of the systematic ambiguity of Being and trans-substantial change that we arrive at this inference.To return to the differences between Mulla Sadra’s and Heidegger’sontology, one is that this Muslim philosopher accepted the doctrine ofemanation. For Mulla Sadra, the world emanated or originated from PureBeing. Emanation can be seen as a temporal origination of the world, aseverything in the world is determined by trans-substantial movement. Allbeings in the world go through change and are preceded by the temporal non-existence of their beings. Ontic beings continually come into existence andpass away. Every moment in this substantial change is death and rebirth of thesame being with a new substance and a new form. Death exists only in thissense as a constant substantial change. Non-being, like being, becomes thereality of all beings. The world is, thus, a temporal surfacing of the reality ofBeing, which continues eternally. It is a temporal origination from a non-temporal origin. The temporal originality of the world and the notion ofperpetual trans-substantial change seem to contradict one another. It is statedon one hand that the world is originated and on the other Mulla Sadra insistson the idea permenant change. Here, perpetuity does not mean that the worldis eternal in the sense that it has no beginning, or that everything existed eter-nally without beginning. If the world is in a state of flux, nothing will remainperpetual, and only in this regard can we say that the world is in constantchange and renewal. This interpretation is also doomed to failure, because thevertical direction of existential movement has a definite objective end. Thetrans-substantial change ceases when it reaches the highest rank of its exis-tence and perfection. In addition, nothing attains or rises above the supremelevel of the ontological rank of Being, and change does not govern beings,which are pure actuality. If we consider an immaterial being such as‘intellect’ to be entirely actuality without potentiality, the intellect will notchange. Change is a movement from potentiality to actuality but not in anAristotelian sense because it includes change in substance. It is for this reasonthat Pure Being and the divine attributes are not affected by change.Potentiality is the state of imperfection while actuality is not. What doesMulla Sadra mean by perpetual change? Does he mean that the realm ofpotentiality and multiplicity remains eternally? Does this movement end byattaining perfection or the highest possible rank of existence?Since emanation is thought to be eternal and constant, it seems that‘becoming’, in Mulla Sadra’s systematic ambiguity of Being, is endless. In78Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"their various ontological ranks, ontic beings differ in their intensity, priority,posteriority, perfection and imperfection. They succeed one another verticallyas well as horizontally. There will be a beginning and an end for an onticbeing that exists at a particular time and space but that is not the case withBeing as the inner reality of that ontic being, because trans-substantial changewill elevate this being from a lower to a higher rank of existence with a newsubstance and form. There is a constant substantial change, which gives a newidentity to the existents at every moment. In the region of becoming, nothingremains the same and nothing resists the stream of this continuous flux andrenewal. Finality can be achieved only in the realm of unity with Pure Being.In the ontological region of history truth, knowledge and moral values, underthe impact of this flux of becoming, also change constantly. Nothing in thehuman world can be seen as eternally existent. Another important point isthat, with this great novelty in the world, trans-substantial change, like thedialectical movement in Hegel’s philosophy, is necessary and determines theprogress towards perfection without leaving individuals room for free choice.This point can be challenged, however, on the same ground as in Hegel’sphilosophy: since trans-substantial change occurs in Being by Being, it isself-determined and hence a free existential movement. Freedom in this caseis interpreted on the ground of necessity. The plausibility of this argument is,however, in the premise that the changeable world is not to be different fromwhat determines the change. But what determines the change is not individualfree will. It is something beyond that, which brings everything under its owndetermination. This argument is better understood in the light of Hegel’scategory of being-for-itself. In the sphere of ‘Determinate Being’ in his logic,there are two dialectical aspects: being-in-itself (positive) and being-for-other(negative). These two aspects unite and their union becomes True Infinite.The essential character of this new category is being-for-itself.36The newcategory is without external limitation and its otherness is not somethingother than itself. Consciousness, for example, as being-for-itself, is self-consciousness. It is aware of itself as well as the external world. The externalworld, at the same time, is nothing but the self-manifestation ofconsciousness. It is idea in its otherness. In this case the contradictionsbetween consciousness and the external world (its otherness) are negated andconsciousness becomes self-related and a being-for-itself. It has no othernessand no external limitation. This is thought to be a necessary ground forfreedom in Hegel’s philosophy. Similarly in Mulla Sadra’s ontology beingdetermines its own modalities and transforms them constantly.The existential movement of the world is not blind or capricious. It is for apurpose. Being, which is identical with God in Mulla Sadra’s onto-theology,has no direct causal relationship with this continuity or with the trans-substantial change of its own modalities. There is an intrinsic motive vehicleresponsible for accomplishing this task. This motive is the mystic force ofAmbiguity of Being and Trans-Substantial Change79"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"love (‘ishq), which is present in everything and creates in lower-ranked beingsthe desire to long for beings in the higher ranks of existence. The notion oflove as the main force in the world depicts a mystic (Sufi) influence on MullaSadra’s metaphysical thinking. Before Mulla Sadra, Ibn Sina expressedsimilar views in Risala fil ‘Ishq(A Treatise on Love), in which he stated thatall entities in the world, including matter, move under the sway of cosmiclove.37The relationship between the self and the Reality in Sufism is primor-dially emotional rather than theoretical. It is the emotional motive (‘ishq)which leads to the rise of the mystic way of cognition (ma‘rifah). Theemotional motive is not only primordial; it is also the ontological constitutionof the world, including the self. Ibn Sina also believed that the self was bornwith this intrinsic motive: ‘Ardent love is innate’ all things flow from God in aprocess of necessary emanation and return to Him in a process of necessarylove.’38The primacy of emotion, however, does not nullify the significance ofcognition. The self can approach Reality passionately without appropriatingit epistemologically. It is also this emotional motive that elevates the self tothe stage where it can experience Reality.Mulla Sadra is in agreement with Ibn Sina that even prime matter isinfected by love. His argument supporting this idea is based on the positivityof prime matter. Prime matter is the realm of potentiality and potentiality issomething positive, or that which exists. Being is a reality commonly sharedby all existents, including prime matter. To all beings, whether at the level ofpotentiality or actuality, the divine attributes (knowledge, will and power)function with various degrees of intensity. These attributes belong to Beingor the inner reality of all beings. Prime matter, which is at the bottom of thedescending process of emanation and is considered to be pure potentiality, iscapable of receiving forms and becoming actual. More specifically, it haslonging and affection for forms. This mystic love penetrates all modalities ofbeing as a motive to assist their progress towards perfection. It prevailseverywhere, and wherever there is existence there will be love and longingfor perfection.39In clarifying this point, Fazlur Rahman remarks that thedegree of intensity of ‘love’ is not only in consciousness, such as in humanbeings. It also exists equally in all beings. Matter, as the most deficient andlowly ranked of all beings, should have a high degree of intensity of ‘love’for the higher ranks.40As a consequence, the world, including inanimatebeings, can be seen as a loving body with various degrees of intensity of loveand longing for perfection. When human beings attain unity with Intellectsor divine attributes through the form of the perfect human being, theiryearning reaches the point of satisfaction. They no longer yearn for a higherrank of existence, because their longing for perfection will no longer exist.The world is, therefore, characterized by renewal; the things and events ofthe past are in the past and those of the future are yet to come.

It cannot be denied that the doctrineexpounded by Mulla Sadra changes our understanding of the two religiousnotions and also opens a discussion on the transmigration of the soul. Thetransmigration of the soul has been discussed in the history of Muslimphilosophy by Muslim philosophers such as Abu Bakr al-Razi, Ibn Sina andSuhrawardi, in addition to Mulla Sadra. They raised the possibility of thetransmigration of the soul from one species to another, for example the humansoul to animals or plants. Of particular importance to Mulla Sadra’s ideas isSuhrawardi’s understanding of this question. Suhrawardi deals with the trans-migration of the soul in several books, but in Hikmat al-Ishraqhe argues thathuman bodies are in a position to receive a managing rational soul ormanaging light, while animals receive only imperfect human souls:Whatever moral habit captures the commanding light, whatever dark statebecomes established in it and becomes its support, the commanding light musttransfer its attachment after the corruption of its fortress to a fortress corre-sponding to that dark state: a fortress of one of the brute animals. When thecommanding light departs from the human fortress, it is darkened and desirous ofdarkness. It does not know its source or the world of light. Wicked states havebecome fixed in it, and it is drawn to the brute fortress of other animals, and thedarkness beckons to it.41Suhrawardi argues for the transmigration of the soul by insisting that thecondition of life after death is dependent on the balance of knowledge andaction in the previous life. With regard to the new form obtained by the humansoul, he puts forward the notion of ‘suspended forms’ (suwar al-mu‘allaqa).These forms, like the Platonic forms, are transcendent but are not in theimmutable rank of existence. Some are dark (evil) and some luminous (good).After death, the wicked souls, those that failed to live a balanced life betweenknowledge and action, are gathered in hell and deprived of their suspendedform in accordance with their character in the previous life.42Shahrazuri, thedisciple of Suhrawardi, clarifies the position of his master by saying thatSuhrawardi accepted the transmigration of the human soul to an animal body,but rejected the transmigration of the human soul into plants and they will begiven bodies of the lower rank of existence.43When we come to discuss trans-migration in Mulla Sadra’s philosophy, particularly in the light of trans-substantial change, we expect him to argue against it. Trans-substantialchange is an irreversible progress and cannot be seen as a movement from amore perfect or developed to a less perfect and undeveloped rank of existence.A being, like a human soul in a developed human body, is not expected to takeAmbiguity of Being and Trans-Substantial Change81"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"an animal body, which is less perfect than a human body and is at a lower rankof being. In other words, demotion in trans-substantial change is not onlyabsurd but impossible.44Mulla Sadra’a denial of the transmigration of thesoul, according to Fazlur Rahman, is beset with a problem. In Islam, thenotion of bodily resurrection implies the transmigration of the soul in so far asit is thought to be a reunion of the soul with a new body.45Mulla Sadra’streatment of this matter takes the middle position between the views of thosewho believe in the survival of the intellect after death, and those who acceptthe survival of the body as well. He explains that in the afterlife the humanintellect is able to apprehend the general ideas in the rational realm in the wayit apprehends and perceives different physical objects in this world. But theapprehended general ideas are not mere concepts without a reality of theirown. They are real, ontological and identical with actual existence, and areexperienced by the human intellect. What then happens to the human body atdeath? Is it disjoined from the soul and does it then decay? Will the humansoul be given a new body? To answer these questions Mulla Sadra, likeSuhrawardi, talks about the World of the Images (‘alam al-khayal). Thebodies of the undeveloped souls, the souls that have committed sins, deteri-orate at the time of death and are not reassembled as before. In order tosurvive physically, they create a material body for themselves by external-izing their inner psychic states in the form of a body in the World of theImages. Thus a human soul that is guilty of committing a sin will imagineitself as an animal.46The important questions that arise here are: what is thedestiny of the human soul that has gone through trans-substantial change? AmI the same sinner of yesterday who committed a sin to be punished or substan-tially transformed into another human being? If I am not the same person,why should I be punished for the sins committed by me in the past? There is,no doubt, a problem here. But Mulla Sadra provides two different answers tothese questions. On one hand, he believes that the identity of a person relieson the intellectual form of that person, which exists in the mind of God.47Onthe other hand, the soul is thought to survive throughout the evolutionarychanges, and that this helps the person to retain an identity.48This solution,which has similarity with Descartes’s view on the human soul as the self-substance, is in my opinion in contradiction with the implication of the trans-substantial change.The philosophical consequences of trans-substantial change can besummarized in three points: the temporal contingency of the world; theinfection of being by non-being or nothingness; and the relativity of truth andvalues.Mulla Sadra demonstrates that the world is in constant substantial change.This ontological view is an indication of the non-being of beings that have notyet come into existence. Non-being or nothingness is at the heart of the world.That is to say, an existent is preceded by its own non-existence.49The passage82Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"of being into non-being and of non-being into being is ‘becoming’, which wasalso demonstrated by Hegel and discussed earlier, and in contradiction ofAristotle’s understanding of Nothingness. In Aristotle’s ontology, non-beingis neither in motion nor at rest, because for non-being to move it should be ina place, which it is not, and if it were it would be somewhere.50Mulla Sadraseems to have borrowed the idea of coming-into-being from Mir Damad.Sabzawari, in explaining the relationship between eternities and becoming intime, states that becoming through perpetual duration or constant creationwas proposed by Mir Damad. He further maintains that, for Mir Damad, thecoming-into-being of the world by way of becoming through perpetualduration is a temporal coming-into-existence, or ‘the precedence of“preceding non-existence” over the existence of a thing by way of separableprecedence of it, i.e., of the non-existence’.51This is an interesting point inHegel’s logic as well as in the phenomenological interpretation of thestructure of consciousness in Sartre’s Being and Nothingness. Being, forHegel, is an undeduced beginning and pure because it has no determination orqualification. It is the most abstract category in his dialectical logic. It isnothing more than a simple ‘isness’.52Since this undeduced beginning has notpassed over into another or its opposition, it is self-identical. When itproduces its opposite it undergoes change and becomes different. But sayingthat Being is an immediacy and has no determination except ‘isness’ impliesmere emptiness and the equivalent of ‘Nothing’ or non-being.53Being,therefore, becomes the birthplace of nothingness, and the two categoriesbecome the first two oppositions in Hegel’s logic holding the relationship ofidentity in difference. When ‘Being’ and ‘Nothingness’ pass over into oneanother they produce the category of ‘becoming’. When understood in thelight of the dialectical interpretation in Hegel’s logic, the meaning and signif-icance of becoming as an important category in Mulla Sadra’s ontology canbe grasped. It is a process that involves being and nothingness. Being of abeing is subsequent to its nothingness; this is the temporal origination of theontic being in the realm of potentiality and diversity. Sartre also deals with theproblem of Nothingness in detail. But, unlike Mulla Sadra and Hegel, heinsists that Pure Being cannot become the source of Nothingness and that theonly being responsible for bringing nothingness into the world with itself isconsciousness. This is described by Sartre in Being and Nothingness asfollows:We perceived that nothingness can be conceived neither outside of being, nor as acomplementary, abstract notion, nor as an infinite milieu where Being issuspended. Nothingness must be given at the heart of being, in order for us to beable to apprehend that particular type of realities which we have called négatités.But this intra-mundane Nothingness cannot be produced by Being-in-itself; thenotion of Being as full positivity does not contain Nothingness as one of its struc-tures. We cannot even say that Being excludes it. Being lacks all relations to it.Ambiguity of Being and Trans-Substantial Change83"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Hence the question which is put to us now with a particular urgency: ifNothingness can be conceived neither outside of Being, nor in terms of Being,and if on the other hand, since it is non-being, it cannot derive from itself thenecessary force to ‘nihilate itself’, where does Nothingness come from?54To prove his point, Sartre gives the example of finding Pierre in the caféwhere Sartre tries to say that Nothingness is experienced by consciousness.Satre also argues with Kant’s view that negation is the quality of a judgment(proposition), and Nothingness is logically prior to negation; that we expe-rience Nothingness and negation before making a judgment.55The distinctionbetween the existentialist views of Mulla Sadra and Sartre is in the origin orbirthplace of Nothingness. Mulla Sadra insists that all contingent beings,including the human intellect, are preceded by their own non-existence in theworld. For Sartre, Nothingness is a characteristic of the ontological structureof consciousness. The being of non-conscious being is not infected byNothingness.As far as the distinction between Being and Nothingness is concerned, it isclear, at least for Sartre, that both can be experienced intuitively as two real-ities. In Hegel’s dialectical logic, they pass over into one another and theircausal relationship can be recognized. But what is the distinction between onenon-being (nothingness) and another? Is there a causal relationship betweenthem? Mulla Sadra does not engage in this discussion, but Sabzawari, one ofthe followers of Mulla Sadra, says that the distinction between non-beings isimaginary and they have no causal relationship: a non-being cannot be acause for another non-being. Is it possible, then, to say that the non-being ofclouds is a cause for the non-being of rain? Or that the non-existence ofoxygen is a cause for the non-being of human life? Sabzawari would say thatsuch statements, which show the causal connection between two non-beings,are only the realization of the absence of beings such as the non-presence ofclouds and rain, and that in reality we are not dealing with non-being or noth-ingness.56But when we study read Sartre we find out that the realization of thenon-presence of a being, as in the case of searching for Pierre in the café, is alegitimate ground for experiencing the non-being of Pierre. It is the non-beingor non-presence of Pierre that produces a negative proposition such as ‘Thereis no Pierre in the café’. If we go back to the causal relationship between thenon-existence of oxygen in space and the non-existence of human life and saythat ‘Such a void is the cause of death’, we are making an affirmative propo-sition that explicates the causal relationship between two non-beings in anaffirmative way. Meanwhile, we cannot deny that every affirmation is anegation. Void, here, can be understood as the absence of oxygen; so that thenon-being of oxygen in space causes death or the non-being of life.Sabzawari’s argument for the non-existence of the causal relationshipbetween non-beings can thus be refuted.84Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Another philosophical consequence is that trans-substantial change leadsto the relativity of truth and values. The doctrine of trans-substantial changedeconstructs the metaphysical foundation of universal truth and values, asnothing is considered to be eternal and stable in the world. Everything is inconstant change, including human society and our understanding of reality.As a consequence of this, no system of belief can claim to be absolute andfinal, because the novelty prevails. This consequence also had a profoundimpact on Mulla Sadra’s understanding of politics, in particular politicalIslam, which proclaims the divinity and universality of its discourse. MullaSadra made a vivid distinction between religion and politics or between reli-gious laws and political laws and rejected the identity of the former with thelatter. Religious laws are characterized by generality and necessity, andpolitical laws by particularity and dependence on the human situation.57Thisdistinction between religion and politics in Mulla Sadra’s philosophy standsin contradiction to Shi‘ite political thought, which claims a necessary linkbetween religion and politics, and states that no true Islamic political systemis established without religious laws. A true Islamic political system ispossible on the foundation of the religious laws and the presence of an imam(a spiritual leader and a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad) to implementthe law. Although Mulla Sadra is a Shi’ite thinker and accepts the doctrine ofthe imamate, he still believes in constant change in nature and history. Forhim, however, trans-substantial change rules over both nature and history;ontology and social system are necessarily interconnected. It is not possibleto understand Mulla Sadra’s political philosophy without understanding hismetaphysics. For him, as for Hegel, metaphysics is the foundation of allnatural and historical phenomena.58Any socio-political system existing at any stage of human history is notfinal and should be superseded by a social system richer and more perfect incontent. According to Mulla Sadra, in a perfect society all members livetogether in harmony and cooperate to achieve the highest good and the fullrealization of Truth. In contrast, in an imperfect society the members coop-erate to execute evil.59Since change is the essential characteristic of theworld, the imperfect society should also be seen in the light of the evolu-tionary process of the existential movement of the world. The evolutionaryprocess of the world is towards perfection rather than deterioration. MullaSadra’s view on political leadership in a perfect society is similar to that of al-Farabi in Mabadi Ara Ahl al-Madina al-Fadila. Al-Farabi, like Mulla Sadra,makes his metaphysical interpretation of reality the foundation of his politicalphilosophy. The socio-political system in a ‘perfect society’ needs to functionin harmony with the system of the universe designed by the First Cause. Foral-Farabi, this interconnection is founded on the doctrine of emanation.Following this doctrine, al-Farabi places his view of the relationship betweenthe state and civil society in the hierarchy of the system of the universe, inAmbiguity of Being and Trans-Substantial Change85"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"which the emanation of various forms of being flows from the First Cause.This metaphysical structure is a political model.60The diversity of emanationrepresents varying social groups and political institutions, which are subordi-nated to the authority or to the will of the supreme statesman. Mulla Sadra,like al-Farabi, holds the view that a leader of the perfect society should besomeone of sound mind and body who has attained the rank of actualintellect:That man [the leader] is a person over whom nobody has any sovereignty what-soever. He is a man who has reached his perfection and has become actualintellect and actual being thought (intelligized), his representative faculty havingby nature reached its utmost perfection in the way stated by us; this faculty of hisis predisposed by nature to receive, either in waking life or in sleep, from theActive Intellect the particulars, either as they are or by imitating them, and alsothe intelligibles, by imitating them. His Passive Intellect will have reached itsperfection by [having apprehended] all the intelligibles, so that none of them iskept back from it, and it will have become actual intellect and actual beingthought.61The leader of the perfect society is not the lawmaker but the executor of thelaw, which is divine and pre-given. Like the ruling organ in the human body,the leader is chiefly responsible for the rise and fall of state and society. Thebearer of such responsibility must further possess two kinds of qualities:natural (inborn) and acquired. Natural qualities are beyond one’s capacity tochoose or acquire after birth. For example, the statesman cannot choosewhich family or situation to be born into. The prime inborn quality, whichprecedes all other qualities, is that a statesman is born as an imam; in theShi‘ite context, he should be a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, a malefrom his household, ahl al-Bayt:This is the sovereign over whom no other human being has any sovereignty what-soever; he is the imam, he is the first sovereign of the excellent city, he is thesovereign of the excellent nation, and the sovereign of the universal state (theoikumene).62Although al-Farabi does not mention in Arathat the leader should be from ahlal-bayt, it is clear that the notion of the imam, which is explicitly expressed inAra, logically presupposes this understanding of leadership. The imam is theonly statesman qualified to lead a perfect society, politically as well as spiri-tually. He is a leader who is granted revelation or is in contact with God,receiving inspiration from the First Principle to guide his perfect society. ForMulla Sadra, the leader should be a theosopher (hakim) who, on attainingperfection in all intellectual faculties, becomes a prophet.63This view seemsincompatible with Mulla Sadra’s idea of the distinction between religion andpolitics. The leader as theosopher and prophet in a perfect society has reli-86Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"gious as well as political authority. His rule becomes the execution of thedivine will and law. The compatibility of religion and politics belongs to therealm of becoming, where nothing remains stable, or where politics, likereligion, becomes universal. But since nothing escapes trans-substantialchange, religion and politics must each go through change from a less perfectto a more perfect stage of existence.64The purpose of political life, in theperfect society, is spiritual salvation, so the political order will be divinelyoriented and the state will be based on the divine creeds. Mulla Sadra’sanalysis of politics is, in the light of his metaphysics, an intellectual attempt toexplain the place of human beings in the world for achieving collectivism anddivinity. He believes that politics is the social sphere where the individual soulexperiences belonging to a social system and works with other individuals fora better form of collective life.65He also believes that the leadership in theperfect society is the real guardian of social justice and the divine laws.66Political life is, therefore, imperative in the evolutionary process of existence.The achievement of perfection and the realization of Truth are possible inhistory. The worldly life is a ladder to ascend to another form of living in theHereafter as another aspect of existence.As mentioned earlier, Muslim philosophers before Mulla Sadra, under theinfluence of Aristotle, tended to acknowledge the reality of change only in theform of accidentality. For Mulla Sadra what was foremost in his mind waschange in the form of becoming, with substantial and accidental changes. Hisnovel interpretation of the world is a genuinely innovative philosophicalproject which involves the development of a new intellectual outlook,conceptual framework and values. The task of philosophy is to activelyinterpret reality rather than give a mere conceptual translation of it. Toachieve this, the creative interpretation should break from tradition andprepare the way for the future. Next, in the light of this innovative interpre-tation, Mulla Sadra’s existential philosophy proves to be far from infected bydogmatism and prejudice, because for him every philosophical convictionremains transitory. Virtually everything about the world, human society, truth,values and knowledge, becomes a prey to change and nothing is immutable inthe world except novelty.Ambiguity of Being and Trans-Substantial Change87"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXMulla Sadra and the Problem ofKnowledgeThis chapter contains an account of Mulla Sadra’s theory of knowledge. Fromthe outset, it should be remembered that the problem of knowledge in MullaSadra’s philosophy developed out of his ontological system. I also argue that hisepistemology should be understood in the light of his interpretation of reality.The doctrine of the primacy of Being is the foundation of the possibility ofknowledge. It suggests that in order to know something we need to begin withits existence. Being becomes an ontological condition for knowing. To makethis issue more adequately appropriated, our task will be at the start to trace thenotion of intuitive knowledge in the history of Muslim philosophy, which playsa significant role in Mulla Sadra’s epistemology, and then continues with anexplanation of Mulla Sadra’s understanding of knowledge and its source.Before Mulla Sadra, Muslim philosophers such as Ibn Sina, Suhrawardiand the Sufis advocated the idea that reality should be apprehended directlyby intuition rather than by rationalistic discourse. Because Mulla Sadra’streatment of the problem of knowledge is so similar to Suhrawardi’s, it isdifficult to make a distinction between them. Nevertheless, what is appre-hended by intuition for Mulla Sadra is the reality of Being rather thanessence. Being and knowledge are not two different things, but are inter-twined. Being, by revealing itself or being revealed, renders knowledgepossible and knowledge makes the truth of Being comprehensible.Intuition is the source of knowledge for Ibn Sina. Knowledge is obtainedintuitively by the human mind when it comes into contact with the externalreality; the active intellect responds by providing the content of intuition. Thecontent of intuition, as Kant also states in his Critique of Pure Reason, isprovided from outside. However, Kant does not deal with the external sourceof knowledge in a mystical way. For him, the faculties of sensibility andunderstanding are limited and determined by the external content of thephenomenal world and by the subjective necessary conditions or forms suchas space and time, in the case of sensibility, and the table of the categories inthe case of understanding. Also, for Ibn Sina and Kant, the human mind isempty without the given external content, and knowledge is possible as theresult of the interaction between internal and external conditions. To clarifythis point, Ibn Sina uses the metaphor of a mirror, saying that the human mindbefore acquiring knowledge is like a tarnished mirror, which can be polishedby knowledge if it is turned to the light of the sun (the active intellect).1The88"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"human mind then acquires knowledge by intuition and does not rely on thephenomenal world as do sense-experience or rationalistic discourse forobtaining intuitive knowledge. This kind of knowledge, as Majid Fakhryremarks, ‘stems from that supernatural or supermundane agency, whichgoverns all the process of generation and corruption, including the process ofcognition, in this world, i.e., the active intellect’.2Acquiring knowledge by intuition varies from individual to individual.Those who get closer to the active intellect are enlightened by attaining theintelligible forms stored in the active intellect, and rely totally on intuitiveknowledge rather than discursive knowledge to reach the rank of theprophethood.3Intuitive knowledge is, therefore, not the product of the humanintellect but springs from a divine source. It is the radiation of the activeintellect upon the intellect of the seekers of the truth. Here, Ibn Sina makes adistinction between four types of human beings: the highest are those whohave acquired prophecy and can create miracles due to the development oftheir intuitive and their imaginative power and their contact with the activeintellect. The second type includes those who have developed their intuitivebut not their imaginative powers. The third type is those who have developedtheir theoretical power but not their practical power. Finally, there are thehuman beings who have developed only their practical power.4Another important thinker after Ibn Sina is Suhrawardi, to be discussedhere, whose epistemology had a significant impact on Mulla Sadra. Asmentioned in Chapter Two, this Muslim thinker is critical of discursiveknowledge and, like Ibn Sina, relies on intuition or knowledge by illumi-nation (ishraq); Nevertheless he does not discard discursive knowledge. Heeven finds sense-perception necessary for acquiring knowledge as he believesthat there are certain things which can be known only by perception.Suhrawardi’s epistemology, discussed in Hikmat al-Ishraqand al-Mutarahat, begins with a critical evaluation of Arsitotle’s analysis ofknowledge by definition. Against Aristotle, he argues that knowledge by defi-nition does not necessarily include the essential characteristics of an entity.Other non-essential qualities or attributes should also be taken into account.He develops an argument against the definition of definition as ‘definitio fitper genus proximum et differentiam specificam’, or connotative definition.His argument, however, is grounded on the idea that certain things cannot bedefined in accordance with this rule in Aristotelian logic. To render definitionpossible, Aristotle insists on the point that a genus plus a differentiaarerequired. When human beings are defined as ‘rational animals’, rationalitybecomes a differentiaand animal a genus. But ‘colour’, for instance, cannotbe known by definition because it is a genus without differentia. It is a simpleidea and a simple truth that has nothing other than itself to become a predicatefor.5This view of Suhrawardi is reminiscent of G. E. Moore’s argumentagainst the definition of goodness. In Principia EthicaMoore states:The Problem of Knowledge89"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"My point is that ‘good’ is a simple notion, just as ‘yellow’ is a simple notion; that,just as you cannot, by any manner of means, explain to anyone who does notalready know it, what yellow is, so you cannot explain what good is. Definitionsof the kind that I was asking for, definitions which describe the real nature of theobject or notion denoted by a word, and which do not merely tell us what theword is used to mean, are only possible when the object or notion in question issomething complex. You can give a definition of a horse, because a horse hasmany different properties and qualities all of which you can enumerate. But whenyou have enumerated them all, when you have reduced a horse to his simplestterms, then you can no longer define those terms.6Mehdi Amin Razavi believes that Suhrawardi’s criticism of knowledge bydefinition is a ‘radical departure from Aristotle.’7In my opinion, Suhrawardi’spoint of view, which is similar to that of Moore, was originally from Socrates(Socrates’ view on definition is discussed in Plato’s Meno). In this dialogue,Socrates presents the ground for definition as a response to questions such as‘What is excellence?’ or ‘What is health?’ In answering these questions,Socrates tries to define a term first by stating what is common to it. In thiscase, Aristotle’s later definition of genus with differentiais one of the possibleways but not the only way of defining a term:Well, is it only concerning excellence that you think this, Meno, that there is oneexcellence of a man, another of a woman and so on; or do you think the sameabout health, too, and size and strength? Do you think health is one thing in aman, another in a woman? Or is it the same pattern everywhere if indeed it ishealth, whether it is in a man or in anything else whatever?8Socrates also remarks that in some cases there are other ways of defining thesame thing. For example, in defining figure, colour, smell or taste, we cannotfollow the previous rule of definition, because no differentiais involved indefining these terms:What then is this which has this name ‘shape’? Try to say. Suppose you said tothe person who asked you in this way either about shape or colour, ‘I don’t evenunderstand what you mean, sir, nor yet do I know what you are saying’; perhapshe would be surprised and say, ‘Don’t you understand that I am looking for whatis the same in the case of all these?’ Or would you not even be able to answer inthis case, Meno, if someone were to ask you ‘What is it that is the same in thecase of all these, the curved and straight and all the other things that you callshapes?’ Try to say, so that you can indeed practise for the answer concerningexcellence.9In defining figure or colour, Socrates thinks of the second alternative, that ofassuming the definition of terms such as figure or colour not by a genus anddifferentiabecause they do not have differentiae. Suhrawardi also, likeSocrates, believes that colour is pure genus without differentia, and thereforeshould be known by another cognitive tool directly, namely perception rather90Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"than definition. This introduces the role and significance of sense-perceptionin Suhrawardi’s epistemology.According to this Muslim thinker, knowledge by definition is not free ofshortcomings. All aspects and qualities of a term are not revealed in a defi-nition. There will always be unknown aspects of the entities defined that arenot given in a definition. The human mind, therefore, will not be able tocognize the truth of an entity completely by definition. In order to surmountthe shortcoming of knowledge by definition, Suhrawardi also talks aboutinnate ideas. He insists that every kind of knowledge begins with a sort ofknowledge about the object of inquiry. It is not possible to begin an investi-gation into the nature of an entity without having any idea about it at all. It istrue that an inquiry begins with a conviction that we do not know enoughabout the object we inquire about. For this reason the inquiry is carried out.Meanwhile we do know something about it. Knowledge always begins withpresuppositions and pre-given ideas; these presuppositions are not producedby previous experiences but are innate:Knowledge is either innate or not innate. When an unknown thing cannot bemade known by pointing it out or bringing it to mind and it is something thatcannot be attained by the true visions of the great sages, then knowledge of itmust depend on things leading to it that are in an order and that are ultimatelybased on innate knowledge. Otherwise knowledge of anything that man desires toknow will depend on previously obtaining an infinite number of things, and hewill not even be able to obtain the first step in knowledge – which is absurd.10In another argument, Suhrawardi states that the process of defining a termwill continue ad infinitum, because if a term is defined by an attribute, thatattribute needs to be defined by another attribute, and so on. In this case,nothing will be known, which is also absurd. There must be a first principle ora beginning against which our definition of a term and innate ideas can bemeasured.11The possibility of knowledge by definition stands on pre-givenknowledge. Pre-given knowledge can be seen as a prioriin the Kantian senseor as a condition that renders knowledge possible. The last and most reliablesource of knowledge for Suhrawardi, after knowledge by sense-perception,definition and innate ideas, is intuition or knowledge by illumination (al-ishraq). Intuitive knowledge, like perception, is direct and non-representa-tional. There is no mediation between the knower and the known. It isknowledge by ‘presence’ in which the distinction between the known and theknower is abolished. One object that is really grasped by intuition, as statedby Suhrawardi, is the ‘self’. In self-knowledge, which is knowledge by illu-mination, the object (the self, which is known) is present in the self, which isthe knower. Self-knowledge, like the Cartesian Cogito ergo sum, goes beyonddoubt and is undeniable. If I doubt, for example, the status of my existence,then I need to exist in order to experience the doubt about my own existence.The Problem of Knowledge91"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Intuitive knowledge is also not confined to the apprehension of the self. It isvital for knowing the intelligences or the inner reality of the world; it is adifferent way of knowing and does not require intermediate concepts. Theintelligence (whether God’s or the human mind) knows its object directly.Cognition is, therefore, not necessarily conceptual but the outcome of illumi-native intuition, which requires the ‘presence’ of its object and direct appre-hension of it.Mulla Sadra’s epistemology deals extensively with knowledge by intuition(al-idrak). This Arabic term has been translated as ‘perception’, but the termsemantically means the act of comprehending, apprehending, attaining,grasping, and then finally perceiving in the sense of knowing somethingdirectly without mediation.12It is used to describe the process of directlyapprehending and attaining the quiddity of objects outside the human mind inorder to make it intelligible. It is a direct epistemological encounter with theexternal world through which the potentiality of knowing becomes actuality.This definition also includes sense-experience. For this reason, Mulla Sadrathinks of sense-perception as the first and the lowest modality of intuition (al-idrak). William Chittick and S. M. Khamenei (director of the Sadra IslamicPhilosophy Research Institute in Teheran) have translated al-idrak asperception.13Perception, then, rather than apprehension, is a unique cognitivepower; due to various levels or degrees of intensity of existence cognition alsohas different modalities and cognitive stages. These stages of cognition inMulla Sadra’s theory of knowledge are in some ways similar to the hierarchyof knowledge in Hegel’s Phenomenology of Mind, with the exception thatHegel’s epistemology does not go beyond rational knowledge. According toHegel, reason can be applied to solve the contradictions between the knownand the knower, and in rational knowledge the truth for consciousnessbecomes consciousness itself.14To reach this form of cognition, it is essentialfor consciousness to move from sense-certainty to perception, and from thereto understanding and finally to reason, which is the birthplace of absoluteknowledge.15For Mulla Sadra, attaining the highest stage of cognition for knowing theTruth does not rely on rationalistic discourse. It is the task of intellectualperception, a cognitive power that transcends the power of reason. How doesMulla Sadra arrive at this conviction? How does he deal with the unity of theknown and the knower in his epistemology? When we understand MullaSadra’s epistemology in the context of his metaphysics we realize that, in hisview, knowledge deals mainly with the problem of the relationship betweenexistence as an external reality outside the human mind and the transformationof external reality into mental existence, which is another form of Being.16Inthis way, his understanding of knowledge as the conceptualization of externalreality for the sake of unity between the known and the knower is in agreementwith Hegel’s dialectic process of consciousness described in the92Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Phenomenology of Mind. It is also important to investigate the nature of thisrelationship between external and mental existence because it resolves thedichotomy of subject and object and the appropriation of the latter by theformer. The transformation of external existence into mental existence isaccomplished by conceptualizing the modalities of Being. But Being, unlike itsmodalities, cannot be known conceptually as it has no essence or universaldeterminations. Whatever is known through the revelation of universal determi-nations is a modality of Being. The human mind knows various modalities ofBeing, which are different in their degrees of perfection and proximity to Being.The possibility of knowing, whether acquired by our sense-experience orintellect, is based on the ‘presence’ of Being in one form or another. The realityof knowledge is inseparable from the reality of existence. The variety of levelsof the modalities of Being is revealed to different levels of perception (al-idrak).Since there are three levels of existence there will be three levels of perception:sense-perception, imaginal perception and intellectual perception.17In sense-perception, the human soul reflects upon the external object usingfive senses. Each of these senses is given a specific task and receives aparticular form of the sensuous quality of the external object. This passiveattitude of the human soul in sense-perception is followed by attention andawareness.18These two activities of the soul are interconnected and theformer leads to the latter; unless we pay attention to sensuous quality such assound we will not be aware of it. What is acquired by the five senses is at thesame time a confirmation of the ‘presence’ of the external object for the soul.Awareness, which is the result of the presence of the object to the senses, isdirect and necessary: direct because it does not require the conceptualizationof its object and is not mediated by representations; necessary because sense-perception will not be able to receive its object unless the object is present.After receiving the sensuous qualities and being aware of the external object,the human soul endeavours to create the sensuous form of this object and toreveal its quiddity. Here, it seems that the passive act of receiving thesensuous qualities of an object is transformed into the activity of constructingthe notion of the object by apprehending its quiddity. This stage, in Kant’sepistemology, is in the domain of the faculty of understanding rather thansense-perception (sensibility). Understanding and not sense-perception isresponsible for constructing the quiddity of a phenomenal object through theapplication of the subjective categories.19The question that arises here iswhether the sensuous qualities of the known object exist externally. Theanswer, for Mulla Sadra, is in the negative. Sense organs are mere instrumentsand channels required for perception; otherwise it is the human soul not thesense organs that experiences sensation. The eyes do not see colour. They areonly organs through which the soul becomes aware of the colour. They aresense organs for seeing but strictly speaking they see nothing, because seeingis perceiving and perception is a faculty of the human soul and not the senseThe Problem of Knowledge93"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"organ. If we think of the human body as an accidental fact, then the bodyplays its role in perception as an instrument; it is not intrinsic to this kind ofknowledge. Mulla Sadra also believes that the human soul can still perceive ifseparated from the body without being assisted by sense organs. To return tothe question, the sensuous qualities are neither in the senses nor present exter-nally in the object. They are subjective forms and are displayed by the soulwhen an external object is presented to the sense organs. Empirical cognitionis produced as the result of this relationship and the interaction between thesubjective forms and the presence of the external object to the senses.20Thisview of Mulla Sadra is incompatible with the idea of perception as a passiveacceptance of the qualities of an external and independent object. The humansoul does not abstract the empirical determinations of an object but trans-forms the object into something mental. It imposes another form on it, whichis pre-existent in the soul. The corporeal form of the object creates only anoccasion for revealing the subjective forms that exist in the human soul.What I understand from this account of perception by Mulla Sadra is thatthe human soul does not rely completely on the external object for empiricalcognition. Rather, the external object stimulates the soul through the medi-ation of the sense organs to yield the cognized forms that transform the objectinto a new kind of being, a mental being, or a being that is known by the soul.If we think of cognition as the appropriation of the estranged object by theintelligence, then the material existence of the object cannot become thesubject matter of cognition. In perception, the human soul experiences a formthat belongs to the material object. This form has a mental character and isinternal and subjective. For this reason, cognition is possible by distancing theintelligence from matter. Meanwhile, the cognitive form that becomesexplicit at the time of presenting a material object to the senses is not the‘essence’, as thought by Muslim Peripatetic Neoplatonic philosophers andthe ishraqithinkers. It is another aspect of being that exists internally in themind. Since the possibility of epistemology is grounded on ontology,whatever is perceived and known is nothing but another form of Being. Inperception, the human soul transforms an object that exists externally (al-wujud al ‘aini) into mental existence (al-wujud al-dihni) after this interactionbetween the intelligence and the external form of existence. Although it is difficult to accept that sense-perception in Mulla Sadra’sepistemology is mere passivity or acquisition, we can still state that imagi-nation, unlike sense-perception, requires some skilful activity. The humansoul creates its own images without relying on the external world to producethem. The power of imagination at the same time is not limited to the creationof these subjective images; it transcends the realm of subjectivity and attainsthe ‘World of Images’ (‘alam al’khayal), which is held by thinkers such as Ibn‘Arabi and Suhrawardi to be a real world beyond the world of corporealbeings.21In this case, there will be two kinds of images: subjective images,94Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"which are created by the power of imagination, and objective images, withtheir own ontological reality outside the human soul.The human soul, after becoming aware of the form of the external object bysense-perception, is able to recall that form and reflect upon it by imagination(takhayul), even when the object is not present.22This power of imagination isconditioned by the sensuous forms, and relies on them. Not having the sense-perception of an object means not being able to imagine what it looks like.Mulla Sadra talks about another kind of imagination between sense-perception and intellectual perception. He calls it tawahumor wahm.23Theliteral meaning of this term in Arabic is ‘illusion’, ‘delusion’, ‘fancy’, ‘misap-prehension’ or ‘imagination’. But for Mulla Sadra, the philosophical meaningof this term is far from illusion or delusion. He uses it to designate the creativepower of imagination in individuals. William Chittick translates this term as‘sense-intuition’ and adds that the medieval scholars translated it as ‘esti-matio’.24This type of imagination is for the apprehension of the intelligibleuniversal forms without relying on a particular being. In this way, tawahumismore significant than takhayulfor three reasons: first it is not conditioned bythe objects of sense-perception; second, it is closer to the intellectual intuitionas it apprehends the universal forms disjoined from the corporeal objects; andthird, it is a creative power in the human soul.Ibn Sina has also written on this cognitive tool before Mulla Sadra. Hebelieves that wahm functioned as a faculty in the human mind and was mainlyresponsible for apprehending particular ideas in particular corporeal objects.The realization of love, for example, in a particular person, or being fearful infacing a particularly dangerous phenomenon, is the task of wahm. MullaSadra, however, says that Ibn Sina’s form of realization is the function ofreason attached to imagination. A person, for example, is afraid of an externalthreat because he/she reasons about it. Mulla Sadra’s view was rejected bySabzawari, one of the followers of the metaphysics of Mulla Sadra whoremarks that, since animals become fearful in the face of danger, wahmshould not be attached to reason, because animals do not have reason yetexperience fear.It is important to mention here that the idea of tawahumas a type of imag-ination was not originally Mulla Sadra’s. Thinkers before him, such asSuhrawardi and Ibn ‘Arabi, endorsed it in their epistemology. Each believedthat imagination is an important faculty of the human mind for grasping therealm of ideas between the physical and intellectual worlds. As we see, and asalso stated by Oliver Leaman, Mulla Sadra employed the technical languageof Ibn ‘Arabi in dealing with the problem of cognition. That language alsoinfluenced Mulla Sadra’s understanding of the mystical implications ofknowledge.25According to Ibn ‘Arabi, imagination is in the domain of thehuman soul and a faculty between sense-perception and intellect.26Theknowledge produced by imagination is of the Barzakhand the world of theThe Problem of Knowledge95"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"corporeal bodies through which spiritual entities manifest themselves.27Theworld of imagination is an intermediary realm between the corporeal andnon-corporeal worlds. It is divided into unbounded or absolute imagination(al-khayal al-mutlaq) and bounded imagination (al-khayal al-muqayyad). Inthe unbounded abode of imagination between the being of God and noth-ingness, all beings come into existence. The bounded imagination is thecreative power of individuals that functions as an intermediary powerbetween the corporeal and the spiritual worlds.28The bounded imagination isfurther subdivided by Ibn ‘Arabi into contiguous (al-muttasil) and discon-tinuous (al-munfasil). The former lies in the individual soul’s production ofimages with the aid of perception, while the latter lies between the corporealand spiritual worlds and has no relation to perception or images producedwith the aid of perception. For Ibn ‘Arabi, Barzakhis the world of creativeimagination and he describes it as (‘alam al-mithal), the ideal world, whereall opposites become self-manifest.29This task of imagination, namelybringing the opposites together, is inherited from the creative nature of imag-ination. When two opposites meet, as in Hegel’s dialectic, their synthesis, orthe third element, emerges. The emergence of this new element takes place inthe realm of Barzakh.30The world of imagination plays a significant roleontologically in the rise of new entities in the corporeal world. Mulla Sadrahimself is aware of the influence of Ibn ‘Arabi on his theory of knowledge anddiscusses the views of his predecessors in detail in al-Asfar. But, unlikeSuhrawardi or Ibn ‘Arabi, he does not think of the world of imagination assomething ontological that exists independent of the human mind. It issubjective and is created by the mind, but when the created ideas of imagi-nation are externalized, for example in works of art, they become objectiverealities.Moving away from the realm of sense-perception is not a venture into therealm of abstraction. It is an endeavour towards grasping the higher levels ofexistence until the human mind is able to attain utmost proximity to Being.31With intellectual intuition, another source of knowledge, the human mindtries to realize its spiritual ambition. At this stage, epistemology becomes avehicle for the human mind to obtain its ultimate goal by moving away fromthe philosophical and scientific boundaries of cognition to the mystical andtheosophical. This shift is determined by trans-substantial changes in theworld and in the human soul. The aim of epistemology is, then, not cognitionor understanding of external reality, but, as in Plato, the transformation andelevation of the human soul from a lower rank of existence to a higher whereit can unite with the Active Intellect. The position of seeker of knowledge atthis level of being resembles the position of the freed prisoner in the allegoryof the cave in the Republic. It is liberation of the human soul from thebondage of shadows and material existence, that is, from a less perfect levelof existence. When the freed prisoner sees the light of the sun and arrives at a96Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"higher level of existence, he or she does not reject other faculties ofknowledge such as perception and imagination. The freed person is perfectedand substantially changed from a lower to a higher level of existence. Hencethe journey through trans-substantial change means that the soul is changedthrough acquiring knowledge and has become a better (higher-rank) humanbeing.In intellectual intuition, the human intelligence becomes aware of the tran-scendent forms that exist ontologically in a Platonic sense. These tran-scendent forms, however, are not universals; each is seen as an individual,non-corporeal being. The forms also unite and become identical with theintelligence when they are grasped by intellectual intuition. This awareness ofthe non-corporeal forms and their unity with the intelligence is determined bythe spiritual station of the human soul. The intelligence is unable toapprehend these forms unless it moves away from obsession with the materialworld. This epistemological development is also a dynamic process based onthe dynamic nature of its object. Since everything in the world is in constantsubstantial change, the knower and the known never remain the same. Also,the nature of the reality of being and of trans-substantial change cannot begrasped fully by rationalistic discourse, or by representation. The rationalisticdiscourse is incapable of understanding the true nature of reality. This view issimilar to that of Henri Bergson in his understanding of reality and ‘duration’.In making a clear distinction between analytic or scientific knowledge andmetaphysical knowledge, Bergson concludes that ‘duration’ as a restlesscontinuity in the evolutionary process of life, and consciousness can beattained by intuition. In intuition, consciousness comes in direct contact withreality without being mediated by representations. This kind of knowledge,which is not representational or translated into concepts, is absolute andperfect in comparison with knowledge by representations or scientificknowledge.32The realm of intellectual intuition contains the transcendent PlatonicForms. It is also the realm of the Active Intellect. The human intelligencebecomes one with the forms through its union with the Active Intellect. Thisunion between the Active Intellect and multiple individual souls does notaffect the simplicity in the nature of the former. The Active Intellect and itsknowledge of the realm of the Platonic Forms remain simple and identical,because this rank of being is perfect and remote from the abode of multi-plicity and the influence of trans-substantial change.Knowledge by presence has characteristics of its own that distinguish itfrom knowledge by representation. It is direct and unmediated by concepts,and indubitable. Since it is neither representational nor non-propositional, itis neither false nor true. Its truth is beyond empirical verification and assertionin propositions. Furthermore, in knowledge by presence the distinctionbetween intelligent and intelligible disappears. The knower and the knownThe Problem of Knowledge97"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"object unite as one being. Finally, this type of knowledge is beyond thedomain of demonstration by reason. The intellectual intuition as the source ofknowledge by presence becomes a mystical tool of cognition (al-kashif), or inthe Bergsonian sense it becomes the fountainhead of metaphysicalknowledge beyond the reach of scientific analysis.Mulla Sadra deals with ‘knowledge by presence’ and intellectual intuitionin another work, Se Asl(‘Three Principles’), written in Persian. He explains inthis work that there are three hindrances in the human mind to obtainingknowledge by presence and experiencing intellectual intuition. Thesehindrances are not related to the nature of knowledge obtained and verified bythe human soul. They are simply conditions influencing the soul and becomeimpediments to the spiritual progress of the individual. These hindrances arethe non-realization of the inner nature of the self on the part of individuals,seeking lust and wealth, and the temptation of the commanding self to pursueevil as excellence and excellence as evil.33These three principles, which arenot epistemological and are not in the quality of knowledge obtained, arenecessary conditions of the spiritual path of of the human soul towards therealization of Truth.Generally speaking, intellectual initiation is successful when the indi-vidual soul realizes its own reality and knows itself as a spiritual entity ratherthan a material body. This is the first station of the spiritual guidance forattaining the Truth by gnosis (‘irfan) or knowledge by presence. The secondhindrance is inherited from the relationship between the soul and the materialworld. This relationship becomes a hindrance when the soul is attractedtowards entertaining the body and seeking lust and material possessions.‘Allamah Tabataba’i, who adheres to the existentialist school of Mulla Sadra,believes that lust and material interest conceal the love and passion for divinebeauty and perfection. This love manifests itself in the heart of the seeker ofthe Truth only through regular and persistent self-control (muraqabah) andthe renunciation of desire for the material world.34It is worth mentioning thatMulla Sadra’s advocacy of intellectual intuition and knowledge by presenceis not the negation of knowledge by representation and demonstration. In hisepistemology, all sources of knowledge have their own function and partic-ipate in unveiling the truth of Being. His position, like Hegel’s in thePhenomenology of Mind, is to accommodate various cognitive sources atdifferent levels of the revelation of Being because the gradations of Being areknown by different cognitive tools. Yet it is intellectual intuition not reasonthat is able to grasp reality fully and directly. Science, philosophy andtheosophy (hikmah) are interconnected in the sense that they are ontologicallyconditioned by the presence of Being, and each deals with one aspect ofBeing, with the exception of theosophy, which relies on intellectual intuitionto attain the truth of Being.35This antagonism with the rationalist philoso-phers in respect of demonstrative knowledge is grounded mainly on the98Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"intrinsic limitation of discursive knowledge for understanding the meaning ofBeing directly. Mulla Sadra, under the sway of Sufism in general and theishraqiepistemology (Illuminationism) in particular, does not allow this limi-tation to curtail the endeavour of the human mind to ‘un-conceal’ Being. Byinsisting on knowledge by presence, Mulla Sadra transcends the limitation ofreason and the boundaries of discursive knowledge. The unlimited power ofintellectual intuition compensates for that constraint and goes beyond thepower of reason.Another important point to be mentioned here is the union of the intelligent(al-‘aqil) and the intelligible (al-ma‘qul). In the history of Muslimphilosophy this epistemological matter is also discussed by PeripateticNeoplatonic thinkers such as Ibn Sina. The truth of the external reality for IbnSina and other Peripatetic Neoplatonic thinkers was based on correspondencebetween the external object and its representation in the mind. Although thisidea is ascribed to Aristotle, it is difficult to claim that Aristotle made a cleardistinction between intelligent and intelligible at all levels of cognition in hisepistemology. In Metaphysicsand De Anima, Aristotle refers to the incor-poreal intelligible substances as intelligibles that unite with their intellect.36This Aristotelian notion of unity was later expressed by Alexander ofAphrodisia (active c.200 AD) in De Intellectuand by Porphyry (c.232–304)as the unity of the intelligible with the intelligent. Mulla Sadra also discussesthe ideas of these thinkers in al-Asfarwhen he argues against the MuslimPeripatetic Neoplatonic thinkers.37Ibn Sina considers this unity a poeticalnonsense and meaningless.38However, in Al-Mabda’ wal-ma‘ad, particularlyin the discussion on the nature of knowledge of the Necessary Being, IbnSina, like Aristotle, holds the view that in the Necessary Being intelligent andintelligible are one and united.39In criticizing Ibn Sina’s position, MullaSadra claims that Ibn Sina was under the sway of Aristotle’s cosmology. Hedoes not accept the emergence of a new element resulting from a unity at theexpense of terminating the two opposing elements.40Mulla Sadra alsodiscusses this problem in Risala fi Ittihad al-‘aaqil wal-ma‘qul (‘Treatise onthe Unity of the Intelligent and the Intelligible’).41How does Mulla Sadrasolve this epistemological problem? On what ground does he demonstrate theunity of the intelligent and the intelligible? Mulla Sadra’s solution can bedivided into two parts. The first is based on his ontological system of theprimacy of Being and the understanding of the meaning of Being as the prin-ciple of unity beneath the multiplicity of the phenomenal world. The secondpart is an exposition argued from correlativity or correlation.I will begin with the argument based on the doctrine of the primacy ofBeing and explain how the intelligent and the intelligible become one onto-logically. It is apparent, and we may agree with Ibn Sina in his criticism ofthis unity, that it is not possible for two different things to unite but that therecan be a connection between them. Mulla Sadra’s ontology makes it clear thatThe Problem of Knowledge99"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"the different elements are all bound together by their inner reality. Differenceis only one aspect of reality; there is a unity beneath this interconnection. Allelements are gradations of Being; they are only different in their intensity ofperfection due to their distance and proximity to Being. There is neither beingfor itself, nor is there anything that can stand by itself alone. All beingsincluding intelligence are taken as real on the ground of the reality of Being astheir ontological foundation. What appears for intelligence as intelligible is atthe same time nothing other than a modality of Being as the ontological foun-dation. The intelligent and the intelligible might be conceived as two differentthings phenomenologically, but, ontologically, they are the same in existing.42As Fazlur Rahman says, the external world is not a different reality thatcontains entities distinct from mental existents; itmerely denotes a status or level of existence, i.e., a level where things operatewith their natural properties. When, again, something is said to be ‘in the mind’,the mind cannot in this use be conceived of as a ‘container’, but it simply meansthat the mind has a set of properties or essences, which is able to apply to theexternal reality and to classify things.43The outcome of this view is that truth does not reside in the object knownexternally, but is defined in terms of its being known internally. This episte-mological interpretation of the mental existents is reminiscent of Kant’sanalysis of the application of the table of the categories in the faculty ofunderstanding. The categories also exist in the mind and their applicationrenders knowledge of the external world possible. Mulla Sadra also tried toestablish the unity between the intelligent and the intelligible by focusing onthe point that these two elements are not substantially dissimilar. They bothbelong to the reality of Being. In order to elucidate this point it is helpful tomention Hegel’s view of cognition as a process of conceptualization or ideal-ization of the external object by consciousness in which consciousnessestransforms the object into something mental which then becomes the propertyof consciousness and unites with it. The external object, after being conceptu-alized, no longer posits itself as something external and different.44The expe-rience that consciousness undergoes brings consciousness to know itselfthrough knowing its object. The object known to consciousness is thusanother aspect of consciousness. It is posited and developed byconsciousness. Cognition, which is always relational under the transfor-mation of the known object, becomes consciousness of consciousness or self-consciousness. In self-consciousness all distinctions between consciousnessand its external object disappear and the object is reduced to mere conceptsand hence is inseparable from consciousness. The difference between Hegel’sview and that of Mulla Sadra is that Mulla Sadra does not intend to transformthe object into mere concepts, nor does he deny its external reality of it. Heinsists on this unity through his understanding of the doctrine of the primacy100Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"of Being, a significant ontological doctrine that considers intelligent andintelligible to be two sides of the same coin. Therefore, there is no distinctionbetween intelligent and intelligible and between mental and external exis-tents, as both belong to Being.In the second part of his argument, Mulla Sadra proves the truth of thisunity by arguing from correlativity. He demonstrates that there is an inherentcorrelation between the intelligent and the intelligible. By this he means thattheir joint occurrence is not accidental but is essentially connected. Thiscorrelation, like that between cause and effect, is necessary and undeniable.Whenever there is a cause, that cause has an effect, and an effect is alwaysproduced by a cause. Likewise, the ‘existence’ of the intelligible is possiblethrough the ‘existence’ of the intelligent.45To explain this correlativity, MullaSadra makes a distinction between two kinds of intelligible: the first kind isaccidental and dependent on the material existence of the object; the second isessential and does not depend on the material existence of the object. It is aseparate intellectual form that relies on the mind. The essential intelligible,which is at the same time the actuality of a being, is inseparable from theintelligent.46In this case the intelligent, in intellectualizing the intelligible,intellectualizes itself, and their complete unity is established as they dependon each other to exist.Another important philosophical issue discussed by Mulla Sadra withinthe problem of knowledge is God’s knowledge of particulars. Generallyspeaking, there are two opposing views in Islamic thought on understandingGod’s knowledge of particulars: philosophical and religious. The religiousviewpoint, which is not the subject of our discussion here, relies on theauthority of the foundation text of Islam, the Qur’an, and asserts God’sknowledge of the infinite number of particular beings created by Him.Muslim philosophers have put forward different views on this. Some reject itand others assert God’s knowledge of Himself as well as of the world. ThePeripatetic Neoplatonist Muslim philosophers, in particular Ibn Sina, held theview that God’s knowledge is not derived from the external objects outsideHis mind; otherwise His knowledge would be conditioned by and dependenton them. To Ibn Sina, God’s mind should be creative rather than receptive,active and not passive. He also states that God knows particulars not as partic-ulars but in a universal way. Other thinkers identified God’s knowledge withPlatonic Forms and discussed the relationship of these Forms with theessence of God. The problem which arises here is that of the nature of God’sknowledge and the way He knows the world. Is God’s knowledge dependenton the world? Is it prior to the creation of the world? Or, more specifically,should we ask how God knows the world?In Ibn Sina’s ontology God is the Necessary Being and identical with Hisessence. From the Necessary Being emanates the first intellect alone, becausethe Necessary Being is absolutely simple. Only one thing emanates from itsThe Problem of Knowledge101"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"existence. The first intellect, which is the first possible existence and is actu-alized by the Necessary Being, is no longer absolutely simple. It has a dualnature and gives rise to two entities: the second intellect and the highestsphere. This dual process of emanation continues until the tenth intellect andthe sublunary world are emanated. The Necessary Being remains absolutelysimple and aloof from the domain of multiplicity. But how does theNecessary Being know the world of multiplicity without having multiplicityin its essence? Before answering this question it is worth mentioning that forIbn Sina God knows Himself as well as the world, because He is the origi-nator of the world, but His knowing of the world is different from the wayhuman beings come to learn about external objects and is at the same timeunique. For example, Ibn Sina says:It is necessary to know first that the knowledge (‘ilm) of the Necessary Being isnot like our knowledge nor is it analogous (qiyas) to our knowledge. The first[kind of knowledge] requires multiplicity, and the second does not. That whichrequires multiplicity is called ‘psychological’ knowledge and that which does notrequire [it] is called ‘intellectual’ knowledge.47The uniqueness of the Necessary Being’s knowledge is due to the ontologicalstatus enjoyed by this being. Its being is unlike the being of the ontic beings inthe world: it is absolutely simple and disjoined from matter. For this reason,God’s knowledge also does not happen in time (history) and is not related tothe changeable world.48Time, multiplicity and change belong to thesublunary world and not to the realm of the Necessary Being. Accordingly,the knowledge possessed by the Necessary Being does not change because itneither happened in time nor is empirical:It cannot be that the knowledge (‘ilm) of the Necessary Being happens withintime, so that it could sat that now it is so and tomorrow it is not so, and [so that] itsjudgment is according to how It exists today and It will be tomorrow, and thenafterwards how It is tomorrow [and] It is not [any longer] today.49In contrast to the human way of obtaining knowledge, the Necessary Beingbecomes aware of the particulars not empirically by perception but in auniversal way. He knows, for example, that there is war in the world andknows all the antecedents and consequences of war. He knows that wars willhappen and how to differentiate war from peace or distinguish war by conven-tional weapons from war by non-conventional weapons; but where and whena particular war will occur is not known to the Necessary Being, because thishappens in a particular space and at a specific time in the human history. Those who affirm God’s knowledge of particulars argue that God’sknowledge is either identical with His essence or separate. The first view wasadvocated by the Mu‘tazilites, a group of Muslim rationalist theologians in102Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Basrah and Baghdad.50They claimed that there was a new relationship betweenthe essence of God and the divine attributes by saying that God neitherpossessed the attributes nor were they in His essence, but the divine essence andthe attributes were identical and the same. For example, God’s knowledge iseternal and not something other than God; otherwise knowledge becomesanother independent eternal being. First, in the sense of numerical unity orabsolute unity, this denies the existence of more than one God, or polytheism.This meaning of unity (al-tawhid) is in agreement with the Qur’anic notion ofmonotheism. Second, it is used in the sense of internal unity and simplicity,meaning that God’s essence is free from essential plurality and composition.If we go back to the history of Judeo-Christian theology, we find that theargument for the unity of God was propounded by Judaeus Philo (20 BCE–40 CE)and restated by Spinoza (1632–1677) in his pantheistic philosophy. For Philo,eternity is an essential quality of God; no other being but He can be eternal. Thisview represents the established Judeo-Christian and Islamic principle ofmonotheism. Its denial constitutes the rejection of monotheism in these threeSemitic religions.Spinoza espouses the Philonic principle by putting the argument intoanother logical form, saying that if there are two substances such as incor-poreal God and the corporeal world, they should be absolutely different orabsolutely the same. If there were two substances having nothing in commonand being absolutely different, one could not become the ‘cause’ of the other.If the existence of two different substances is not logically possible, then wemust consider the case of the existence of two similar substances which areabsolutely alike. Such substances cannot be distinct, that is two, unless, inaddition to their common qualities, they possess some other quality in whichthey differ. As Spinoza concludes, ‘Two substances would be granted ashaving the same attribute, which is absurd.’51The Mu‘tazilites also claimed that ‘essences’ are known by God in the stateof their ‘subsistence’, in the state of non-existence, or before coming into therealm of existence. Ibn ‘Arabi shares this view and argues that the essenceswere in God’s mind prior to their actual existence in the real world. SomeMuslim thinkers also identified God’s knowledge with the Platonic Forms,which were considered separate from God with their own ontological reality.This approach, which was taken by some Sufis, was in agreement with theHanbali School, the followers of which argued for the reality and eternity ofthe divine attributes. Knowledge as one of the attributes was considered bothnon-identical with the divine essence and eternal.52Suhrawardi had adifferent idea. He insisted that God’s knowledge was separate and its objectsincluded all things emanated from Him. The emanated objects are multipleand under the sway of change, but God’s knowledge is not.53Suhrawadi alsothinks of God’s knowledge of the world in the context that God is perfect andthe knowledge of His perfection cannot be denied.The Problem of Knowledge103"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"In Mulla Sadra’s ontology, essences belong to the realm of the contingentbeings, which are finite. By contrast, God is pure Being and the finiteattributes of the contingent beings or essences cannot be ascribed to Him.Here, Mulla Sadra distances himself from the views of the Mu‘tazilites andIbn ‘Arabi. His criticism of those who think of God’s knowledge as a PlatonicForm is based on two points. First, he states that if knowledge is separate fromGod and is not something in the mind of God, it is essential to find out howGod knows this separate and distant form. Second, the Platonic Forms areposterior to God’s existence, so how can we say that God’s knowledge, whichis identical to the Platonic Forms, is eternal? Also, if God’s knowledge is aseparate form, a prioriknowledge is required for knowing that form, whichwill become an endless process.54Mulla Sadra’s main confrontation on God’s knowledge of the particulars iswith Ibn Sina. While he agrees with him that knowledge does not affect God’ssimplicity, he is critical of Ibn Sina’s indifference towards the union of theintelligent (al-‘aaqil) and the intelligible (al-ma‘qul). According to MullaSadra, on the ground of this union it is possible to conclude that Being is theonly reality and that knowledge is derived from Being. Since Being producesa systematic ambiguity of gradation or its own modalities, knowledge shouldbe seen in this way. Another difference between Mulla Sadra and Ibn Sina ison God’s knowledge as ‘accident’, in which God’s knowledge is described asa posteriori, conditioned by and dependent on the objects known outsideGod’s mind. Hence the mind of God remains receptive rather than creative.55Against this, Mulla Sadra developed three arguments. In the first argument,he maintains that knowledge, as one of the divine attributes, can be neithermental nor non-existential. To prove this point, Mulla Sadra classifies theattributes into three types. The first two are subjective, existing only in themind, and existential, meaning ontological, and attributes as properties oftheir accidents’ ‘essences’. For him, it is impossible to think of the divineattributes as subjective or mere properties of the mind. The third type ofattributes become existential reality when the essences emerge in the world orcome into existence with the ontic beings. As a consequence of this,knowledge as one of the divine attributes cannot be described as somethingmental. Therefore, it must be an existential reality.56The second argument deals with the principle that obtaining perfectknowledge of an effect is acquired only through its cause. This principleappears to be self-contradictory, because it does not mean that the effect isknown only through knowing its cause. In thinking of the primordialness ofBeing in Mulla Sadra’s ontology, we should insist that this principle stand onthe ground of ‘existential’ cause and ‘existential’ effect. The proposition‘Whenever there is p, then there will be q’ should be modified into ‘This is p,hence there is q’. The second is an existential proposition, and an indication ofexistential q, which is directly caused by p. Hence the forms, which are104Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"caused by God’s mind, are directly known by Him as existential realitiesrather than a posterioriconcepts.57In the third argument, Mulla Sadra, inrejecting the idea of God’s knowledge as mental or subjective, disagrees thatsomething at a lower rank of existence can become the source and the causeof an entity at a higher rank of existence. Since God’s knowledge is the causeof the contingent world, it is not mental but a real existence. Otherwise, God’sknowledge as the cause of the contingent world will stay at a lower rank ofexistence and the contingent world at a higher.58Having critically evaluated the views of his predecessors, Mulla Sadrarelies on his own ontological understanding of reality to solve this problem.As is mentioned in Chapter Four, Being is the primordial reality on which themultiplicity of the contingent world stands. But Being itself, as the reality ofall things, is simple: what is real in everything is its being rather than itsessence. Being is, in this sense, equivocal and not univocal. It is the realityand a common ground of all things or the Being of them, but with differentintensity and weakness. The Being of a thing and a thing are not two differentrealities, but one and the same. The reality of Being is, therefore, objective oran ontological reality of all things. The multiplicity of the contingent worlddoes not affect the simple nature of Being. The principle of unity for them aswell as their diversity is something grounded on the unified ground becausenothing grounded exists without its own ground. This understanding of Beingand its relationship with the contingent world of beings helps us to understandGod’s cognitive relationship with multiplicity. All things are present in God’ssimple being. When God thinks about Himself and this self-knowledge doesnot involve duality of the intellect and the intelligible, God comes to knowabout everything, including all particulars, without suffering multiplicity.59Although Being or God is the cause of multiplicity and all contingent beingsare modalities of the systematic ambiguity of Being, Being is not affected bythem. God’s knowledge of particulars or His modalities is nothing more thanself-knowledge; this does not infect the simplicity and infinity of His exis-tence with multiplicity and finitude. God, which is pure Being for MullaSadra, has no essence, but His being is inclusive of all forms and knows themin an order as His affects. He knows all of them simply by contemplatingHimself. The self-knowledge of God passes through three stages. In the firststage, God realizes His own absolute unity. In the second, various attributesbecome manifest in His knowledge, but since all of them belong to the samesource they have an underlying unity. Finally, at the third stage, God’sknowledge gives rise to the Platonic Forms in the non-corporeal world. Hereevery Platonic Form stands by itself as a unique form; for this reason it iscalled the stage of distinction.60At this stage the contingent modalities ofBeing such as different corporeal entities come into existence. As a conse-quence of this, the self-knowledge of God is the knowledge of the world,because the world is the self-manifestation of God.The Problem of Knowledge105"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENIn ConclusionThe significance of Mulla Sadra’s philosophy should not be seen in the lightof its role in the continuity of the intellectual and philosophical tradition in theMuslim world. Its task was not to replicate what was produced before;instead, it represented a break with the philosophical tradition and the emer-gence of a new philosophical system based on a new ontology. This newdevelopment was antagonistic to the dominant philosophical thought of itstime and stood against the ‘essentialist’ intellectual persuasion of the schoolof Illuminationism of Suhrawardi.From the very beginning of this book it was argued that Mulla Sadra’sphilosophical ‘turn’ or shift from the philosophical position of the primacy ofessence to the primacy of Being and to thinking of Being as the primordialmetaphysical reality is similar to the ontological enterprise of Being and Timeby Martin Heidegger. To elucidate this claim I have tried, first, to suggest acommonality of philosophical tradition against which Mulla Sadra andHeidegger communicate their discontent. Second, the similarities betweenMulla Sadra’s ontology and that of Heidegger are explained in the stream ofthought in this work where the need for comparison arises.Similarities between the ontological enterprises of these two thinkers arediscussed mainly on the grounds that Mulla Sadra and Heidegger advocatedthe primordialness of Being and held the view that Aristotle’s logic was inca-pable of revealing the meaning of Being. Both thinkers also argued againstPlato’s metaphysics as a foundation of the philosophical tradition on whichthe essentialism of Suhrawardi and the nihilism of Western thought relied. Mulla Sadra’s new ontological system begins with the primordialness ofBeing. Unlike Suhrawardi, who thought that ‘essences’ were real, MullaSadra argued for the primacy of Being. This shift from the primacy of essenceto the primacy of Being is described as a ‘turn’ from the core elements ofSuhrawardi’s metaphysics towards a contrary ontological view. The essen-tialism of Suhrawardi, according to Mulla Sadra in al-Masha‘ir, led to the‘darkness of illusion’ and neglected the fundamental philosophical questionsconcerning the meaning of Being in favour of investigating the nature ofsomething less fundamental. It sacrificed the ground for the grounded.Mulla Sadra’s description of the dominant metaphysical tradition of histime as the ‘darkness of illusion’ is reminiscent of Heidegger’s notion of the‘abandonment of Being’ or the ‘concealment of the truth’ in his understandingof the Platonic and the post-Platonic traditions in the West. Both philo-sophical traditions (Illuminationism and Platonism) abandoned or shrouded106"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"in darkness the Being of beings as the inner reality and the ground on whichall beings stand. This led to the oblivion of Being and to the thinking of Beingas ‘essence’. In Heidegger’s view, the oblivion of Being is a process in whichthe truth of Being is concealed; as described by Mulla Sadra it is the state ofuntruth or’darkness of illusion’. Suhrawardi’s metaphysics is, therefore, likethat of Plato, in that it represents ‘nihilism’ or the thinking of Being as nothingor un-real. Overcoming the ‘darkness of illusion’ or ‘nihilism’ is possible onlythrough turning to Being as the sole fundamental metaphysical reality. InContributions to Philosophy, Heidegger describes this turning as anotherbeginning, a new epoch, and a transition from the withdrawal of Being to itsre-emergence behind the appearance of beings. In insisting on similaritiesbetween Mulla Sadra’s and Heidegger’s metaphysics I do not intend toneglect their differences. It is clear that Mulla Sadra describes Being as aconscious transcendent reality that has a purpose in manifesting itself. It is thefirst principle beyond the gradations of its own modalities. For this reason,Mulla Sadra’s metaphysics, unlike that of Heidegger, should be seen as anonto-theological system with a metaphysical objective and a realized end.In his critical evaluation of essentialism or the illuminative philosophy ofSuhrawardi, Mulla Sadra examines three ontological positions: Being is priorto essence, posterior to it, or Being and essence co-exist simultaneously.Thinking of Being as prior to essence signifies that Being can stand by itselfwithout its essence. This ontological position at the rank of Pure Being isaccepted because Pure Being is without essence; but a problem arises if wethink of essence as prior to being, or conversely of being as posterior toessence. If the primacy of essence is accepted by Mulla Sadra as true, itimplies that essence exists without Being. But for this, essence has to exist orneeds another being to rely on, which leads to a vicious regress. The thirdposition is that existence and essence co-exist simultaneously. This onto-logical view involves the notion that essence is in existence. In this case,essence again needs another existence to rely on for its existence. As a conse-quence of this, essence cannot be without prior existence.Mulla Sadra concludes that the qualification of essence by existence is anintellectual operation. Neither existence nor essence is prior to the other, nordo they have a state of simultaneity, since nothing can be prior, posterior orsimultaneous to itself. Both are ontologically inseparable in the ranks belowthe rank of Pure Being and are different only in thinking when the humanmind apprehends an ontic being.What, then, does the primacy of Being mean if these three positions arerefuted? How can we talk about the primacy of Being? In my opinion MullaSadra’s argument against the second and the third ontological positionsshould be understood with reference to the existence of the ontic beings.There is no doubt that Pure Being is without essence and we cannot talk aboutthe priority or posteriority of its essence. Mulla Sadra believes that Being andIn Conclusion107"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"essence, like the ground and the grounded, are ontologically inseparable, andare different realities in the ontological region of becoming only in thinkingand for thinking. When a being is conceived and analysed into its determina-tions, the Being of this being appears in thinking to be distinct from thesedeterminations. This intellectual apprehension does not coincide with theinner reality of Being, because essence is not distinct from an ontic entity, noris existence an addition to essence. It is only in thinking that the priority ofone over the other, in particular of essence, becomes evident, becausethinking analyses each entity into existence and essence. Essence appears asthe prior factor due to its nature as a universal determination apprehended bythe intellect, whereas existence is not apprehended. Here, the primacy ofessence becomes a mental factor, and Being remains as an ontological groundinaccessible to rational thinking. Mulla Sadra elucidates the distinctionbetween Being and beings in a number of ways: as the division of Being intounity and multiplicity (modalities), as necessary and contingent; and then asindependent and dependent (connective). In these divisions, multiplicity,contingent and dependent are understood in their relationship with Being,which stands as their unity or necessary and independent reality. For example,multiplicity is possible only on the ground of unity, because the beings arenothing more than the self-manifestation of a single, simple reality in its ownmodalities. Whatever exists and the human intellect becomes aware of inintellectual experience, including the ‘self’, is nothing but a modality ofBeing.The distinction between beings (phenomena) and their essences ariseswhen beings are analysed intellectually into categorical determinations. Inthe world external to the intellect, these beings are not separable from theiressences. The case with Being is completely distinct, because Being (or Seinin the Heideggerian sense) is Pure Being and has no universal determinations.This description of Being as a reality without universal determinations retainsBeing beyond the domain of Aristotle’s logic and rationalistic apprehension.All beings are grounded on Being and are known by it, but at the same timeBeing cannot be defined. Being, then, is the ontological as well as epistemo-logical precondition for the world and our cognizance of beings, but thelogical definition of genus and specific difference is not applicable to it. Inthis traditional way (by relying on Aristotelian rule for definition), Being isindefinable.Another important point is the systematic ambiguity of the gradation ofBeing (tashkik al-wujud). In this process, Being manifests itself vertically aswell as horizontally. It begins with the most perfect rank of Being to the leastperfect, such as prime matter. The other direction of tashkikdetermines thetransformation of the world horizontally through successive and infiniteforms. This is analogous to the gradation of light in Suhrawardi’s meta-physics, but for Mulla Sadra it is Being rather than light (essence) that creates108Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"its own modalities. Being is viewed as equivocal and not univocal. This is acommon characteristic of all things or the Being of beings, but it differs in itsintensity and weakness. The Being of a thing and a thing are not two differentrealities but one thing and the same at the same time. Being is a single realitybut with ranks and grades of its own modalities. All beings are but onticcoagulaof a single ontological reality. This reality should not be understoodas this or that being but as the Being of beings and something transcendentand grasped intuitively.I have interpreted Mulla Sadra’s concept of the ‘transcendence’ of Being intwo ways: ontologically and epistemologically. Ontologically, Being is theBeing of all beings and their source. All things emanate from Being. The rela-tionship between Being and beings in terms of the doctrine of emanation isthat Being, as the fountainhead of all emanated beings, is not immanent but areality that transcends them. Epistemologically, Being can be seen as aprecondition for our knowledge of the world as well as our own existence,because it is a reality on which the existence of all beings relies. Our expe-rience and knowledge of beings is possible only by virtue of their ‘Being’,and Being at the same time is beyond the domain of perception and rational-istic discourse. It is neither this nor that being of our experience but some-thing transcendent.Mulla Sadra’s ontology, in particular the doctrine of systematic ambiguityof Being, as analysed in Chapter Five, bridges the gulf between unity andmultiplicity. This bridging is realized on the ground of the principle ofidentity in difference or unity in diversity. Being as a unity and identitycontains the multiplicity of its own modification. The external world is char-acterized by unity and diversity. Diversity is a mode of the single and simplereality of Being that exists only on the ground of unity.The systematic ambiguity of Being is an increase and decrease in theintensity of existence. For this reason, I conclude that it is not a change in the‘essence’ of a being but an existential movement in the core of its existence.The qualitative and quantitative change in a being is not seen as a gradualintensification of a particular quality, i.e., whiteness, but rather a replacementof a former quality by a new one. This is also the case with a definite quantityof an ontic being: a new quantity replaces the old quantity. As a result, theworld is in constant change and Being is in a pattern of renewal and evolutionuntil it reaches its own culmination where no further change is thinkable.What undergoes change and at the same time endures in this evolutionaryprocess of the world is Being. All changes occur in Being and by Being,which is called trans-substantial change. This doctrine is the keystone ofMulla Sadra’s ontology and the ground for developing other aspects of hisphilosophy. It is the ground for our understanding of the world and of humanknowledge. Being is, then, in a self-evolutionary process and it is the onlycause that determines this process. Nor does Mulla Sadra see this existentialIn Conclusion109"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"movement of the world as blind or capricious. It has a purpose and a realizedend. The inner motive for accomplishing this task is a mystic force of love(‘ishq), present in all beings and causing the lower-ranked beings to long forbeings of the higher ranks of existence to obtain perfection. The verticaldirection, in contrast to the horizontal direction of the systematic ambiguityof Being, is one from potentiality to actuality for the sake of perfection. Itfinally reaches its goal in human existence with the rise of the perfect humanbeing (al-insan al-kamil), who apprehends the divine realm and attains unitywith the Intelligences or divine attributes. I also argue that the verticaldirection of this movement is similar to the dialectical movement in Hegel’sphilosophy and to the idea of creative evolution in Bergson’s thought.I have also mentioned that the concept of trans-substantial change has reli-gious as well as philosophical consequences. It can change our understandingof the notions of resurrection and divine retribution and initiate discussion onthe transmigration of the soul. All these notions deal with the identity of thehuman existence that undergoes trans-substantial change. On one hand,Mulla Sadra believes that the identity of the self depends on the intellectualform of a person, which exists in the mind of God. On the other hand, he statesthat the self will survive throughout the evolutionary changes, which will helpthe self to retain its own identity. This position is, however, similar to thattaken by Descartes in developing his theory of self-substance in the secondand third meditations and is in contradiction with Mulla Sadra’s doctrine oftrans-substantial change.The philosophical consequences of trans-substantial change are summa-rized in three points: the temporal contingency of the world, the infection ofbeing by non-being or nothingness, and the relativity of truth and values.Trans-substantial change is an indication of the non-being of beings thathave not yet come into existence. Every being is preceded by its own non-being. The passage of being into non-being and non-being into being is‘becoming’. Based on this understanding of the reality of beings, two newregions of being and becoming arise. The region of becoming is the result ofthe passage of non-being into being and vice versa. It is also argued thatMulla Sadra’s interpretation of the relationship between being and noth-ingness is closer to Sartre’s than Hegel’s. Mulla Sadra and Sartre agree thatnothingness is in the world due to the existence of the ontic beings, but forSartre, more specifically, the ontic being means the human consciousness.Mulla Sadra insists that all contingent beings, including the humanconsciousness, are preceded by their own non-existence in the world. In theregion of becoming, where the evolutionary process rules and changes insubstance as well as accidents take place, there is no room for deteriorationor corruption. All beings strive to move upwards from a lower to a higherrank of existence. Change, as we have discussed, in Mulla Sadra’s ontologyis evolution and an irreversible progress.110Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Another philosophical consequence of this doctrine that can have a signif-icant impact on the intellectual development in the Muslim world is thattrans-substantial change leads to the relativity of truth and values. The appli-cation of this doctrine deconstructs the metaphysical foundation of universaltruth and values. Relying on this doctrine for understanding the structure ofthe world means that nothing can be considered eternal or stable. Everythingis in constant change, including human society and our understanding ofreality. A consequence of this is that no system of belief can claimabsoluteness and finality for itself because novelty prevails. This conse-quence also had a profound impact on Mulla Sadra’s understanding ofpolitics, in particular political Islam, which proclaims divinity and univer-sality in its discourse. Mulla Sadra makes a vivid distinction between religionand politics and between religious laws and political laws, and rejects theidentification of the former with the latter. I have also attempted to explainthat trans-substantial change encompasses both nature and history. Ontologyand social systems are necessarily interconnected. It is hard to understandMulla Sadra’s political and social philosophy without understanding hismetaphysics. For him, metaphysics is the foundation of history and nature.Mulla Sadra’s interpretation of the world is an innovative philosophicalproject and a clear departure from Illuminationsim. It involves the devel-opment of a new intellectual discourse in the Muslim world that might have astrong influence on Islamic socio-political and theological theories,conceptual frameworks and values. The task of philosophy, for Mulla Sadra,is initially an active interpretation of the world and the realization ofsubstantial change in all beings. This realization also leads to an antagonisticstand vis-à-vis tradition and leaps towards future possibilities in the verticalmovement of evolution.In Chapter Six, I explained Mulla Sadra’s analysis of human knowledge,the unity of the intelligent and the intelligible, and God’s knowledge of theworld. Although Mulla Sadra’s metaphysics is characterized by strong oppo-sition to Illuminationism, his understanding of the human knowledge of theworld was greatly influenced by Suhrawardi’s theory of knowledge.Nevertheless, it is undeniable that Mulla Sadra departs from Suhrawardi inbelieving that anything that is in reality is a ‘being’ (Suhrawardi called it‘essence’). Without being, it is impossible to think of knowing.Mulla Sadra, like Suhrawardi, advocates the priority of knowledge by‘presence’ rather than ‘representation’. Knowledge by presence has theadvantage of apprehending the known object directly without mediation byconcepts. The human intellect does not only know the object, it also experi-ences it. Knowledge by presence in Mulla Sadra’s epistemology is neithersubjective nor objective. It is the product of the application of some innatecognitive forms and the presence of the objects apprehended by perception.The gradation of being is seen at different ranks and levels of perfectionIn Conclusion111"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"(al-idrak), and this conditions human knowledge. Accordingly there aredifferent stages and kinds of knowledge. Also, since whatever is known is‘being’ and being undergoes change, our knowledge of the world is also inconstant change and is always both relational and temporal, with theexception of the objects of intellectual perception such as the divineattributes, which are perfect and remain the same.The unity of the intellect and the intelligible occupies an important place inMulla Sadra’s philosophy. This problem has been discussed from antiquity,including by some Muslim philosophers before him, but Mulla Sadraexpressed dissatisfaction with their positions and sought to solve this problemon his own metaphysical foundation of the primacy of Being. In Chapter Six Idiscussed two possible ways to understand Mulla Sadra’s solution: onto-logical and epistemological. Ontologically, whatever is known by the intellectis neither a distinct reality nor different. The intellect and the intelligible areboth beings and modalities of the same reality. They are identical becausethey share the principle of identity, but are separate in belonging to the samereality in different ways. Their difference, which cannot be understoodwithout their identity, is due to their proximity to and remoteness from Being.As all beings are modalities of Being, the intellect and the intelligible enjoy aunity. Epistemologically, the object known after being apprehended by theintellect is conceptualized and becomes a mental property. It is also importantto understand that in Mulla Sadra’s metaphysics it is not possible to think ofthe separation of the intellect from the intelligible. His metaphysics can alsobe seen as the unity of Being; but that unity, which is the ontological conditionfor the existence of the intellect and the intelligible, remains transcendent.Although Mulla Sadra was a Muslim philosopher who developed a newphilosophical system for interpreting the structure of nature and history, theinfluence of his thought on intellectual life was felt mainly in Persia in theQajar era. At present, his philosophy is widely read and studied in Iran butlittle is known about him in Western academic circles. I hope that this bookwill serve by encouraging discussion of Mulla Sadra. This great thinkerdeserves wider attention for his place in Eastern and Western civilization andthought.Finally, this presentation of his transcendent philosophy is a modestattempt to project the main ideas of Mulla Sadra. If my book has value it is instarting a discussion on him. I am hopeful that this beginning will lead tofurther fruitful research and debate on the ideas and contribution of thisthinker to the intellectual life of our civilization.112Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"NotesChapter One1.

Bothwere influenced by Ibn ‘Arabi’s doctrine of the Unity of Being, at least until the time of ShaykhAhmad Sirhindi (1564–1624), who brought radical changes into the mystical doctrine of this order.Naqshabandiyyah was also hostile towards Shi‘i Islam. Sirhind, as one of the spiritual masters of theorder in India, declared holy war against Shi‘ism and the eclectic system of religious belief endorsedby Akbar, the Mughal Emperor (r. 1542–1605), and branded them heretical.8. According to Lapidus, the Safawid rulers were less hostile towards the Armenian Christians in Persiabecause of their conflict with the Greek Orthodox Church, whose base was in the territory of theOttoman Empire.

Agha Muhammad Khan, the founder of this dynasty, defeatednumerous rivals and brought all of Iran under his rule, establishing the Qajar dynasty with its territoryfrom Georgia and the Caucasus to the Persian Gulf. The Qajars established their capital at Teheran, avillage near the ruins of the ancient city of Rayy. In 1796 Agha Muhammad Khan was formallycrowned as a new king. This dynasty was destroyed by a military coup in February 1921 by RezaShah, who ousted Ahmed Shah, the last Qajar king. Ahmed Shah was officially removed from officeby the Iranian national assembly in October 1925 while he was in Europe and the Pehlavi dynasty wasestablished. 53.

Babism is a religious sect founded by Mirza ‘Ali Muhammad (1819–1266/1850), who was born inShiraz and executed in Tabriz. He claimed to be the bab, the ‘gate’ or the intermediary between thehidden imam and the Shi‘ite community. His followers came to believe that he was the new MessiahNotes117"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"or the imam, which he himself did not deny. His new movement was regarded by the official ‘ulamaasa threat to authority and dangerous. He was summoned to Teheran, where he was arrested thenexecuted. One of his followers, Mirza Husayn ‘Ali Nuri, developed Babism further, establishing a newsect called Baha’ism, after which he assumed the name Baha’ullah. Baha’ullah was arrested in 1852and imprisoned in Teheran. Later, in 1853, he was deported to Baghdad and claimed to be a newprophet. He was subsequently confined by the Ottomans in Adrianople and then in Acre in Palestine(now ‘Akka, in Israel).

Khamenei has mistakenly used the Heideggerian termDaseinfor the particularization of Being. He states that ‘although existence is indivisible and even inde-finable reality, its degrees of radiation upon objects could create several existences, each different fromthe other, and each possessing a specific definition and some features such as time and space. We mightcall each of them a Dasein’. See S.M. Khamenei, Mulla Sadra’s Transcendent Philosophy(Teheran,2004), pp. 57–58. In Heidegger’s ontology the term Daseinis used to describe human existence only andnot the particularization of Being in all ontic beings. Heidegger clearly states that ‘Being which is anissue for this entity in its very Being, is in each case mine. Thus Daseinis never to be taken ontologicallyas an instance or special case of some genus of entities as things that are present-at-hand. To entities suchas these, their Being is “a matter of indifference”; or more precisely, they “are” such that their Being canbe neither the matter of indifference to them nor the opposite. Because Daseinhas in each case minenessNotes119"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"[Jemeinigkeit], one must always use a personalpronoun when one addresses it: ‘I am.’, ‘You are.’” SeeHeidegger, Being and Time, pp. 67–68. Elsewhere, Heidegger also states that ‘Daseinis not a “thing”like a piece of wood not such a thing as a plant–nor does it consist of experiences, and still less is it asubject (an ego) standing over against objects (which are not the ego). It is a distinctive being [Seiendes]which precisely insofar as it “is there” for itself in an authentic manner is not an object-in formal terms:toward-which of a being-directed toward it by mean-ing it.’ See Martin Heidegger, Ontology–TheHermeneutics of Facticity, translated by John van Buren (Bloomington, 1999), p. 17.43.

The first type of movement is not observable, such as continuity or motion from beginningto the end. This movement for him is subjective and a mental image. The second type, such as themovement of a body from one point to another in space, is observable. The first movement gives riseto the idea of time as an extension because the observation in this case is concerned with time-instances. He also refuses to call time an extension or subjective. Time is continuity like the measureof the moving body in space. See Fazlur Rahman, The Philosophy of Mulla Sadra, p. 95.Notes121"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"30.

Mu‘tazilite was a rationalist theological school founded in Basrah by some pupils of Hasan al-Basri(642–728) who had seceded from him. The Mu‘tazilites interpreted the dogmas of faith in the light ofhuman reason. They believed in the unity of God and the notion of divine justice, which led them toreject the idea of predestination and advocate the doctrine of free will or al-qadariyyah. A branch ofthis school was founded by Bishr b. al-Mu‘tamir (d. 825) in Baghdad and was patronized by the‘Abbasid caliph al-Ma’mun (r. 813–833), who began an ‘Inquisition’ under the influence of theMu‘tazilites against those who believed in the uncreatedness of the Qur’an. 51. Spinoza, Ethics, Proposition III, Prop. V, p. 3.52. Hanbalis were the followers of the Hanbali School of law, which was named after its founder Ahmedb. Hanbal (780–855). Before the ‘Inquisition’ of caliph al-Ma’mun, Ahmed b. Hanbal denied that theQur’an was created, for which he was imprisoned. In 848, the caliph al Mutawakkil reversed thispolicy, abandoned the Mu‘tazilite doctrine and accepted the idea of the uncreatedness of the Qur’an.The traditionalist theology of Ahmad b. Hanbal was subsequently revived. Ahmed b. Hanbal was agreat scholar of Hadith and his main work is the Musnad.53. Fazlur Rahman, The Philosophy of Mulla Sadra, p. 147.54.
