How closely can Sufioppositions to rationality in medieval Islamic thought resemble the con-temporary, deconstructive resistance to reason and the Enlightenmentproject? How far is the medieval debate in Islamic tradition, concerningthe extent to which we can talk truthfully and meaningfully about God,analogous to the postmodern debate of more recent times, concerningthe extent to which we can talk truthfully and meaningfully about theworld and the text?This book provides a fascinating exploration of these questions bydiscussing a variety of common features in the vocabularies of twothinkers, Jacques Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi, situated almost eight centuriesapart. These features include the opposition to systematizing representa-tions of God/reality/the text; a re-emphasis on the radical unthinkabilityof God and the text; a common conception of rational thought as restric-tive, commodifying and ultimately illusory – and a subsequent appraisalof confusion as leading to a higher state of knowledge; a positive belief inthe infinite interpretability of the text; a suspicion of representation – andan awareness of its semantic futility, along with a common, ‘welcoming’affirmation of openness and errancy towards God and the text.This book will be essential reading for advanced students andacademics of Religious Studies, Arabic and Islamic Studies and thoseinterested in the work of Jacques Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi.Ian Almondteaches English Literature at Bosphorus University,Istanbul, Turkey.

From Heraclitus and Augustine to Aquinas, prece-dents for existentialism are found almost daily, even though Pamuk’slong and extraordinary novel, it should be said, finds little sympathy withthis practice. Parodying the familiar territorial instinct which, in manycritics, seeks to re-appropriate vast sections of modern culture and wholecenturies of thought on behalf of a single cultural source (invariably thecritic’s own), Pamuk uses Ibn 2Arabi as an example of how certainIslamic/nationalist agendas in the ‘East’ (for desperate want of a betterterm) have tried to lay claims to the foundations of the West. TheShaykh’s alleged influence on Dante’s Divina Commedia– althoughPamuk never mentions the scholar who first suggested this, AsinPalacios, by name – is cited as one example amongst many of suchwishful hermeneutics.‘Robbed blind’ or not, one thing is certain: Ibn 2Arabi is ‘hot’.In the 150 years since the first of Ibn 2Arabi’s works were printed inEurope,2the body of critical interest in a thinker previously unknownto the West has grown exponentially. With a thriving Society, a plethoraof critical studies and a quarterly Journal, Ibn 2Arabi (or the Shaykh al-akbar, the greatest master, as he is known in the Muslim world)has become associated with (to name but a few) quantum mechanics,Taoism, St Thomas Aquinas, Swedenborg, New Age mysticism, Kantand Chaos theory.

Thus a critic such asMahmoud al-Ghorab can demonstrate, in twenty pages, how Ibn 2Arabiwas neither a Shi1ite, nor a philosopher, nor an Isma1ili, nor an esoteri-cist, nor a figure especially sympathetic to Jews and Christians, butrather a ‘Muslim’and a ‘Traditionalist (salafi)’.3Even William Chittick,a towering figure in Ibn 2Arabi studies, appears wary of associating theShaykh with modern theorists who ‘claim that language determines allof reality’.4There is an understandable desire for context in all of this(Derrida’s ‘indispensable guardrail’),5even if establishing exactlywhat that context is– and whether Ibn 2Arabi is being read inor outof it – remains easier said than done.It is certainly not the object of this book to claim that Ibn 2Arabi wasthe existentialist – or post-structuralist – of all time, as Pamuk jokes.Rather, we will be trying to understand Sufism and deconstruction, toabuse an analogy from Benjamin, as different fragments belonging tothe same, long-shattered vase. In dealing with texts whose origins liealmost eight hundred years and many more kilometres apart, it is nottheintention of this study to turn a thirteenth-century Sufi into a postmod-ern theorist, anymore than it is our desire to ‘islamicize’Jacques Derridaor transform his writings into a form of Islamic mysticism (producing a‘Jacques of El-Biar’, as John D. Caputo has already quipped).6Over thepast fifteen years, scholars from comparative religion and theologydepartments around the world have been rediscovering in their own reli-gious traditions various precedents for Derrida’s deconstructive writings,a trend there is certainly every reason to encourage. Figures such asPseudo-Dionysius, Meister Eckhart, Sankara, Lao-Tzu and Ayn al-Qudat Hamadani have all been credited with deconstructing the rigidlogocentric assumptions within their own respective faiths, rescuing amore authentic spirituality from the legalistic metaphysics of theirtimes.7Certainly one aim of this study is to show how a similar decon-structive process can be found in the writings of Ibn 2Arabi – a demon-stration, however, which is far from turning the Great Shaykh into amedieval post-structuralist.Hopefully, such comparisons will act as a point of departure for thisstudy, and not as a destination in themselves.

How analogous can the vocab-ulary of a Sufi saint be to the work of a contemporary French theoristwho, on his own admission, ‘rightly pass(es) for an atheist’?8Do themetaphors, strategies and motifs of deconstruction change their meaningat all in the context of a comparison with Sufism? Can Ibn 2Arabi teachus how to read Derrida differently (and vice versa)?Derrida’s interest in Islam, it has to be said, has been slight.9Apartfrom a handful of remarks in The Gift of Deathand some remarks onAlgeria, comments on Islam and Islamic thought have been conspicu-ously absent in a writer who spent the early, formative years of his lifein a Muslim country (Algeria). What Derrida hasbeen interested in,however, is mysticism – or more precisely, the ways in which many com-mentators have either tried to re-describe Derrida as a mystic/negativetheologian, or have re-proposed figures from the mystical tradition suchas Eckhart and Pseudo-Dionysius as predecessors for deconstruction.Over the years, Derrida has spent a considerable amount of text object-ing to both these counts – amongst which the most significant workappears to be his 1987 essay, ‘How to Avoid Speaking: Denials’. In‘Denials’, Derrida takes issue with the ‘Greek...and Christian para-digms’ of negative theology and tries to show how, even though ‘theonto-theological re-appropriation [of différance] always remains possi-ble’,10thinkers such as Pseudo-Dionysius and Eckhart are ultimatelyconcerned with something very different – the preservation of a ‘hyper-essentiality, a being beyond Being’.11Nevertheless, in restricting hischoice to Greek and Christian versions of the apophatic, Derrida – who,far from being Greek or Christian, describes himself in Circumfessionasa ‘very Arab little Jew’ – is aware of the various traditions he has notincluded in his face-to-face with negative theology:I thus decided not to speakof negativity or of apophatic movementsin, for example, the Jewish or Islamic traditions. To leave thisimmense place empty, and above all that which can connect such aname of God with the name of the Place, to remain thus on thethreshold – was this not the most consistent possible apophasis?Concerning that about which one cannot speak, isn’t it best toremain silent?12It is an interesting admission – or o-mission – and one which inspiresa number of questions: what exactly is the difference between theIntroduction3"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Greek/Christian negativity Derrida is willing to talk about and theJewish/Islamic versions he feels he cannot? Is Derrida hinting at a cer-tain deconstructive success in Jewish and Sufi mysticism, a success notto be confused with their Greek/Christian counterparts and all theirHellenized dependency on the logos and the epekeina tes ousia? Or,on the contrary, does Derrida believe the Jewish/Islamic traditions heis unfamiliar with to be just as metaphysically vulnerable as theGreek/Christian negativity he so confidently deconstructs?Derrida’s allusion to the famous last line of Wittgenstein’s Tractatus(Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen)remains unclear – why is the ‘immense place’ of Judaism and Islam sounspeakable? What gives it special treatment? The ‘unspeakable’(Unaussprechliches) the young Wittgenstein referred to was a very un-Derridean unspeakability, a place outside the world of facts and things –it seems unlikely that Derrida would use such a transcendental space tolocate a genuine alternative to the Greek/Christian paradigm. If themeaning of Derrida’s ‘cannot speak’ lies in the fact that the author doesnot ‘belong’ to the traditions he has chosen to pass over, then the omis-sion becomes even more curious: an Algerian Jew who feels ‘at home’writing about a Syrian monk, a German Dominican and a Bavarianphenomenologist, but hesitant in offering comments upon his own(albeit abandoned) faith – or, for that matter, on an Islamic tradition(Ibn Masarrah, Ibn 2Arabi, Ibn Rushd) based to a large extent inMoorish Spain, in the very ‘Christian Europe’ Derrida has quite rightlycritiqued elsewhere.So what is the real reason for Derrida’s decision ‘not to speak’ ofJewish and Islamic traditions, in his counter-deconstruction of negativetheology (for this is what ‘Denials’ is, fundamentally)? Why doesDerrida choose to stay in Christian Europe? Perhaps there are no com-plex reasons, but only straightforward ones: maybe Derrida simplydoesn’t know enough about the School of Gerona or the Sefer ha-bahiror Ibn 2Arabi or Mevlana or Suhrawardi. Perhaps he can’t read Arabicor Aramaic. Perhaps he was too enticed by the possible genealogy ofthree figures such as Pseudo-Dionysius, Eckhart and Heidegger (eachof whom has read his predecessor) to wander off into the strange desertsof Kabbalism or Persian esotericism. There may even be the possibilitythat Derrida, in a distinctly underconstructed moment of political cor-rectness, was more attracted by the deconstruction of a EuropeanChristian tradition than a non-European Islamic/Judaic one; after all histalk of ‘a Europe united in Christianity’ and the ‘logocentric impasse ofEuropean domesticity’,13perhaps Derrida felt a more pressing need to4Introduction"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"deconstruct Euro-Christian logocentrisms rather than their Islamic orJewish equivalents.This all sounds rather cynical, and perhaps unjustly so. Whatever thereasons for Derrida choosing notto talk about Islamic mysticism, onething remains clear: Derrida provides the sort of explanation only a neg-ative theologian would offer. His silence, we are told, is the most ‘con-sistent possible apophasis’ he can offer on the question of Islam. Whichdoes suggest, unkindly or not, that ‘Islamic traditions’ belong to some-thing far too radically autrefor a French post-structuralist to write about.Islam becomes the unspeakable Other once again, an Other simply outof place in any critique of Christian negative theology.We will try to show, in response to this, how the work of Ibn 2Arabi,far from being some obscure Sufi esotericism encrypted in mysticalEastern terminology, actually asks the same questions and moves insome similar directions as a number of familiar figures in the West.Ibn2Arabi’s mistrust of rational/metaphysical thought, his awareness ofthe creative power of language, his keen understanding of the reliance ofidentity upon difference, his sophisticated hermeneutics and re-evaluationof selfhood...all allow him similarities with key figures in the Westernphilosophical tradition. Which is why the invisible presence of MeisterEckhart (1260–1327) makes itself felt throughout this book as a phan-tom third figure in our comparative study of Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi.There are two reasons for this: not only is Eckhart the figure most oftenassociated in the West with Ibn 2Arabi, he is also the figure most oftenassociated by Derrida with negative theology.Ibn 2Arabi has been called, by one critic, the ‘Meister Eckhart of theIslamic tradition’.14A surprising number of Western studies and transla-tions of Ibn 2Arabi mention Eckhart in passing (see in particular DomSylvester Houdehard), whilst scholars like Ralph Austin even speak of‘striking resemblances’. Even without having read a word of eitherthinker’s works, it is not difficult to see why so many scholars seem tolink them together. Two thinkers who both attempt a radical synthesis ofthe mystical with the philosophical – and who subsequently suffer per-secution from the authorities as a result; who embark upon lengthypilgrimages/journeys, lasting years (Seville to Damascus, Erfurt toAvignon); two figures who draw their own set of disciples after them(Suso, Tauler, Davud Al1Qayseri, al-Qashani) to comment upon theirworks and disseminate their ideas. Even the modern critical debates con-cerning the two are analogous – arguments over both thinkers’orthodoxyand their denominational status (Shi1ia or Sunni? Catholic or earlyprecedent of the Reformation?), the same allegations of pantheism, theIntroduction5"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"same questioning of their clarity and coherence as thinkers (Denifle/Affifi), the same comparisons with Far Eastern thought-systems (Suzuki,Ueda/Izutsu)...if one were to try and search medieval Christendom foran Ibn 2Arabi, Eckhart would appear to be the nearest alternative.Although I have, elsewhere, gone to some trouble to show howEckhart and Ibn 2Arabi develop from identical points of departure intoultimately different vocabularies, this abundance of comparisonsbetween the Shaykh and the Meisteris good news for our own examina-tion of Sufism and deconstruction.15Although Derrida has not written aword about Sufism, he has written a great deal about Meister Eckhart.As early as 1964, within the pages of Revue de Métaphysique et deMorale, Derrida displays a revealing knowledge of ‘Maître Eckhart’’svernacular sermons, whilst in ‘How to Avoid Speaking: Denials’ hefleshes out the elementary points he had made concerning Eckharttwenty years earlier. Naturally, this does not mean that what Derridawrites about Eckhart is automatically valid for Ibn 2Arabi as well. WhatDerrida’s fascination with Eckhart does do is give us an idea of whereIbn 2Arabi’s points of similarity with Eckhart (mistrust of metaphysicsand rationality, insistence on openness, the idea of ‘God’ as a construct,a hidden divinity in the soul, a radically generous hermeneutics...)would be similarly prone to a deconstructive reading. Eckhart cannotsimply be used as a handy Christian synonym for Ibn 2Arabi; the Meistercan serve, however, as a useful barometer to measure Derrida’s own hos-tility and sympathy towards the wider ideas of mysticism and negativetheology.6Introduction"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"1 The shackles of reasonSufi/deconstructive opposition torational thoughtHe who claims to know that God is his CreatorWhile not being perplexed, this is the evidence of his ignorance.Ibn 2Arabi, from the Futuhat al-Makkiyya1If one were ambitious enough to compile a chronology of oppositions toWestern rational thought – a chronology broad enough to include suchfigures as Al-Ghazali, Meister Eckhart, Rousseau, Blake, Nietzsche andLevinas – it would be interesting to see what kind of common denomina-tors, if any, such a study would produce. Metaphors of wind, breath, spiritand freedom would probably abound; a common emphasis on ‘openness’(futuh/ouvert– an important word for both our thinkers), an aversiontowards rigidity and systems, an exaltation of wandering and a defamationof reason as somehow unnatural and restrictive...in other words, a rejec-tion of reason which would be almost aestheticallymotivated.In this chapter, two such oppositions to rational and metaphysicalthought are going to be examined alongside one another: Ibn 2Arabi’scritique of naz.aror reflective thought, and Derrida’s much wider re-examination of the entire theo-philosophical tradition of the West –the ‘fundamental conceptual system produced by the Greco-Europeanadventure’, as Derrida puts it.2The first thing the attentive reader notices about both Derrida and Ibn2Arabi is the absolute singularity of their positions. Neither of the twoseems willing to attach their writings to a particular school of thought(madhahib) or tradition; a curious solitude seems to pervade their workas they critique – sometimes subtly, sometimes openly – practicallyevery thinker they encounter, be they Mu1tazilites or phenomenologists,Ash1arites or structural linguists, esotericists (al-batiniyya) or existen-tialists. Probably the best example of this in Ibn 2Arabi occurs towards"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"the end of his treatise Shajarat al-Kawn, where the Shaykh envisages anomnitemporal Allah foretelling to Muhammad the numerous ways inwhich subsequent thinkers are going to misunderstand His Essence:O Muhammad, I created my creatures and summoned them toMyself, but they differed among themselves with regard to Me. Onegroup among them claimed that Ezra was My Son (IX: 30), and thatMy hand is fettered (V: 64–69). These are the Jews. Another groupclaimed that the Messiah is My Son (IX: 30), that I had a wife andchild. These are the Christians. Another group gave Me partners.They are the idolaters. Another group gave Me a form. They are thecorporealists [the Mujassima]. Another group made Me limited.They are the Mushabbiha. Another group made Me non-existent.They are the Mu1attila. And there is another group who claim thatI shall not be seen in the hereafter. They are the Mu1tazilites.3Not surprisingly, passages such as these have earned Ibn 2Arabi thedescription ‘arrogant’ on more than one occasion. Not only does theShaykh distance himself from his contemporaries, he puts his criticismsin the mouth of the Divine. Clearly, the author wants to avoid the twodangers present to any Islamic thinker – the possibility of ta1tilor com-plete denudation of God’s attributes on one hand, and tashbihor overde-termining God with positive attributes on the other. This difficult coursewhich Ibn 2Arabi charters between the apophatic and the cataphatic willhave to be followed carefully if we are to understand exactly why theShaykh remains aloof from every form of reflective thought. The author’sobjections to the groups of thinkers mentioned in the previous passage –the Mu1tazilites, the Mujassima, the Mu1attila, the Mushabbiha, not tomention the Christians and Jews – are not merely partisan quibbles.Some common error lies at the heart of Ibn 2Arabi’s criticisms, someperceived, fundamental mistake motivates Ibn 2Arabi’s slightly genericdismissal of five centuries of Islamic thought.Derrida, likewise, cultivates a certain distance between his own tex-tual strategies and the thinkers he writes about, isolating moments ofself-presence in their work which re-consign them to an uninterruptedtradition of logocentric metaphysics. Unlike Ibn 2Arabi, praise and cri-tique in Derrida’s writings are often subtly blended together, particularlyin dealing with figures whose own aims seem to closely resemble thoseof Derrida’s. Derrida’s 1964 essay on Levinas, whilst never renouncinga tone of respect for the thoughts ‘assembled and enriched in that great8The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"book Totality and Infinity’,4nevertheless portrays a Levinas ‘resigned tobetraying his own intentions in his philosophical discourse’.5In ‘Structure, Sign and Play’, Derrida’s ‘fascination’ with Levi-Strauss’‘remarkable endeavour’ doesn’t stop him from finding the anthropolo-gist guilty of ‘an ethic of nostalgia for origins’(d1éthique...de nostalgiede l1origine).6Various figures in Christian negative theology(St Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius, Eckhart), held by many to be amedieval precedent for deconstruction, have received similar treatmentfrom Derrida. On the one hand, Derrida has taken great pains to pointout his admiration for negative theology – a ‘corpus at once open andclosed’, and written in a language ‘that does not cease testing the verylimits of language’.7On the other hand negative theology, for all its rad-ical questioning of metaphysics, still ‘belongs...to the onto-theologicalpromise it seems to break’.8It still remains ultimately logocentric in itspurpose – to preserve the secret name of God.In other words: just as Ibn 2Arabi believes that no thinker can provide‘a definition of the Real [al-haqq]’,9Derrida insists that no thinker canescape the history of metaphysics. Even the trinity of Nietzsche, Freudand Heidegger, credited with no less an achievement than ‘the critiqueof the concepts of Being and truth..., of self-presence..., and thedestruction of metaphysics’, even these initiators of the dissolution ofWestern metaphysics remain ‘trapped in a kind of circle’(sont pris dansune sorte de cercle).10Something remains, some kind of special knowl-edge or realization, which distinguishes Ibn 2Arabi and Derrida fromtheir respective traditions; ‘something’ both thinkers feel they haveunderstood, some kind of gnosis or situation, an awareness of a hiddencomplexity which enables them to re-contextualize their predecessorsand contemporaries so confidently.It is to the examination of this special ‘something’that the rest of thischapter is dedicated: what exactly motivates Ibn 2Arabi and Derrida’scomprehensive rejection of metaphysical thought? Tempted by brevity,one could sum up both thinkers’ reasons in two easy responses: for Ibn2Arabi, the philosophers and the theologians have yet to understand thesimultaneous transcendence (tanzih) and immanence (tashbih) of God.11For Derrida, Western metaphysics has never really problematized theword ‘meaning’, nor come to terms with the fact that signs do not leadus to ‘meanings’, but simply to other signs. Such responses, however,would be inadequate. Both Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi’s distrust of meta-physics is far more complex, and will involve an analysis of terms suchas al-haqqand écritureif we are to understand their objections at all.The shackles of reason9"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The emancipatory project in Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi: freeing al-haqqand l1écriturefrom the shackles of reasonBoth Ibn 2Arabi and Derrida, in their own contexts, speak of fetters andfreedom. It is no exaggeration to say that a certain emancipatory spiritunderlies both their projects – ‘emancipatory’ not in any social sense,but rather the emancipation of the unknowability of the Real/the uncon-trollability of writing from the shackles of rational/metaphysicalthought. Indeed, one could say the entire aim of Of Grammatologyis theliberation of écriturefrom ‘the rank of an instrument enslaved to full andoriginarily spoken language’.12Of course, these are not identical gestures:Derrida’s liberation is a purely semantic one, whereas Ibn 2Arabi has amore spiritual aim in mind. Nevertheless, the re-affirmation of some-thing vital, inconstant and elusive which defeats all our attempts to talkabout it will play a common role in both thinkers’ vocabularies, andevolve according to a common structure. A look at the contexts of bothIbn 2Arabi and Derrida’s writings may help us to understand this better.The people of reflection (ahl al-nazar)and the idolatry of the signIn the Futuhat, Ibn 2Arabi points out that the root meaning of the wordfor reason (2aql) comes from the same root as the word for ‘fetter’(2iqal).13It is a convenient etymology for the Shaykh, whose main objec-tion to the philosophers and theologians is that they narrow and limit a‘Divine Vastness’ (al-tawassu1al-ilahi) that is without attribute or limit.‘Every group have believed something different about God,’14he writes,always exuding a very definite impatience with those who mistake theirspecific beliefs for knowledge of the Absolute. Ibn 2Arabi’s impatiencehere would be with both affirmative and negative schools of theology,both with those who insist God can be predicated through His effects(the Ash1arites), and those who said nothing could ultimately be predi-cated of God, only what He is not (the Mu1tazilites). Not that theMu1tazilites and Ash1arites were polar opposites – al-Ash1ari’s master,after all, had been the head of the Basra Mu1tazilites (al-Juba1i).15A com-mon willingness to use reason as a tool in their arguments also charac-terized both groups – even if for the Ash1arites reason was an instrumentused to justify revelation, and not vice versa. Such debates concerning theunknowability of God would have formed a common background to Ibn2Arabi’s thought, producing such a proliferation of schools, quarrels and10The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"doctrines that one can well sympathize with the Shaykh’s words: ‘I hearthe grinding, but I don’t see any flour’.16Thus, a believer in the eternalattributes of God such as al-Ash1ari (873–935) can declare:We confess that God is firmly seated on His Throne...We confessthat God has two hands, without asking how...We confess that Godhas two eyes, without asking how...We confess that God has aface ... We affirm hearing and sight, and do not deny that, as do theMu1tazila, the Jahmiyya, and the Khawarij...17Whereas other, more apophatically inclined groups such as theMu1tazilites are capable of producing statements which, for Westernreaders, are reminiscent of Dionysius the Areopagite:He is no body, nor object, nor volume, nor form ... Neither is heprovided with parts, divisions, limbs, members ... He cannot bedescribed by any description which can be applied to creatures ...He is a being, but not as other beings ...18In a sense these two extreme positions of tashbih(anthropomorphism) andtanzih(incomparability) provided the parameters of a very wide debate.How much can we know about God? What is the relationship betweenthe Divine Names (the Merciful, the Generous, the Knower, etc.) to theDivinity – are they simply analogies? Or do they reflect some positive eter-nal attributes? How much of our beliefs concerning God are actually valid?How can we ascertain this? If there really is, as the Quran says, ‘nothinglike Him’ (42: 11), then how can we know anything about God at all?Such questions, amongst others, had been debated over the centuriesby the philosophers of the Kalam. As Abdel Haleem has shown, the term‘Kalam’ is difficult to define with any accuracy.19Literally, it means‘speech’, and denotes the general discussion of religious issues pertain-ing to the Quran – not just the extent of God’s knowability, but also suchquestions as the problem of freewill and divine pre-determinism, the sta-tus of the Quran and the implementation of the Shariah. ‘Kalam’was notsimply a discussion of religious topics, however – it usually required thepresence of an adversary, an opposite position against whom the variousarguments could be raised. It is not difficult to see why Ibn 2Arabiwanted to distance himself from the thinkers of the Kalam and dismiss theirefforts with words such as ‘meddlesome’ (fudul) and ‘obfuscation’.

Some past definitions of Kalamare quite telling in this respect – Al-Farabi saw Kalam as ‘a sciencewhich enables a person to support specific beliefs and actions laid downby the Legislators’; al-Iji goes slightly farther, insisting Kalam does notsupport but rather ‘establish(es) religious beliefs, by adducing argu-ments and banishing doubts.’ For Ibn Khaldun, Kalam is ‘the sciencethat involves arguing with rational proofs in defence of the articles offaith and refuting innovators who deviate from orthodoxy’, whilst themodern Muhammad 2Abduh proposes as a definition ‘a science thatstudies the Being and Attributes of God, the essential and possible affir-mations about Him.’20In all of these definitions, a certain theme is con-stant: the acquisition of divine knowledge in order to justify social andlegal practices, facilitate hermeneutics, systematize theology and ascer-tain exactly what is orthodox and what is heresy (ilhad).Ibn 2Arabi’s context: placing the ShaykhTrying to place Ibn 2Arabi’s writings in their proper context is not asstraightforward as it sounds. The diversity of opinions and interpreta-tions of Ibn 2Arabi is reflected, in part, by the variety of different con-texts – Sufi gnostic, Neoplatonist, hadith scholar, philosopher, mystic –critics are willing to place him in. If Burckhardt originally saw Ibn2Arabi as a ‘fundamentally Platonic’ thinker, early biographers of theShaykh such as Ibn al-Abbar (d.1260) saw him rather as a muhaddithorscholar of the sayings of the prophet.21Whereas scholars such as Nettonand Corbin mention Ibn 2Arabi in the same breath as the Persian mysticSuhrawardi – even, in Corbin’s case, to the point of suggesting theFutuhatmay be more comfortably read in a Shiite tradition rather than aSunni one22– Majid Fakhry pairs Ibn 2Arabi with al-Ghazali in hisHistory of Islamic Philosophyas two examples of ‘synthesis and sys-temization’.23Even the Encyclopedia Britannicahas a slightly differentgenealogy to offer, suggesting Ibn Masarrah – and ultimatelyEmpedocles – as one of the primary sources of Ibn 2Arabi’s thought.Ibn 2Arabi was born in Murcia, in the southeast of Muslim Spain, in1165. Both in terms of time and place, the Shaykh found himself at a12The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"pivotal point in the history of Islamic thought, where philosophy, kalam(or scholastic theology) and Sufism were all developing and borrowingfrom one another. Thus, a wide currency of terms and motifs werealready in use (such as emanation, unity, attribute, intelligence), termswhich Ibn 2Arabi would be able to incorporate into his own unique sys-tem, giving them their own particular meaning. The Shaykh’s readingwas wide – frequent references not just to the Mu1tazilites, the Ash1aritesand the exotericists but also individual figures such as al-Ghazali, IbnMasarrah and Ibn Qasyi, reinforce the fact that Ibn 2Arabi was articu-lately familiar with his predecessors. Ibn 2Arabi also knew a number ofthem in person – the famous female mystic and saint Fatima of Cordobawas his teacher for two years, whilst as a young man he had a famousencounter with the great Ibn Rushd (Averroes). When the two met, it isreported, Ibn Rushd was surprised to see that the young man he hadheard so much about still did not have a beard. At the age of 36, Ibn2Arabi left Spain never to return for the rest of his life, on a journey thatwould take him, along the coast of North Africa, up through Egypt andJerusalem as far north as central Turkey, before coming back down tosettle in Damascus, where he died in 1240.Although Ibn 2Arabi was the author of an estimated 350 works, histwo most important books, The Bezels of Wisdom(al-Fusus al-hikem)and the Meccan Openings(al-Futuhat al-Makkiyah) differ significantlyin size. If the Fususis barely a 150 pages long, the Futuhatis an enor-mous work, made of 560 chapters and taking up numerous volumes.If the Fususis a collection of brief, somewhat esoteric commentaries onvarious figures from the Koran (Noah, Moses, Adam), the Futuhatconstitutes more of an encyclopaedic, in-depth examination of a widerange of topics – prophecy, stations, divine names, Sufi practices, thedelineations of various ontologies, reflections on interpretation andepistemology. While the Fususis a series of brief, mystical essays, theFutuhatlies closer, in terms of form at least, to the Summa Theologiae.Both works were composed by Ibn 2Arabi during his stay in Mecca,sometime between 1220 and 1230.Possibly the most basic thing one can say about the context of Ibn2Arabi’s writings is that they belong to an already well-developed tradi-tion of Islamic Neoplatonism. In Ibn 2Arabi’s case, this manifests itself ina vast, complicated system of ranked entities, stations and sub-realities,one which has prompted Annemarie Schimmel to call the Shaykh ‘agenius of systematization’.24The idea of God as a single, pure, ineffa-ble, unnamable source of all things, whose various emanations bringforth things into existence, is a standard scheme in most Sufi writings.The shackles of reason13"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"In Ibn 2Arabi’s texts, the various levels of creation form an intricateladder of Platonic hierarchies and categories through which the Breathof mercy – the pulse of creation – is constantly blowing, annihilating andre-creating in each instant. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that theterm ‘unity of Being’ (wahd al-wujud) has always been associated withIbn 2Arabi’s name, even if his later disciples and followers (Davud al-Qaysari, al-Qashani, al-Qunawi) were more responsible than theShaykh himself for emphasizing and working out this concern for one-ness systematically. Ibn 2Arabi’s ‘unity of Being’ is no pantheism(although it has often been called so), but rather an attempt by theShaykh to re-ascribe the origins and ontic status of all things to Godwhilst at the same time preserving their ontological individuality. Thepurpose of human existence, within such a system of thought, is for thehuman soul to ‘realize’its own divine origins through a gradual, ascend-ing return to God via a series of spiritual stages and stations. The word‘system’, however, has to be used quite carefully. It should not lead oneto believe (as Hamid Dabashi has suggested) Ibn 2Arabi was a ‘grandtotalising master narrator’,25one who imposed a narrow, rigid, nomo-centric system upon the divine and its emanations. On the contrary, thewhole aim of Ibn 2Arabi’s system is to reach a point where one is free ofit; the purpose of the Shaykh’s hierarchies of names and entities is tohelp the soul towards a place where those names and entities disappear.For Ibn 2Arabi, the idea of the return to God means the progression of thesoul through a complex series of gradually ascending spiritual stationsor makam, an ascent which culminates in the dissolution of all attributesdescriptions once the believer has realized their totality.26In this sense,the intricate, hierarchical system that Ibn 2Arabi has constructed must beunderstood as a very Wittgensteinian ladder, one which can be kickedaway out from under one’s feet after it has been climbed.The incomparability of the RealIbn 2Arabi’s first gesture in reply to the philosophers and theologians isto underline, beneath all the ideas and concepts of God we construct forourselves, an utterly unknowable, unthinkable God, bereft of all namesand attributes (shifa). This gesture is by no means without precedent –al-Farabi’s ‘First Cause’, we will recall, was conceived as immaterial,without associate or contrast, and not susceptible of being defined.27This unknowable entity, which is the source of all effects and actions butcannot be described by any of them, Ibn 2Arabi refers to as the DivineEssence (dhat Allah) or sometimes the Real (al-haqq) – a word which,14The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"for Western readers, is not without its Lacanian echoes.28‘In our viewthere is no disputing the fact that the Essence is unknown’.29Rather likeEckhart’s ‘God beyond God’ and Plotinus’ Ineffable One, it remainsforever untouched by every proposition we try to make about it. Hencethe error of the rational thinkers, who have mistaken their constructs forthe Real itself:When a person rationally considers God, he creates what he believesin himself through his consideration. Hence he considers only a godthat he has created through his consideration.30Such constructs Ibn 2Arabi refers to, near the end of the Fusus al-Hikem,as the ‘God of Belief’, which changes according to the predisposition ofthe believer.31As we shall see, Ibn 2Arabi has a generally benign attitudetowards such constructs, as long as the believer is aware of the ‘actualsituation’ – that is, the artificiality of his/her God. The problem withthinkers such as the Ash1arites is that they have built and elaborated theirentire theology upon an empty construct – one that they feel sure to be‘God’. It is here where parallels with deconstruction become most inter-esting; just as Derrida sees all metaphysical thinkers as basing theirthought-systems upon illusory moments of ‘self-presence’ – a ‘centre’which is never really the centre,32a signifier which can only ever lead toother signifiers – Ibn 2Arabi sees all reflective thinkers as building theirideas about God on something which is not really God. In both cases, thephilosopher falls victim to a certain illusion – the unquestioning convic-tion that the semantic foundation of the thinker’s thought-system (‘God’,‘experience’, ‘reality’, ‘innocence’) is somehow sufficient in itself, andrequires no further justification.The infinity of the RealApart from the incomparability of the Real which renders every con-ceptual proposition about the Real potentially idolatrous, there are threeother reasons why Ibn 2Arabi feels our rational faculties can tell us noth-ing about the Real – and all three have to do with the uncontrollability/unthinkability of the Real. The first and most important reason whyreflective thought is inadequate for giving us any knowledge about Godis, quite simply, its finitude:He who does not restrict Him does not deny Him, but affirms HisReality in every formal transformation, worshipping Him in HisThe shackles of reason15"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"infinite forms, since there is no limit to the forms in which Hemanifests Himself.33... the intellect restricts and seeks to define the truth within a par-ticular qualification, while in fact the Reality does not admit of sucha limitation. It is not a reminder for the intellectuals and mongers ofdoctrinal formulations who contradict one another and denounceeach other...and they have no helpers(3: 91).34Although in this passage it is not so much the unknowable Real that isinfinite, but rather its manifestations, the problem such infinity presentsto the narrowing parameters of Reason remains the same. God encom-passes an infinite sea of forms, He ‘possesses relationships, faces andrealities without limit’.35Among this endless, ever-fluctuating plethoraof images and forms, the philosophers and thinkers have seized uponone or two images and attempted to found their epistemologies on them,mistaking them for the Real itself. In this sense, all theologies for Ibn2Arabi are idolatries (shirk), if they do not take into account the infiniterange of divine possibilities in addition to their own. Although Ibn 2Arabihas many positive things to say about reason, his insistence on thetheologians’ignorance of God’s infinite semantic richness pervades boththe Fusus al-Hikamand the Futuhat.If Ibn 2Arabi loses his patience with those who chain the Real to theirown meanings and dismiss any other manifestation as heresy, Derridaspends a similar amount of energy exploring the infinite semanticpossibilities of a text – and how various thinkers have sought to restrictthese possibilities to their own interpretations. For Derrida, the desire torestrict a text and make it say only what wewant it to is embodied in the‘preface’ – the short text with which an author introduces his work, andwhich is intended to ‘sum up’the general aim and intentions of the workthat follows, so that no misunderstandings can take place.InDissemination, Derrida is particularly interested in the Hegelianpreface – how Hegel sees, and doubts, the Vorwortas a way of ensuringthat certain unacceptableinterpretations of his work will never takeplace. In Ibn 2Arabi’s terms, the preface is the attempt to limit the text’sinfinite possibilities (batin) to one interpretation only (zahir), the othersbeing considered heretical. It chains the semantic infinity of the text toone manifestation and one only – that of the author’s desired reading.A preface is an attempt to say what is, has been and will be:The preface would announce in the future tense (‘This is whatyou are going to read’) the conceptual content or significance...of16The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"what will already have been written...From the viewpoint of theforeword, which creates an intention-to-say after the fact, the textexists as something written...which...a bidden omnipotent author(in full mastery of his product) is presenting to the reader as hisfuture...the prereduces the future [possibilities of the text] to theform of manifest presence.36It is this ‘reduction’which both Ibn 2Arabi and Derrida, in their own con-texts, will object to, even though the reasons for such an objection willnot be the same. If Derrida feels the original, reductive purpose of thepreface to be an ‘essential and ludicrous operation’ (ibid.), it is notbecause the text (like Ibn 2Arabi’s God) already has within it an untappedinfinity of meanings, but rather because of the uncontrollable semanticplay within the text which must necessarily open up new and unexpectedreadings of the work – new readings which no preface, however carefuland comprehensive, can anticipate. On this point, at least, the differenceseems clear: Ibn 2Arabi resists logocentric reductions of the Real on thegrounds of God’s inexhaustible Divinity, while Derrida’s objectionstowards totalizing exegesis stems more from a belief in the un-arrestableplay of forces within the text, rather than any theological concept of itsinfinite unfathomability.The unrepeatability of the RealIbn 2Arabi’s second reason why the Real resists all exclusive appropria-tions lies perhaps somewhat closer to the structure of Derrida’s ownapproach: the fact that the Real, in all its manifestations, never repeatsitself. Ibn 2Arabi’s main justification of this is the Koranic verse 55:29Each day He is upon some new task. It is a feature of the Real that,although alluded to only briefly in the Fusus,37is elaborated upon quiteheavily in the Futuhat:That which is past never returns, since were it to return, somethingin existence would repeat itself, but there is no repetition because ofthe Divine Vastness.[God’s] returnings undergo variation (tanawwu1), His Self-disclosuresare diverse, and His loci of manifestation are multiple,without repetition.But the gnostics...know that ‘God never discloses Himself in asingle form to two individuals, nor in a single form twice.’38The shackles of reason17"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Because, in one sense at least, God is an infinite storehouse of images,the unrepeatability of the Real is directly linked to the infinity of theDivine Vastness. In one single, theological bound, Ibn 2Arabi re-inscribesevery act of signification that has ever taken place as only a minutefraction of the infinite capacity of the Divine. Ibn 2Arabi is hardly thefirst to place such emphasis on the infinity of God – his originality lies,as we shall see, in the way he fleshes out all the epistemological andhermeneutical consequences of such an infinity. If God encompasses allimages, graven and holy, then idolatry is impossible when one is awareof the ‘actual situation’, for all images signify Him. An infinite God whoencompasses all images also encompasses all interpretations, hencethere is no interpretation of the Koran that God has not already under-stood and comprehended.Seen from the viewpoint of the Real, the endlessly diverse flow ofmanifestations is an effect of the Real itself, stamping its image upon thecorporeal world with a different seal each time, infinitely andomnipresently. From the viewpoint of the believer, the Real is almostProtean in its movements, forever changing from one form to another,forever manifesting itself in different ways to different groups, whilstremaining untouched by any of them. If we can keep this view of theReal as a constantly fluctuating source of manifestations in mind, Ibn2Arabi’s dismissal of reason and rational thought as a ‘fetter’ becomesclearer – like Derrida’s preface, Reason fetters constant change, it con-strains the Real from repeating itself in a different way:In the view of the Verifiers, the Real is too exalted ‘to discloseHimself in a single form twice or to two individuals’. The Realnever repeats anything, because of His nondelimitation and theDivine Vastness, since repetition amounts to constraint (dhiq) anddelimitation.39To describe God is to restrict Him; to predicate his Essence is toconstrain Him. Whoever practises theology, in effect, forces God torepeat Himself, again and again, imposing a banality and a predictabil-ity upon God which, Ibn 2Arabi clearly feels, is misplaced. Rationalthought (2aql), the tool so treasured by the philosophers of the Kalam(mutakallimun) as a means to divine knowledge, becomes a way offossilizing God’s dynamic flexibility. The Real, Whom no signifier cansignify, Whom no sign can contain, immediately abandons any name orattribute which the philosophers attempt to nail to it, in substantia. TheShaykh is not against anyone naming one of God’s attributes, providing18The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"they keep the utter unthinkability of the Real in mind. For Ibn 2Arabi,one could even make a distinction between ‘authentic’ and ‘inauthentic’modes of speech concerning God. The authentic thinkers are the Verifiers,those who predicate names and attributes to God, but at the same time areaware that the Real has an infinite range of other names and attributes too.‘Inauthentic’ thought would belong to those who, like the Ash1arites orthe Mu1tazilites, fix their own rational/theological constructs onto God,to the exclusion of all other perspectives.Hence the accusation of idolatry (shirk) which Ibn 2Arabi levels at therational thinkers, who mistake their constructs for the Real. The mutakil-limunall attempt to fix a sign onto the Real, to somehow tie it to theirown finite perspective; the possibility that the Real has no sign – that itonly moves ‘from veil to veil’40– does not occur to them. Nor are theyin the least disconcerted by the dizzying infinity of God, by the unfath-omable reservoir of His forms and faces which, if they were to realize it,would turn their doctrines from incontestable, overarching Truths intojust another glimpse of an infinitely manifesting Divinity. In this depic-tion of Kalam as ‘fettering’ the infinite unrepeatability of God, Ibn2Arabi seems to be entertaining the kind of fear which both Maimonidesand Meister Eckhart gave voice to – the fear that people desire knowl-edge of God ultimately for their own worldly purposes. It is a familiartheme in the Guide of the Perplexed, where Maimonides chastises thesophists who ‘derive [from the scriptures] inferences and secondary con-clusions’ in order to exploit the ‘multitude who listen to these utter-ances’.41Eckhart also spoke of those who ‘want to see God with thesame eyes with which they look at a cow...[they] love it for the milkand the cheese and for their own profit’.42The unpleasant speculationthat all our theologies may be born not out of a humble desire to betterunderstand the will of God and the limits of our own knowledge, butrather out of a will-to-power, a proprietary desire to familiarize and con-trol something for our own self-aggrandizement...such fears fuel Ibn2Arabi’s emphasis on the unknowability of the Essence:Were the Essence to make the loci of manifestation (mazahWr) man-ifest, it would be known. Were It known, it would be encompassed(ihata). Were it encompassed, It would be limited (hadd). Were Itlimited, It would be confined (inhisar). Were It confined, It wouldbe owned (mulk).43Manifest-known-encompassed-limited-confined-owned.

One is reminded of the images of writing and zoology that Derridaplayfully juggles with towards the end of Of Grammatology: ‘writingas zoography, as that painting of the living which stabilizes animality[fixant l1animalité]’.45The philosophers of the Kalam wish to do pre-cisely this – ‘stabilize’the Protean unrepeatability of the Real, standard-ize the variety of its manifestations, equilibrate and control theunpredictability of its theophanies.How far any comparisons between Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi’s unre-peatability of the sign/the Real can be pushed remains a difficultquestion. We have already seen how the Real cannot repeat a signbecause of the infinite store of its images – for Derrida, the unrepeata-bility has two much more terrestrial reasons: the play of presences andabsences withinthe text which renders it semantically unstable, and theinfinite number of different contexts outsidethe text which will foreverchange how it is read. In different places, Derrida has emphasized oneor the other of these factors as a reason for the unrepeatability of thesign/text. Sometimes he stresses the undecidable play of oppositionswithin a text – what he calls ‘a determinate oscillation between possibil-ities’, a feature he is careful to distinguish from ‘polysemeia’: ‘If poly-semy is infinite, if it cannot be mastered as such, this is not because afinite reading or a finite writing cannot exhaust a superabundance ofmeaning’.46In other words, if Derrida’s text is, like Ibn 2Arabi’s al-haqq,‘infinite’, the reason for such unmasterability has nothing to do with theinfinite imaginal richness of its ‘deeper meanings’, but rather becauseof ‘a certain fold’ (un certain pli)47within the text which forever fis-sures and doubles the text without repeating it. Derrida’s debt to theSaussurean ‘discovery’ of the essentially differential nature oflanguage – that sign-systems ‘work’ not through any positive elementsbut only through differences, hence we only know what something isthrough what it is not – enables him to see texts as a bristling collectionof forces, forever oscillating indeterminately between various parame-ters of meaning.In other places, however, Derrida seems to connect the hermeneuticunrepeatability of a text with the uncertain future of its trajectory – the20The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"fact that no-one can say who will appropriate the text or what kind ofuse it will be put to. Thus ‘there are only contexts without any centreof absolute anchoring’,48which accounts for the large number ofwandering motifs in Derrida’s work. The text wanders from reader toreader, its signs forever repeating themselves for different audienceswith different results, acquiring a different meaning each time the con-text is changed. The impossibility of repetition for Derrida stemsdirectly from the potentially infinite number of different contexts a textcan be read and re-read in.All this seems a far cry from Ibn 2Arabi’s infinitely differing zahir. Ifthe Derridean text, to use Abu Talib al-Makki’s words, ‘never disclosesitself in a single form to two individuals, nor in a single form twice’,such hermeneutic elasticity is certainly not the product of some vast,Neoplatonic sea of images. Probably because of its religious resonance,Derrida has always been careful with the word ‘infinite’, often prefer-ring the synonym ‘non-finite’ instead. In Of Grammatology, we arewarned of the ‘profound unity among infinitist theology, logocentrismand a certain technicism’,49to render God infinite still remains a meta-physical gesture, for it fails to call into question the idea of presence ormeaning. This idea of a ‘positive infinity’ – a phrase Derrida uses in hisessay on Levinas as a synonym for God50– does not face up to thegenuine unthinkability of God but only infinitely defers it, producing noreal critique of presence but only an infinite postponement of meaning.Hence Derrida’s refusal to connect the utter unpredictability of his textwith a ‘superabundance of meaning’; far from any idea of plenitude, it isa certain emptiness beneath the text which allows it to double and differwithout repeating itself.Nevertheless, it is difficult to say for sure whether Ibn 2Arabi’s God –that is, his idea of the Real or Essence – can be so easily dismissed asjust another one of the ‘infinitist theologies’ which Derrida regards as acloset logocentrism. There are certainly moments in the Fususwhere Ibn2Arabi’s description of God resembles Derrida’s description of the text asa constant play of forces, ‘producing a force of dislocation that spreadsitself...fissuring [the text] in every direction and thoroughly delimitingit.’51In his chapter on the Wisdom of Eminence in Moses, for example,Ibn 2Arabi gives a similar description of God as a life-giving chaos:[True] guidance means being guided to bewilderment, that he mightknow that the whole affair [of God] is perplexity, which means per-turbation and flux, and flux is life. There is no abatement and nocessation, but all is being with no non-being.52The shackles of reason21"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"A picture of God quite different from the calm, unchanging, tran-scendental infinity of orthodox theology. As God is the source of allpolarities – good and evil, immanence and transcendence, mercy andwrath – reaching Him produces a state of perplexity (hayrah) in thebeliever. Nevertheless, this is still a perplexity that produces, a primor-dial confusion which allows order to come into being. To underline this,an analogy is made for God with water, whose unceasing course andflow allows all things to live and flourish:The same is the case with water by which the earth lives and moves,as in His saying and it quiversin its pregnancy, and swellsin itsbringing forth, and brings forth every joyous pair. (ibid.)53The idea of creation as a consequence of overflowing istypically Neoplatonic – we see it in authors as diverse as Plotinus(‘the One is perfect and, in our metaphor, has overflowed and in itsexuberance has produced the new...’),54Eckhart (‘God overflows intoall creatures, and yet he remains untouched by all’),55not to mentionMuslim sages such as the Ikhwan al-S ̧afa (‘The universal soul is an effu-sion that was effused from the universal intellect...’)56and Afdal al-DinKashani (‘...the intellective world...and its good that bubbles up andboils over’).57Later on, Ibn 2Arabi’s disciples (in particular al-Qunawiand al-Farghani) would systematize the overflowing act of creation intoa series of three, five and ultimately six stages.58Like Kashani andthe Brethren, the word Ibn 2Arabi uses for this is fayd, an effusion orradiation. The idea is of interest to us because Derrida also uses thesame metaphor (déborder) to describe the way the oscillating, alterna-tive meanings in a text ‘spill over’ their boundaries and bring a text tolife: ‘If the play of meaning can overflow signification...this overflowis the moment of the attempt to write’ (si le jeu du sens peut déborder la signification...ce débord est le moment du vouloir écrire).59In thisuse of déborder, which means literally to exceed a certain markor boundary, Derrida is trying to analyse the elusive moment of the actof writing – the moment when, as soon as the mark appears on thepage, a multiplicity of meanings overflow the text and transform it, giv-ing life to new, various interpretations. Chaos and indeterminacy, soto speak, give rise to various kinds of order, although how far this cor-responds to Ibn 2Arabi’s divine, life-giving hareketand flux will beexamined further on.22The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The impossibility of the Real: simultaneous immanenceand transcendenceThe topic of perplexity brings us to the third reason why, according to Ibn2Arabi, the philosophers and theologians can make no proposition aboutthe Real. Up to now, Ibn 2Arabi has been presented somewhat in the guiseof a negative theologian – the three reasons why ‘reflective thought’remains forever inadequate to representing the Real all involve a radicallyapophatic understanding of God as incomparable, infinite and unrepeat-able. Given Derrida’s interest in negative theology, this is an aspect of Ibn2Arabi’s writing which will become increasingly important as we progress.To read Ibn 2Arabi as a negative theologian, in the manner of Eckhartand Dionysius, forever stressing the ultimate transcendence andunspeakability of God, makes sense in a certain way: it enables us tounderstand why the Shaykh criticizes positivist positions such as thoseof Al-Ash1ari, the corporealists or the Mushabbiha. However, such insis-tence on the unknowablility of God does not explain Ibn 2Arabi’s objec-tions to groups like the Mu1tazilites and the Mu1attila, groups who wereequally keen to stress the radical ineffability of God. Far from offeringany sympathy towards such positions, Ibn 2Arabi seems to include bothpositive and negative theologies (both Mu1tazilite and Ash1arite) in hisdismissal of the ahl al-nazaror People of Reflection:However, the mistakes of the People of Reflection in the divinethings (ilahiyyat) are more than their hitting the mark, whether theyare philosophers, Mu1tazilites, Ash1arites or any other sort of thepeople of consideration...[Philosophers] are blamed because theymake errors in the knowledge of God by opposing the reportsbrought by the messengers.60In other words, Ibn 2Arabi’s objection against the People of Reflectionis not necessarily a theological objection – a disagreement with a certainschool of thought over a certain issue or the interpretation of a certainverse, something which would require the taking of a position or elabo-ration of a doctrine. The philosophers of the Kalam, quite regardless ofwhatever their own positions are on the eternity of the Quran or the attrib-ute(lessness) of God, are guilty of a much more fundamental error – thatof limiting God to only one half of a dualism. When Ibn 2Arabi criticizesthe Mu1tazilites and Ash1arites together, he is criticizing two oppositepoles of a very familiar debate – that of the knowability of God. Onepole emphasizes the absolute transcendence (tanzih) of God, the otherThe shackles of reason23"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"his immanence, but neither have understood the actual situation – thatthe Real can actually be both at the same time:If you insist only on His transcendence, you restrict Him,And if you insist only on His immanence you limit Him.If you maintain both aspects you are right,An Imam and a master in the spiritual sciences.Whoso would say He is two things is a polytheist,While the one who isolates Him tries to regulate Him.Beware of comparing Him if you profess duality,And, if unity, of making Him transcendent.You are not He and you are He andYou see Him in the essences of things both boundless and limited.61To say that God can be two different things at the same time isimpossible – and it is precisely this possibility of the impossible, the ideaof God as an experience with the impossible, which the thinkers of theKalam have failed to take into account. In the Tahafut al-Falasifah (TheIncoherence of the Philosophers), Al-Ghazali cites this very idea of asimultaneous affirmation and negation (‘A is both black and white’) as animpossibility which falls within the Law of Contradiction.62From adeconstructive angle, Ibn 2Arabi’s insistence on the simultaneity of every-thing being He/not He (huwa la huwa) is an important step – it acknowl-edges the illusion of the dualism, the fundamental mistake of believingGod to be either ‘this’ or ‘that’, transcendent or immanent, ‘out there’ or‘in here’. As long as rational thought conceives of God in terms of binaryoppositions, ‘opposing the reports brought by the messengers’in order toestablish ‘true’ knowledge of God, then ‘reflection can only roam in itsown specific playing field (maydan), which is one of many fields’.63Because of its committal to a simplistic, logocentric law of identity (‘IsGod X or Y?’), reflective thought finds itself a priori unable to grasp thetrue complexity of God. Moreover, in observing how ‘the one who iso-lates Him tries to regulate Him’, Ibn 2Arabi seems to anticipate Derrida’sown reasons for his objections to binary thought. Namely, that whenevertwo terms are opposed to one another (spirit/flesh, nature/culture,speech/writing) a hierarchy always ensues; one half of the term is artifi-cially privileged over the other for ultimately ideological purposes. Ibn2Arabi seems to be prefiguring this – the Ash1arites will privilege ‘imma-nence’over ‘transcendence’in order to justify their own versions of God.‘From the moment there is meaning,’writes Derrida, ‘there are nothingbut signs’(Il n1y a donc que des signes dès lors qu1il y a du sens).64Once24The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"again, the danger arises of assuming analogous gestures to be identicalones. Both Ibn 2Arabi and Derrida reject binary thought as illusory and,at worst, potentially tyrannical. Whether their objections stem from acommon source remains to be seen. Derrida sees binary oppositions asillusions because of a certain semantic emptiness – signs forever needtheir opposites in order to negatively define themselves. For Derrida,then, to believe in a word like ‘transcendence’ is to believe in a certainabsence. ‘Transcendence’and ‘immanence’are semantic vacuities whichcan only pretend to meaning through contrast with their opposites –in other words, the immanent can only be understood as the non-transcendent, the transcendent as the non-immanent. Ibn 2Arabi,however, is making no such critique of meaning; the above passage fromthe Fususis not questioning whether signifiers like ‘transcendent’ and‘immanent’ can ever lead to anything other than signifiers. Ibn 2Arabistill believes in the positive, independent signification of such words,and he still believes these meanings to be opposed to one another.However, it is an opposition which is dissolvedin the Real. Ibn 2Arabibelieves in a God paradoxical enough, all-comprehensive enough,impossibleenough to be both immanent and transcendent at the sametime. If Derrida rejects binary oppositions because they veil an absence,Ibn 2Arabi resents the dualism because it veils a presence – the presenceof a paradox, the ultimate, unthinkable Oneness of God.We shall see in a later chapter whether it will still be possible to re-describe this situation in different terms – that is, whether the Onenessof God so central to Ibn 2Arabi’s thought is just another logocentricmoment of infinite self-presence, or whether such a ‘negation of nega-tions’ actually moves closer to the Derridean oeuvrethan anyone couldsuspect. For now, it is sufficient to merely underline how Ibn 2Arabi seesbeneath what we call ‘God’ something infinite enough, uncontrollableenough, paradoxical enough to re-contextualize and ultimately under-mine everything we try to sing, say or scribble about Him.The emancipatory project in Derrida: freeingthe letter from the shackles of the spiritIf Ibn 2Arabi insists upon the unthinkability of God in the face of thephilosophers of the Kalam, then Derrida insists on the ungovernable textin the face of the structuralists. This insistence is best examined in one ofDerrida’s earliest essays, ‘Force and signification’, which first appearedwithin the pages of Critiquein 1963. The title of the essay – a play onthe title of the work it deals with, Jean Rousset’s 1962 study of Corneille,The shackles of reason25"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Forme et Signification– effectively sums up many of Derrida’s basicdisagreements with structuralism, described as ‘a relaxation, if not alapse, of the attention given to force’ (une détente, sinon une lapsus,dans l1attention à la force).65Throughout the essay, Rousset’s own brandof structuralism, the confidence with which he produces his structuralanalyses of Le Cidand Polyeucte(‘with such a mastery one wonderswhether the credit is due Corneille or Rousset’),66is portrayed as aconsistent forgetting of a certain energy within the text, a lamentableobliviousness towards the play which is always already at work withinCorneille.Therefore, Derrida’s objections to Rousset (whose Forme etSignification, it does not take long to realize, ultimately serve Derrida asa springboard toward the chief tenets of structuralism in general) arethree in number and interrelated. First, the concept of the structureinitially implemented as an aid towards analysis, ‘becomes in fact anddespite his theoretical intentionthe critic’s sole preoccupation’.67Thetext, sacrificed for the sake of structure, simply becomes an excuse totalk about the structure – leading Derrida to speak of Rousset’s efforts asan ‘ultrastructuralism’.68Derrida is keen to emphasize this – one almostexpects to encounter the word ‘fetishism’ – as it brings him to his sec-ond objection: so captivating is the attention given to structure, one‘risks being interested in the figure itself to the detriment of the playgoing on within it metaphorically [au détriment du jeu qui s1y joue parmétaphore]’.69In other words, Rousset becomes so interested in forme,he forgets about force. In this sense, structuralism can almost be seen asa minimal desire for certainty, the desire for a structure which mighteliminate – or at least contain – the chaotic play within a text.‘Structuralism above all insists upon preserving the coherence and com-pletion of each totality at its own level’.70For Derrida (third objection),this is the very thing which cannot be done. The desire to preserve atotality, to speak meaningfully and above all consistently about the‘autonomy’of a work, would be to ‘attempt to forget difference’(vouloiroublir la différance),71to forget uncertainty, to forget the dynamic natureof textuality and pretend that things stand stillwithin a text.Although Derrida’s essay is a specific response to a specific text,‘Force and Signification’ is by no means simply a critique of a contem-porary work on Corneille. Derrida clearly has other things in mind –Rousset’s version of literary structuralism was simply the nearest logo-centrism at hand. In Rousset’s obsession with form lies the reason ‘whyliterary criticism is structuralist in every age, in its essence and destiny’.72It is an obsession, to paraphrase Derrida, which either denies or forgets26The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"that the play of meaning alwaysoverflows signification – an obsessionhardly exclusive to Rousset.The most important thing we learn from Derrida’s essay on Rousset isthat the text is never present. No matter how coherent and meticulous astructure is created to explain the text, the interpretation of the text willalways be rendered incomplete by ‘the impossibility of its ever beingpresent, of its ever being summarized by some absolute simultaneityor instantaneousness’.73Just as no sign can ever capture the Real,no theological position can ever regulate the unpredictable, infinite vari-ety of the Real’s manifestations, Derrida is careful to show how theungraspable vitality of the text fissures and threatens every interpreta-tion made of it.Of all Derrida’s work, Of Grammatologyis probably the most focusedand single-minded analysis of this subjugation of writing. Here Derridaexplores, in a mode self-consciously reminiscent of psychoanalysis,74aWestern aversion and resentment towards the written, in favour of thespoken; a consistent desire on the part of thinkers such as Rousseau,Saussure and Levi-Strauss ‘to confine writing to a secondary and instru-mental function’ (à confiner l1écriture dans une fonction seconde etinstrumentale)75– a vehicle of meaning, the humble carrier of a royalmessage, a semantic go-between, in short writing as (to quote Rousseau)‘nothing but the representation of speech’.76Hence Derrida’s repeatedreferences to his own project as an emancipatory one:[Linguistics’] declared purpose confirms...the subordinationof grammatology, the...reduction of writing to the rank of instru-ment...But another gesture...liberates the future of a generalgrammatology.This logocentrism...has always...suspended, and suppressedfor essential reasons, all free reflection on the origin and status ofwriting...The subordination of the trace to the full presence summed up inthe logos, the humbling of writing beneath a speech dreaming itsplenitude...77The written sign has always been excluded, suppressed, humbled, sub-ordinated to its spoken meaning, facilitated by a fear of letting our wordsget out of control and mean something different from what we wanted to‘say’. Such grammophobia, the unshaken conviction that writing isnothing other than the form which delivers the content, lies at the heartof allmetaphysical and rational thought. Just as the thinkers of theThe shackles of reason27"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Kalam continually underestimate the ungraspability of the Real, Derridashows how various figures in Western thought have repeatedly underes-timated the vitality of écriture, have repeatedly failed to problematizethe idea of writing as ‘nothing but the representation of speech’. Just asthe Ash1arites feel they can use positive attributes about the Real withoutany problem, Derrida’s structuralists and phenomenologists feel they canrefer repeatedly to words such as ‘purity’, ‘experience’, ‘innocence’,‘the text’ without any complications whatsoever.In this sense, both Sufi and deconstructive oppositions to rational/metaphysical thought can be considered analogous, if only because boththinkers are trying to ‘restore an originary difficulty’ to their respectivesubjects.78Both see something fatally flawed in the arrogant confidenceof the system – a presumptuous taking-for-granted of the analysabilityof God/writing, accompanied by an unconscious reluctance to allow thecomplexity of their subjects to undermine or derail their projects.The emancipatory tone which Derrida adopts in Of Grammatologyis,we gradually learn, an ironic gesture; Saussure, Rousseau and Levi-Strauss all advocate a liberation too, but of the reverse kind – protectingthe illiterate non-European from colonial shackles of writing. Saussurespeaks of the ‘tyranny of writing’, which ‘impose(s) itself upon themasses’,79changing spellings and modifying how people speak, whereasboth Rousseau and Levi-Strauss go farther, equating the Western intro-duction of writing skills with a concept of Original Sin and the ultimateimperialist destruction of native innocence: ‘the primary function ofwriting, as a means of communication, is to facilitate the enslavement ofhuman beings’ (la fonction primaire de la communication écrite est defaciliter l1asservissement).80If Derrida objects to this vilification of écri-ture, however, it is notbecause he feels writing to be innocent – whichwould simply place him on the opposite end of an identical dualism. Thepoint is repeated several times in Of Grammatology: ‘...writing does notbefall an innocent language. There is an originary violence of writingbecause language is first, I shall gradually reveal, writing.’81Thus, thepossibility of writing as a tyrannical discourse is not contested; but it isnot tyranny over an innocent subject. Writing cannot ‘corrupt’, ‘sup-press’ or ‘distort’ real meaning, for there is no real meaning to be cor-rupted, only an anterior sequence of signs. Language, as Derrida says, isalready a kind of writing.We shall see, further on, how far Ibn 2Arabi’s critique of Kalam andthe philosophers can be called ‘deconstructive’– that is, whether there isnot a moment of self-presence in Ibn 2Arabi’s own work, a momentwhere the unthinkability of God is deferred as one might defer the28The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"unveiling of a monument, a secret sign pushed away inside a box. Orwhether, alternatively, Ibn 2Arabi in his opposition to the thinkers andtheologians is actually calling into question the whole activity of meta-physics by suggesting the Real is something radically other to all ourconventional ways of understanding – not simply a secret meaninghidden away from the rest of us, but a less deconstructible metaphorsuch as a ‘flux’ or ‘void’. Which all depends on whether Ibn 2Arabi isgenuinely superseding metaphysics, or merely re-instating it at a higherlevel with a logocentric ‘Oneness of God’.‘La différance’There is an obvious irony in the fact that Derrida’s term ‘différance’,which was meant to be ‘literally neither a word nor a concept’ (à lalettre, ni un mot, ni un concept),82has become very definitely both afterthree decades of deconstructive criticism. And a further irony in the waymany critics have insisted on associating it with ‘God’ or some kind ofapophatic theology, despite Derrida’s very careful caveats to the con-trary. In the debate following Derrida’s 1971 lecture, Brice Parain wasthe first to stand up and declare différance to be ‘the God of negativetheology’,83an assertion Derrida strongly objected to. In the first pagesof the essay, we read:So much so that the detours, locutions and syntax in which I willoften have to take recourse will resemble those of negative theology,occasionally even to the point of being indistinguishable from neg-ative theology. Already we have had to delineate that différance isnot, does not exist, is not a present-being (on) in any form; and wewill be led to delineate also everything thatit is not, that is, every-thing; and consequently that it has neither existence nor essence.It derives from no category of being, whether present or absent. Andyet those aspects of différancewhich are thereby delineated are nottheological, not even in the order of the most negative of negativetheologies, which are always concerned with disengaging a super-essentiality beyond the finite categories of essence and existence,that is, of presence, and always hastening to recall that God isrefused the predicate of existence, only in order to acknowledge hissuperior, inconceivable and ineffable mode of being.Si bien que les détours, les périodes, la syntaxe auxquels jedevrais souvent recourir, ressembleront, parfois à s1y méprendre,à ceux de la théologie négative. Déjà il a fallu marquerque laThe shackles of reason29"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"différancen1est pas, n1existe pas, n1est pas un étant-présent(on),quel q1il soit: et nous serons amenés à marquer aussi toutce qu 1ellen1est pas, c1est-à-diretout: et par conséquent qu1elle n1a ni existenceni essence.

Nevertheless, Derrida in this passageis insistent that the way he is going to talk about différance – its beingsiteless, nameless, bereft of quality or tangible existence, non-temporal,forever Other yet the source of all meaning – will sound uncannily sim-ilar to the way negative theology used to talk about God (and certainlythe way Ibn 2Arabi talks about the Real). A similarity, Derrida says,which we shouldn’t be deceived by. The ‘structured and differentiatedorigin of differences’(l1origine structurée et différante dés différences)85which Derrida is going to call ‘différance’has nothing to do with God orany other kind of ‘superessentiality’, however much the elusiveness ofthe term may lead us to think this. This resistance by Derrida to the the-ologization of his work will be examined later. For now, regardlesswhether we agree with Brice Parain or John Caputo (‘God is notdif-férance...différance is especially not a hidden God, the innermost con-cealed Godhead of negative theology’),86we shall take a look at some ofthe (non)attributes which Derrida gives to différance.The place of différance in Derrida’s thought is important insofar as itis precisely that which makes écriture so uncontrollable, the elusive,never-quite-present force which forever unsettles the text, so that it inturn ‘differs from itself, defers itself, and writes itself as différance’.87Probably the first and most striking resemblance between différance andthe Real is that différance, like al-haqq, ‘has no name in our language’(n1a aucune nom dans notre langue).88However mystical this may sound,Derrida is keen to point out that if différance isunnamable, it is ‘notbecause our language has not yet found or received this name...outside30The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"the finite system of our own’.89Although one might be tempted here tothink of the Hebrew unnamable name, Lossky’s nomen innomabile,Derrida is actually alluding to Heidegger. Différance is unnamablebecause ‘there is no name for it at all, not even that of différance’.Having distanced himself from Heideggerian nostalgia with the remarkthat différance is ‘older than Being itself’, Derrida goes on in the nextparagraph to repeat the dissociative operation, this time with regardto negative theology. The unnamable is ‘not an ineffable Being which noname could approach’ but rather ‘the play which makes possible nomi-nal effects’ (le jeu qui fait qu1il y a des effets nominaux). It’s difficult tosay whether this would constitute an accurate appraisal of Ibn 2Arabi’sReal. On the one hand the Real ultimately ‘has no attributes (shifa)’ ornames (asma)90– an assertion which puts Ibn 2Arabi squarely against theAsh1arites and their like, who believed that God did possess attributes,but they were utterly unlike any human attributes we could imagine.91In other places, however, Ibn 2Arabi certainly seems to give the impres-sion that, beneath such an absence of attributes, an ‘ineffable Being’ isstill the subject of discussion: ‘One comes to know that there is Someonewho cannot be known’.92Derrida’s différance has no need of such a‘Someone’.Another resemblance between the Real and différance is that both areliterally unthinkable: they are terms which, both authors insist, can neveracquire presence. ‘Reason cannot delimit Him by one of those forms,since He destroys that delimitation by the next self-disclosure.’93The Real’s refusal to concretely, permanently assume a single form isprecisely what makes it unthinkable, this Heraclitean flux of constantlydiffering manifestations ensures that the Real itself ‘remains foreverunseen’.94In a similar way, the ‘a’ in ‘différance’ ‘cannot be exposed’because ‘différance is...what makes possible the presentation of thebeing-present’.95Différance, however, is a kind of play, not a non-manifest entity which brings forth non-beings into being – there is nopresence to try and think, and therefore the unthinkability of différance,although superficially identical to that of the Real, is of a radically dif-ferent kind: ‘One cannot think différance...on the basis of the present,or of the presence of the present.’96This common ground of nameless and unthinkability with regard todifférance and the Real, however differently constituted, does lead usonto a string of similar resemblances, most of which repeat the samebasic point again but which are worthwhile mentioning, as they elucidatethis point from a variety of different, interesting perspectives. First,both the Real and différance are neither sensible nor intelligible – oneThe shackles of reason31"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"can neither touch nor conceive them. Derrida’s famous insistence thatdifférance is ‘literally neither a word nor a concept’97echoes a Koranicverse which Ibn 2Arabi is fond of repeating: Nothing is like Him(42:11).No sign or symbol exists which could signify or even remotely resemblethe Real, being utterly incommensurable – for Ibn 2Arabi, even the word‘incomparable’ (tanzih) cannot be used, as the Real is ‘absolutely incom-parable with every declaration of incomparability that delimits’.98In short,the Real is the Absolute Unseen (al-ghayb al-mutlaq).99Différance, how-ever, is neither sensible nor intelligible because it ‘does not exist, is not apresent being (on) in any form’100; différance cannot be signified becauseit always already precedes the act of signification, eluding it whilst at thesame time making it possible. The hinge in a door, the fold in a piece ofpaper – différance operates on the edge of language, producing whilereceding, forever absenting itself in the act of making things present, hencethe endless comparisons with negative theology it has provoked. Just as theReal ‘remains forever unseen’, the movement of différance ‘eludes bothvision and hearing’and ultimately works within ‘an order which no longerbelongs to sensibility...But neither...to intelligibility.’101The immediate consequence of this is that both différance and theReal cannot be expounded upon directly, through what they are, but onlyindirectly, through what they are not. Harvey makes much of this in anexcellent chapter of her Derrida and the Economy of Différance, whereshe quite literally lists twenty-six things that deconstruction is not, rang-ing from ‘(a) metaphysics’ through ‘(m) “un coup des Dés”, as perMallarmé’ to ‘(z) the celebration of a Wake, as per Joyce’.102‘I canspeak of this graphic difference only through a very indirect discourseon writing’.103In a sense, Derrida’s lecture on ‘La différance’ is anattempt to say what cannot be said – in the open pages Derrida quicklydemonstrates himself to be articulately aware of this problem. Even lec-tures on différance fall prey to différance, which explains why Derridaconsistently refuses to provide any clear, concise definition of what dif-férance ‘means’, choosing to abandon the direct approach of naming anddefining for the oblique way, the way of inference, allusion, negation.The idea of negation (salb) as the only possibility of description canbe found often in Ibn 2Arabi, whose insistence of the unthinkability andintangibility of the Real/Essence forces him to choose the via negativaas the only available path for he who would still wish to speak meaning-fully about God:In our view there is no disputing the fact that the Essence is unknown.To It are ascribed descriptions which make it incomparable with32The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"the attributes of temporal things (al-hadath). It possesses eternity (al-qidam), and to Its Being is ascribed beginningless (al-azal). Butall these names designate negations, such as the negation of begin-ning and everything appropriate to temporal origination.104Thus we cannot say that the Real is ‘free’, only that It is not a slave,for God ‘can only be known through negative descriptions, not throughpositive descriptions of self’.105Ibn 2Arabi encounters the same problemas St Augustine – to call God ‘ineffable’ still remains an affront to Hisineffability. For Derrida, the dilemma has its relevance – if language isunstable, how can we speak within language about the instability oflanguage? If there is no sign which can represent différance, how can wewrite about it? Further on, we shall see how both thinkers respond to theproblems which the common unthinkability of their subjects present –whether the strategy of negation, of indirect discourse, remains aviable one.It is also interesting to note how, in the passage given, Ibn 2Arabiis careful to keep the Real outside temporality, insisting It has no end (al-qidam) and no beginning (al-azal). In the text of ‘La Différance’,Derrida makes a similar gesture, carefully separating différance fromany notion of ‘origin’or ‘result’which would re-inscribe it into a schemeof cause and effect. The fact that différance is the ‘differentiated ori-gin of differences’ does notmean that ‘the différance that produces dif-ferences is somehow before them, in a simple and unmodified...present’106– a move which, in one sense at least, blocks any Neoplatonicdescription of différance as a First Cause, producing a waterfall ofeffects which spill out and over into the world below. On the contrary,the ‘name “origin” no longer suits it’.107Why is Derrida so keen to remove différance from the temporal – agesture which would seem to emphasize rather than diminish its theolog-ical echoes? If the atemporality of différance is stressed here, it is not tosuggest the lofty detachment of a transcendental, omnitemporal deity,calmly watching over the course and unfolding of His Creation. Derridakeeps différance away from all notions of temporality because he doesn’twant to fall foul of the same metaphysical trap Husserl fell into – that ofbasing his entire thought system on a logocentric notion of the ‘present’.In ‘Genesis and Structure’ Derrida shows how Husserl’s ‘serene use of...concepts’ such as ‘experience’ and ‘present’ ultimately reveals an‘incompleteness’ in his phenomenology.108The more Husserl tries toanalyse exactly how the world becomes meaningful for the conscious-ness with terms like noemaand hylé(the latter – the non-intentional,The shackles of reason33"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"sensate experience of the world before it is shaped through meaning –being ‘primarily temporal matter’109), the more Husserl has to rely uponthe problematic ‘themes of the Other and Time’.110The ‘experience’ ofthe Husserlian Other necessitates the moment of ‘a living present’(lebendige Gegenwart), for Derrida the epitome of an illusory self-presence, the metaphysical sands upon which Husserl builds the entirestructure of his castle. Hence Derrida’s insistence that, even though an‘interval must separate the present from what it is not in order for thepresent to be itself’, this interval – this difference – is related ‘no less towhat is called the future than to what is called the past.’111Words whichmust represent Derrida’s most determined attempt to break with thelogocentric (one could even say theocentric) assumptions of the terms‘past’, ‘present’ and ‘future’.The mirror of différance: the invisible production of the visibleThe last and most important characteristic of différance, the featurewhich has most often provoked comparisons with ‘the God of negativetheology’, is a straightforward function: différance produces. It creates –or rather, enables creation to take place. It ‘lends itself to a certain numberof nonsynonymous substitutions’,112without ever forming any part ofthose signs it gives rise to. The mirror seems to be Derrida’s most aptexample of this process. We already know that différance is not a being(ov) and ‘does not exist’.113In a passage from Dissemination, quoted byGasché at the beginning of his own work on what he calls Derrida’s‘System beyond being’, Derrida offers an important analogy towards theunderstanding of the role of différance and its relation to nothingness:The breakthrough towards radical otherness...always takes, withinphilosophy, the formof an a posteriority or an empiricism. But thisis an effect of the specular nature of philosophical reflection, phi-losophy being incapable of inscribing (comprehending) what isoutside it otherwise than through the appropriating assimulation ofa negative image of it, and dissemination is written on the back – the tain– of that mirror.114Différance is that which allows identities to produce differences – anddifferences to produce identities – ad infinitum, endlessly disseminatinga trace without origins, without ever taking part in the process. The tainof a mirror, Gasché tells us, ‘is the silver lining, the lustreless back of themirror...without which no reflection and no specular and speculative34The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"activity would be possible, but which at the same time has no place andno part in reflection’s scintillating play’.115Différance is this tain – amovement which generates without participating, engenders withoutappearing. Derrida’s cryptic mark which ‘alludes without breaking theglass, toward the epekeina tes ousias’ now becomes clear: writing onlyever alludes to, but never trespasses into the non-space beyond being, tothe non-space behind the mirror.How far is Derrida’s ‘tain of the mirror’, this non-space behind tomirror, the site of Ibn 2Arabi’s Real, which gives rise to presences whilstforever absenting itself? In a crucial passage from the Futuhat, Ibn2Arabi elaborates upon this process of the Real in terms uncannily simi-lar to those of Derrida’s:This alerts us to the form of the veil within which the Real disclosesHimself. Then He transmutes Himself from it into another veil. Inreality, there is nothing but passage from veil to veil, since no divinedisclosure ever repeats itself. Hence the forms must be diverse,while the Real is behind all of that. We possess nothing of Him butthe name Manifest (al-zahir), whether in a vision or a veil. As forthe name Nonmanifest (al-batin), it remains forever Nonmanifest.Hence the Real remains forever unseen behind the forms whichbecome manifest within existence.116From the instant there is meaning, Derrida has written, there are noth-ing but signs.117From the moment there is the Real, there are only man-ifestations, ‘nothing but passage from veil to veil’. As soon as the batinis expressed, there are only zahir, leading to more zahir, ad infinitum.Although by no means free of the ‘hyperessentiality’ which Derrida,elsewhere, will try to deconstruct Meister Eckhart with, the elusivenessof the Real, giving rise to presences whilst remaining paradoxicallyabsent, does seem to follow the movement of différance. Ibn 2Arabi evenuses the same metaphor of the mirror – often, in fact, altering themetaphor each time to suit the context. Sometimes the mirror is the Real,sometimes it is the heart of the gnostic, sometimes it is a fellow believer.A passage from the Fususprobably best conveys the Derridean echoesof this metaphor:Try, when you look at yourself in a mirror, to see the mirror itself,and you will find that you cannot do so......the recipient sees nothing other than his own form in the mir-ror of the Reality. He does not see the Reality itself, which isThe shackles of reason35"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"not possible, although he knows that he may see only his [true form]in It. As in the case of a mirror and the beholder, he sees the form in it, but does not see the mirror itself...The analogy of amirror is the closest and most faithful one for a vision of a divineSelf-revelation.118As in Derrida’s analogy, the Real constitutes that part of the mirror wecannot see (the tain), which remains invisible throughout the entirereflective process, and yet without which we would not be able to see ourreflection at all. The analogy, in both cases, gives an almost narcissistictone to metaphysics. When the theologian looks in the mirror, he mis-takes his own reflection for the Real itself; the subjects of both Ibn2Arabi’s and Derrida’s critiques fail to consider the tain of the mirror, failto seehow what they are looking for must necessarily lie outsidetheirfield of vision. Of course, mirror metaphors abound in all kinds of reli-gious writing, and Ibn 2Arabi is hardly the first to make use of them –but it is an analogy which underlines Ibn 2Arabi’s conviction of theunthinkable otherness of the Real. A Real which produces forms, butsomehow can never be glimpsed. In this sense, the underside of themirror becomes the ‘locus of disclosure’119for a profusion of forms –just as différance belongs to that ‘strange space...betweenspeech andwriting’,120the unthinkable moment when batinbecomes zahir, whentexts become interpretations, when words become things.* * * * *If différance and the Real do seem uncannily analogous, sharing a numberof features in common – namelessness, radical otherness, intangibility/invisibility/unthinkability, atemporality, not to mention their paradoxi-cally generative functions – one has to decide how far we can accept thedifference (for want of a better word) Derrida still wishes to preservebetween his own strategies and Ibn 2Arabi’s de-ontologizing gesture ofthe Real. Différance remains, after all, ‘a silent play’, a silence as ‘silent,secret and discreet as a tomb’ (silencieux, secret et discret commeun tombeau).121If anything, a certain emptiness seems to pervade all ofDerrida’s work on différance, the infinity of an emptiness which has noneed of a ‘Someone that cannot be known’. No elusive Something,forever leaving in its wake a succession of forms, but simply an‘‘‘active”, moving discord of different forces’, to use Derrida’s para-phrasing of Nietzsche; in other words, différance simply happens.It takes place, producing images as effortlessly as two images might36The shackles of reason"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"multiply themselves ad infinitum. It is a depthless infinity which seemsto haunt all of Derrida’s work: ‘There is no maintaining, and no depth to,this bottomless chessboard on which Being is put into play [pour cetéchiquier sans fond où l1être est mis en jeu]’.122A chessboard which hasno need of any Chess Player, capitalized or otherwise.We shall see, in a later chapter, how far Derrida’s ‘protection’ ofdifférance from theological ‘contamination’can be questioned. For now,however differently constituted différance and al-haqqmay be, this in noway detracts from the powerful similarity of their effects – a radical re-questioning of rational thought, a re-understanding of all attempts toexplain God/reality/the text as being founded on an illusion, a freeingof the uncontrollability of God/the text from the shackles of limitingmetaphysics. With such freedom from the narrowing names and cate-gories of rationality comes, inevitably, a degree of confusion – and it isexactly how Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi respond to words like ‘perplexity’and ‘confusion’ that will be the subject of our next chapter.The shackles of reason37"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"2 The honesty of the perplexedDerrida and Ibn 2Arabi on‘confusion’I mistrust all systematizers and avoid them.

That something has takenplace in a language our rational faculties do not speak. In a sense, con-fusion takes place becauseof our rationality, because we insist on cling-ing to something which is blinding us to the ‘actual situation’. What isto be examined in this chapter is a certain desirefor confusion in bothdeconstructive and Sufi thought, a certain perception of bewilderment asa more honest possibility of truth. Words such as ‘confusion’and ‘bewil-derment’ enable us to glimpse a similar vein of thought in both Derridaand Ibn 2Arabi – that is, a similar affirmation of confusion as a difficult,courageous and desirable state.Neither Ibn 2Arabi nor Derrida seem to be afraid of bewilderment – or,for that matter, bewildering. Whether it is the constantly ‘explodingsemantic horizons’ of the disseminating text,3or the guidance whichmeans being ‘guided to bewilderment’,4the ‘acceptance of incoherent"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"incoherence’5or the God Who is everywhere and nowhere, both Derridaand Ibn 2Arabi part with a philosophical and Koranic tradition whichsees confusion synonymous with error, failure, untruth and sin.In the West, confusion has almost always been seen as the ‘problem’of philosophy. Wittgenstein sums this idea up the best: ‘The philosophergoes wild, screaming helplessly, until he gets to the heart of his confu-sion.’6Whether it is Spinoza’s desire to understand the nature of humanactions or Descartes’ project to overcome the anxiety of his own scepti-cism, a fear of confusion and doubt has always been the driving forcebehind most philosophical projects. Equally negative is the word inIslamic thought, where ‘confusion’ is used to describe any state of men-tal or spiritual regression, an inability to understand the will of God – orthe consequence of a reluctance to do so. It is the kind of confusion2Ay al-Qudat Hamadhani felt before finally reading Al-Ghazali: ‘My heartwas a tumultuous sea with no shores, in it was drowned all the ends andall the beginnings’.7Ibn Tamiyah, in his Muqaddimat al-tafsir, insiststhe Prophet was sent to explain clearly (tubayyin) everything we need toknow.8Given such a premise, confusion in Islam can only ever be nega-tive, falling upon those who cannot or will not understand. Therefore,God may well be the Guide (al-hadW) for the righteous, but He is alsothe Misguider (al-mudill) of the wicked, dispersing and confoundingthose who reject His counsel and follow evil. The fact that Ibn 2Arabican take such a standard Koranic (not to mention Biblical) motif such as‘confusion’ and imbue it with a positive meaning – to the point ofmaking bewilderment a gift from God – not only attests to the Shaykh’sdaring originality, but also indicates how far Ibn 2Arabi is prepared toradically re-interpret familiar sections of the Koran such as the Surah onNoah (Nuh). Re-interpretations which, as we shall see, will call intoquestion some of the familiar claims for an ‘orthodox’ and ‘tradition-alist’ Ibn 2Arabi, centrally located in the mainstream of Islamic thought.Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi: lovers of clarity or confusion?The works of Ibn 2Arabi do not simply ennoble confusion – they alsoconfuse. Of course, not everyone agrees on this point. Akbarian schol-arship seems to divide itself into two parties over the question of theunity and coherence of Ibn 2Arabi’s works. A. E. Affifi was probablyone of the first English-speaking critics to discern no ‘appreciabledegree of coherence or order’ in the Great Shaykh’s writings,9merely astyle ‘rampant, discursive and badly lacking in form and cohesion’.10Later scholars, somewhat more sympathetically, have also testified to40The honesty of the perplexed"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Ibn 2Arabi’s works as (to use the Sufi’s own words) a place ofbewilderment; for Mustafa Tahrali, ‘the general rules of discourse,especially that of non-contradiction, are not respected’ within the pagesof the Fusus al-Hikam; it is ‘completely natural that [the reader] shouldbe perplexed’ when reading it.11Alexander Knysh extends this effect ofperplexity to all of the Shaykh’s works, with their ‘confrontation ofcontradictory metaphysical and theological statements’.12On the otherhand, scholars more keen on seeing the ‘traditionalist (salafi)’ in Ibn2Arabi – such as Mahmoud al-Ghorab – insist it is the commentators whoare responsible for any confusion surrounding the Shaykh’s words.13Farfrom Affifi’s confused and inconsistent thinker, al-Ghorab’s Ibn 2Arabiis a2Muhammedan mirror of the utmost clarity, symmetry andstraightness’.14A similar gulf separates those of Derrida’s readers who argue he hasa system and a systematic purpose, from those who feel it is preciselythe a-systematic confusion of systems that is Derrida’s aim. Both admir-ers and detractors of Derrida’s work can be found amongst the lattergroup: from Habermas’famous and uncomplimentary charge of ‘a mys-tification of palpable social pathologies’15to Mark C. Taylor, who seesdeconstructive readings as resulting in an ‘unending play of surfaces’.16Where John Ellis accuses Derrida of ‘mysticism’, self-contradiction andgeneral incoherence, Richard Rorty is quite happy to find a philosopherwho is no longer ‘serious’(in the most Anglo-Saxon sense of the word) –a thinker who has simply dropped ‘theory...in favour of fantasizingabout [Derrida’s philosophical] predecessors, playing with them’.17For such critics, Derrida has not come to bring peace to philosophy,but confusion. The strongest resistance to this chaos-affirming versionof Derrida probably comes from a group of admirers (Culler, Gasché,Norris) who see Derrida as being, far from any post-structuralist maverick,a serious philosopher ‘in the mainstream tradition from Kant to Husserland Frege’ (Norris).18For Gasché, deconstruction neither mystifies norconfuses but explicates– it attempts ‘to “account” for a heterogeneousvariety...of discursive inequalities...that continue to haunt even thesuccessfuldevelopment of philosophical arguments’.19In other wordsDerrida, to borrow Wittgenstein’s metaphor, shows the fly the way out ofthe fly-bottle. Not at all confusing, deconstruction clarifies, illuminates,it sorts out philosophy’s problems, settles its accounts.As the central aim of this chapter is to examine the positive value thatboth deconstruction and Sufism give to confusion and bewilderment,such a course of action will bring us into conflict both with al-Ghorab’sIbn 2Arabi and Gasché’s Derrida. In Ibn 2Arabi’s case, Mustafa TahraliThe honesty of the perplexed41"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"goes so far as to suggest that the paradoxes and contradictions in theFususform part of a more spiritual strategy – by literally arousing a stateof perplexity in the reader, the Fususbegins the long process of detach-ing the reader from his/her reliance on rationality and logic.20In a sense,the bewildering style of the Fususis in itself a preparatory station on theway to a more divine perplexity – the hayrahwhich accompanies allknowledge of God.Near the beginning of his book on Ibn 2Arabi, William Chittick writes:‘To find God is to fall into bewilderment’.21No sentence sums up moreaccurately the Sufi’s attitude towards confusion. Throughout both theFutuhatand the Fusus, Ibn 2Arabi uses a variety of metaphors for bewil-derment: it is, we are told, a station, a gift, a divine name, a tool, aknowledge and ultimately, one suspects, an ‘actual situation’ whichunderlies everything we think we know. ‘To realise that one cannot know[God] is to know,’ says Abu Bakr,22a Socratic disclaimer Ibn 2Arabinever tires of quoting, and in a sense Ibn 2Arabi’s radically positive viewof bewilderment stems directly from this equally radical unthinkabilityof God.Therefore, when Ibn 2Arabi quotes the hadith ‘O Lord, increasemy perplexity concerning You’23(as he frequently does), what he isreally asking is: O Lord, confuse and confound the simplistic limitationsI have attempted to cage You within. Bewilderment becomes the bestway the believer has of escaping the metaphysical trap of his ownperspectiveness – not, in this case, by the proffering of some extra-linguistic knowledge (a secret name or sign), but rather by presentingand confusing the believer with a multiplicity of different Gods, someorthodox, some heretical, some intimately immanent, others aloof andtranscendental. In the alarming, disconcerting contiguity of this myriadof different images, one can truly begin to understand how ‘the actualsituation of the Divinity does not become delimited or restricted andremains unknown.’24For Ibn 2Arabi, a profusion of different beliefs istestimony to God’s utter unthinkability. This idea of understanding whatGod is through a confusion of contrasting images has a fairly longgenealogy, one which goes back at least to the first negative theologiansof the early Church; it shows the apophatic possibilities of Ibn 2Arabi asa negative theologian, one which become increasingly relevant toDerrida’s own critique of the via negativa.Perhaps the sixth century Dionysius offers the most famous examplein negative theology of how different constructions concerning God,once dismantled, can actually convey a better sense of God’s ineffability.In certain moments of The Mystical Theologyand The Celestial42The honesty of the perplexed"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Hierarchy, he makes the remarkable assertion that to call God drunk orhungover is more suitable than calling God good or wise,25for ‘incon-gruous dissimilarities’ make us more aware of God’s unreachable other-ness than equally finite adjectives such as ‘almighty’ and ‘all-knowing’.For the Areopagite, to call God at the same time ‘Almighty’ and a‘worm’, ‘wise’and ‘drunk’, is more accurately to address what one critichas called the ‘language-defeating reality of God’.26Dionysius self-consciously employs contradictory constructions of the divine Other toconvey a more realistic sense of God’s utter unthinkability. Constructingand disassembling the various inventions of God that affirmative theologysupplies presents an interesting apophatic strategy. Dionysius offers anattempt to understand the Imageless not through the abandonment ofimages but rather through the contiguity of conflicting ones.In Derrida, we find a secular version of the same strategy. Under-standing the Other involves an ‘absolute openness towards the whollyother’, a constant interruption, a repeated breaking-up of all the ver-sions of the Other that the Same constructs for itself. Constant interrup-tion is the necessary instability that provides the conditions forglimpsing the otherness of the Other through the broken ruins of one’sown constructions:By interrupting the weaving of our language and then by weavingtogether the interruptions themselves, another language comes todisturb the first one...Another text, the text of the other, arrives insilence with a more or less regular cadence, without ever appearingin its original language, to dislodge the language of translation.27The tout autreworks like an utterly unreachable sub-text, foreverreceding before all our interpretations, while remaining paradoxicallythe very condition of their possibility. Through the creation and des-truction of all our conceptions of the Other, the continual irruptionof the truly Other allows us to glimpse a very secular epekeina tesousias: ‘At the moment when it erupts, the inaugural invention ought tooverflow, overlook, transgress, negate...the status that people wouldhave wanted to assign it or grant it in advance.’28Through such a sub-version of the familiar, the completely unfamiliar may be perceivedwithout any horizon of expectation. How far all of this lies from Ibn2Arabi’s diversity of Gods remains a difficult question. If Derrida seesthe authentic relationship to the Other as a constant and necessary insta-bility, a clarifying bewilderment through which one may momentarilyglimpse the otherness of the Other, then perhaps Ibn 2Arabi’s approachThe honesty of the perplexed43"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"might be redescribed as a constant shattering of our constructions ofGod, a necessary iconoclasm that allows one to glimpse the unmediated‘God-ness’ of God.Although Ibn 2Arabi goes to some lengths to show how ‘knowledge ofGod is bewilderment, and knowledge of creation is bewilderment’,29there are certainly moments in both the Futuhatand the Fususwhere thisidea of perplexity as a mystical end-station on the believer’s journey iscalled into question. ‘Bewilderment’, far from being an essential state ofthings, is occasionally portrayed by the Shaykh in a different light –more as a temporary and inconvenient prelude to enlightenment (‘arif)rather than any kind of knowledge in itself. In the middle of a discussionon the ‘transcendent reality’ which is, at the same time, ‘the relativecreature’,30Ibn 2Arabi writes how ‘he who truly understands what we arediscussing here is not confused’ – which means that he who is confusedhas not truly understood. Thus comprehension, notconfusion, is the lastthing to be experienced before an encounter with the divine. This beliefthat the desire for knowledge of God ends, epistemologically, ina moment of calm rather than turbulence is underlined further by theending to the chapter on Lot:The Mystery is now clear to youAnd the matter is well explained.For that which is oddIs enshrined within the even.31The dilemma emerges: which vocabulary has the last word in Ibn 2Arabi,one which sees God as a holy, primordial, difference-dissolving state ofconfusion? Or one which leads the believer not to but through a confu-sion, towards an ineffable Something – the ‘mystery’ (sirr) whichIbn2Arabi so often refers to? Is God Perplexity itself, or rather aSomething which lies on the other side of all our bewilderment?For readers familiar with Derrida (in particular with Derrida’s workon negative theology), the question will be of some relevance. For if agiveaway moment of self-presence is to be found anywhere withinIbn2Arabi’s work – if the word ‘logocentric’ is to be attributed to him atall – it hinges on this conception of God. For Derrida, allnegative the-ologies – Islamic or Christian, Greek or Jewish – essentially perform thesame gesture. By denying God attributes they claim to do away withthe metaphysical shell of God in search of a truly radical encounter withthe divine. However, such apophatic strategies do not deconstruct, theymerely defer. For all their boldness, Derrida insists, even after all their44The honesty of the perplexed"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"negations, de-negations and auto-deconstructions, such negativetheologies still remain ultimately metaphysical – they still keep ‘inreserve...some hyperessentiality’ (elles semble résérver quelquesuressentialité) and thereby re-affirm the onto-theo-logic.32If God isbewilderment itself, then the Shaykh cannot easily be accused of sub-scribing to a metaphysical, onto-theological idea of God – the very‘hyperessentiality’(suressentialité) which Derrida accuses both Eckhartand Dionysius of harbouring. However, if Ibn 2Arabi is merely delineat-ing a series of steps (of which bewilderment is only one) which will leadus, eventually, to some hallowed secret or mystery, then Ibn 2Arabi is notradically questioning the idea of God but merely deferring Him, merelypostponing His imminent meaning.So what is Ibn 2Arabi’s ultimate idea of God – confusion or clarity? Ifthe Fususappears to give two different responses to this question – thechapters on Noah and Muhammed suggesting the former, the sections onEnoch and Hud the latter – some help comes from a later commentatorof Ibn 2Arabi, the fifteenth century ‘Abd al-Rahman JamW.33Essentially,JamWdiscerns three kinds of bewilderment in the closing chapter of theFusus. The first kind is the ‘bewilderment of the beginners’.34This, JamWsays, is a ‘common’bewilderment, which most believers feel – the anxietyof those who seek meaning but have no belief or direction in which totravel. This first state of confusion is usually removed by ‘the determi-nation of a quest’.35For the ‘most part’ of the people, this leads to tran-quillity – some, however, experience the second stage of bewildermentas they look around and see the believers who have ‘split up into numer-ous factions’ about them, ‘so [the believer] becomes bewildered anddoes not know which of the beliefs is the most correct in reality’. Theremoval of this bewilderment takes place when ‘no desire remains in[the believer] for the divine presence from a particular aspect or point ofview’.36Once this abandonment of isms and perspectives takes place,we move onto the third stage – which belongs to what JamWcalls ‘thepeople of the final bewilderment’. Significantly, this is a station whicheven ‘the greatest spiritual luminaries’ do not exceed – ‘rather theyascend in it for ever and ever’. Writing almost two hundred years afterthe Fusus, JamWsees his predecessor’s bewilderment as no temporarybridge to a final, clarifying solution, but rather a strange land beyondGod where true gnostics wander in all directions of their own accord.‘So they enter the Trackless Desert in His contemplation, and theirbewilderment is from Him, through Him and in Him’.37‘Abd al-Rahman JamW’s comments bring to light three important aspectsof the Shaykh’s ‘bewilderment’– aspects which, we shall see, will reflectThe honesty of the perplexed45"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"on our comparison with Derrida. First of all, there are different kinds ofconfusion, different types of bewilderment to be encountered by thebeliever. In some cases, attempting to overcome confusion is seen to bespiritually necessary; in others, it is futile and foolish. Second, JamWrightly (and uncritically) discerns in Ibn 2Arabi a certain elitism – confusion is not for everyone. Apart from those rare spirits who are able topersist in perpetual bewilderment, the greater part of the faithful (JamWcalls them the ‘people of the stopping places’ahl al-mawaqif)38stopshort of the ‘final bewilderment’ and take shelter in a niche of clarity.One almost discerns a hierarchy of perplexity here, made possible not byknowledge but rather by non-knowledge. Those at the bottom are theones with the clearest ideas, whilst those near the top are the most con-fused, the ones who have come closest to the secret of God’s mind-numbing unthinkability. Third, the ‘final bewilderment’ which JamWrefers to makes us wonder if, in Ibn 2Arabi’s oeuvre, the true goal is notso much confusion but a certain attitude towards confusion; whether truehayrahis not so much a state but rather the calm acceptance of a situa-tion, perhaps even the celebrationof such a moment. Of course, howclose such a ‘celebration’ would come towards the ‘Nietzschean...joyous affirmation of the play of the world’(l1affirmation nietzschéenne...joyeuse du jeu du monde)39we read in those famous closing passages ofDerrida’s ‘Structure, Sign and Play’, remains to be seen.Deconstruction: untying knots, thwarting systemsThere is something implicitly negative about the word ‘deconstruction’,even though elsewhere Derrida has suggested ‘de-structuration’ (trans-lating Heidegger’s Destruktion) as more accurately conveying the senseof the term.40The variety of images Derrida supplies to describethe effects of différance and dissemination is bewildering in itself:différance is anarchic, it ‘instigates the subversion of every kingdom’,41it ‘escapes...and disorganizes structure’,42it ‘disembedds’ the text,‘unsews’ it,43‘explodes the semantic horizon’ of its subject.44Suchterms which illustrate the paradoxical etymology of confusion, with itssimultaneous sense of convergence and divergence. Confusion is a wordwhich literally means ‘melting together’ but which we often use in theopposite sense, to describe a situation in which many things are happen-ing at the same time. Différance at once confuses and makes things sim-pler. It breaks down complexities, undoes complications, dismantlesstructures into their various components. At the same time it makesa text difficult to read, disabling its primary sense in order to free46The honesty of the perplexed"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"a plethora of secondary ones, robbing the text of its semantic rudder sothat it can no longer be said to sail in any particular direction.This emphasis on différance as something which undoes/unsews/disrupts the text obviously makes use of the origins of the word ‘text’(from the Latin textus, cloth). The text is a cloth which différance foreverthreatens to undo. ‘Dissemination endlessly opens up a snag [accroc] inwriting that can no longer be mended...’.45No work can escape thisstitch, this inherent, ever-present possibility of its complete undoing. Itis interesting to note that the Arabic term Ibn 2Arabi frequently uses for‘belief’(i1tiqãd, 2aqida) has as its root meaning the tying of a knot, or totie something firmly.46Thus, when Ibn 2Arabi says how ‘Every grouphas believed something about God’, what he means is ‘Every group hastied a certain knot about God’.47The bewildering unthinkability of Godunties every knot concerning Him, just as the unthinkable movement ofdifférance undoes every text.Despite the variety of metaphors Derrida offers for différance anddissemination, it should not be forgotten that Derrida, far from confus-ing the text, is simply showing how the text is already confused in itself.Deconstruction is a revelatory operation, not a stimulatory one. The‘essential drifting of the text’48precedes any theoretical intervention –texts are always already drifting. If deconstruction brings anarchy to thetext, it is only by showing how these unruly elements have always beenseething and brooding underneath a calm façade of unity and coherence.Confusion and instability is the a priori condition of every text, regard-less of whether it has been analysed or not. In the same way, for Ibn2Arabi the essentially bewildering nature of God precedes every attempt,be it Ash1arite or Mu1tazilite, to talk meaningfully about Him – ‘God isthe root of every diversity (khilaf) in beliefs within the cosmos’.49Inboth Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi, confusion and perplexity seem to precedeand underlie every attempt to form a system – a belief which inevitablyimbues the desire for confusion with an element of honesty and courage(not to mention Nietzschean ‘integrity’), the desire to glimpse a ‘truer’,more confused state of affairs and not succumb to the temptation of thesystem. In Derrida’s case, this re-appraisal of confusion is most clearlyseen in his 1985 essay, ‘Des Tours de Babel’.Derrida on Babel: the tyranny of clarityDerrida’s essay, being itself an analysis of Benjamin’s famous essay ontranslation ‘The Task of the Translator’, displays its title with an obviousirony, quite apart from the ambiguity of ‘Des Tours’(Some tricks? SomeThe honesty of the perplexed47"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"towers? Some detours?). Derrida’s essay on translation hasto begin withGenesis 11: 1–9, the destruction of the tower of Babel which is simulta-neously the birth of the translator, the ethnoclastic event which makestranslation possible. What is most immediately striking about ‘DesTours’ is the way in which Derrida re-interprets the episode of Babelusing his own terms, retelling the Old Testament story like a medievaltypologist, this time not Christianizing but post-structuralizing the chapterfrom Genesis to transform it into a deconstructive parable. Genesis 11: 1–9is no longer just a story about the pride of man thwarted by theOmnipotence of God: it is also a tale about an unfinished structure, amonocultural and monolingual project (the Shemites) with universalistintentions being thwarted not by thunder or earthquakes but by languageitself.‘Now the whole world had one language and a common speech’(Genesis 11: 1). The Babel episode, whilst purporting to be a Biblicalexplanation for the multiplicity of tongues, also marks the beginning ofconfusion for man in the Bible. It marks the beginning of a fragmentationof cultures, a dispersal of different tongues, the deliberate introductionof a nefarious (and divinely delivered) multiplicity into the totalizingproject of the Shemites. Not surprisingly, Derrida discerns clear paral-lels to deconstruction in all of this:In seeking to ‘make a name for themselves’, to found at the same timea universal tongue and a unique genealogy, the Shemites want to bringthe world to reason, and this reason can signify simultaneously acolonial violence (since they would thus universalise their idiom)and a peaceful transparency of the human community.50The Shemites, no longer simply tower-builders, have become system-builders. Believers in universal truths, metaphysical constructionengineers, trying to build a structure which would both symbolize anddisseminate their supremacy – not only over other peoples (‘colonialviolence’), but also over language. The Shemites want to take over thedeistic function of eponymy and ‘make a name for themselves’– subdueand control language, decide what they may and may not be called, con-trol which signifieds get allotted to which signifiers. Apart from inject-ing something strangely Biblical into Derrida’s own deconstruction ofWestern metaphysics (Is Derrida a modern Jeremiah, railing against theBabelian pretensions of structuralism and phenomenology, science andsociology?), the passage emphasizes how the pride of the Shemitesblinds them to the futility of their project. For this is precisely what48The honesty of the perplexed"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Babel – to Derrida – represents: ‘an incompletion, the impossibility offinishing, of totalising...of completing something on the order of sys-tem...and architectonics.’51Derrida has spent a life exploring thisimpossibility of ever putting a stop to meaning, of ever making a text sayone thing, coherently and consistently, and nothing else. Thus, the futil-ity of the Shemites’ project is also the futility of Husserl’s, whoseCartesian project sought to ‘return to the things themselves’and seek out‘the foundation of objectivity’,52the futility of Foucault’s L1histoire de lafolie, which believes it can talk in a rational–analytical way about mad-ness without ever succumbing to the rational/insane dualism it purportsto critique; the futility of Levinas’Totality and Infinity, whose aim ofre-establishing a ‘non-violent’ relationship with the wholly Other isrevealed by Derrida to be nothing more than a ‘dream’ – the ‘dreamofa purely heterologicalthought’ (le rêve d1une pensée purementhétérologique).53In all these instances, the Shemites’ mistaken convic-tion that their structure can actually get the better of language isreplicated.What is even more interesting than this contemporary allegorizing ofBiblical pride is the way Derrida sees God as a synonym for decon-struction. It is ‘from a propername of God...tongues are scattered, con-founded or multiplied’.54God is the arch-deconstructor of the story – itis He who confounds the sign-system of the Shemites by fissuring it,fracturing it, causing it to double and triple until the Shemites no longerknow who they are or what it is they were planning to do. For all thishumbling, abasing and confounding, however, Derrida’s God is notsimply an agent of deconstruction, but also a God who deconstructsHimself:And the proper name of God (given by God) is divided enough inthe tongue, already, to signify also, confusedly, ‘confusion’. And thewar that He declares has first raged within his name: divided, bifid,ambivalent, polysemic: God deconstructs. Himself.55It is a point Derrida has made several times: not even God escapesdifférance. Or, in more secular terms, even the deconstructive critic mustfall prey to the same semantic instabilities s/he has detected in others.The pat distinction between deconstructor and deconstructed is dis-solved. For Derrida, no-one or -thing, no God or mystic, neitherHusserl’s brackets, Heidegger’s Seinnor Levi-Strauss’bricoleurcanescape the ‘metaphysical complicity’of language.56As soon as we beginto deconstruct, we have already deconstructed ourselves. When GodThe honesty of the perplexed49"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"delivers confusion and chaos upon the designs of the Shemites, He isactually inflicting Himself upon them. Derrida has already suggestedthis at the very beginning of the essay with a quote from Voltaire’sDictionnaire Philosophique:I do not know why it is said that Babel signifies confusion, for Basignifies father in the Oriental tongues, and Belsignifies God;Babel signifies the city of God, the holy city. The Ancients gave thisname to all their capitals.57It’s not difficult to see why Derrida makes use of Voltaire’s ‘calmirony’ (ibid.): Voltaire is implying, tacitly, what Derrida is later goingto declare openly – that both the origin and the nature of confusion(Ba-Bel) is not diabolical, but divine. Of course, Voltaire’s alternativeetymology of Babel is a clear swipe at Augustine; in Civitas Dei,Augustine distinguishes between the city of God (Jerusalem – peace,silence, unity, lawfulness, immutability) and the city of men (Babylon –disruption, noise, discord, confusion, change). Whereas the saint seesdivinity as the remedy for confusion, even suggesting ‘vision of peace’as an etymology for Jeru-salem, Voltaire sees Babylon as the first andtrue city of God. Divinity is another name for confusion.Just as God precedes history, confusion precedes order. Or, as Derridamight say, confusion inhabits order, pervades order, gives meaningtoorder. In Derrida’s version of Genesis, no calm, transcendental deity decon-structs the tower – rather, one version of confusion gives birth to another.Which is why ‘Des Tours de Babel’is so important for our own argument –it is one of the few places in the Derridean oeuvre where Derrida actu-ally joins Ibn 2Arabi in using ‘confusion’ as a divine name. What Derridadoes in ‘Des Tours’ is call into question the simplicityof God, criticize thestandard and fairly simplistic images of deity we have, remind us of theconfusing and overwhelming complexity of the thought of God. It is atheme Derrida has certainly touched on elsewhere – twenty years earlier, inhis essay on Jabès (in many ways the most Kabbalistic of Derrida’s essays)Derrida is comparing the ‘God’ we can know with the ‘God’ we cannot:If God opens the question in God, if he is the very opening of theQuestion, there can be no simplicity of God. And, thus, that whichwas unthinkable for the classical rationalists here becomes theobvious itself. Proceeding within the duplicity of his own question-ability, God does not act in the simplest ways; he is not truthful, heis not sincere.5850The honesty of the perplexed"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Like Ibn 2Arabi, Derrida is asking us to increase our perplexityconcerning God. The ‘simplicity’ of God – the belief that God acts andworks in essentially clear, meaningful ways – is opposed to the distinctlyun-classical complexity and confusion of God. Derrida’s rejection ofsuch ‘simplicity’ replicates, to some extent, Ibn 2Arabi’s frequentKoranic reminder that God is like ‘no thing’ that we can know.Of course after his essay on Benjamin, Derrida will go on to write agreat deal about God and confusion – but never again as synonyms. In hislater essays on Eckhart and Silesius, not to mention his more recent workon the Czech philosopher Jan Patocka, Derrida is more concerned withGod as an infinitely deferred secret or ‘hyper-truth’, rather than any kind ofdivine, de-structuring chaos. In a sense, Derrida’s gesture in ‘Des Tours deBabel’– that of depicting God as a holy confusion, a wild and forever fluc-tuating source of energy – has a number of precedents both in and outsideWestern thought, not least among them Boehme (1575–1624) and Eckhart.Derrida mentions Boehme himself towards the end of the essay: ‘the Godof Boehme...who goes out of himself, determines himself in his finitudeand thus produces history’.59Boehme’s own idea of God as a dynamic,turbulent energy is most famously expressed in his idea of the Ungrund:For all is comprised in the will, and is an essence, which, in theeternal unground, eternally takes its rise in itself, enters into itself,grasps itself in itself, and makes the centre in itself; but with thatwhich is grasped passes out of itself, manifests itself in the bright-ness of the eye, and thus shines forth out of the essence in itself andfrom itself.60Given the Protean nature of différance, which is a ‘nothing’(rien) andyet forever ‘differs from itself, defers itself and writes itself as dif-férance’,61it is clear why Derrida (at least in ‘Des Tours’) finds the ‘Godof Boehme’ attractive – a writhing, seething force which emerges froma bottomless depth (Ungrund) to crystallize itself as history. The God ofGenesis, after all, creates history by the destruction of a monument; withthe abolition of one language, He gives birth to many more; by foilingthe plans of one people, He creates a multiplicity of tribes.All of which leads to the question: what exactlyis Derrida saying in‘Des Tours’about confusion? Is it desirable or undesirable? Is it the birthof something new and positive – or an ineluctable fate which terminatesevery project we undertake?Confusion, first and foremost, appears to be a punishment deliveredin particular upon those who want to get rid of their own confusion.The honesty of the perplexed51"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Shemites are guilty of this cardinal sin: ‘Come, let us build ourselvesa city and a tower.../Let us make ourselves a name,/that we not bescattered over the face of all the earth’.62Seeing the world not as a placeto affirm but rather to control, the Shemites are unhappy with their wan-dering, nameless status – and it is precisely this proud dissatisfactionwith their nomadic condition which provokes their punishment. There issomething faintly paradoxical here – ‘True homelessness and confusionwill only be inflicted on those who do not desire it’, as if learning to loveone’s perplexity is the only way ever to be free of it.Part of the Shemites’sin, it would appear, lies in the Shemites’refusalnot just to wander but also to accept the multiplicity of language. Theonly truly ‘proper’ (propre) name is that of ‘YHWH’; the Shemites,troubled by the fact that their name may take on different meanings fordifferent people, yearn for a similar unambiguity. In this sense, the towerof Babel is (in the words of Richard Rorty) ‘an attempt to avoid related-ness...to speak a word which has meaning even though it has no placein a social practice’.63The Shemites’sin is the desire for meaningitself,pure, unambiguous, repeatable meaning, not to be at the mercy of con-texts, or adrift in alien situations. Of course the Shemites fail in this –and Derrida’s conviction of the ‘impossibility of finishing’ such towersonly reflects the more general impossibility of anyproper name (eventhat of YHWH) to evermean one thing and one thing only.This desire to have a proper name – whether it is for one’s race, one’smovement or one’s work – does remind one of Freud. Freud certainlyhad paths he wanted his writings to travel along – as Derrida points outso cleverly in ‘Coming Into One’s Own’– and was quick to admonish hisfollowers whenever he saw a text straying from its desired trajectory. Inhis essay on Beyond The Pleasure Principle, Derrida examines Freud’spaternal hold on his writings, his desire to keep psychoanalysis ‘in thefamily’, as it were, not to let any of his texts run about on their own,orphan-like: ‘...the establishment of a science...should have been ableto do without the family name Freud. Or able, at least, to make forget-ting that name the necessary condition and the proof that science itselfis handed on, passed down.’64The same unambiguity the Shemites wantfor their own name, Freud wanted for ‘psychoanalysis’. Freud shared theShemites’ aversion towards confusion, the fear of being differentlyunderstood, a fear which can only spring from a desire for power.Second, Derrida’s essay seems to oppose confusion to violence – atleast, to a certain kind of violence, a ‘colonial violence’. The Shemites’desire to ‘universalise their idiom’,65of making the whole world speaktheir tongue and subscribe to their culture, ultimately belongs to what52The honesty of the perplexed"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Derrida had earlier called (paraphrasing Levinas) a thought of ‘the Oneand the Same’ – in other words, a metaphysics which is ‘the origin...ofall oppression in the world’.66God’s gesture, therefore, becomes ‘multi-cultural’ in the most ironic sense of the term; the bewildering of theShemites foils their imperialist intentions, confounding their architectsand scattering their armies, disempowering them physically as well assemantically. Confusion, here, means the loss of all the reasons why onewould want to control and subdue somebody; the difficulty in forcingsomeone to conform to one logoswhen a multiplicity of them abound.If rational metaphysics is ‘the origin...of all oppression’, and if confu-sion is precisely that which disables the will-to-metaphysicize, then it isnot surprising to see how Derrida can discover pacific overtones in theidea of bewilderment. Confusion, far from being that which foils justiceor creates a breeding ground for injustice, actually becomes a disabler oftyranny, a dismantler of the violent totality, a paralysing spanner throwninto the dictator’s machine.Derrida, in typical fashion, questions this idea as soon as he expresses it.The Babelian project ‘can signify simultaneously a colonial violence...and a peaceful transparency of the community’.67The divine abolitionof a single tongue may well foil the aims of a ‘linguistic imperialism’,but it also removes a form of communication. A difficult question brieflymakes its appearance: is Genesis 11: 1–9 about the thwarting of anempire or the destruction of a community? Is the removal of one bigger,‘colonial violence’ only the beginning of a number of smaller, inter-ethnic ones? It is a surprisingly generous phrase, given Derrida’s antipa-thy towards words like ‘community’ (in which he sees ‘as many threatsas promises’),68not to mention the famous crossing of swords withHabermas and his communicative reason. The common idiom, howevercolonially imposed, would at least reduce the possibility of misunder-standing within the community – expressions, actions, gestures, wouldall be relatively ‘transparent’. The language game of the Shemites wouldbe colonially singular, and its rules transparently (albeit incontestably)clear. Even though Derrida seems to be saying, in ‘Des Tours’, thatGod’s deconstruction of the tower is an example of what Derrida haselsewhere termed ‘just deconstruction’,69the possible ‘peaceful trans-parency’ of the Shemites’ community does inject a note of ambivalenceinto the essay.If the Derrida of ‘Des Tours’ appears to be reluctant to come out andout and declare confusion to be a truly pacific state – that is, declaringbewilderment to be the only way of non-violently receiving the Other – weshould not be surprised. As we have already seen in Of Grammatology,The honesty of the perplexed53"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"when using words like ‘violence’ and ‘colonial’ Derrida is often carefulnot to replicate Levi-Strauss’ error and fall into the trap of a tyrant/victim, wicked/innocent dualism. Even though Derrida believes no orderor community to be free of a certain violence, this does not mean anar-chy is some form of blissful utopia. The most we can say about Derrida’sattitude towards confusion is that, when we are confused or bewildered,we are less likely to impose a single, reductive image onto the Other – justas Ibn 2Arabi’s perfect gnostic, when in a state of complete h.ayrahorperplexity, is no longer willing or able to fix any image onto the Real.Third, Derrida’s words on Babel underline one consistent feature ofhis varied and diverse corpus: a delight in multiplicity at the expense ofunity. For Derrida the divergent is infinitely preferable to the convergent,the fragments are more interesting than the whole, the Many is prefer-able to the One. Bewilderment is to be encouraged, not resisted. Theallegations of anarchy which have been levelled at Derrida, whilst exag-gerated in tone and mistaken in motive, are correct to some degree: theyconcern a thinker who is as interested in dissolution as he is in design.The ‘dissemination’ of the Shemites (‘YHWH disperses them from here over the face of all the earth/They cease to build the city’),70a working metaphor for the deconstruction of every would-be system, isthe very kind of confusion Derrida seeks to affirm. This profoundly anti-Neoplatonic strain in Derrida’s writing, rather than seeking animpossible return to the One, affirms the dissolution of the One into theMany – if only because there never was a ‘pure’, ‘unchanging’ One tobegin with:...the quasi-‘meaning’ of dissemination is the impossible return tothe rejoined, readjusted unity of meaning...But is disseminationthen the lossof that kind of truth, the negativeprohibition of allaccess to such a signified? Far from presupposing that a virginsubstance thus precedes or oversees it, dispersing or withholdingitself within a negative second moment, dissemination affirmsthealways already divided generation of meaning.71This denial of any original ‘oneness’ or ‘wholeness’ (‘virginsubstance’) which might have preceded the multiple probably constitutesthe most serious difference between Ibn 2Arabi and Derrida, whoseattitudes towards rationality and bewilderment otherwise encounter somany points of similarity. It is a passage which reveals Derrida to be themost un-Neoplatonic of thinkers, surprising only when one considerssome of the favourites in the Derridean canon (Benjamin and Blanchot,54The honesty of the perplexed"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"for instance). Instead of the One, an emptiness lies at the heart ofdissemination, a place where ‘there is no longer any depth of mean-ing’.72The ‘actual situation’ for Derrida is an endlessly proliferatingmyriad of substitutions, without beginning or end, centre or periphery, inthe midst of which the unenlightened forever attempt to build theirtheories, structures and truths, unaware that their metaphysical towersrest upon interminably shifting sands.Ibn 2Arabi on the flood: sainthood as perplexityWere He to come out of a thing, it would cease to be. And were Heto be within a thing, it would cease to be. (Futuhat, II.661.10)Ibn 2Arabi’s treatment of the seventy-first surah of the Koran on Noah(Nuh) is a good example of how the Shaykh bewilders the reader, byoffering interpretations of well-known passages from the Koran whichare almost the exact opposite of what they appear to mean. Thehermeneutics of the Fususare a lesson in perplexity in themselves:villains and tyrants are treated sympathetically, heroes are shown to beignorant or misguided, condemnatory verses are reinterpreted as praise,idolaters are shown to be enlightened. As we shall see in a later chapter,Ibn 2Arabi’s conviction that ‘the Reality of God lies in all things’ is per-fectly translated into his Koranic commentary; the intention of God’sHoly Text lies in all possible readings, even in the most contradictoryand outrageous ones. For now, we are merely interested in whatIbn2Arabi’s chapter on Noah in the Fusus says about bewilderment – andultimately how this compares to Derrida’s own thoughts on confusion.In a way, Ibn 2Arabi’s retelling of the story of Noah follows Derrida’sversion of Babel, insofar as both writers deal with a divinely deliveredcatastrophe – and both writers choose to redescribe this punishment asmore of a blessing than a chastisement, more of a development or anadvancement than a termination. The Koranic account of the flood doesnot differ greatly from that of the Biblical version with regards to theultimate significance of the event – in response to the rising corruptionand sinfulness of man, God resolves to wipe out the unbelievers with adivine deluge, saving only Noah and those around him from the watersbecause of their righteousness. The Koran differs only insofar as itshows, in some detail, the despair of Noah as he attempts (in vain) topersuade his people to leave their idols and repent, and his request toGod that none of the proud unbelievers should be spared.The honesty of the perplexed55"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"In order to understand the Shaykh’s radical rereading of this surah,one has to remember God’s persistent emphasis on God as beingsimultaneouslyimmanent and transcendent. In his attempt to reach theunbelievers Noah, far from being praised as a solitary bastion of right-eousness in a decadent world, is criticized for only emphasizing the tran-scendent without mentioning the immanent: ‘Had Noah uttered this kindof saying, they would have responded to him...’.73Even more notori-ously, Ibn 2Arabi interprets the final drowning of the unbelievers not asjust punishment upon the sinful, but as the drowning of saints in theshoreless oceans of Allah: ‘they drowned in the seas of knowledge ofGod, which is what is meant by perplexity’.74The stubborn idolaters,with their bewildering abundance of idols (Wadd, Suwan, Yaghuth, Ya1uq,Nasr71: 23), suddenly became the purveyors of a spiritual hayrah– onewhich eludes Noah, a figure still clinging to a one-sided view of atranscendent God.Ibn 2Arabi’s version of Noah is important because it tells us a numberof things about the Shaykh’s attitude towards bewilderment; first andforemost, multiplicity is seen not as a problem, but as a means towardsthe solution. The perplexity necessary towards spiritual advancementcan only be provided by multiplicity – in this case, the multiplicity ofidols which ‘cause confusion’ amongst Noah’s people. Only confusioncan bring us nearer to God. One object of worship is not sufficient – itdeludes the ignorant with an illusion of clarity, desists from complicat-ing the thought of God, makes the believer think the holy is exclusive tothe statue or painting s/he is worshipping. As soon as a multiplicity ofidols appears, the locus of the holy – and thereby the nature of the Holyitself – is called into question. Distraction here becomes an anti-metaphysical tool, one used to lever and prize the intellect out of acertain niche and into a freer understanding of things. The perplexity thebeliever experiences at this multiplication of possibilities provokes asincerer inquiry into the nature of God, one which will lead (theShaykh believes) to the all-important realization that al-haqqis presenteverywhere and in everything.Here, especially, one sees how important a role infinity plays at theheart of both Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi’s thought. The forms of the Real,like the possible meanings of the deconstructive text, are infinite in num-ber: there is no end to the ‘bottomless chessboard’(échiquier sans fond)on which différance is put into play,75any more than there is any bottomto the infinite oceans of God (‘God possesses relationships, faces andrealities without limit’76). The confusion which the infinity of theReal/the Derridean text provides is seen by both Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi56The honesty of the perplexed"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"to be perfectly desirable, even if they do lead in radically differentdirections. For Derrida, the bewilderingly infinite possibilities of the textleads to one conclusion: that the text is semantically vacuous, a sheet ofsymbols bereft of depth. Ibn 2Arabi, however, viewing the perplexingvariety of people’s beliefs, does not come to the conclusion thatthere is no God, but rather that there is ‘Something which cannot beknown’ which both embodies and is embodied by all of these infinitemanifestations.A second point to be made is that Noah’s evangelical failure to savethe unbelievers from the flood stems from his refusal to present God asa divine perplexity:Noah summoned his people by night, in that he appealed to theirintellects and spirits, which are unseen, and by day, in that heappealed to the external senses. But he did not unite the two as inthe verse There is none like Him(42: 11).77Noah literally refuses to con-fuse the idea of God by presenting Him asa simultaneous conjunction of opposites (immanent and transcendent).This monologic attachment to a simplistic understanding of God, essen-tially this distaste for confusion on Noah’s part, causes the unbelieversto ‘recoil’and prevents them from climbing onto the boat. It is an unflat-tering portrayal of Noah for Ibn 2Arabi to present – one which seems toclass Noah with the proponents of the Kalam and the other philosopherswho fetter (2iqal) themselves to a single image of God. Perhaps torecover some shred of orthodoxy, Ibn 2Arabi contrasts this implicitignorance of Noah with the keener wisdom of the Prophet Muhammed,who (in the Shaykh’s opinion) clearly understood something about Godwhich Noah did not:In the verse There is none like Him, similarity is at once implied anddenied. Because of this Muhammad said that he had been grantedknowledge [of God] integrating all His aspects. Muhammad [unlikeNoah] did not summon his people by nightand by day, but by nightduring the day [an inner summons implicit in the outer one], and byday during the night [the outer truth being implicit in the inner].78Unlike Noah, the Prophet is keenly aware of the ‘actual situation’– heemphasizes neither the zahirnor the batinat the expense of one another,but rather blurs the distinction between both. Unlike Noah, the Prophetis not afraid of the con-fusion of God; this natural distance betweenThe honesty of the perplexed57"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Noah and Muhammad is not measured in terms of respect or divinefavour, but rather in terms of how close each comes to acceptingperplexity as a condition of the divine.One of the more interesting metaphors Ibn 2Arabi uses for such per-plexity is that of a deluge, evoking the familiar image of God as a shore-less ocean. It is a metaphor which provides the most scandaloussuggestion in Ibn 2Arabi’s rereading of the surah; the unbelievers’refusal to join Noah and climb on the boat is no tragic mistake, but rathera spiritually wiser move, one which saves them from the narrow onto-theology of Noah’s ark and allows them to drown ecstatically in thewider seas of ‘the knowledge of God’.79By refusing to join Noah andheed the call to his transcendent God, they reject an unenlightened clar-ity in favour of their own perplexing truth – and pay for this choice, asAl Hallaj did, with their lives. Nevertheless, the spiritual stage the unbe-lievers reach as a result of their refusal is far higher than that of Noah.Once swept away by the flood, if they were ever to find land again(as Noah does), it would constitute no rescue but a spiritual descent:‘Were He to deliver them onto the shore of Nature He would be lower-ing them from an eminent stage...’.80For true gnostics, evidently,oceans are preferable to arks.In the FutuhatIbn 2Arabi performs the same controversial gesture,taking familiar condemnations of the foolish and the proud in the Koranand completely inverting their meaning so that they describe thosefew, distinct from ‘the common people’,81who have discovered trueperplexity. For example, the wayward described by the Koran in verses2: 17, those ‘who do not see’, are ‘deaf, dumb, and blind’and ‘will neverreturn to the right path’, are interpreted differently by the Shaykh in thelast volume of the Futuhat:But the electare ‘in darkness, they do not see. Deaf, dumb, blind.’(2: 17), they do not understand. Sometimes they say ‘We are weand He is He’, sometimes they say ‘He is we and we are He’...82(italics mine)Darkness, incomprehension and aimlessness are the gifts of the per-plexed – ‘...they will never return to the right path’. Bewilderment,amongst other things, means loss of direction. Suddenly, ‘never return-ing to the right path’ seems to be indicative of enlightenment, not igno-rance. Ibn 2Arabi infuses the idea of wandering with a positive sensewhich would be difficult to reconcile with orthodox Islam, given theimportance of the path (al-sirat al-mustaqWm) and its synonymy with the58The honesty of the perplexed"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"codes and traditions of the Shariah. In his chapter on Noah, Ibn 2Arabianalyses this difference between the unperplexed – who proceed along agiven path towards a goal – and the bewildered, for whom there is nolonger any centre to journey towards:He who experiences this perplexity is ceaselessly centred on thePole [God], while he who follows the ‘long’ path [to a distant God]is always turning aside from the [Supreme] Goal to search after thatwhich is [eternally] within him, running after imagination as hisgoal. He has an [imaginary] starting point and [what he supposes tobe] a goal and what lies between them, while for the God-centredman there is no restriction of beginning or end, possessing [as hedoes] the most comprehensive existence and being the recipient of[divine] truths and realities.83Ibn 2Arabi’s perplexity here is opposed to movement – confusionbecomes a paralysing condition, it robs the believer of a goal, an object,an aim. As soon as one discovers that God is (immanently) in oneself aswell as (transcendentally) ‘Somewhere’ outside, one no longer needs tomake a pilgrimage, for the shrine is already inside the pilgrim. Hence theparalysis which confusion brings to the ‘God-centred’ (perplexed) manis by no means negative, but simply the rendering unnecessary of an illu-sory journey to something one already is.The final point to be made about Ibn 2Arabi’s remarks on Noah con-cerns the social implications of hayrahand its subversive potential. Thechapter on Noah offers one of the few places in the Fususwhere thefaintly political possibilities of perplexity – discovering the Real withinoneself – are alluded to, if not fully explored. Modern critics with polit-ical agendas can often be found re-interpreting various medieval mysti-cisms as revolutionary vocabularies, particularly those which emphasizethe divine within the human. The clearest example of this is probablyErnst Bloch’s Marxist reading of Meister Eckhart in his Atheismus imChristentum. In Ernst Bloch, Eckhart’s insistence on the unity of Godand the soul becomes a subversive, emancipatory gesture which ulti-mately sees ‘the treasure in Heaven [as] the property of man’ (dieSchätze im Himmel als Eigentum der Mensch).84Thus for Bloch,Eckhart supplies not just an ‘aspiring subject’ but also a ‘blown-open,descending heavenly kingdom’ (gesprengter, niedersteigenderHimmel).85All of which does not mean to say a similarly emancipatory readingof Ibn 2Arabi should be attempted – the only chains the Shaykh is keenThe honesty of the perplexed59"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"to break are purely metaphysical. What deserves comment in Ibn 2Arabi’sNoah is the way the presence of the perplexed dissolves a certain socialhierarchy – and the way Noah’s words (below in italics) presents theconfusion of the unbelievers as a possible threat to society, one whichmight spread if not checked in time:If you spare them, that is leave them, they will confuse yourservants, meaning that they will perplex them and cause them todepart from their servanthood to [assert] the mysteries of Lordshipin themselves, so that they will consider themselves as Lords afterbeing servants. They will indeed be servants become as Lords.86If God is the dissolver of differences (‘He has no attributes (sifa)’87),then everyone carries within them this capacity to dismantle hierarchy,regardless of their social position. Noah’s fear lies in this perceivedthreat of self-discovery; perplexity lifts the servant out of his servant-hood, causes everything to shimmer and change, relocating the Divinitynot just in the hearts of caliphs and kings, but even down to the lowestrung of the social ladder. It is a passage which reminds us of Bloch’sobservation – in Ibn 2Arabi, true enlightenment turns servants intoLords.Conclusion: actual situationsBoth Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi’s attitude towards perplexity – theirrepeated mistrust of systems and system-builders, their consistentportrayal of clarity as an illusion based on the ignorance of a certain sit-uation, their understanding of a certain dynamic force which pervadesall manifestations/texts without ever revealing itself, along with theirbelief that the state of perplexity allows one to glimpse an elusiveOther which remains invisible to those who are trying to think it...allthese observations leads us to a number of general points as in thefollowing list.Perplexity is an ‘actual situation’.For both thinkers, confusion is acertain originary state of affairs which seems to precede God/the textand every attempt to talk about them. For Ibn 2Arabi, the true gnosticsees through (without dismissing) the theologizing and philosophizingof his peers; he understands that ‘the whole affair [of God] is perplex-ity’,88a divine flux which lies beneath every image and concept prof-fered about the Real. The deconstructive critic replicates this antedatingof meaning with confusion by seeing through the apparent calm of the60The honesty of the perplexed"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"text and perceiving an ‘“active, moving discord of different forces”beneath it’,89always already about to subvert and undermine any andevery interpretation.Perplexity is an inevitable situation.The confusion which bothdifférance and al-haqqperpetrate cannot be overcome; no theologicalvocabulary can tie the Real to one form, safe and constant, just as nohermeneutics can prevent the ‘essential drifting of the text’.90The Realmoves through a bewildering variety of manifestations, from zahirtozahir, just as the text moves through an equally bewildering series of dif-fering interpretations. For both Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi, the perplexingeffusion of meanings and manifestations can neither be controlled norresisted; bewilderment is a semantic fact of God.Perplexity is an honest, difficult situation.The word for kafir(‘infi-del, unbeliever’) comes from the Arabic root khafara, meaning to hideor conceal. Etymologically, a kafiris someone who hides the truth in hisor her heart.91For Ibn 2Arabi, this would mean refusing to acknowledgethe perplexity of the ‘actual situation’ – that the Real both is and is notthe creation, that He is simultaneously immanent and transcendent. Thesecret of the Akbarian soul – that it is a part of the Real – is concealed(kafara) thanks to the half-truth of transcendence (tanzih). ‘We forbidreflection totally,’writes Ibn 2Arabi, ‘since it makes the possessor heir todeceit and lack of sincerity’.92‘Covering’ or ‘concealing’ the radicalunthinkability of God with our own versions of the deity makes ourspiritual lives easier for us; if we desire a true encounter with the Real,we have to be prepared to experience perplexity and not simply seekreassurance in comfortable, familiar images.In speaking (within a strictly Christian context) of a ‘deconstructivetheology movement’, Derrida has suggested some similar theologicalapplications of deconstruction – more than anything else, of ‘uncovering’a spiritual authenticity:...the point would seem to be to liberatetheology from what has beengrafted onto it, to free it from its metaphysico-philosophical superego, so as to uncoveran authenticity of the ‘gospel’, of the evangeli-cal message. And thus from the perspective of faith, deconstructioncan at least be a very useful technique when Aristotelianism orThomism are to be criticized or, even from an institutional perspec-tive, when what needs to be criticized is a whole theological institu-tion which supposedly has covered over, dissimulated an authenticChristian message. And [the point would also seem to be] a realpossibility for faith both at the margins and very close to Scripture, afaith lived in a venturous, dangerous, free way. (Italics mine)93The honesty of the perplexed61"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Despite the difference in contexts, Derrida is in effect saying somethingremarkably similar to Ibn 2Arabi: the ‘metaphysico-philosophical’ con-structions with which various institutions (the Ash1arites, the Mu1tazilites)have tried to simplify and regulate the nature of God over the centurieshave been based on a ‘covering over’ of the true Divinity. Ibn 2Arabi’shayrah, in many ways, provides the Islamic precedent for a ‘faith livedin a venturous, dangerous, free way’. A faith free of metaphysics, free ofveils, images and idols.Perplexity is a desirable situation.For both deconstructive and Sufialterities, the basic point remains the same: when we are confused, wesee things which we miss when we think we know what we are doing.We see the difference of difference.Heidegger often makes a similar point. When something goes wrong –a broken tool, an unexpected accident, an unfaithful partner – and ourprojects breakdown, we truly see for a moment how our world is struc-tured and contextualized around us to give it meaning. In this moment of‘breakdown’ we glimpse, says Heidegger, the ‘worldhood of the world’(die Weltlichkeit der Welt). The perplexing multiplicity of manifestationsenables the stunned believer to glimpse the ‘Godness’of God, just as thecontinually irrupting images of the Other enables Derrida toglimpse the otherness of the tout autre. Thus, a common opposition torational/metaphysical thought in both Sufism and deconstruction alsofinds a common response: if metaphysics blinds/veils us from the actualsituation – and if confusion is that which disables our rationalizing willto a system – then we will only truly begin to ‘see’ when we learn todesire confusion, not to flee it.62The honesty of the perplexed"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 3Sages of the bookThe meaning of infinity in Sufi anddeconstructive hermeneuticsWe may conclude this history of hermeneutics with the followingremark. The initial purpose of hermeneutics was to explain the word ofGod. This purpose was eventually expanded into an attempt to regulatethe process of explaining the word of man. In the nineteenth century welearned, first from Hegel and then more effectively from Nietzsche, thatGod is dead. In the twentieth century, Kojève and his students, likeFoucault, have informed us that man is dead, thereby as it were openingthe gates into an abyss of postanthropological deconstruction. As thescope of hermeneutics has expanded, then, the two original sourcesof meaning, God and man, have vanished, taking with them the cosmosor world and leaving us with nothing but our own garrulity, which wechoose to call the philosophy of language, linguistic philosophy, or oneof their synonyms. If nothing is real, the real is nothing; there is nodifference between the written lines of a text and the blank spacesbetween them.Stanley Rosen, Hermeneutics as Politics.1I’ve chosen to begin this chapter on Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi’s ideas ofinterpretation with Rosen’s faintly apocalyptic remarks for two reasons.First of all, Rosen’s remarks (although over a decade old) effectively sumup the place contemporary hermeneutics has reached in its explorationof the death of the subject/author/canon and their consequences for theway we read books. Rosen’s point is, of course, a familiar one: thecollapse of the subject, the mistrust of the object, the demise of variousinstitutions – along with all of their theological raisons d1être– hasbrought about the demise of stable, repeatable meaning. If both readersand writers really are, as one theorist says, nothing more than ‘centrelesswebs of beliefs and desires’2then exactly how are human beings to con-tinue reading and writing sheets of symbols no-one agrees upon? It is"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"a question which, in their respective centuries, faced both Ibn 2Arabi andDerrida, even though in the Great Shaykh’s case it is the infinity of themind of God, rather than any agonistic plurality of interpretativeperspectives, which lay as the source of the problem. The point suppliesthe second reason why our chapter on thirteenth-century Sufi hermeneu-tics must begin with mention of ‘the abyss of postanthropological decon-struction’. Just as Derrida’s work on the endless text reminds us of howuncannily contemporary Ibn 2Arabi is, Ibn 2Arabi’s understanding ofwhat it means to read the Quran brings to light a much older genealogyin Derrida’s work.One of the aims of this chapter will be to contest, through a comparisonof Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi, Rosen’s kind of popular, simplistic view of thehistory of hermeneutics as one long slide from the transcendental unam-biguity of the Holy Word to the emptiness of the deconstructive abyss. Inthis version of history, the freedom of the reader has gradually progressed,thanks to a Weberesque Entzauberungof the act of reading, from theecclesiastical imprisonment of the Book to the semantic freedom of theText. It is a view we often hear, particularly in relation to the Derrideanepoch; Mark C. Taylor, most famously, has re-defined deconstruction as‘the “hermeneutic” of the death of God’,3implying that it was the unde-constructed ghost of God which still lingered on in the Enlightenmentspirit (in the form of Author Intention), narrowing parameters, eliminatingalternatives, restricting (sometimes prohibiting) interpretations, foreverprodding the would-be-exegete onward in that wonderfully futile searchfor ‘what the (A)uthor is trying to say’. Within such a history, deconstruc-tion arrives as a semantic coup de grace, finally dispelling the ghost of thetext and freeing us all from the fear of misinterpretation by showing howthere is (quite literally) nothingto be scared of.This understanding of Derrida’s place in the history of hermeneuticshas to change. Not because it is essentially wrong, but because it restson an unsound and oversimplified understanding of how the medievalsactually read their texts. There has been no deconstructive ‘freeing’ ofthe text from some ill-perceived domain of the theological – on thecontrary, the textual elasticity of the medieval exegete was every bit asversatile and allowed just as many different interpretations as the mostradical deconstructive study. This warning not to underestimate thecomplexities of the medieval mind – by now a fairly standard gesture inthe history of ideas – has been most memorably uttered by Borges:The idea that the Sacred Scriptures have (aside from their literalvalue) a symbolic value is ancient and not irrational...64Sages of the book"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"They thought that a work dictated by the Holy Spirit was anabsolute text; in other words, a text in which the collaboration ofchance was calculable as zero. This portentous premise of a bookimpenetrable to contingency, of a book which is a mechanism ofinfinite purposes, moved them to permute the scriptural words, addup the numerical value of the letters, consider their form, observethe small letters and capitals, seeks acrostics and anagrams andperform other exegetical rigours which it is not difficult to ridicule.Their excuse is that nothing can be contingent in the work of an infi-nite mind.4As eloquent and erudite as ever, Borges comes to remind us thatsemantic multiplicity is no fancy trend of the twentieth century – it isold, as old as the Zoharor Philo’s Allegories of the Laws, the commen-taries of Ibn Abbas or St Augustine. In the passage quoted, Borges isreferring to the Jewish Kabbalists, but it would not be difficult to extendthis to Ibn 2Arabi (and, as Habermas will purport, even to Derrida him-self). The ‘exegetical rigours’which Borges cites as characteristics of aninfinitely readable text – counting up the letters numerologically, deriv-ing meaning from their various shapes and arrangements, the extractionof acrostics and anagrams from apparently straightforward pieces ofverse – can all be found as fairly standard features in the hermeneuticsof the Great Shaykh himself. Whether it is Ibn 2Arabi’s mystical reinter-pretation of the date of Almohad’s victory over the Christian armies in1194,5or the Shaykh’s understanding of a man figure (the Perfect Man,al-insan al-kamil) from the letters of the Prophet Muhammad’s name (), the all-encompassing infinity of the Divine Mind anticipatesevery Koranic nuance, every so-called ‘chance’ or ‘coincidence’, everyhermeneutic variation as one more unspeakable development in theInfinite Will.Of course, the majority of us no longer read texts like this any more.When we read a novel, the possibility that all our idiosyncratically sin-gular responses to the text (certain characters reminding us of familymembers, certain personal memories being provoked by certain pas-sages, etc.) have already been anticipated by the novelist would strike usas absurd. And yet the openness the deconstructive reader shows towards the text – the fact that, as Derrida says, ‘there are only contextswithout any centre of absolute anchoring’,6which turns the text into ameaning-machine that can constantly produce new meanings – is no dif-ferent in effect from the openness of the Sufi exegete towards the‘Tremendous Koran’. As Borges rightly points out, the infinite mind ofSages of the book65"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"the Author explodes the Koran, releasing it at once in all kinds ofdirections, allowing it to say an infinite variety of things to an infinitenumber of addressees. In both cases, infinitely interpretable texts are thesubject in discussion – even if those texts are infinitely interpretable forfundamentally different reasons.In other words, we are approaching an analogy in which (to quoteMacIntyre) ‘the gradual accumulation...of so many different, heteroge-neous, and conflicting bodies of canonical texts’7has the same infinitiz-ing effect on the modern text as the unfathomability of the Divine Intenthad on the Sacred Scriptures. Both the infinite mind of Allah on the onehand and the infinite range of contemporary contexts on the other resultin the same thing: an unending multiplication of meaning. Derrida mayhave de-transcendentalized the text and exposed its secret – that it has no‘secret’; he has not, however, by any means ‘liberated’ it from the logo-centric clutches of an onto-theological hermeneutics, but rather restoredan originary infinity to the text which was already there in the days ofSt Bonaventure, Rabbi Moses de Leon and Al-Ghazali. Not to mentionMuhyiddin Ibn al-2Arabi himself.This version of a Derrida who has come to return a medieval sense ofinfinity to hermeneutics has upset some people. Not surprisingly,Derrida has been accused of/complimented with mysticism on a numberof occasions, and not simply for essays such as ‘Edmond Jabès’.Ironically enough Habermas, relying on Susan Handelmann’s rabbinicreading of deconstruction, was one of the first to associate Derrida with‘Jewish mysticism’, in particular the ‘Cabalists’.8Derridean écriture,with its infinite deferral, ‘renews the mystical concept of tradition as anever delayedevent of revelation’ (p. 182). The ‘a’ of différance, we aretold, is comparable to the alephof Rabbi Mendel (reported by Scholem):‘To hear the alephis to hear next to nothing; it is the preparation for allaudible language, but in itself contains no determinate, specific mean-ing’ (p. 183). Reading Habermas carefully, it does not take long to real-ize exactly what it is about Derrida – or Kabbalism – that the author of‘communicative reason’ finds so offensive: a fascination with ‘theabsolute readability’of the text (p. 166). A fascination which, ultimately,leads to a levelling of the distinction between philosophical and literarygenres – in other words, the profound fear that people will confuse Marxwith Tolstoy and Tolstoy with Marx. All of which leads Habermas to theconclusion that Derrida’s neo-Kabbalistic hermeneutics conceal ‘ananarchist wish to explode the continuum of history’.9Before moving on to a comparison of Sufi/deconstructive herm-eneutics, it should be mentioned that, if critics like Habermas and Norris66Sages of the book"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"cannot agree upon whether Derrida belongs to a philosophical traditionor a mystical one, a somewhat similar dispute takes place withinIbn2Arabi scholarship over whether the Shaykh’s ideas on interpretationbelong to an excessively mystical or more orthodox exegetical tradition –in other words, exactly how flexible Ibn 2Arabi’s hermeneutics actuallyare. The disagreement centres over the use of a certain term, ta1wil,which literally means ‘carrying back to’ but which generally refers to arather mystical and esoteric technique of exegesis, more often than notassociated with Shi1ia Islam. The practice of ta1wilencourages the ideaof a text with an infinite number of inner meanings (batin) – rather thaninterpreting the text, the ta1wilreleases it, leading the reader onto awhole new level of higher meanings. The main proponent of such a ver-sion of Ibn 2Arabi has been Henry Corbin. As Corbin spent many yearsteaching in Iran, most critics tend to see Corbin’s linking of Ibn 2Arabiwith ta1wilas part of his general desire to present the Great Shaykh as‘a pure Shi1ite’.10Chittick, most notably, opposes Corbin with the obser-vation that most of Ibn 2Arabi’s references to ta1wilin the Futuhatareactually explicitly negative. Of course, Chittick’s knowledge of his sub-ject and the quality of his scholarship are beyond question – however, inhis opposition to Corbin, Chittick feels compelled to make some slightlyincredible claims for the orthodoxy of Ibn 2Arabi’s hermeneutics, in par-ticular that he ‘displays a tremendous reverence for the literal text’.11Any reader of the Fusus Al-Hikam, with its mystical numerologies,strange etymologies, obscure interpretations, implicit criticism of Noahand apparent praise for the tyrannical Pharaoh, may be forgiven forthinking otherwise.Livreand kitab: when is an empty text an infinite one?Every existent thing finds in the Koran what it desires.Futuhat, III.94Ibn 2Arabi is certainly by no means the first to suggest an infinite num-ber of meanings for the Koranic text, nor are his stranger interpretationsuncommon in any history of Koranic exegesis. Al-Ghazali, in his workon the rules for the recitation of the Koran (Kitab adab Hawat al-Qur1an), quotes the familiar hadithor tradition of Ali’s: ‘If I wished,I could load seventy camels with the exegesis of the opening surah of theKoran’.12Like Ibn 2Arabi two centuries after him, al-Ghazali disagreedwith the limited way in which the exotericists (arbab al-zawahir)‘inclined towards closing the door’on esoteric interpretation (ibid., p. 242)Sages of the book67"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"and advocated the legitimacy of esoteric interpretations not only whenthe verse in question could yield no rational meaning, but even for thoseverses which could conventionally be understood by the ordinary reader.Indeed, whilst never actually advocating the infinite interpretabilityof the text, al-Ghazali goes so far as to call a veil of ignorance thebelief that the only correct interpretations of the Koran are the exoteric(rational, intelligible) ones. The stranger gestures in Ibn 2Arabi’shermeneutics, therefore, have to be understood with this backgroundin mind.In comparing Derrida’s and Ibn 2Arabi’s views on interpretation, itshould be stressed that the Great Shaykh’s hermeneutics almost entirelyconcern the Koran. What Ibn 2Arabi says about meaning and interpreta-tion is seldom explicitly extended to other secular works, or to languagein general – in contrast to Derrida, the Shaykh will always find one Bookto be more special than all the other ones.13Nevertheless, there are cer-tain moments in the Futuhatwhere the belief in a God whose Essence isunique but whose determinations are various leads to all texts, Koranicor not, being in some way involved in His revelation:There are those among us who see God but are ignorant of Him...Though no-one loves any but his own Creator, he is veiledfrom Him by the love for Zaynab, Su1ad, Hind, Layla, thisworld, money, position, and everything loved in the world. Poetsexhaust their words writing about all these existent things withoutknowing, but the gnostics never hear a verse, a riddle, a panegyric,or a love poem that is not about Him, hidden beyond the veils offorms.14If God is truly the omnipresent source of all manifestation, the hiddentruth behind every zahir, then wisdom consists not in trying to find Godthrough one Book, but in trying to see how God has written every book.Such a belief in the hermeneutic omnipresence of God effectively pre-empts and sabotages every secular attempt at writing a book which is‘not about Him’. Indeed, within such a worldview which sees everyzahir– every ‘verse, riddle, panegyric and love poem’– as having divinepossibilities, what room can there be for the secular?Probably the first feature which unites deconstructive/Sufiapproaches to interpretation is a simple disbelief in any exclusive, con-clusive secret to the text – a belief in the text not as a single communi-cation to be reiterated endlessly, but rather as a vehicle which constantly68Sages of the book"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"delivers new meanings according to the situation and moment of thereader. In both writers, this effectively means an unending flow ofdifferent meanings. Ibn 2Arabi’s most explicit comments on this occur inthe second volume of the Futuhat:We say concerning the senses of a verse that all are intended byGod. No one forces anything upon God...The reason for this is asfollows: The verse of God’s speech, of whatever sort it might be –Koran, revealed book, scripture, divine report – is a sign or a remarksignifying what the words (lafz) support in all senses and intendedby the One who sent down His speech in those words, which com-prise, in that language, those senses. For He who sent it down knowsall those senses without exception. He knows that His servants aredisparate in their consideration of those words...Hence, whensomeone understands a sense from the verse, that sense is intendedby God in this verse in the case of the person who finds it.15First and foremost the Koran (which is ‘God’s speech’) has no singlemessage, but a variety of messages, each one gauged to the competenceand situation of its reader. This variety is infinite – or at least, as multi-tudinous as the number of the Koran’s readership (one can’t help think-ing here of Isaac Luria’s assertion that there were 600,000 ‘faces’ of theTorah – as many readings as there were Jews living in Israel at the timeof the Revelation, or also of one scholar’s belief that the Koran contained77,200 sciences, one for every letter on its pages).16The infinite mind ofthe Author can ‘gauge’His text to respond to each of His ‘disparate’ser-vants – indeed, He has always already performed this hermeneuticalfine-tuning. The Shaykh’s point here really hinges on the omnitemporal-ity of God – a God who is divine enough to see, in the future, all theways in which His creatures are going to understand His words. For Ibn2Arabi, God has already witnessed the Koran’s infinite spray of interpre-tive possibilities, has already understood and anticipated how eachone of the multitude is going to respond to His ‘inexhaustible words’.This passage from the Futuhatis an interesting one, if only becauseIbn2Arabi seems to give a different and more complex reason for theinfinite semantic depth of the Koran, one which depends on a kind ofretrospective view by God of all the Koran’s accumulated readings. As ifone were to imagine Shakespeare beginning Macbethalready with aknowledge of the 30,000 critical studies that are going to be writtenabout it.Sages of the book69"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"A sea without a shore: the Koran as example par excellenceof infinite textualityOf course, all this is facilitated by the peculiarly Islamic conception ofthe Book as a container of all things. A little later on in the same sectionof the Futuhatwe read: ‘For the Koran is the shoreless ocean, since Heto whom it is ascribed intends all the meanings demanded by speech –in contrast to the speech of created things’.17In the sixth surah of theKoran the angels tell the Prophet Muhammed We have missed nothing inthe Book(6: 38), a phrase Ibn 2Arabi is fond of quoting, particularly inthe Fusus, where the Koran ‘comprises all that has come to pass and allthat has not come to pass’.18This familiar idea in Islam of the Koran asan ‘all-comprehensive Book’means, for Ibn 2Arabi, that one can literallyfind all things in it. The text of the Koran (a word which in itself comesfrom qu1ran, ‘to gather together’) contains an infinity of images, a sea ofsymbols, a repository of all that is thought and will be thought. TheKoran, to state the obvious, is the nearest metaphor we have to God.This possibility that a text, given the right context, might be able tosay anything– that there exists no single, primary ur-meaning to whichthe text would have to revert – has probably been the most controversialand most misunderstood feature of Derrida’s writing. Derrida’sexchange of words (if one can use the term) with the language philoso-pher John Searle, which produced the essay ‘Signature, Event, Context’,goes some way to showing why Derrida feels ‘the value of literal, propermeaningappears more problematical than ever’:19To write is to produce a mark that will constitute a kind of machinethat is in turn productive, that my future disappearance in principlewill not prevent from functioning and from yielding, and yieldingitself to, reading and re-writing.20In a sense, Derrida extends what Ibn 2Arabi has said about the Koranto every book: no text has a single, ‘proper’ meaning, but rather an infi-nite possibility of imminent ones, an ever-present capacity to be read andre-read in radically different ways. Whilst acknowledging that contextsenable meaning, Derrida insists they cannot control it – the text mustforever carry with it ‘the structural possibility of being severed from itsreferent or signified’(p. 318). Unlike Ibn 2Arabi’s God, we cannot antic-ipate how our texts will be read, nor can we control the hermeneuticalcircumstances in which they will be encountered. Authors scribblemarks onto squares of paper, without really knowing where or by whomor according to what code they will be deciphered.70Sages of the book"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"What constitutes the essential difference between these two versionsof the text as ‘meaning machine’ is the way Ibn 2Arabi continues to seethe Koran as an infinite, never-to-be-depleted reservoir of meanings.There is a notion of ‘fullness’ here (Derrida’s favourite word for this is‘plenitude’) which is ultimately alien to the deconstructive text, particu-larly given the repeated warnings in his work against confusing‘dissemination’ with ‘polysemeia’. The Derridean text, essentiallyparasitic, is not infinitely rich but infinitely poor – far from being an‘inexhaustible’storehouse of treasures like the Koran, it draws its wealthfrom its surroundings, having nothing of its own to offer:The phantom, the phantasm, the simulacrum of living discourse isnot inanimate; it is not insignificant; it simply signifies little, andalways the same thing. This signifier of little, this discourse thatdoesn’t amount to much, is like all ghosts: errant. It rolls this wayand that, like someone who has lost his way...like someone whohas lost his rights, an outlaw, a pervert, a bad seed, a vagrant, anadventurer, a bum. Wandering in the streets, he doesn’t even knowwho he is, what his name is...uprooted, anonymous, unattached toany house or country, this almost insignificant signifier is at every-one’s disposal, can be picked up by both the competent and theincompetent, by those who...knowing nothing about it, can inflictall manner of impertinence upon it.21Although we have two parallel examples of texts which can mean allthings, Derrida’s wandering signs, ‘at everyone’s disposal’, are infinitelyflexible because of a certain amnesia. Their semantic flexibility stemsfrom this very loss of identity. Which, in turn, provides anotherimportant point: if texts for Derrida threaten to disrupt unity, for Ibn2Arabi they serve to expressit. The anarchic nature of the deconstructivetext (‘errant’, ‘pervert’, ‘outlaw’, ‘adventurer’, ‘uprooted, anonymous,unattached to any house or country’) eludes contexts, undermines sys-tems, ‘endlessly opens up a snag’;22even the most disparate inter-pretations of the Koran, however, ultimately reinforce the unity andall-comprehensiveness of the Book – they teach us to see ‘the details inthe whole...as part of the whole’.23Ibn 2Arabi’s insistence that the Bookshould ‘stand up’ after being read is the best illumination of the statusthe Shaykh gives to the Koran:...others lift up the Book from its bed, since interpretation on thepart of the learned (2ulama) has made the Book lie down after it hadSages of the book71"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"been standing. The person to whom God has given success comesand makes the Book stand up after it had been lying down. In otherwords, he declares it incomparable with his own interpretation...24In other words, each time the Koran has been ‘used’ (‘laid down’ issynonymous here with being read and understood), it has to be placedupright again – to assert the fact of its semantic inexhaustibility.Surprisingly, Ibn 2Arabi goes farther than this: by attributing the wordtanzih(incomparable) to the Koran, the Shaykh is not merely describinghow we can never finish interpreting the Koran, but goes on to makea slightly different point – that none of our interpretations actually haveanything to do with the holy word. The Koran is a book about which wecan know nothing – an infinitely well-kept secret that turns all ourattempts at interpretation into a series of hopeless guesses.If Habermas attributed to deconstruction a fascination with the‘absolute readability’of the text, then perhaps the Shaykh can be creditedwith practising the absolute unreadability of the text. By extending theword tanzihto the Koran, Ibn 2Arabi is almost suggesting the text itself isnever touched; it goes on, forever producing meanings without everrevealing itself, in the same way the Real (al-haqq) is the ineffable sourceof all manifestations without ever actually manifesting Itself. It brings tomind another example of a hidden text which remains forever ‘incompa-rable’ with all its interpretations – this time from Meister Eckhart:...there is none so wise that when he tries to fathom it, he will notfind it deeper yet and discover more in it. Whatever we may hear,and whatever anyone can tell us, contains another hidden sense....vnnd es ist auch niemant so weyss, der sy gründen woll, er fyndesy tieffer vnnd fynde mer darinn. Alles, das wir hie horen mogen,vnnd alles, das man vns gesagen mag, das hat alles eynen anderen,verborgenen synn darinn.25For Eckhart even the most learned man will never get to the bottom ofthe scriptures; something will always elude him. It is a situation analo-gous to the defining of God, who – like Eckhart’s idea of scriptural inter-pretation – is without end, Ab-grund. Like Ibn 2Arabi, Eckhart uses thefamiliar motif of the Sacred Scriptures as a sea (a metaphor which stemsback to at least Origen).26Where Ibn 2Arabi goes further is to extendthe Koranic reminder of God’s utter unthinkability (No thing is like Him42: 11) to the Koran itself. It is a gesture which, in one sense, moves theHoly text for Ibn 2Arabi away from the idea of a bottomless treasure-chestand nearer towards a different kind of metaphor – a one-way radio,72Sages of the book"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"perhaps, where the Author would ‘switch on’the comprehensibility of thetext whenever He wished to communicate something to His otherwisepuzzled reader, and then just as abruptly ‘switch off’ the legibility of thetext once the message had been delivered.Viewed in a contemporary light, another feature of Ibn 2Arabi’shermeneutics which appears to echo certain deconstructive gestures isthe strikingly similar way in which the Shaykh talks about God, thePerfect Man (al-insan al-kamil) and the Koran – essentially performingwhat could be described, in more modern terms, as a collapsing of thedistinction between author, text and reader. In both the Fususand theFutuhat, Ibn 2Arabi talks about these three separate ideas using similarterms and attributes; for example, the metaphor of ‘shoreless sea’ isattributed both to the soul (‘The soul is an ocean without a shore’27) andto the Koran (‘For the Koran is the shoreless ocean...’28). The relatedidea that God/Man/the Koran is the possessor of an infinity of things canbe found repeated throughout both works:God possesses relationships, faces and realities without limit....the Tremendous Koran...the tremendous totality that hasbeen brought together (majmu1) comprising all things.In the same way, all the infinite objects of knowledge that Godknows are within man...through this type of nearness.29What we have is a situation where both the Perfect Man and theTremendous Book offer themselves up as microcosms of God, miniatureversions of all-encompassing infinity mirroring the limitless ocean ofimages which is God.30In order to understand how this ‘collapses’ dis-tinctions between author, text and reader in Ibn 2Arabi, one has toremember the controversial nature of the relationship between God andthe soul in the Shaykh’s writings – ‘controversial’ because no-one canagree how far Ibn 2Arabi goes in his assertion of the essential divinity ofthe self (‘He prevented the real secret from being known, namely that Heis the essential Self of things’31). The secret of the self would be its priv-ileged relationship with God – the clandestine fact that is in reality partof God, hence the saying ‘He who knows his self, knows his Lord.’Of course, many modern critics have already re-interpreted the mys-tical self-annihilation of the soul within the nothingness of God as aneffective and very contemporary deconstruction of selfhood (see mostrecently Denys Turner’s version of St John of the Cross).32What is ofinterest here, however, are the hermeneutical consequences of Ibn2Arabi’s views on God and the soul – how they alter and effect the activ-ity of interpretation. If the reader of the Koran is, in some elusive way,Sages of the book73"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"related or even a part of the Author of the text s/he is reading, then atraditional understanding of the author/reader relationship as the trans-ferral of information from one separate entity to another is no longerapplicable. Rather, for the enlightened, to understand something fromthe Koran is to recollect what the Koran has already meant. Probably themost openly Platonic aspect of Ibn 2Arabi’s epistemology, everythingman knows – including that which he has read – is in fact ‘a recollectionand a renewal (tajdid) of what he had forgotten’.33 It would be interest-ing to see how the Shaykh would apply this hermeneutically – whatwould be the resultant metaphor for such an author/reader relationship?If the Author of the Koran really has ‘deposited within man knowledgeof all things’ (ibid.), then interpretation is above all else a bringing tomemory of something dormant, an actualizing of something latentbut already existent. To understand the Koran is to participate in itsexpansion.Affirmative hermeneutics: celebrations of multiple meaningIf multiple meaning is a common feature in Sufi/deconstructivehermeneutics, then so is the essentially positive, affirmative attitudeboth figures share towards it. Neither Derrida nor Ibn 2Arabi seem tohave any problem with the absolute freedom of their texts. Faced withthe fact that every reader finds in their text what they desire, neitherthinker seems to exhibit any fear or anxiety. In Ibn 2Arabi’s case, this isprobably because the Shaykh sees the Koranic generation of interpreta-tions as a movement from batinto zahir, an endless actualizing of theinfinite potential of the Sacred Book. Given the Shaykh’s own under-standing of creation as a continual engendering of existent things out ofnon-existence, it is hardly surprising to find an open, encouragingattitude towards multiple meanings in Ibn 2Arabi’s hermeneutics:The cause of the speed and lastingness of continual change is thatthe Root is such. Hence He gives to engendered existence in accor-dance with the fact that He is ever-creating perpetually because ofthe reality of His level, while engendered existence is poor andneedy perpetually. Hence all existence is perpetually in motion,in this world and the hereafter, since bringing to be does not takeplace from stillness. On God’s part there are perpetual turnings ofattentiveness and inexhaustible words.3474Sages of the book"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Ibn 2Arabi’s Heraclitean view of a world constantly in flux, involvedin perpetual creation, easily finds its microcosmic equivalent in the actof interpretation. As far as the Koran is concerned, ‘the situation is newforever’: yielding different things to different readers, reading the Koranmeans constantly translating the batinof a verse into a zahirin someway applicable to one’s own life. Ibn 2Arabi is thoroughly Aristotelian inthis respect (and quite plausibly Avicennian);35he replicates theStagirite’s privileging of actuality overpossibility by introducing‘mercy’ (rahman) into his concept of creation. In an act of gratuitouskindness (imtinan), God ‘relieves’ the possible things from the ‘misery’of non-existence by bringing them into reality – by bestowing uponthem, as Ibn 2Arabi says, ‘the sweet pleasure of existence’.36An inter-preted verse, in this sense, is privileged over an uninterpreted one. Toread and understand the Koran meaningfully is, following this logic, tohave ‘mercy’ upon it.This idea, it should be said, of interpretation as mercifully givinglife to a text is suggested by the pneumatic characteristics of Arabic – astandard feature, as we know, of all Semitic languages. The characters(mhmd) mean nothing until we breathe through them (muhammad), bringing them to life. In a sense, reading each word con-stitutes an interpretation, for each word can be breathed in a number ofdifferent ways, changing the meaning each time. Therefore, the idea thatto read a text is immediately to interpret it finds a very concrete realityin Arabic.If Derrida shares with Ibn 2Arabi a positive affirmation of multipleinterpretation, it is certainly not out of the belief that ‘God is at theroot of every diversity (khilaf)’,37but rather out of a much moreNietzschean affirmation of the absence of the A/author and the irrele-vance of the origin. The work of those interpreters still obsessed withan ‘original meaning’ in the text – which would control and determineall subsequent ones – Derrida dismisses as ‘paleonymy’, the pointlessdesire to preserve fossilized meanings: ‘Why should an old name...be retained? Why should the effects of a new meaning...be dampedby memory?’.38Bereft of all but the marks on the page, Derrida hasno time for such nostalgia; his hermeneutics (or anti-hermeneutics)stems precisely from the absence which belies every text. Throughouthis oeuvre, Derrida has employed a range of metaphors to describe this aboriginality of the textual condition – the text as abyss, bottom-less well, orphan, vagrant – without ever lamenting this perpetualadriftness, this constant vulnerability to incessant appropriation, as anSages of the book75"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"undesirable situation:The grapheme, repeating itself in this fashion, thus has neither sitenor natural centre. But did it ever lose them? Is its excentricity adecentering? Can one not affirm the nonreferral to the centre, ratherthan bemoan the absence of the centre?39It is not difficult to see how, within Derrida’s work on interpretation,there moves a much keener, almost existentialist emphasis on the demiseof that which would guide us – Derrida is challenging us to readtexts without worrying about what their authors are trying to say to us.Whereas for Ibn 2Arabi it is infinite presencewhich causes the textto multiply and proliferate – the infinite presence of God in all interpre-tations – for Derrida it is an infinite absence which gives the text itsfreedom, ‘the infinite absence which founds it’(l1inepuisable...absencede fond).40Infinite presence/infinite absence: how far can the word ‘infinity’, intheir respective French and Arabic, be said to link these two radicallydifferent vocabularies? To what extent do these two words constitute abridge between the deconstructive ‘bottomlessness of infinite redou-bling’ (redoublement infini)41and the ‘shoreless ocean’ of the Koran?Are they really the same word at all? And most importantly: When, interms of the text, does the ungraspability of the mind of God begin tomean the same as His absence? If both the infinitizing of the divineintent and the removal of it result in the same hermeneutical freedom,should one bother retaining the distinction at all?Rabbis and poetsOne of the difficulties in answering this question lies with the remark-able variety in tone and style of Derrida’s writings, a diversity whichcomplicates any neat, simplistic comparison of something called‘Derrida’ or ‘deconstruction’ with another writer. Derrida’s two mostimportant essays on the act of interpretation – ‘Edmond Jabès and theQuestion of the Book’ (1964) and ‘Signature, Event, Context’ (1971) –are a case in point. Whereas the Derrida of ‘Edmond Jabès’ seems to bemaking use of a tradition going back to Abraham Abulafia, Isaac Luriaand Rabbi Moses de Leon, the latter essay seems to be nearer, both inform and content, to Wittgenstein, Austin and Wisdom. The Kabbalisticprofusion of metaphors (city, forest, desert, the Book, the letter) we find76Sages of the book"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"in ‘Jabès’ are distinctly absent in Derrida’s essentially technical reply toSearle. Even though the two essays make similar points – that theabsence of the author is a fundamental condition of interpretation, thatthere is something ineluctably, incurablyunstable about the text, that weshould not hope to try and control meaning – these points are made instrikingly different languages. If Derrida’s essay on Jabès is scatteredwith rabbinical comments, turning it more into a piece of midrash thana work of criticism, the only rabbi quoted in ‘Signature’ is J. J. Austin.If, in ‘Jabès’, we learn that ‘God separated himself from himself in orderto let us speak...He did so not by speaking but by keeping still, by let-ting his silence interrupt his voice’,42in ‘Signature’ the idea is phrasedsomewhat differently: ‘The absence of the sender, the addresser, fromthe marks that he abandons, which are cut off from him and continue toproduce effects beyond his presence...belongs to the structure of allwriting’.43The peregrinary nature of écriture embedded in a phrase suchas ‘Writing is the moment of the desert as the moment of Separation’44is re-presented in ‘Signature’ as an ‘essential drifting, due to writing asan iterative structure cut off from all absolute responsibility’.45In otherwords, essentially similar ideas find themselves expressed in two differ-ent vocabularies – in the metaphor-clustered, theological language of therabbinical commentary tradition which Derrida quite openly imitates/parodies in his essay on Jabès (even to the point of calling himself ‘RebDerissa’46), and in the cleaner, more precise terminology of the OxfordSchool (Austin, Ryle, etc.), with its emphasis on clear-cut examples andclarity of expression.Exactly which language Derrida feels most comfortable in is anyone’sguess. Enough people have already tried to place Derrida within various,carefully pre-arranged Socratic/Semitic boxes, most recently JohnCaputo with a version of deconstruction ‘more prophetic than apophatic,more in touch with Jewish prophets than with Christian Neoplatonists’.47There are obvious risks in all of this – the kinds of risks one always takesin offering religious interpretations of avowedly secular thinkers –although Thomas Altizer has probably been the most adept at emphasiz-ing the ‘Jewish theological thinker’48in Derrida without overlooking theunignorable role which emptiness and nothingness plays in his work. Inan essay called ‘History As Apocalypse’, Altizer equated the decon-structive removal of a text’s origins with the zim-zum, the Kabbalisticmoment where Jahweh withdrew into himself in order to make creationpossible. Altizer helps us to understand how, in the essay on Jabès, hedoes to the Torah in religious language what he has already done to thetext in secular terms – in ‘Jabès’, the freedom of the text is actuallySages of the book77"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"God’s gift of silence, God’s decision to withdraw from the scene and letHis creations make up their own minds. In ‘Signature’, the phrase ‘theabsence of the sender’ carries with it no such theological reassurances.The ‘essential drifting’ of the text takes place in a universe bereft of anycentres or points of reference, hidden or not.All of which does not bring us any closer to Ibn 2Arabi, for whatwe have now are threereasons for an infinite text: a text which can sayanything because it has no Author (Derrida), a text which can say any-thing because its Author has relinquished control (Kabbala), and a textwhich can say anything (and ‘mean’ it) because its Author has intendedall of its meanings (Ibn 2Arabi).In essence, the fundamental difference which we are repeatedlyencountering between Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi’s infinite hermeneuticshinges on the question of the message. Built into the very foundation ofthe word ‘hermeneutics’ (whose etymology, remember, comes fromHermes, the messenger-god), the idea of the text as a message sent fromone entity to another to say a single, specific thing accounts for Derrida’sdistaste towards rabbinic/Rousseauistic interpretation – one which (touse Alan Bass’ apt phrase) ‘sees interpretation as an unfortunatelynecessary road back to an original truth’.49In other words, there are twokinds of interpreters – poets and rabbis. The rabbi, forever unaware ofthe ‘disappearance of an exceeded God or an erased man’,50still seeksthe origin, still yearn to recover the meaning, still see the text in essen-tially epistolary terms; as a certainmessage coming from a certainplace. Derrida’s poet, on the other hand, has finally understood the secretabyssality of the text, has finally realized that the sheet of symbols offront of him ‘has neither natural site nor natural centre’(ni lieu ni centrenaturels).51One could even speak here, in the memory of the Frenchexistentialists, of an ‘authentic’ response to the text in Derrida; poeticreadings, in contrast to rabbinical ones, encounter and affirm a certainemptiness in the act of reading. They are unafraid of the absence of aguide.If hermeneutics is to be understood as the attempt to reach the toutautreof a text, then we can understand why Derrida feels ‘a phenome-nology of writing is impossible’52– and why the poet shares noHusserlian desire to reach the ‘foundation’ of a text and thereby estab-lish its ‘true meaning, the authentic and original meaning’ (le sensvéritable...le sens authentique et originel).53The absolute superficial-ity of the text, refuted by the rabbi, is embraced by the poet. Derrida’smost famous words on this choice between the ‘two interpretations ofinterpretation’, towards the end of his essay on Levi-Strauss, clearly78Sages of the book"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"shows there is much more at stake here than attitudes towards texts oranthropological research:There are thus two interpretations of interpretation, of structure, ofsign, of play. The one seeks to decipher, dreams of deciphering atruth or an origin which escapes play and the order of the sign, andwhich lives the necessity of interpretation as an exile. The other,which is no longer turned towards the origin, affirms play and triesto pass beyond man and humanism, the name of man being the nameof that being who...has dreamed of full presence, in reassuringfoundation, the origin and the end of play.54Although Derrida does not actually stipulate which path is the pathto choose, the word-choice he employs to describe each path makesany explicit suggestion unnecessary: the ‘saddened, negative, nostalgic,guilty, Rousseauistic’ understanding of the text as something tobe unlocked or deciphered is presented, in striking comparison, withthe ‘joyous’, ‘Nietzschean’, ‘active’ affirmation of the text, one whichleads notdown the semantic blind-alley of metaphysics but to the‘seminal adventure of the trace’ (ibid.). In other words, Derrida makesa basically Romantic distinction between the dull, penitent, monologicdreariness of the rabbi, which seeks to endplay, and the thrill-seeking,adventurous hermeneutics of the poet, which desires to play on,which never wants to stop playing. Thus rabbis and structural anthropol-ogists do have one thing in common: they see the text as a puzzle, not asan adventure. We must pick up the text and take it back to where itbelongs; we can’t simply keep hold of it and use it for something wildlydifferent.Derrida insists these two ideas of interpretation are ‘absolutely irrec-oncilable’,55and yet what Ibn 2Arabi provides in many ways is a hybridintermediary between these two positions. The Shaykh is, in Derrida’sterms, both a rabbi anda poet. His hermeneutics offer, within a medievalIslamic context, a deconstructive rejection of ‘authentic’ meaning anda thoroughly contemporary freeing of the text, but at the same time stillretain the concept of the author as a Sender who is trying to tell us‘something’. The only difference being that this ‘something’ varies infi-nitely from person to person, from moment to moment, from place toplace. Both thinkers feel texts can mean an endless variety of differentthings to different people, but only Ibn 2Arabi sees ‘meaning’ as essen-tially transitive– in this case as information ‘sent down’to the reader by‘Something’ outside the book.Sages of the book79"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Secular readers may be starting to find all this rather supernatural,although they needn’t. Like Derrida, Ibn 2Arabi simply sees textsmore as opportunities to explore than secrets to decode; a moment of‘opening up’(futuhat) rather than closing down. This can be seen in theway Ibn 2Arabi often links interpretation with metaphors of travel orcrossing: ‘interpretation’, we read in the Fusus, ‘means to pass from theform of what one sees to something beyond it’.56Of course, a thoroughlydeconstructible notion of ‘beyond’ is at work here – as far as interpreta-tion goes, the Shaykh never really problematizes the word ‘meaning’theway Derrida will do, although this is not the point: what is significant isthe way an element of adventure and uncertainty is introduced into boththinkers’ hermeneutics. The text becomes the means to an encounterwith something radically other, even if the location and significance ofthis Other in both thinkers is fundamentally different. This is bestexpressed not in what Ibn 2Arabi says about interpreting the Koran, butin what he says about interpreting dreams. In the Futuhat, he makesuse of the root meaning of the word ‘interpretation’ (ta1bir) – from 2br( ) meaning to cross over or traverse:Reporting (ikhbar) about things is called ‘expression’ (2ibara)and interpreting dreams is called ‘interpretation’(ta1bir). This isbecausethe expresser/interpreter ‘crosses over’ (2ubur) by means of what hesays. In other words, by means of his words he passes (jawaz) fromthe presence (hadra) of his own self to the self of the listener. Hencehe transfers his words from imagination to imagination, since thelistener imagines to the extent of his understanding.57If there is such a thing as the ‘deconstructive moment’ – a moment inthe thinker’s oeuvrewhere s/he realizes that signs can only lead us to moresigns, while ‘meaning’forever remains one semantic step ahead – then Ibn2Arabi, like Rousseau, often comes disturbingly close to this moment with-out ever truly replicating it. In this passage, Ibn 2Arabi sees interpretationas nothing more than a transfer of symbols ‘from imagination to imagina-tion’– from images to images. The Shaykh erases the distinction betweenexpresser and interpreter – between one who produces signs and one whoreads them – by locating both their etymologies in the same root, 2ubur,‘crossing over’. To be involved in language, regardless of whether one isinterpreting or producing it, means already to be separated from it, to crossa certain threshold between self and other. Interpretation is no longer amatter of extraction, but rather a point of embarkation.80Sages of the book"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Derrida, too, is fond of itinerative/peregrinary metaphors in hisdiscourse on écriture, although whether Ibn 2Arabi’s embarkation upon a‘sea without a shore’ constitutes anything more than a convincinglysuperficial resemblance to the Derridean text’s ‘passage through nega-tive excentricity’58– basically the unrepeatable repetition of the sign asit passes from context to context – remains doubtful, however uncannilyanalogous the side effects of textual openness, adventure and multiplemeaning may seem. Of course, the ‘adventurous excess’59is still theresult of a ‘crossing over’; severed from an unrepresentable origin andbereft of any ‘predetermined itinerary’, it has to forge its ‘actual infiniteway through the desolate swamp’ (as Derrida says of Lautréamont’sprefaces), producing ‘the irruptive track...of a path that breaks groundand constructs itself as it goes along’.60One gets the feeling that chance,along with an uncontrollable plurality of contexts, has replaced the Realin Derrida’s non-hermeneutics, providing a non-theological concept ofinfinity to multiply the text in the absence of any Sender. The limitlessmind of God has been replaced with an equally limitless (but very un-transcendental) sea of hermeneutic possibilities; the elasticity of the text,however, remains the same.InconsistenciesTheir books are also different...Those of a philosophical nature invari-ably include both the thesis and the antithesis, the rigorous pro and conof a doctrine.

Moreover, it is only the factofinconsistency which unites Ibn 2Arabi and Derrida – as we shall see, bothSages of the book81"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"these thinkers contradict their own versions of infinitizing hermeneuticsin very different ways.In both cases, certain elements within Derridean/Akbarian scholar-ship have tried to show that this is not the case – that Derrida and Ibn2Arabi’s various dismissals of certain interpretations as ‘wrong’ or‘unsound’in no way causes problems with their own theories of the text.What this final section aims to show, very briefly, is an occasional butunmistakable disparity between what these two thinkers sayabout inter-pretation and how they actually interpret.Although Ibn 2Arabi considers the Koran to be a ‘shoreless ocean’, thisdoes not stop him from dismissing some of its interpretations as ‘corrupt’or ‘far-fetched’(ta1wil, ba1id).62On the one hand, in some parts of theFutuhatIbn 2Arabi is keen to show how we should refrain from labellingcertain interpretations or certain ideas ‘impossible’ (muhal), for nothingcan be declared impossible in the face of God’s tremendousness:How wide is the Presence of Imagination! Within it becomes mani-fest the existence of the impossible thing...63Since imagination possesses such non-delimitation, though it is acreature created by God, what do you think about the Creator whocreated it...? How can you wish to judge that God is delimited andsay that God is not capable of doing the impossible?64Ibn 2Arabi’s target here is the rational thinkers, those who do not relyon ‘divine bestowal’ (wahb) but on their own rational faculties (2aql) toascertain what is and is not valid. In a sense, the passage forms partof Ibn 2Arabi’s long standing argument with the rational thinkers whodismiss any reading of the Koran which does not concur with their owninterpretation as ‘corrupt’(fasad). What Ibn 2Arabi does here is employthe infinity (non-delimitation) of the Creator to undermine any attemptat rational verification – in other words, he abandons notions of possibility/impossibility as meaningful criteria for judging the phenomena of a Godwho lies outside the possible and impossible: ‘So [if the impossible cantake place]where is the judgment of the rational faculty about God andthe corruption of its interpretation?’ (ibid.). If God is truly infinite andcapable of all things, possible and impossible, can we use our finiterational faculties to call any interpretation ‘corrupt’?Nevertheless, Ibn 2Arabi does consider certain interpretations ‘far-fetched’, for two reasons. In some cases, he is suspicious of motive – thecourt scholars who ‘seek high degrees with kings’ and interpret theKoran so as to ‘walk with the personal desires’ of their benefactors.6582Sages of the book"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Others, more importantly, are criticized because they ‘are not moderatebut instead plunge deeply into interpretations such that no correspon-dence (munasaba) remains between the revealed words and the mean-ing’.66Ibn 2Arabi stresses this in several places – there has to be a linkbetween the literal meaning and the interpretation, between the batinandthe zahir, otherwise the interpreter is merely ‘plunging’ without anyrespect for the truth.This insistence on the interpretation remaining in someway faithfuland linkedto the original text is an important point to remember –particularly when one encounters the kind of passages in the Fususwhich scandalized Ibn Tamiyya. What Ibn 2Arabi often displays in theFususis a tendency to re-inscribe popular phrases and stories from theKoran into his own thought-system by imposing radically differentmeanings upon them. Thus, Ibn 2Arabi can take an apparently straight-forward verse like Fear your Lord(4: 1) and interpret it to mean ‘Makeyour outer selves a protection for your Lord, and make your inner [reality],which is your Lord, a protection for your outer selves.’67One can’t helpthinking of Heidegger here, who can take a fragment from the Pre-Socratics such as Anaximander’s ‘Here, too, the gods come to presence’(einai gar kai entautha theos) and reinterpret it to mean a much moreHeideggerian ‘The familiar abode for man is the open region for thepresencing of god’.68It is difficult to see, in either of these examples,where the munasabalies between the original and its interpretation.Even the Augustinian principle of interpretation (only interpret allegor-ically when the sense of the literal is unclear), which Ibn 2Arabi in cer-tain places in the Fususseems to echo,69is violated here by the clarityof the verse chosen.Another feature of Ibn 2Arabi’s hermeneutics which may make readersincredulous towards the Shaykh’s views on ‘far-fetched interpretations’ isthe careful way he includes the physical arrangement of the letters onthe page as part of the meaning to be interpreted. In chapter 17 of the Fusus,for example, Ibn 2Arabi considers the fact that the name David ( )is made up of separate characters, whilst the name Muhammed () is made up of both separate andjoined characters. From thisobservation, the Shaykh informs us that the ‘gift’ of David’s separate-lettered name was intended to ‘cut him off from the world’,70whereasthe name of the Prophet, with its mixture of joined and separate letters,was intended to show how God had simultaneously ‘joined him[Muhammed] to Himself and separated him from the world, so combin-ing in his name both states’ (ibid.). If the Author of the text is Infinityitself, then clearly there can be no room for chance. Every stroke ofSages of the book83"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"every letter, each number of consonants in a stanza or lines on a page,must have a carefully premeditated meaning.As soon as one enters into this Weltanschauung, it’s easier to under-stand why the Shaykh refused to see such exercises as ‘far-fetched’– andmore difficult to see why he felt others to be so. This belief that everyapparent idiosyncrasy present in the text has somehow been divinelypreordained is by no means restricted to letter symbolism; even readinga certain passage in different ways can yield different secrets to thedivinely guided reader. In the Kitâb al-Jalâl, the Shaykh appears to placea peculiar emphasis on self-interruption when reciting a Koranic verse:It is necessary for you to be mindful of the distinctions in the Wordof Allah Most High when you read it. For instance, they reciteWhen they meet those who believeThen a pause, thenthey say ‘We believe’then a pause, the say:and when they are alone with their devils, they saypause; then say‘We are with you; we were only mocking’pause; then sayAllah shall mock. (Baqarah 14–15)If you read it in this fashion, you will become acquainted with itssecrets and distinguish the circumstances of the addresses and thestories of states, sayings, and deeds, and the harmony of things. Soknow that.71To read the Koran in a straightforward fashion is not enough: the infi-nite richness of the Word of Allah yields different meanings when readin different manners – and every single oneof them is intended. The veryunorthodox severing and re-contextualizing, which the Shaykh appliesto this passage, offers up ‘secrets’ that any ‘normal’ reading wouldhave missed. In essence, if the Koran truly is a ‘shoreless ocean’, all ofwhose conceivable meanings are intended by the Author, then theinevitable question follows: can one ever quote an infinite text out ofcontext? Can an ‘all-comprehensive’ Book ever be misquoted?If Ibn 2Arabi does dismiss some interpretations as ‘far-fetched’, it iscertainly not because the culprits have ‘quoted out of context’. As wehave seen, Ibn 2Arabi’s objections to such peers are based on either theirinsincerity or an unwillingness to keep hold of the ‘literal sense’ (zahir)as they move onto its inner meaning (batin). This all leads William84Sages of the book"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Chittick, easily one of the most competent and outstanding scholarsin Ibn 2Arabi criticism, to write that ‘Ibn 2Arabi displays tremendousreverence for the literal text’.72Ibn 2Arabi’s hermeneutics abandon, weare told, ‘whatever contradicts the literal sense of the Koran and theHadith’.73If such assertions have to be rejected, this is not because ofany lacunaein Chittick’s scholarship, but simply because the words ‘lit-eral sense’ in Ibn 2Arabi do not possess any real meaning. If the authorof the Fususcan read a text which appears to condemn the Pharaoh andrespond with a text which praises him – whilst keeping to the letter ofthe verse – then an extraordinary notion of ‘reverence for the literal text’must be at work. If Ibn 2Arabi can carefully reinterpret a surahso thatthe idolaters become saints and Noah misguided, then it is difficult tosee what Ibn 2Arabi himself has in mind when he insists on there beinga munasabaor link between text and interpretation. In either case, anentirely new notion of ‘literality’ has to be constructed in order tosupport Professor Chittick’s assertions.Of course, a similar tale of disparity between theory and practicecould be told about Derrida – if such a tale had not already beenembarked upon hundreds of times by the ‘officials of anti-deconstruction’(as Derrida calls them),74all of them eager to locate some logocentricblind spot in Derrida’s own work and catch the master at his own game.Suffice to say Derrida has always been articulately aware of the risks inwriting within language about the instability of language – an aware-ness, however, which has not prevented him from occasionally revealinga telling sense of ownership over his own texts, particularly whenresisting unwanted appropriations of them by others. Apart from being‘disagreeably surprised’ at the fortunes of the word ‘deconstruction’(indicating a mild displeasure at some of the American uses of his work),Derrida’s portrayal of the wandering text has been slightly underminedby his own rather defensive attempts to have his work read in some waysrather than others. This has especially been the case in response to thevarious theological comparisons with his work – readings which attemptto link différance with ‘the God of negative theology’, much to theauthor’s chagrin. Derrida has spent at least three separate essays explain-ing why he is neither a Rhineland mystic nor the founder of some secretsociety. Given Derrida’s own remarks on the efforts of Freud to keep hisfollowers in line, it’s difficult not to observe Derrida’s own manoeuvreswithout a sense of irony.In the well-documented debate concerning deconstruction and nega-tive theology, Derrida has not only refused to accept interpretations ofhis own work that associate it with apophatic theology, but has alsoSages of the book85"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"rejected readings of Pseudo-Dionysius and Meister Eckhart whichsuggest a precedent for deconstruction. The main reason for this, saysDerrida, is a notion of ‘purity’ in the writings of these mystics – an‘experience’ which ‘does not allow [them] to say just anything’ (ne pasla laisser dire n1importe quoi).75The presence in such apophatic writingof a ‘hyperessentiality’ (suressentialité) means that their texts willalways have ‘something’ to say, a certain direction to travel in, a certain‘pure’ reading to safeguard. In implicit contrast with Derrida’s writings,they are not truly free.One could say, however, that it is a desire for purity which Derridahimself displays in his attempt to disassociate deconstruction from the‘locutions, detours and syntax’of negative theology.76In a passage from‘Post-Scriptum’ which relates how negative theology fulfils ‘the philo-sophical or ontotheological promise it seems to break’ (la promessephilosophique ou onto-théologique qu’elle paraît renier),77Derridawrites:Conversely, I trust, no text that is not [negative theology] is some-way contaminatedwith negative theology, and even among thosetexts that apparently do not have, want or believe they have anyrelation with theology in general. (italics mine)Inversement, je n1en crois aucun qui ne soit en riencontaminéde théologie négative, et même parmi ceux qui apparemment n1ont,ne veulent ou ne croient avoir aucun rapport avec la théologie engénéral.Derrida’s point is this: if negative theology insists that one can onlyknow what God is through what He is not, then all discourse – eventhat which claims not to have ‘any relation with theology in general’ –potentially becomes a statement about God. What is of interest to ushere, however, is how the word ‘contaminated’ becomes involved in thispotential ontotheological re-appropriation of all discourse. Derrida’sreference to ‘those texts that apparently do not...want...any relationwith theology in general’ presumably includes his own writings –writings which attempt to enact a critique of onto-theology, yet never-theless remain ‘someway contaminated with negative theology’. Why‘contaminated’? one feels forced to ask. Is this because the ‘purity’ ofthe deconstructive project must be maintained? And not be infiltrated(and possibly hijacked) by negative theology?Such questions, no doubt, lead us onto the familiar and somewhatexhausted issue of the status of deconstruction. The point, however,86Sages of the book"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"is not to resurrect once more the contours and conclusions of analready well-documented debate (Gasché/Rorty/Norris et al.), butsimply to highlight how even Derrida cannot escape a notion of‘purity’ and ‘contamination’. In his desire to keep an ‘infinite distance’between his own writings and those of negative theology (and others),he has to preserve the ‘purity’ of his own discourse, of différance,and keep it free from any form of metaphysical ‘contamination’.Which, for Derrida, inevitably involves the problematic task of decid-ing which interpretations of his work are ‘correct’ and which are ‘far-fetched’.Near the beginning of his famous essay on translation, Benjaminponders the status of a text no-one has ever read or will ever read – andwhether one can still say such a text meanssomething:One might, for example, speak of an unforgettable life or momenteven if all men had forgotten it. If the nature of such a life ormoment required that it be unforgotten, that predicate would notimply a falsehood but merely a claim not fulfilled by men [eineForderung, der Menschen nicht entsprechen], and probably also areference to a realm in which it isfulfilled: God’s remembrance.Analogously, the translatability of linguistic creations [die Überset-zbarkeit sprachlicher Gebilde] ought to be considered even if menshould prove unable to translate them.78It is a passage which adds a strange, murky tone to Benjamin’s essay,with its Zen-like echoes of the unobserved leaf which may or may nothave fallen to the ground. What Benjamin essentially does (as DeManhas pointed out)79is raise the possibility of language’s inhumanity. Thepossibility that language may be something quite independent from man –neither pertaining to him as an origin nor reliant upon him as a destina-tion. The reader, Benjamin seems to be saying, may well be irrelevant tothe text.This idea of the unreachable solitude of the text, a silent inner worldglimpsed by no-one or -thing, retains enough ambiguity to appeal toboth the divine and the secular. On the one hand, Benjamin haunts uswith the possibility of a text which truly has a life of its own, driftingthrough a void, unread, unseen, perfectly indifferent; on the other, he intro-duces a God (perhaps to reassure us) much in the manner of Berkeley’sCreator, the closure of whose eyelids would annihilate the world. A Godwhose ‘remembrance’ would safeguard the meaning of a text even if nohuman gaze were ever to cross it.Sages of the book87"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Of course, Zorn has translated Gebildeas ‘creations’, whereas ‘images’would probably have been a more accurate – and less theological – word-choice. Nevertheless, I have chosen to end with Benjamin becausethe idea he espouses applies to both the subjects in our study. In a way,Ibn 2Arabi’s kitaband Derrida’s textefind their place on either side ofthis strange passage, linked by a mutual awareness of the utter inde-pendence of their texts, but separated by a different understanding ofwhynobody can control them.In Derrida, no-one is watching. Whereas the all-seeing gaze of itsAuthor forever monitors the activity of Koranic interpretation, keen todiscern who is reading correctly and who is not (this profoundly ethicalaspect of interpretation will always be a distinguishing feature), inDerrida there is no-one to care how you read. Not even an author. Infi-nity swirls around both these versions of the infinite text, staggering/fissuring/reflecting them beyond count, but whereas for Derrida this is apeculiarly earthlyinfinity (‘...the accident or throw of dice...’,80)dependant on an endlessly fortuitous series of chance encounters andvagrant appropriations, for Ibn 2Arabi something always remains ‘in con-trol’ of the text’s infinity. If Derrida’s reader paternally adopts the text,rears it, nurtures it until it becomes similar to the reader, then Ibn2Arabi’s scholar is engulfed by the text. In this difference lies a definitequestion of magnitude: to interpret the Koran is to humbly add one moreresponse to an infinite storehouse of readings, to modestly provide onemore variant on something inexhaustibly original. For Derrida, to read atext is to change it, to make it utterly special to oneself, to commandeerthe text until it becomes an intimate part of the reader. The thought ofthe original, along with the presence of other interpretations, somehowloses importance as an event...it serves, like Ibn 2Arabi’s Koran, as the‘nonrepresentable origin of representation’, forever giving rise to inter-pretation whilst somehow remaining tout autrethroughout. This idea ofthe utterly unreachable text seems to mean more to Ibn 2Arabi than itdoes to Derrida. The Shaykh refers constantly to his original in order tosay what he wants to say, whereas Derrida seems to consider l1origine dutexteas an important but ultimately inaccessible memory – akin to thoseof early childhood, significant and effective in every moment but never-theless hopelessly lost to the past.88Sages of the book"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"4 Mystery-tasting and abyssalityThe secret in Ibn 2Arabi and DerridaThe goals we pursue are always veiled.

Robbe-Grillet writes ‘of having found a locked drawer, then a key; and this keyopens the drawer quite impeccably...and the drawer is empty’.3InUmberto Eco’s Il Pendolo di Foucault, a group of young academics con-struct a bizarre conspiracy theory out of Templar lore, Freemasonry,Egyptian pyramids and numerology, attracting unwanted attention froma variety of dangerous parties as they do so. When the unfortunate Belbois finally trapped by a motley collection of cultists, masons andCrowleyesque aesthetes, he refuses to give them the ultimate secret –that there is no secret, that their entire research has been an elaborateacademic hoax – and pays for his silence with an unpleasant death.

Stratagems which remind us of the impor-tant theological consequences of an all-too familiar trick: a secret doesnot have to be ‘real’ in order to exert its power.In examining the place of the secret in Derrida’s thought, perhaps weshould begin by saying what everyone else has said about the Derrideansecret – that it is a non-secret, an illusion, a semantic surface foreverkidding us with a promise of depth. Beneath all sign-systems, writesCarl Raschke, ‘is buried the “secret” of all traditions of structured dis-course – that they signify nothing’.4Morny Joy speaks of a Derridawhose ‘disclosure is the absence of any presence – of any secret’.5‘TheBuddha emphasized that he had no secret,’ insists David Loy,wryly alluding to Derrida, ‘although that did not stop later generationsattributing one to him’.6Perhaps Mark C.Taylor puts it most directly of all:Since the ‘genesis of secrecy’is always missing, there is nothing to tell.I repeat: There is nothingto tell. The secret is that there is no secret.790Mystery-tasting and abyssality"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"And, just in case someone out there stillhasn’t got the point,John D.

The disclosure of a secret would be the endof meaning. Nothing more could be said.The questions, however, still remain: what exactly is Derrida’s attitudetowards the secret? How does he understand their genesis, their propa-gation, their (ab)uses? Would the world be a better place without them?And what part does deconstruction play in all this talk of le secret– adismantler of enigmas or a primordial source of them? To what extent is‘deconstruction’ really a synonym for ‘demystification’?It is no exaggeration to suggest that the secret, more than any othersingle motif, dominates the length and breadth of the Derridean oeuvre.Partly because the ‘secret’ has been used so often as the standardmetaphor for the meaning of a literary text; partly because of its indeli-bly religious significance (the secret name of YHWH which no-one maypronounce, the secret face of God which no man may see and live, thesecret hour of the Last Day, etc.); partly because of Derrida’s own play-ful appropriation of the secret, at times self-ironizing, at times utterlyserious (in ‘La Différance’, for example, where Derrida can speak of‘the very enigma of difference’, only to declare eight pages on that ‘thereis nothing kerygmatic about this “word”’).9Thus, in essays such as‘Post-Scriptum’ and ‘How to Avoid Speaking’, Derrida examines therole of the secret – the ‘topolitology of the secret’– in negative theology,re-affirming his familiar claim that the secret of the negative theologiansis, in the end, the very onto-theological God they claim to rid themselvesof.

A cluster of them best conveys their diversity:There is no secret as such; I deny it. And this is what I confide insecret to whomever allies himself to me.(‘How to Avoid Speaking: Denials’)Non-presence, the gaping void of desire, and presence, the fullnessof enjoyment, amount to the same. By the same token, there isno longer any textual difference between the image and the thing,the empty signifier and the full signified, the imitator and theimitated, etc.(Dissemination)I have forgotten my umbrellais a statement at once hermetic andtotally open, as secret and superficial as the postcard apocalypse itannounces and protects against.(‘Of A Newly Adopted Apocalyptic Tone’)But if, without liking literature in general and for its own sake, I likesomething about it...this would be in place of the secret. In placeof an absolute secret. There would be the passion. There is nopassion without secret, this very secret, indeed no secret withoutthis passion.(‘Passions: An Oblique Offering’)I refer first of all to the secret shared within itself, its partition‘proper’, which divides the essence of a secret that cannot evenappear to one alone except in starting to be lost...(‘How to Avoid Speaking: Denials’)92Mystery-tasting and abyssality"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Here there is no longer any depth of meaning.(Dissemination)10A number of points need to be drawn from these. Firstly, the secret foreverrecedes, it is always already lost. If the secret is ‘that in speech which isforeign to speech’,11then divulging the secret only pushes it further away,like Augustine’s God (‘Whatever we say about God is not true, and what-ever we do not say about Him is true’).Talking about the secret only servesto defer it – it remains forever ‘on the other side’ of whatever noises ormarks we try to make about it. Secondly, there is no difference betweenthe secret and the non-secret. For Derrida, there are no ‘full’ or ‘empty’signifiers, no texts which are somehow ‘deeper’ than others, no marks orcharacters which are more intrinsicallysignificant than others. The by-now famous remark at the end of Nietzsche’s notebooks – I have forgottenmy umbrella– illustrates the perfectly dual status of the kerygmatic, acapacity for the ordinary to conceal the extraordinary (and vice versa)which readers of Kafka and Pinter have long been familiar with. Anything,potentially, could be a secret – every signifier could, potentially, signifysomething radically other than its habitual signified. Thirdly, the illusionof secrecy is analogous to the illusion of depth – which is where we beginto move closer to the theological resonance of Derrida’s remarks upon thesecret. It brings to mind a passage from Tillich:The Name of this inexhaustible depth and ground of all being is God.That depth is what the word means....For if you know that Godmeans depth, you know much about Him. You cannot then call your-self an atheist or an unbeliever, for you cannot think or say: Life hasno depth. Life is shallow. Being itself is surface only. If you could saythis in complete seriousness, you would be an atheist, but otherwiseyou are not. He who knows about depth knows about God.12For Derrida, one can’t help feeling that ‘depth’, sooner or later, alwaysgets associated with ‘divinity’. Insofar as all secrets require a knower –and possibly even a Knower – Derrida’s denial of textual depth consti-tutes the denial of anyone or thing ‘out there’ who might have the LastWord, hermeneutically, on the meaning of a text. For the medievalexegete, poring over the uncial letters of God’s Holy Word, there wasalways a divine mind who had understood something – who wouldalwaysunderstand something – the reader had not. Regardless ofwhether we are talking about the scholastic rigours of Dominicanexegesis, the mystical ta 1wilof Islamic hermeneutics, or the midrashof theMystery-tasting and abyssality93"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Jewish commentary tradition, the idea that the Ineffable Author is on the‘inside’ – whilst we, humble readers, linger forever on the ‘outside’13–remains essentially the same. The Derridean synonymy of ‘secrecy’ and‘surface’ effectively erases this distinction between ‘insider’ and ‘out-sider’. A phalanx of scribbled symbols on a sheet of parchment – c1esttout. In deconstructive hermeneutics nothing is hidden notbecause thereis nothing to hide, but rather because there is No-one to hide it.Whether all this amounts to a ‘demystification’ of metaphysics in theEnlightenment fashion, the kind of Weberesque Entzauberungwhichreplaces the mysterious cause with the visible, remains debatable – asDerrida has clearly commented elsewhere. In ‘Of an Apocalyptic Tone’heis searching for a possible ‘limit of demystification’, one which ‘would(perhaps) distinguish deconstruction from a simple, progressive demysti-fication in the style of the Enlightenment’.14There are certainly momentselsewhere in Derrida where ‘deconstruct’ and ‘demystify’ appear to besynonymous in their early stages, even if they ultimately concern two rad-ically different kinds of analysis (literally from analyein, to loosen oruntie). What this chapter suggests is that deconstruction is simultaneouslya work of both demystificationand remystification– it locates and dis-solves the moments of self-presence in a text only to leave in their place asemantic void, one which liberates the text from its single destination andallows it to drift, rudderless, in an infinite number of directions.What doesmake deconstructive demystification so different from itsrational counterparts? ‘There is no unfathomable mystery in the world’Moritz Schlick, the Vienna positivist, famously said. For logical posi-tivists like Ayer and Carnap, the mysteries and enigmas of everyday lifewere simply ‘bad’ uses of language – the result of using ‘nonsense’,unclear metaphysical propositions. As soon as we stopped asking thewrong questions and began to use correct, verifiable assertions, the so-called ‘mystery’ (for logical positivists a word always synonymouswith ‘problem’) would vanish of its own accord. It is difficult to see howsuch a project of clarification can be attributed to deconstruction. ‘Tomake enigmatic what one thinks one understands by the words “proxim-ity”, “immediacy”, “presence”’ wrote Derrida in Of Grammatology, ‘ismy final intention in this book’.15If Derrida rids the text of its mysteri-ous secret – the sensus spiritualiswhich lies buried like hidden treasurebeneath the page – this does not mean he wishes to replace it with oneof his own. What distinguishes deconstructive demystification from allthe other Enlightenment versions of mystery-murder is precisely thiscalling into question of the desire to explicate. For deconstruction, to‘explain’ is simply to produce another set of signs to describe the first.Solving a secret simply means producing another one. ‘From the94Mystery-tasting and abyssality"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"moment there is meaning, there is nothing but signs.’16The belief thatthere exists a secret whose meaning, once unlocked and lifted out of itsprecious casket, would somehow unambiguously enlighten everyoneconcerned without ever having to use a sign itself – this is surely thenaïve dream of structuralism which Derrida so happily takes apart inessays such as ‘Force and Signification’. Meaning, like the secret, enjoysa certain semantic inexhaustibility – there is no end to either of them.‘To make enigmatic...’. It is a curious phrase of Derrida’s, particularlywhen one bears in mind the kind of clarifying/explicating versions ofDerrida offered by critics like Gasché, who see the theorist as a one whoresolves ‘inconsistencies’ in philosophical systems and their exposition.17‘To make enigmatic...’Does this mean that deconstruction brings anenigma to the text? After all our talk of demystification, does deconstruc-tion turn texts into secrets once more? Does it restore a kind of Ur-secretto the text as the originary condition of literature? Perhaps...but if decon-struction doesattribute a secret to the text, it is a ‘secret de Polichinelle’,a secret for no-one.18If deconstruction doesre-mystify the text and liber-ate it from certain rigid parameters of meaning, it is not by insisting upona secret, transcendentally hidden interpretation of the text, but rather byrestoring an originary darkness (from ainigma, lit. ‘to darken’) to the illu-sion of clarity. A darkness that no amount of lumiéreor Aufklärungcanever completely dispel. A darkness in which nothing is hidden.In what does this enigma – this darkness – consist of? It is the dark-ness of the abyss – a word (l1abîme) which seems to recur often inDerrida, usually in the context of the futility of representational thought,the hollowness of the sign which forever empties itself, the abyssality ofthe signifying chain which can only ever pass on the message withoutever understanding its ‘meaning’:Once it [the centre] lends itself a single time to such a representa-tion – that is to say, once it is written – ...it is the abyss, is thebottomlessness of infinite redoubling.(‘Ellipsis’ in Writing and Difference)The labyrinth, here is an abyss: we plunge into the horizontality ofa pure surface...(ibid.)Representation in the abyssof presence is not an accident ofpresence; the desire of presence is, on the contrary, born from theabyss (the indefinite multiplication) of representation...(Of Grammatology)Mystery-tasting and abyssality95"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"...historicity remains a secret.

Ex nihilio nihil fit: nothingness as the sourceof meaning. The nothingness, the semantic void at the heart of the textenables all its various counter-texts, sub-texts, con-texts to proliferate ina ‘bottomlessness of infinite redoubling’. It is the abyss beneath thetext – the absence of any supernatural, extra-textual presence that mightcontrol it – which enables its meanings to shimmer and multiply.This removal of the text’s depth, however, does not signify the end ofinterpretation, but merely the end of nostalgia. The secret of the text’s‘pure surface’still permits interpretation to take place, but will dividefuture exegetes into two categories: (i) the uninitiated – those who stillhaven’t realized that the only secret is that there is no secret, the aca-demic detectives who will forever search and scrutinize the signs beforethem in an attempt to recover the Real Meaning, and (ii) the enlightened –those who will have finally understood the millennia-old illusion of exe-gesis but decide to carry on with it anyway, out of habit, passion, fear,obstinacy or simply lack of imagination. For this second category, inter-preting texts from now on will mean reactingto them; bumping intocollections of signs and responding to them with some of their own.

In ‘The Purloined Letter’, an important letter is successfully hid-den from a thorough but unimaginative police chief, who ransacks an apart-ment three times but fails to find it – if only because the thief has decidedto ‘hide’it from the investigators by leaving it openly on the table for all tosee. Far from being concealed in some hidden drawer, the secret envelopeis so obvious and visible to all that no-one guesses its true identity. By itsvery openness, it retains its secrecy. In Poe’s story, the revelation of thehidden has gone unnoticed – no-one is even aware it has taken place.This tale of the extraordinary being mistaken for the ordinary exempli-fies, in many respects, the meaning of the secret in Ibn 2Arabi’s work.It could be said that the only real secret for the Shaykh al-Akhbar is thefact that there is anythingsecret at all. Of course, there are ‘obvious’secrets in Ibn 2Arabi – moments where some form of information is clearlybeing withheld from general knowledge – such as the ‘Mystery ofDestiny’ (sirr al-qadar)21or the ‘Mystery of Premeasurement’;22thesecret plans of God which mortals cannot know. However, the most impor-tant secret of all – what Ibn 2Arabi refers to as the sirr al-sirror ‘secret ofsecrets’23– is a secret so tremendous that, like Poe’s innocuous envelope,it lies right in front of our eyes without any of us ever guessing what it is.Ibn 2Arabi’s secret is so successful that most people (the masses,2amma) are not even aware there is a secret. The sin of idolatry (shirk)offers the clearest example of this. In the Book of Majesty and Beauty(Kitab al-jalal wa-l jamal), Ibn 2Arabi says of the Koranic declaration‘Your god is One God’ (ilahukum ilahun wahidun):It is a statement applying to everything deified and worshipped.This is a secret of Allah’s Divinity. If it were not for what everyworshipper finds in the object of this worship...he would not wor-ship it...[the idol-worshipper] is merely the servant of a particularobject of worship, the secret of whose divinity itself belongs toAllah Most High. That is the soul of His saying:Your god is One GodSo the statement affirms the essential form of a thing rejected inactual practice. People only adopt these [idols] because of the rela-tionship with the divine that they establish by carving them...Sounderstand that: it is a remarkable secret.24Ibn 2Arabi’s point is striking: God is the secret of all idolatry. Even themost profane and secular things we can think of contain this secret,Mystery-tasting and abyssality97"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"tucked away inside, discernible only by those who see God as somethingboth like andunlike creation – someone who has learnt to see with twoeyes, as the Shaykh says. Such a secret is not only ‘remarkable’, it alsocarries with it a tremendous power – the power to completely reverse themeaning of an ayatfrom the Koran, the power to take a practice regardedby most Muslims to be sinful (the Koran abounds with condemnationsof idolatry) and turn it into a form of worship as acceptable and ortho-dox as any evening prayer-call. Of course, even those ‘pagans’ whohaven’t understood the true meaning of their idolatry – the fact that thefire or cow or sun they are worshipping is just one more form of the Realitself – will still ‘end up (ma1al) with mercy’.25The ‘preferable’idolatry,however, is practised only by those who have understood the secret ofGod’s bewildering omnipresence – in such cases, one can no longer callsuch people ‘idolaters’. The idol has become a conscious vehicle ofworship for the gnostic – no longer merely the last laugh of Allah on thewayward and unbelieving, but rather a radical relocation of the holy inthe quotidian and the ‘apparently’ profane:...all sensory and supra-sensory forms are His loci of manifesta-tion. He speaks from every form, but not in every form. He is seenby every eye, He is heard by every hearing, but it is He from whomno speech is heard.26Ibn 2Arabi brings God near to man without compromising His incompa-rability. In deconstructive terms, however, one could be tempted to re-describe this gesture as just another case of semantic deferral. In otherwords, far from radically dismantling the ontotheological exoskeletonwhich the philosophers and the theologians have tried to fix onto God,Ibn 2Arabi simply carries on where the others left off by supplying ‘God’as a signified to every signifier, without ever being able to say what that‘God’ is – precisely the kind of thing Derrida has been saying about thesecret all along.Indeed, one of the problems Derrida has with figures such as Eckhartand Dionysius is this obsession with the secret, with ‘the necessity of thesecret – to be kept, preserved, shared’.27‘Something’(what Eckhart calls‘neizwaz’ or ‘I know not what’) is always held back, kept in reserve, hid-den away – a ‘hyper-truth’(sur-verité) offering Derrida the perfect exam-ple of an anxious logocentrism which uses the excuse of secrecy toconceal the abyss upon which it is built.

He conceals it by otherness, which isyou. Otherness asserts that the hearing is Zaid’s hearing, while thegnostic asserts that it is the Reality Himself...29...no-one knows the path which brings about nearness to God andbestows endless felicity on the servant except him who knows whatis in the Self of the Real.30The secret of the secret: That by which the Real One is isolated fromthe servant.31As we said earlier, the exact nature of this relationship between the souland the Real is shrouded in debate among Ibn 2Arabi scholars32–however, what is important here is how the self becomes the container of amystery, to echo Sahl al-Tustari’s words (‘In Lordship there is a mystery,that mystery being you...’). We ourselves are the carriers of a secret, not‘outside’or in the heavens or beyond the mountains, but buried within ourown breasts is an enigma waiting to be discovered. The secret lies in thefamiliar, in the place where we least expect to look for it – truly heimlichin this sense, both ‘homely’ and ‘mysterious’.If, etymologically, the condition of holiness (quddus) is understood tobe separation, then Ibn 2Arabi’s teachings on the secret would ultimatelymean an end to any notion of the sacred. For the Shaykh, understandingthe secret does not mean to acquire a new, unfamiliar piece of knowledgesuch as a password or a certain gesture, but rather to see how things havealways been. To rediscover in oneself (and here we return to Ibn 2Arabi’sessential Platonism) a primordial bond of some kind with the Real, arelationship which has always been existent with God – an ‘actual situa-tion’. The secret, one could say, is a forgotten memory; entering intothe mystery simply means recollecting what one has always been.

The mystic does not becomeGod, for there is nobecomingin Ibnul1Arabi’s theory, he isessentially one with God in the senseeverything else is.33Given the fact that the central aim of Affifi’s study is to portrayIbn2Arabi as a ‘thoroughgoing pantheist’, one could dismiss this surmiseof the Great Shaykh’s relation to God on the basis of everything elseAffifi has said. Nevertheless, it is difficult not to receive this impressionfrom certain parts of the Fusus– especially the tenth chapter on Hud,where ‘otherness’is understood as an illusion, constructed by God, to hidethe true nature of the soul’s divinity from itself. This all creates problemsfor Ibn 2Arabi scholars, for Ibn 2Arabi in some places stresses the inde-pendence of God and in others seems to present Him as somehowdependent on His creatures. Ibn 2Arabi’s most memorable expression ofthis is in the fifth chapter on Ibrahim in the Fusus Al-Hikam:Where then is His Self-sufficiency,Since I help Him and grant Him Bliss?It is for this that the Real created me,For I give content to His knowledge and manifest Him.34This denial of self-sufficiency to God causes some problems, as ear-lier in the FususIbn 2Arabi had isolated precisely this quality as ‘anincurable factor of distinction’ between God and the soul. God createsus, while ‘He is free of all dependence whatsoever’.35And so, on the onehand we have a ‘careful’ Ibn 2Arabi who cautiously attributes all thequalities of God to the soul except for that of maintaining existence; andon the other hand a more audacious version presents us with a soul thatnot only gives its Maker happiness and Self-knowledge but also enablesHim to exist. One could remedy this by saying that the God of the firstversion is exclusively the Real (al-haqq), whilst the God of the secondversion which the soul supports and keeps in Being is merely the‘God of belief’. However, parts of the Futuhatseem to suggest that thesoul genuinely could become one with the Real in substantiaandnot simply in grace. In speaking of the spiritually advanced who ‘haveno station’ (la maqam) Ibn 2Arabi calls such believers ‘the divine ones (al-ilahiyyun), since the Real is identical with them’.36This seems to100Mystery-tasting and abyssality"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"move fairly close to Eckhart’s substantial linking of the Eternal Groundof the Soul with the Ground in the Eternal Godhead.On the consequences of the secretFor Ibn 2Arabi, therefore, the secret doesn’t simply lead to God – it alsoleads to self-annihilation. To learn the ‘secret of the secret’is to lose one-self, to glimpse the ‘abyssality’ of oneself. Derrida speaks of the ‘his-torical man’ who does not want to admit to the ‘abyss that undermineshis own historicity’;37a similar idea of the abyss underlies Ibn 2Arabi’sperfect man. For Derrida, anyone who still believes in a coherent, stableself is unwilling to admit to the fact that s/he is a construction of images.Ditto for nations – isms, races, histories: blind belief in these constructsas concrete, self-sufficient realities can only come from a profoundignorance of how ‘meaning’ really works. An ignorance of the factthat all such sign-systems are based on differences, not absolutes – thattheir signifiers cannot base themselves on anything which does notalready signify something else, ad infinitum. Hence the ‘abyss’ whichundermines historical man.Of course, Ibn 2Arabi’s questioning of absolutes and identities leads toan abyss of a very different kind. Ibn 2Arabi’s truth-seeker discovers thenameless, faceless, formless Real as the foundation of all things, not asemantic emptiness. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see how these twoinquiries into the origin of phenomena compare with each other; whilstnot quite stumbling upon the Derridean abîmeof absolute surface, theperfect gnostic does realize that ‘All roots are unseen (ghayb)’.38Just asfor Derrida, ‘life’ (a word which he has more than once used as a syn-onym for différance) means the ‘non-representable origin of representa-tion’, the gnostic’s secret lies in discovering how ‘the root of theexistence of the things is the Real, and He is unseen by them’ (ibid.).In both cases, the secret unveiled is that the radically Other lies behindthe familiar; the tout autreis the source of that which we felt wascomfortably, cosily ours.With Ibn 2Arabi, this means that once one has ‘tasted’ (dhawq) themystery, one cannot talk about it.39The word ‘cannot’here is not used inthe sense of prohibition, but incapacity – once one has broken throughinto the mind-numbingly simultaneous omnipresence and incommensu-rability of the Real, ‘there can be no technical terminology’ (ibid.).The secret of the Real, as we saw in the first chapter, is a (non)place sit-uated beyond/outside/prior to the world of differences, a space whererepresentation cannot take place. In the Futuhat, Ibn 2Arabi goes into Mystery-tasting and abyssality101"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"this in some detail:...it is impossible for a technical term to tie Him down, since thatof Him which one individual witnesses is not the same as whatanother individual witnesses in any respect...Hence no gnostic isable to convey to another gnostic what he witnesses of his Lord, foreach of the two gnostics witnesses Him who has no likeness, andconveying knowledge can only take place through likenesses.40To repeat a point: the Real is unspeakable not because it is a secret pieceof information, say, a certain letter of the alphabet, but rather because ofits absolute incomparability. In order to speak about it, one would have tofind a letter which somehow meant all of the letters of the alphabetat once. The secret of Ibn 2Arabi’s secret is no arbitrary curtaining of cer-tain signs from public view – as Derrida would have it in his version ofnegative theology – but rather the unthinkable root of all identities.Whether this inability to speak about the secret in Ibn 2Arabi has anyresemblance to Kierkegaardian silence is uncertain. In Fear andTrembling, Abraham cannot speak when he decides to follow God’scommand and kill his only son: ‘He said nothing to Sarah, he said noth-ing to Eleazar. After all, who could have understood him?’.41Abrahamcannot speak about his relationship with God because to do would be tospeak a language which contradicts the Law. To be asked by a God ofLove and Justice to kill one’s own son – Abraham’s secret is unique,incommensurable, no-one can understand it. And it is because of thissecret that Abraham walks alone. As soon as Abraham understands histask and begins his long walk of silence, he enters into an ‘absolute rela-tion with the absolute’.42At this point, Abraham begins his own lan-guage game, employing a vocabulary which no-one – neither Sarah norIsaac – is familiar. In the face of this inwardness, Kierkegaard cannottranslate Abraham’s faith into some sort of intelligible account, for wehave nothing with which we might understand it. This idea parts com-pany with the original, much simpler definition of the mystical as a com-municable piece of information which is somehow kept from the restand revealed only to a select few: now the secret is a poem whoseuntranslatable effect in the original (and here we skirt close to Benjamin)can never be reproduced in any other language. The coincidence ofsound and sense isolates it, in the same way Abraham is isolated by hisdecision: the fortuitous collision in a poem of certain consonantswith certain meanings cannot be replicated in any other language, itremains – like Abraham – sadly and uniquely alone.102Mystery-tasting and abyssality"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Nevertheless, although Kierkegaard follows Ibn 2Arabi’s work inpositing a God beyond dualistic categories of good and evil, the secretof Abraham does not lead to a dissolution of the self. The word in ArabicIbn 2Arabi uses to describe this is fana1, and the Shaykh employs itfrequently to describe to final (re)joining of the soul to the Real:Through being joined (ittisal) to the Real, man is annihilated (fana1)from himself. Then the Real becomes manifest so that He is hishearing and his sight. This is what is called a knowledge of ‘tasting’(dhawq). The Real is nothing of these organs until they are burnedup by His Being, so that He is there, not they.43As Derrida might say: the secret of the self is that there is no self. Untilwe are enlightened we are rooted in something we remain fundamentallyignorant of. How far this Sufi dismantling of selfhood is comparable tothe deconstructive laying-bare of the autosis a difficult question. Derridacertainly doesn’t reveal the groundlessness of identities in order to havethem re-incorporated into some bigger, transcendental presence; on theother hand, neither does Ibn 2Arabi. The Real is not an ‘entity’ in anyonto-theological sense of the word. A proper understanding of fana1would see it as a dissolution, notan addition, nor an in-corporation, forthe Real is not a corpus. It is a formless, nameless, faceless force, mov-ing through creation, constantly renewing it. When Zayd realizes that hishearing and seeing actually stems from the Real, and not from his ‘self’,then a different picture of the universe comes into being. Many of Ibn2Arabi’s controversial interpretations of familiar passages from the Koran –lauding villains and disparaging ‘good’characters – have been misunder-stood for this very reason. Dismissing them as exercises in moralrelativism, the Shaykh’s critics have failed to take into account theomnipresence of the Real in all things, ‘good’ and ‘bad’.Of course, the dissolution of the self may also suggest a dissolution ofresponsibility. If one’s traditions and practices (adab) are based on acommitment to God as Other, than as soon as this idea of God as Otheris dispelled, so are one’s ritual obligations: ‘Adabrequires the Other.Now, there is a station at which others vanish; adabceases, for there isno longer [any other to relate to].’44Learning the secret means discover-ing that one no longer hasto do anything, because all notions of obliga-tion are based on a relationship to the Other. ‘Tasting’the mystery meansbecoming the mystery – the mystery of God, becoming as formless,faceless and attributeless as God Himself.

It is not difficultto recognize the contemporary version of this; to finally grasp the secretcultural contingency of all our habits and beliefs, to realize that we see theworld the way we do because of the latitude and longitude of our birthplace,because of the first hundred books we read, because of our televisionhabits, our parents’passions and indifferences, because of the thousands ofunknowable factors which form a backdrop to the illusion of our ‘self’.‘I no longer made any distinctions between different directions...’Asif one had finally got beyond the binary differences of right and wrong,left and right, East and West, ‘good’ and ‘bad’ deeds.

Taken out of context, there are countless remarks inthe Futuhatalone whose conclusions could be seen as inescapably‘relativist’, perhaps even nihilistic:The root of all things is difference (tafriqa)...Things are only witnessed in respect of their levels, not in their enti-ties.

More importantly, there seems to be a profoundly pre-scient understanding of how identities seem to require their opposites inorder to signify – Ibn 2Arabi’s definition of Paradise as a place whosehappiness is constantly threatened is probably the most memorableexample of this.48Once the believer has ‘tasted’ the attributelessness ofthe mystery, it will be difficult to perceive any values and traditionsagain in quite the same way. Once the believer has been to a place wherethere is ‘no ranking in degrees’,49the word ‘hierarchy’ thereafter willalways have a slightly absurd ring.And yet, the progress of the soul does not end with fana1, nor with anabandonment of one’s traditions. Once the believer has glimpsed thesecret of the divine abyss upon which everything rests, one of twopossible reactions ensue: fear or illumination. For some, the enormity ofwhat they glimpse is simply too much:There are those who undergo unveiling and then flee back to thevisible world because they see that which terrifies them in theirunveiling. One such was our companion Ahmad al-2Assad al-Hariri.When he was taken, he would quickly return to his senses shakingand trembling. I used to scold him and tell him not to do that, but hewould say, ‘I am frightened and terrified lest I lose myself throughwhat I see...’50Many, like Ibn 2Arabi’s friend, are frightened of losing themselves –their ‘selves’ – and even going mad (majnun). Those who are more pre-pared returnof their own choice to the visible world and to their traditions,Mystery-tasting and abyssality105"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"but simply with a different understanding. As we have seen in an earlierchapter, learning of the omnipresence of God perhaps makes the qibla(the direction of prayer towards Mecca) unnecessary. However, this doesnot lead Ibn 2Arabi to declare any direction for salatcorrect; on the con-trary, we are told to continue praying towards Mecca, but only on thecondition that we realize God is not confined to that place, but lies in allother directions too. This is a repeated theme in Ibn 2Arabi’s work;Ibn2Arabi is keen to warn against the secret leading the believer awayfrom his/her tradition:It may happen that the possessor of such an unveiling [i.e. he wholearns a secret] continues to practice the outward sense of that ruling,while he does not believe in it in respect of himself. He practices itby stipulating the outward situation (zahir), saying to himself, ‘Tothis commandment of the law I only give the outward dimension(zahir) of myself, for I have gained knowledge of its secret (sirr).Hence its property in my innermost consciousness (sirr) is differentfrom its property in my outward dimension.’51This amounts to what Ibn 2Arabi calls ‘throwing away the scale of theLaw’ (ibid.) – and the Shaykh does not approve of it. Such a radical dis-parity between zahirand batinis unacceptable in the eyes of Ibn 2Arabi.The secret of the self – namely, its selflessness – must never interferewith adab. The Shaykh is insistent on this: as we saw in the previouschapter on hermeneutics, there must always be some kind of linkbetween the secret (batin) and its practice (zahir). In the passage, giventhe believer is condemned because the secret (sirr) has led him to dis-believe in a certain practice. His knowledge of the secret, rather thanenhancing him spiritually and filling him with desire to observe the law,has only bred indifference and complacency: ‘Now I know the secret ofwhat I do, there’s no need for me to do it anymore.’Thus, if the secret brings about the annihilation of the individual, itcan also dissolve the tradition and customs based on the individual’srelationship to such a God. There seems to be a deep-rooted fear here,on Ibn 2Arabi’s part, of the all-encompassing and incomparable nature ofGod somehow robbing the gnostic of his/her traditions – which, after all,are specificpractices based on a certain, delimited understanding ofGod. A fear that, once people realize the undelimitable Real lies in allthings and in all directions (even in themselves), the ‘enlightened’ willno longer bother with the pilgrimage or the correct direction of prayer.Any religious tradition which extols a radically unthinkable God carries106Mystery-tasting and abyssality"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"within itself this capacity for self-dismantling, this possibility forprofoundly calling into question the raisons d1êtreof its own practicesand customs. It is unlikely that Ibn 2Arabi’s fear of appearing to incitelaxity and moral abandon (a familiar charge levelled at the Sufis) hadany external motive – a desire to appear ‘orthodox’ or ‘sound’. On thecontrary, the Shaykh appears to show little inhibition or self-regulationin revealing his most controversial ideas, particularly in the Fusus. Agenuine anxiety seems to lie beneath Ibn 2Arabi’s frequent insistence onnot abandoning adabafter grasping the secret of the Real. Perhaps suchanxiety stems from a fear that discovering the mystery of Lordshipwithin oneself may cause arrogance and self-importance to overtakemodesty and humility.Certainly Ibn 2Arabi’s most perfect type of gnostic, the ‘People ofBlame’ (malamiyya– a familiar Sufi term) is the perfect example ofmodesty and non-distinction. Even though they have tasted the mysteryof God (‘They have achieved all the stations and have seen that Godveils Himself from the creation in this world’)52these gnostics are dis-tinguished by their utter ordinariness. Although ‘everything in their viewis named Allah’ (ibid.), such an awareness of the Real’s omnipresencehas not caused them to leave their cultural contexts or view them asstrange or unnecessary. On the contrary, they fit perfectly into society,mixing among the common people without anyone ever divining theirtrue status:They walk in the markets, they speak to the people...[and yet] theyare alone with God....The People of Blame do not distinguish themselves from anyof God’s creatures by anything, so they are unknown. Their state isthe state of the common people.(ibid.)One could be forgiven for thinking the People of Blame to be asecret society, clandestinely moving among the masses, imitating theirways and practices perfectly whilst remaining intimately in touchwith Something absolutely beyond them. Ibn 2Arabi seems to see thisinconspicuous condition of the malamiyyaas their most perfect virtue –whereas the worshippers (al-2ubbad) are noticeable through their obvi-ous holiness, and the Sufis are recognized by everyone through their‘miraculous breaking of habits’, the most advanced group of gnosticsremain plain Joe Bloggs, ordinary citizens living ordinary lives to theundiscerning eye.Mystery-tasting and abyssality107"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"It is difficult not to think once more of Kierkegaard in this praise ofthe extraordinary returning to, and passing for, the ordinary. Like thegnostics who are ‘alone with God’, Kierkegaard’s famous ‘knight offaith’ always stands ‘in absolute isolation’.53And yet, with equal irony,he belongs almost wholly to society; even though he ‘has felt the pain ofrenouncing everything in the world’, only to ‘take everything back onthe strength of the absurd’,54even though he stands alone and separatefrom ‘the mass of humans’, the knight of faith still remains and partici-pates in the world. The authenticity of his faith reveals itself in no mirac-ulous acts of self-mortification (like Ibn 2Arabi’s Sufis and worshippers),but rather with all the utter conformity of the petit bourgeoisie – ‘nosmartly turned-out townsman taking a stroll out to Fresberg on a Sundayafternoon treads the ground with surer feet’.55Like the malamiyya, he isindistinguishable from those around him, even though he is spirituallylight-years ahead of his peers: ‘if one didn’t know him it would beimpossible to set him apart from the rest of the crowd’. And yet, saysKierkegaard in one of his most careful analogies, if a skilful dancer canleap in the air and land to assume a position straightaway, the knights offaith cannot quite manage such a smooth transition; they waver for aninstant, ‘and the wavering shows they are nevertheless strangers to theworld’.56Of course, it would be unwise to claim – despite Pamuk’s tongue-in-cheek image of Ibn 2Arabi as the ‘existentialist of all time’ – that thePeople of Blame and the Kierkegaardian knight of faith are strangers tothe world for the same reason. Nevertheless, there is something curi-ously analogous in this return to the mundane and the everyday after anexperience which, by all accounts, should have rendered everythingsuperfluous and unimportant. In both cases, the individuals concernedare returning to people who cannot understand them. In both cases,Kierkegaard’s knight and Ibn 2Arabi’s gnostic choose to accept this situ-ation, hiding the true level of their advancement so they may blend inwith those around them. They walk in the market, along the streets,keeping their secret to themselves. They are truly ‘happy’. For suchpeople, glimpsing the secret does not mean changing one’s life, butrather one’s attitude towards it – deconstructing the cur, but leaving thequidintact.What we have, in other words, is a secret which calls all our previousbeliefs and passions into question but which, once we have learnt it,leaves everything intact. Is it possible to make an analogy here withDerrida’s own attempt to deconstruct morality without abandoning theethical? To retain certain Marxist/feminist values, even after one has108Mystery-tasting and abyssality"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"learned the secret abyssality of such -isms? Of course, thinkers such asIbn 2Arabi and Derrida who unconventionally question ideas of ‘good-ness’and ‘justice’have always been accused of immorality – and almostalways have to resort to the same kind of ritual defence to reassure crit-ics of their own Muslim hood/sense of the ethical (Heidegger makes asimilar defence in Letter on Humanism, where he laments how ‘because“humanism” is argued against, one fears a defence of the inhuman’57).Ibn 2Arabi’s insistence that his secret does notmean a dispensing withadabbut rather a richer understanding of it finds some parallels withDerrida, and his insistence that a deconstructive laying-bare of the logo-centric secret of traditional moral and political values does not neces-sarily mean a destructionof them, but rather a re-appraisal, a re-opening.It is an issue which Derrida has written about at length. In ‘Passions’he expresses an understandable wariness concerning the ‘remoralizationof deconstruction’,58a prospect which, although ‘attractive’, ultimatelyrisks ‘reassuring itself in order to reassure the other’ (an allusion tothe various charges of amoralism and political indifference directedat Derrida’s work) and lapsing logocentrically into a ‘new dogmaticslumber’ (ibid.). The example of Ibn 2Arabi’s perfect gnostic – whograsps the secret of his own selflessness and is still able to live in the realworld without any visible change to his own external practices – cannotreally be followed through in Derrida. It is difficult to imagine how theorthodox socialist or feminist, having accepted the semantic groundless-ness of words such as ‘humanism’, ‘utopia’, ‘woman’, can still carry onas if nothing had happened. When, in Positions(1971), Houdebine asksDerrida what effect deconstructive practices will have on the ‘currentideological scene’, Derrida seems somewhat guarded in his reply, insist-ing there are ‘no grounds for expecting from it...an immediatelygeneralefficacity’.59It is going to take time before the real effects ofdeconstructive practice – the re-analysis of the concept of ideology, a re-understanding of the relationship between ‘a determined text or sig-nifying chain’ and ‘reality’ – make themselves felt. As this gradualprocess takes place, ideologists of all persuasions will finally learn thatthey ‘can no longer restrict [themselves] to prior delimitations’ (an irre-sistibly Sufi phrase). Derrida uses, as he often does, the word ‘trem-bling’ (ébranler) to describe the effect of deconstruction: ‘What areapparently simply “regional” effects of this trembling, therefore, at thesame time have a nonregional opening, destroying their own limits andtending to articulate themselves...in new modes, without any pretentionto mastery’60The structure trembles, it is shaken – shaken to the pointwhere one has to think of living elsewhere.

Unlike the malamiyya, glimpsing thereality of the metaphysical abyss upon which one’s sign-system isfounded leads to an opening-up of one’s parameters, not a re-affirmationof them; a ‘willing-to-be-changed’ towards the radically new, ‘destroy-ing’previous limits, and not the maintenance – albeit in an ‘enlightened’,ironic way – of the same practices and customs the believer was chainedto when s/he was still ‘ignorant’.Conclusion: Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi on illusionIf we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics forinstance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerningquantity or number?No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning,concerning matter of fact and existence?No. Commit it then to theflames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.David Hume, An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, III.12The word ‘illusion’comes from the Latin illudere, to play with or mock.When we are the victim of an illusion, something is playing with us,deceiving us, misleading us. The word is, of course, philosophically neu-tral; it is a word which can be used equally well by mystics, scientists,empiricists, priests and post-structuralists. Which is why we can say thatDerrida and Ibn’Arabi, in their own ways, place a similar emphasis onthe idea of illusion, have a similar understanding of what perpetrates thisillusion, and present a similar urgency on the need to breakthrough thisillusion if we are to truly ‘know’ anything at all.An illusion, as we all know, is a secret lie, an untruth we have yetto discover. The deluded are subject to a lie whose veracity they havenever suspected – on this narrow point Hume, Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi areall in agreement. For Hume, famously credited with waking Kant fromhis ‘dogmatic slumber’, the illusion is provided by the unverifiableclaims of dogmatic metaphysics (of which, one can imagine, Ibn 2Arabi’swould be a prime example). Hume’s solution, not surprisingly, is anexclusively empirical concern with ‘the matter of fact and existence’,and a dispensing with the ‘sophistry and illusion’ of metaphysicalthought.If both Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi agree with Hume that an illusion is tak-ing place every time we practice metaphysics, they certainly do notagree with him on what constitutes the viable alternatives to this ‘illu-sion’. For both the Sufi and the theorist, rationalism and empiricism are110Mystery-tasting and abyssality"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"no less an illusion than dogmatic metaphysics. Derrida’s view of Hume’s‘illusion’ would rest on his mistaken assumption that there is ‘some-thing’ beyond the sign which metaphysics is misrepresenting. Hume,despite his well-known stature as ‘Scotland’s most famous atheist’,would still be proposing an empiricism every bit as transcendental as themetaphysics he was trying to depose. At least one famous critic ofDerrida has confused deconstruction with Hume’s scepticism, mistakingDerrida for a French Hume without ever really understanding why thedeconstructive critique of logocentrism does not stop with ‘divinity orschool metaphysics’.61Naturally, there are obvious reasons why Ibn 2Arabi would disagreewith an eighteenth-century British agnostic empiricist – namely, thatHume refuses to see how ‘everything is named Allah’! But on thespecific question of illusion, Ibn 2Arabi would see Hume as correct insaying we are blinded by metaphysics to the truth, but incorrect in sug-gesting that rationality and experimental reasoning can get us any nearer.Ibn 2Arabi would see no distinction here between the two, convinced ashe is of the radical unthinkability of al-haqq. In dealing with that whichis ‘like nothing else’, it matters little whether one is an idealist, a ratio-nalist or an empiricist – one is trying to find images to describe thatwhich has no image.The related motifs of illusion, dream and fantasy run throughout boththinkers’works, and it is interesting to see how an almost esotericbrandof scepticism in Ibn 2Arabi and Derrida lead to some similar conclusionsabout the illusion of reality/meaning. The idea that the world we see is adream (ruya), with its echoes of Calderon, is of central importance to theShaykh’s whole system of thought. Like so many of Ibn 2Arabi’s motifs,it is a term often used by Sufis and neoplatonists to describe the state ofignorance the unenlightened occupy when they fail to realize the simul-taneous immanence and transcendence of God – a state the Ikhwan al-Safa called the ‘dream of negligence’.62In his comparative study ofSufism and the Tao, Izutsu dedicates the opening chapter to the subjectof illusion in Ibn 2Arabi – beginning with a key passage from the Fusus:The world is an illusion; it has no real existence. And this is what ismeant by ‘imagination’(khayal), for you just imagine that it (i.e. theworld) is an autonomous reality quite different from and independ-ent of the divine Reality, while in truth it is nothing of the sort...Know that you yourself are an imagination. And everything you per-ceive and say to your self, ‘this is not me’, is also an imagination.So that the whole of existence is imagination within imagination.63Mystery-tasting and abyssality111"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"If the Real is the secret of all things, then the illusion is our ignoranceof this fact. Our dependence on the unthinkable Real is veiled from us;we are deluded insofar as we think we ‘mean’ something independentlyof God. The illusion of our independence is sustained by an equallyillusory belief in the simplistic identity of things – including our‘selves’, which we feel are separate and autonomous. Izutsu is quiteright in commenting how ‘“dream”, “illusion” or “imagination” doesnot mean something valueless, something false; it simply means “beinga symbol”’.64If we were to break through the illusion of everyday mean-ings, we would realize that everything is a symbol for the Real. All thatwe perceive leads back to the primordial abyssality of al-haqq.At first, one might feel hesitant in attributing overtly transcendentterms like ‘illusion’ and ‘dream’ to Derrida’s project, even though suchwords can be found quite frequently in his own work (all italics mine):...the effect of language that impels language to represent itself asexpressive re-presentation, a translation on the outside of what wasconstituted inside....Doubtless Western metaphysics constitutes apowerful systematization of this illusion...(Positions)...this accident produces a kind of semantic mirage: the deviance ofmeaning, its reflection effect in writing, sets something off.(Positions)...the mirageof the thing itself, of immediate presence, of originaryperception.(Of Grammatology)Rousseau is suspicious also of the illusionof full and presentspeech, of the illusionof presence within a speech believed to betransparent and innocent.(Of Grammatology)[Levinas’] dreamof a purely heterological thought at its source.Apurethought of puredifférance...we say the dreambecause itmust vanish at daybreak, as soon as language awakens.(Writing and Difference)65Mirage, illusion, dream: Derrida seems to employ a certain somnam-bulistic collection of metaphors whenever his subjects fall victim to the112Mystery-tasting and abyssality"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"lure of ‘full, immediate meaning’. In the first four quotations, at least,the illusion seems to be one of referentiality – the belief that every signis somehow referring to or ‘expressing’ something more concrete, more‘real’. Victims of this illusion have still not understood that the signified‘is always already in the position of the signifier’;66that whenever theyspeak so confidently about illusion or madness or purity, what they arereferring to is already a reference to something else, ad infinitum.In other words, logocentrism dreams. It dreams of capturing the logos,the origin, of returning to the garden. Whether it is Levinas’ seeking thepurity of the Other or Husserl searching for the Cartesian foundations ofhis ‘objectivity’, Derrida has spent a long career examining exactly howthinkers ‘dream’ whenever they seek the ‘origin’ or the ‘reality’ ofthings. There is a famous hadithwhich Ibn 2Arabi quotes in the Fusus–and which can be read with a certain irony here: ‘All men are asleep inthis world; only when they die do they wake up’.67Metaphysics wouldbe this sleep for Derrida, a sleep most (though not Rousseau) are noteven aware of being immersed in – deconstruction would be the ‘awak-ening’from such a sleep, the ‘shaking’(ébranler) which would rouse thethinker out of his dogmatic – or at least, logocentric – slumber. Derridaends Of Grammatologywith the words of Rousseau:You will say I too am a dreamer; I admit it, but I do what others failto do; I give my dreams as dreams, and leave the reader to discoverwhether there is anything in them which may prove useful to thosewho are awake.68Although this is no homage to a superior thinker, or even a compli-ment to a modest one, what Derrida is doing here is saying ‘thank you’for Rousseau’s misguided logocentrism. Rousseau the Dreamer hasallowed Derrida, the more ‘alert’critic of the two (one of ‘those who areawake’) to make deconstructive use of the dreams he has tried to pass for‘philosophy’. Derrida has understood in the light of day what Rousseaufailed to see in the small hours of the night – the semantic emptiness ofthe dream words Rousseau mistook for reality: origin, nature, innocence.At this point, one might feel that Derrida’s idea of ‘illusion’ has littleto do with Ibn 2Arabi’s hayal: apart from a handful of similar metaphors,there seems to be little else linking the Sufi view of the world as an illu-sion with the deconstructive illusion of meaning. Surely Derrida, in starkcontrast to Ibn 2Arabi, sees the word ‘illusion’ itself as an illusion? Isn’tDerrida’s illusion much more Nietzschean (i.e. the author of Twilight ofthe Idols), refusing to see the world of the senses as an illusion, in favourMystery-tasting and abyssality113"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"of some ‘true world’ which has merely been ‘mendaciously added’(lugisch hingefugt).69The answer to these questions can only be: ‘yes’ and ‘no’. On the onehand, it would be ridiculous to assume that the secret of Derrida’sillusion is the same as Ibn 2Arabi’s sirr. Derrida does not see the identityof all things rooted in God, but in differences, in différance. Nor does hesee the self as a construct, as an illusion, because it is originally ‘God’,but rather because it is rooted in a collection of differences which couldnot ever form any conceivable notion of coherent, stable selfhood. In thisimmediate sense, Derrida’s work is saying something very different fromthat of a thirteenth-century Sufi. On the other hand, what Chittick hascalled Ibn 2Arabi’s ‘ontological ambiguity of all things’70cannot simplybe dismissed as just another ascetic mysticism, devaluing everything inthisworld as part of one huge semantic deferral of meaning to the ‘next’.What Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi share is an understanding of how all mean-ing is rooted in an abyss (what Derrida calls ‘being born from the abyssof representation’71). Izutsu, more than anyone else, has probablyshown the most interest in the place of the abyss (in Arabic, 2ama) in Ibn2Arabi’s thought. He dedicates a central chapter of his work to it,‘The Abysmal Darkness’, even if the specific term 2amaappears to beused with greater frequency by Ibn 2Arabi’s disciple al-Qâshâni than bythe Shaykh himself. Izutsu reads the term ‘abyss’/ 2amaas a synonym forthe absolute unknowability of the Real, a silent, motionless, unfath-omable place which allows meaning/self-disclosure (tajallW) to be with-out ever revealing anything of itself. It is an ‘absolute mystery (mutlaqghayb)’, bereft of all ‘quiddity (mahiyya)’, a ‘primordial darkness’where there is ‘not the slightest movement’.72This abyssal darkness isthe source of all names and identities, even that of Allah. Such a notionof the abyss resembles a familiar Neoplatonic paradox – the Namelesswhich gives rise to names, the characterless which enables qualities toexist. Izutsu, for reasons best derived from his own Taoist perspective,succeeds in highlighting, albeit rather thematically, a definite tone ofdarkness, mystery and abyssality in the Shaykh which many critics haveoverlooked.Abgrund, 2ama, abîme: is such a notion of the abyss in Ibn 2Arabi’sthought really comparable to the Derridean abîme? Can we really saythat the unthinkable abyss of the Real, the non-representable sourceof all phenomena, is to be considered alongside the ‘semantic mirage’ofdifférance as it differs and defers from one sign to another, forever pro-ducing differences whilst forever remaining utterly intangible? Probably114Mystery-tasting and abyssality"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"anticipating such comparisons, Derrida has been careful to distinguishhis abyss from the type found in most apophatic mysticisms:...on one side, on one way, a profound and abyssal eternity, funda-mental but accessible to the teleo-eschatological narrative and to acertain experience or historical (or historial) revelation; on the otherside, on the other way, the nontemporality of an abyss without bottomor surface, an absolute impassibility (neither life nor death) thatgives rise to everything that it is not. In fact, two abysses.73The context of the quote is important: placed as it is in an essay whoseaim is to distinguish deconstruction from the cryptologocentrism ofnegative theology, Derrida offers two versions of the abyss – theAbgrundmystics such as Eckhart and Silesius have always talked about,and the abyss ‘without bottom or surface’ which Derrida seems to beequating with the movement of différance. In keeping with his ownthoughts on negative theology, Derrida characterizes the first abyss as‘profound’ (notbottomless) and ultimately ‘accessible to the teleo-eschatological narrative’. In other words, an abyss which never reallythreatensthe sign-systems it lies beneath, but rather participates in andfounds the ontotheology it maintains – a ‘familiar’ abyss, it wouldappear, a ‘deep’one (with all the metaphysical connotations, a notion ofdepth can carry). An abyss, unlike différance, situated within the struc-ture of temporality, symbolizing a very theological ‘eternity’. Derrida’sabyss, on the other hand, is almost the inverse: absolutely ‘nontemporal’,it is as bottomless and surfaceless as a mirror – and just as impassible.Distinctly lacking any theological characteristics such as ‘eternal’ or‘ineffable’, this second abyss appears to be nothing more than an end-lessly displaced effect of language, all zahirwith no batin. If this trulyis, as Raschke says, the ‘secret of all traditions of discourse – that theysignify nothing’, then our comparison with Ibn 2Arabi’s sirr al-sirrappears to have encountered a genuine disparity.Mystery-tasting and abyssality115"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Conclusion – the post-structuralistdissolution of the subjectThree Neoplatonic moments inthe Derridean canonA conclusion is usually a place where the author ties up loose ends.Points are made, efforts summarized, tentative abstractions ventured.In our comparative study of Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi, there has beenplenty to summarize: an analogous mistrust in the ability of rationalthought/metaphysics to talk unproblematically about God/meaning; aninsistence on the ultimate ungraspability of the Real/writing, despite allphilosophical/metaphysical claims to the contrary; a parallel interest inand positive appraisal of ‘confusion’ as a genuine means of ‘breakingthrough’ to the Other/the Real beyond our metaphysical constrictions; adeceptively similar belief in the infinite possibilities of the text – andthat those possibilities are modified, in varying degrees, to the actualcircumstances of the reader; a comparable idea of a secret abyssalitywhich lies hidden at the root of all identities – and a corresponding ideaof the ‘illusion’ of such identities; and finally, a related disbelief in theautonomous substantiality of the self.Instead of collating these tentative similarities into some kind of‘formula’and bringing them to converge on a final point, we will end ona note of widening, not convergence; by looking at certain moments inthe work of three authors from the Derridean canon – Blanchot,Benjamin and Foucault – we shall see how the comparison of Derridawith a Sufi Neoplatonist is no special case, exclusive to Derrida andhis well-known fascination with negative theology. On the contrary, de-theologized versions of Neoplatonic metaphors have always been atwork in texts such as ‘What is an Author?’, ‘The Task of the Translator’and ‘The Essential Solitude’. Whenever such authors reject rational/analytical explanations in their re-examination of concepts such as theself and the text, a certain tone emerges in their work which does bear aguarded resemblance to the term ‘Neoplatonic’."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"There are obvious dangers in saying all of this. First of all, no one isimplying that authors such as Foucault and Blanchot are ‘Neoplatonic’–nothing could be further from the truth. The vocabulary ofNeoplatonism, from Plotinus’Enneads, through its various Augustinian/Dionysian evolutions, its medieval passage into Meister Eckhart and upto its later re-manifestation in the Italian Renaissance (Cusano, Ficino),constitutes a diverse canon, with its Islamic (the Ikhwan al-Safa, the‘Theology of Aristotle’) and Jewish appropriations (Maimonides)equally original and irreducible to a simple, pat adjective. Nevertheless,insofar as the basic metaphor of all Neoplatonic writings involves theidea of a pure, ineffable Oneness, forever ready to gather together allerrant multiplicities and usher them back into the divine namelessness ofthe One...such a transcendent example of ontotheology would usuallyserve as a subjectfor most post-structuralist critiques, rather than as ananalogy for them.The second danger lies in mistaking any attempt to locate aNeoplatonic tone in such authors as a replication of Habermas’own harsh remarks concerning Heidegger and his ‘mysticism of theNew Paganism’.1Habermas’ dismissal of deconstruction as the ‘histori-cal locale where mysticism once turned into enlightenment’(ibid.) is, aswe have seen, fuelled largely by a desire to preserve at least some notionof Kantian Aufklärungfrom the perceived ‘anarchist wish(es)’ ofDerrida et al. Habermas’ pejorative use of the word ‘mystic’ stems fromthis very fear of an-archy – it is precisely this idea of groundlessness,of beginninglessness which Habermas sees as ultimately hostile toemancipatory/progressive thought (Derrida’s mysticism, remember,‘degrades politics and contemporary history to the status of the onticand the foreground’). Whenever Habermas uses the word ‘mystic’, thissense of an irrational, ungrounded and reality-trivializing danger isnever far away.No such defensive agenda informs our own examination of Blanchot,Benjamin and Foucault’s ‘mystical’ moments. If anything, our owninquiry lies closer to Bataille’s attempt to find, via Angela di Folignoand Mechtild von Magdeburg, mystical possibilities within theNietzschean deconstruction of self (‘you haven’t understood a word ofNietzsche’s work without living that dazzling dissolution into totality[cette dissolution éclatante dans la totalité]’).2It is precisely the natureof this ‘dissolution’ – and what kind of ‘totality’ it so dazzlinglydissolves into – which brings us first to Blanchot, whose blinding ‘light’of writing is also ‘the abyss, a light one sinks into, both terrifying andtantalizing’.3Blanchot appears to be one amongst many figures in the118The post-structuralist dissolution of the subject"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Derridean canon for whom écritureis more a means of self-annihilationthan self-repression, more an act of destructivity than creativity.Blanchot on écrireand the ‘breakthrough’Timothy Clark has described Blanchot’s view of writing as ‘not essen-tially a profession or even a ‘cultural activity’...[but] a vocation pursuedwith religious intensity’.4In reading Blanchot’s subtle, difficult prose, thealerted reader can detect (as many critics already have)5an almostmonastic emphasis on the way writing carries with it a gradual effacingof selfhood and a renunciation of everything which is not the text. ‘TheEssential Solitude’, especially, is an essay where Neoplatonic echoesabound – the idea of the soul as belonging to an ineffable power, anepekeina tes ousiawhich is constantly creating effects whilst remaininguncannily beyond them; the idea of a returnto a space which robs one ofself, a space situated outside time; the idea of the world as a distraction,something to be renounced, abandoned, and the attributing of an individ-ual’s actions to ‘something’ other than the self...all of these metaphorswork together, in the most secular of ways, to help Blanchot examine howthe writer is able to vanish into his work through the act of writing it.Probably the first Neoplatonic metaphor we encounter in ‘TheEssential Solitude’ is the slightly mysterious presence of an unseenpower, which Blanchot calls ‘that neutral force, formless and bereftof any destiny, which is behind everything that gets written’.6Characteristically Neoplatonic in its utter absence of attributes, thisforce is at work in all writing, omnipresently enough to justify the word‘incessant’. The seeds of Blanchot’s dissolution of the author lie in thisattribution of the act of writing not to the writer him/herself, but to‘something’ the writer belongs to in a more originary way. ‘To write’says Blanchot, ‘is to make oneself the echo of what cannot cease speak-ing’ (ibid.). Writing as the echo of an unseen dynamism...one cannothelp thinking of Plotinus’Enneadshere: ‘As speech is the echo ofthought in the soul, so thought in the soul is an echo from elsewhere...’7Of course, unlike the carefully laddered world of Plotinus’ graduatedemanations, there is no notion of hierarchy in Blanchot, no pyramidicalstructure of phenomena. Nevertheless, just as the Neoplatonic soulbelongs to and expresses its ‘source’, Blanchot’s author ‘belong(s), inthe work, to what always precedes the work’.8The word ‘expression’hasto be used carefully here – if the author ex-presses anything here, it isneither a classical notion of personality nor some form of the ‘universal’,but rather the fact that, ‘in one way or another, he is no longer himself;The post-structuralist dissolution of the subject119"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"he isn’t anyone anymore’.9The metaphor for the author is no longer afont of creativity, but rather a mouthpiece for an alien tongue, a media-tor for a formless, faceless ‘force’, a Heideggerian clearing in which theunfamiliar can make itself manifest.Such a metaphor for the author allows the activity of writing itself totake on a number of characteristically Neoplatonic functions. The first isthat of renunciation: writing means renouncing the world, abandoning it,giving it up as the source of any possible mimesis. ‘To write is...towithdraw language from the world.’10The author refuses to demeanlanguage by chaining it to mere representation, but instead allows lan-guage to speak with its own power, allows it to ‘be’ instead of slavishlyforcing it to ‘mean’. An obligation of piety which, we are told, the poetValéry did not fulfil: ‘he found it good to talk about everything, to writeon everything: thus the scattered totality of the world distracted himfrom the unique and rigorous totality of the work, from which he ami-ably let himself be diverted’.11Here Blanchot almost adopts a moralis-tic, puritanicalattitude towards representational thought, which isalways seduced by the world into representing it, writing about it,‘diverting’it from the one thing needful: the work itself. Valéry is almostjudged to have had an impure attitude towards language, a worldlyobsession with écriture– instead of ‘withdraw(ing) language from theworld’, of keeping language pure and whole, Valéry insisted on shatter-ing it, on mixing it with the world’s ‘scattered totality’. A thoroughlyNeoplatonic notion of the fragment which, we shall see, will become acentral metaphor in Benjamin’s work on translation.Paradoxically, what involves liberation also denotes surrender. Just asthe Neoplatonic soul must surrender its individuality if it is to return tothe One, Blanchot’s author must forego any notion of independence if heis truly to belong to écriture:If to write is to surrender to the interminable, the writer who con-sents to sustain writing’s essence loses the power to say ‘I’. And sohe loses the power to make others say ‘I’. Thus he can by no meansgive life to characters whose liberty would be guaranteed by hiscreative power.12An odd paradox is suggested: the writer must surrender the power tocreate if he is truly to write. Just as the Eckhartian soul must remain‘empty and bare’ (ledic und vrî) in order to spiritually give birth,Blanchot’s author must lose ‘the power to say “I”’ if it is to produce the‘echo’ of the incessant, of the interminable.120The post-structuralist dissolution of the subject"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"In essence, what happens when Blanchot’s author finally puts pen topaper mirrors, in many ways, the loss of self and extinction of differencewhich ensues the Neoplatonic moment of the ‘breakthrough’; the slideof the author’s life into ‘the distress of the infinite’ echoes the momentwhen the errant soul finally returns from the multiple and the finite intothe formless void of the One – ‘alone with the Alone’, as Plotinusfamously says, giving an ironic ring Blanchot’s own title. In the closinglines of the essay we read:To write...is to stay in touch, through language, in language, withthe absolute milieu where the thing becomes image again, where theimage, instead of alluding to some particular feature, becomes anallusion to the featureless, and instead of a form drawn uponabsence, becomes the formless presence of this absence, the opaque,empty opening onto that which is when there is no more world, whenthere is no world yet.13The string of apophatic adjectives: ‘featureless’, ‘absence’, ‘empty’,‘opaque’ underline the eerie resonance of a moment when the authorfinally ‘connects’ with that which precedes his/her work. A momentwhere, by remaining open to language, s/he glimpses the non-space atthe root of all differences, where signifiers do not lead onto other signi-fieds, but simply ‘allude’ to a void – the void which lies beneath all sig-nification. Blanchot’s ‘absolute milieu’ is this very opacity where theworld finishes – where images lose their objects, signifiers their signi-fieds, where ‘things’ lose their meanings and authors their selves,because it is a realm where meaning cannot take place. Regardless ofwhether the subject is Kafka or Hölderlin, this fascination with theunspeakable aboriginality of language – and the necessary humility ofthose who would approach it – remains probably the most ‘mystical’aspect of an otherwise untranscendental writer.Benjamin’s Übersetzenas a return to the OneLike Blanchot, voids, forces and infinities permeate Benjamin’s work;unlike Blanchot, Benjamin had a definite, documentable fascinationwith the history of Neoplatonic esotericism, including some carefulreadings of Origen, Boehme and Ficino’s commentary on the Enneads.In his essay on translation ‘The Task of the Translator’(1923), Benjaminapproaches his subject as only a Neoplatonist might.

Ofcourse, this linking of Neoplatonism with Benjamin should come as noreal surprise. Various Neoplatonic motifs of unity, oneness and ineffable,ever-receding origins can be found interspersed throughout his work:Origin is an eddy in the stream of becoming, and in its current itswallows the material involved in the process of genesis. That whichis original is never revealed in the naked and manifest existence ofthe factual...(Origin of German Drama)...the materials of memory no longer appear singly, as images, buttell us about a whole, amorphously and formlessly...in the sameway the weight of his net tells a fisherman about his catch.(‘The Image of Proust’)Dates, place names, formats, previous owners, bindings, and thelike: all these details must tell [the book collector] something – notas dry, isolated facts, but as a harmonious whole; from the qualityand intensity of this harmony he must be able to recognize whethera book is for him or not.(‘Unpacking My Library’)15The vocabulary of Neoplatonism, from Plotinus to Ficino, is a wide one,certainly wide enough to pull apart any attempt at a definition. Its commonstore of motifs, however – multiplicity and oneness, divine overflowing, thefragment, the source, the return – all permeate Benjamin’s work and underlie it, manifesting themselves even in the most un-transcendentalapplications. One sees in the Moscow journals, for example, how Benjaminanalyses the all-encompassing oneness of the Soviet state:To endure this existence in idleness becomes impossible because,in each smallest detail, it becomes beautiful and comprehensibleonly through work. The integration of personal thoughts with apreexisting force-field;...organized, guaranteed contact with com-rades – to all this, life here is so tightly bound that anyone whoabstains...degenerates intellectually as if through years of solitaryconfinement...(‘Moscow’)122The post-structuralist dissolution of the subject"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Or in examining the relationship of children and their toys to the largercommunity, Benjamin’s familiar evocation of Something bigger and‘other’ than oneself seems to manifest itself once more:After all, a child is no Robinson Crusoe; children do not constitutea community cut-off from everything else. They belong to thenation and the class they come from. This means that their toys can-not bear witness to any autonomous, separate existence, but ratherare a silent, signifying dialogue between them and their nation.(‘The Cultural History of Toys’)16Rather like Kafka’s philosopher, who is convinced the knowledge ofthe bigger things in life lies in the study of the smallest, Benjamin seesthe smaller parts of society – its toys, its side-dishes, its kitsch, its streetcorners – as leading him to a knowledge of the whole. This perceptionof a hidden unity amongst such fragments, somewhere behind/beyondthe world of things, has its obvious Neoplatonic parallels. In contrast toBlanchot, however, what Benjamin does here is begin to politicizetheNeoplatonic – to translate the vocabulary of Plotinus and Proclus intosocio-political terms. In Benjamin’s voluminous analyses of culture andculture theory, the State replaces the ‘One’ as the source of all effectswhilst words like society (Gesellschaft) and culture (Kultur) becomesubstitutions for the emanations of Plotinus’ Ineffable.This political interest on Benjamin’s part in the loss of selfhoodnever really manifests itself in ‘The Task of the Translator’ – probablythe most esoteric of Benjamin’s many essays. Although Benjaminoffers ten metaphors for the relationship between translation and origi-nal – translation as the flower of the original, the ghost/afterthoughtof the original, translation as a process of ripening, or a window peeringonto the original, or a corresponding fragment of a long-shattered vase...two of them are of particular interest to us for their Neoplatonicorigins. The first is the analogy of the echo which Benjamin usesfor translation, the same analogy Blanchot uses for the work of theauthor. It appears towards the middle of the essay, in a passagewhere Benjamin appears keen to differentiate between the poet and thetranslator:Unlike a work of literature, translation does not find itself in thecentre of the language forest but on the outside facing the woodedridge; it calls into it without entering, aiming at that single spotwhere the echo is able to give, in its own language, the reverbera-tion of the work in the alien one.17The post-structuralist dissolution of the subject123"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Before commenting on this it will be useful to quote, this time in itsentirety, the relevant passage from Plotinus’Enneads:As speech is the echo of the thought in the soul, so thought in thesoul is an echo from elsewhere: that is to say, as the uttered thoughtis an image of the soul-thought, so the soul-thought images athought above itself and is the interpreter of the higher sphere.18Plotinus’ words bring out a number of points in Benjamin’s passage:firstly, that the translator is an entity situated outside something he isdesperately trying to replicate. Outside a secret, as it were, the secret ofthe original’s identity – a secret which, in this analogy at least, appearsto have a precise location. A step forwards or backwards, a wrong verbor excessive adjective, and the echo is lost. Secondly, the comparisonwith the Enneadsreminds us of how Benjamin’s analogy is both similarto and different from the familiar Neoplatonic doctrine of similarity withthe One. The One can admit no differences – if the errant soul is to returnto It, it must become similar. However, if we follow Benjamin’s analogycarefully, we discover that what Benjamin initially calls ‘the echo of theoriginal’ is actually the voice of the translator. The translator, not theoriginal, is the source of the echo. The translator has to change position,of course, before he can perceive the perfect reverberation of his ownvoice; nevertheless, his efforts are not guided towards imitating an exter-nal Something, but rather towards using this Something to reproducewhat he already is. The original, far from possessing any contents whichhave to be ‘imitated’, simply becomes an ineffable engine that returns avoice to its owner, a hidden power which appears to create and replicatewithout ever participating in the process of creation.The metaphor of the translation as a garment covering the naked con-tent of the original reinforces, once more, the apophatic, uncrossable gulfbetween Urtextand Übersetzungwhich Benjamin, at various moments,seems to be describing. The metaphor comes after some meditation onthe ‘element’ in an original ‘that does not lend itself to translation’:...the relationship between content and language is quite differentin the original and the translation. While content and language forma certain unity in the original, like a fruit and its skin, the languageof the translation envelops its content like a royal robe [wie einKönigsmantel] with ample folds. For it [the language] signifies amore exalted language than its own and thus remains unsuited to itscontent, overpowering and alien.19124The post-structuralist dissolution of the subject"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"One could seize with deconstructive glee upon a notion of innocencehere in Benjamin’s essay – the pristine, Edenic unity of the original,whose magical language supersedes both form and content, falls into themultiple world of the translator, where signifiers have been sinfully sun-dered from their signifieds, where speech is no longer instantaneouswith meaning.20If Benjamin does see the original as a lost paradise,however, it is not always clear whether the task of the translator is torecover this innocence, or whether the memory of this loss is enough initselfto allow the translation to work, independently of the original. Orwhether, indeed, the dream of the original only leads to the creation ofnew paradises, cryptically separate yet somehow still connected to theirancient predecessor. The metaphor Benjamin uses in this instance doesnot seem so optimistic. It is a metaphor one could find in many places(in Eckhart, for instance: ‘The will apprehends God under the garmentof goodness. The intellect apprehends God naked, as He is divested ofgoodness and being.’),21although the most appropriate parallel occurs inIbn 2Arabi himself:For the benefit of the many, the prophets express on this matter inan outer fashion, limited as they are by the understanding of thelearner...Thus...one who has no depth of understanding may gono further than the outward forms [of the message]...On the other hand, one of refined understanding...says [of thetext], ‘This is the outer garment of a King’. Thus he examines thequality of the garment and the fineness of its cloth and therebylearns the worth of the one whom it causes, so acquiring knowledgedenied to the other, who understands nothing of this.22Although Ibn 2Arabi here is not talking directly about translations norknowledge of the divine, but how to approach the holy scriptures of theprophets, the question he raises about interpretation is still analogousto that of translation. For the medieval exegete, interpretation wastrans-lation – not simply Arabic into Persian or Greek into Latin, but thetranslation of the hidden, divine language (batin, ‘inner meaning’) intothe comprehensible language of men (zahir, ‘outward meaning’). It is in this sense that both Benjamin and Ibn 2Arabi see the translation/zahiras the outer garment of an inner truth (batin). This is where the twometaphors part company, however – in the Sufi version, the outer gar-ment can still give some meaningful information about its owner. Therichness of the cloth offers some positive link with the royalty it isintended to signify.

Like Bataille’s work on Nietzscheand Angela di Foligno, there is certainly some scope for trying to under-stand Neoplatonically how Foucault’s author dissolves into a ‘juridicaland institutional system that encompasses, determines and articulatesthe universe of discourses’.24Studies on the subject of Foucault andmysticism, although by no means commonplace, are certainly not rare.Probably the most important has been Christian Jambet’s work onFoucault and Islamic Iranian spirituality. Encouraged by Foucault’s owninterest in the Iranian revolution and the mystical factors in its origins,25Jambet makes use of Foucault’s famous phrase ‘taking care of the self’,finding an equivalent in Suhrawardi’s identical expression 2ishtighal binaisi-hi– which leads the author to conclude how Foucault’s ‘elucida-tion of subjective and objective universes...are an exercise which aimsat “release from the self”.26Of course, the aim of Foucault’s essay ‘What is an Author?’is no Sufi‘release from the self’, but rather an ultimately political and verypractical re-understanding of how that ‘self’ has come to exist as an‘author-function’. No spiritual exercise in fana1, then, but an attempt tounderstand the illusion of the author in socio-political terms and therebyelucidate ‘the real meaning of his disappearance’(p. 198). What remainseye-catchingly Neoplatonic in Foucault’s essay, apart from the vapidityof the self and the enthusiasm with which Foucault is ready to dissolvewords such as ‘author’ and ‘oeuvre’, is the curious presence of a powerwhich only becomes noticeable once the author has been removed. It is,in a sense, the unasked question of the essay – one which lingers like126The post-structuralist dissolution of the subject"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"a palimpsest beneath every line we read: if there is no (A)uthor, who orwhat is doing the writing? It is a question Foucault’s n1importe quoiatthe end of the essay doesn’t answer, although he had already asked it inThe Order of Things:To the Nietzschean question ‘Who is speaking?’, Mallarmé replies –and constantly reverts to that reply – by saying that what is speakingis, in its solitude, in its fragile vibration, in its nothingness, the worditself – not the meaning of the word, but its enigmatic and precari-ous being.27In this reply of Mallarmé (who, we are told, ‘was constantly effacinghimself from his own language’)28Foucault seems to find, in absolutelyapolitical terms, some of his own resistance towards classical ideas ofauthorial ex-pression and the vehicular concept of language as a ‘meaning-carrier’. In other words a concept of language which, by the time of‘What is an Author?’, had ‘freed itself from the dimension of expres-sion’.29Like Blanchot and his ‘neutral, formless force...behind every-thing that gets written’, Foucault’s Mallarmé seems content to locate thisforce in language itself, in the enigma of écriture, without growingpolitically suspicious about the origins of this power in the way laterpost-structuralists will become. This enigmatic force, forever incitingsignification without ever signifying itself, crystallizing itself in imageseven as it recedes, reminds us of the only two moments in Foucault’sessay where ‘something’ even as remotely mysterious as Blanchot’s‘formless force’ is alluded to:Writing unfolds like a game that invariably goes beyond its ownrules and transgresses its limits. In writing, the point is not to mani-fest or exalt the act of writing, nor is it to pin a subject within lan-guage; it is rather a question of creating a space into which thewriting subject constantly disappears.In the future development of a science, the founding act mayappear as little more than a particular instance of a more generalphenomenon which unveils itself in the process.30What is of relevance here are not the subjects of the quotations, butthe verbs: ‘unfolding’, ‘unveiling’. Verbs which, far from beingHegelian, carry with them all the Neoplatonic echoes which lie at theroot of the post-structuralist dissolution of the subject.

The illusionof the self in mystics such as Eckhart, Ibn 2Arabi, Pseudo-Dionysius isevery bit as a posteriori as the ‘author-function’ – the texts produce the author, says Foucault, the author doesn’t precede the texts. Both the‘self’and the ‘author’constitute an attempt at ‘appropriation’31– for themystic, selfhood is a futile attempt to appropriate something which fun-damentally belongs to God; it is an ignorance of the ‘actual situation’ofGod’s omnipresence. For the post-structuralist, authorship is an attemptto appropriate écriture; it stems from a desire to resist and control the‘unveiling’, ‘unfolding’, transgressive forces of writing, to limit themand pretend that they come from the author. An author who is no ‘cre-ator’, but merely a carefully constructed subject artificially imposedupon the turbulence of the work itself.Allah and écriture: the centre is not the centre,‘God’ is not the RealThe centre is at the centre of the totality, and yet, since the centre doesnot belong to the totality (is not part of the totality), the totality has itscentre elsewhere. The centre is not the centre.32It will come as no surprise that we are finally moving towards the conclu-sion that the way in which Sufi thinkers like Ibn 2Arabi talk about God isuncannily similar to the way in which post-structuralists like Derrida talkabout writing. Neither writing nor the Real ever stands still long enoughto be a ‘centre’ for anything; separated by seven centuries, both thinkersfeatured in this study have been castigated and vilified for daring to sug-gest the ‘blindness’ of their peers to this situation. The Ash1arites failed tounderstand how the ‘centre’of their own theology (an immanent God) wasno nearer to the Real than the ‘centre’ of the rival theology belonging totheir opponents, the Mu1tazilites. The structuralists who claimed to per-form a critique of empiricism did not see how they themselves shared thesame ‘centre’ as empiricism – a truth ‘which can always be completed orinvalidated by new information’.33Both thinkers have discerned a varietyof idols which philosophers and theologians, ever the centuries, have mis-taken for a ‘centre’ – an ultimate point of reference which would justify,incontestably, all the propositions made about it.If Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi share one thing in common – and they areverydifferent thinkers – it is this awareness of how obstructive and128The post-structuralist dissolution of the subject"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"ineluctably misleading representations can be. No surprise, then, thatboth thinkers speak of metaphysics in terms of chains and ‘knots’ – andof their own projects as attempts to untie those ‘knots’; neither is it sur-prising how both thinkers seem to see in the state of confusion a possi-bility for ‘truer’knowledge, or how they come to see texts as bearing anultimately uncontrollable number of meanings, or how they perceive the‘self’ (or indeed all autonomous, self-present identities) as being rootedin an ‘abyss’...this common store of motifs and metaphors is nopatched-together collection of superficial similarities, but simply theconsequences of a genuine suspicion of rational/metaphysical thought.Neither is it surprising that both Ibn 2Arabi and Derrida have been thesubject of comparisons with Taoism. Izutsu’s famous 1967 study sees thetao’s production (sheng) of the ‘ten thousand things’(tao→sheng→wanwu) as an ‘exact Taoist counterpart of the Islamic haqq’34– that is, theway Ibn 2Arabi’s Real manifests itself constantly in the world of possiblebeings (haqq→tajallW→mumkinat).35Similarly, critics such as MichelleYeh have discerned a common opposition to ‘dualistic conceptualization’in the thought of both Derrida and the Taoist sage Chuang Tzu,36whilstothers such as Donald Wesling have gone so far as to call Derrida’sthought an ‘incomplete Taoism’.37Of the two approaches Izutsu is themore convinced of the veracity of his comparison, with Hongchu Fu moresoberly discerning a number of clear differences between Derrida’s ‘activeattitude’and the ‘Taoist transcendence’.38Nevertheless, both comparisonsreflect in deconstruction and Sufism a basic dissatisfaction with the meta-physical, essentialist structure of philosophy, even if the alternatives pro-vided seem to be of a very different nature.The question remains: what are the implications of any comparativestudy of Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi for Sufism and deconstruction? Whenwe speak of a radical re-emphasizing of the unthinkable in both God andthe text, an analogous mistrust of metaphysical thought and a parallelaffirmation of confusion and infinite interpretation, what consequencesdo such comparisons have for the way we continue to read Derrida andIbn 2Arabi?In Ibn 2Arabi’s case two important points can be drawn, the first con-cerning the Shaykh’s alleged status as a genius of systematization, thesecond concerning the ontological status of that system itself. Mostrecently Hamid Dabashi, in an otherwise admirable study of the twelfth-century Persian thinker and mystic 2Ayn al-Qudat, has spoken of Ibn2Arabi as a ‘grand totalising master narrator’,39one who produced a‘dead, compromising, politically correct “Sufism”’ (ibid.). Dabashi’sshallow and ungrounded reading of Ibn 2Arabi, in particular his curiousThe post-structuralist dissolution of the subject129"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"claim that after 2Ayn al-Qudat, Sufism ‘lost’ its ‘centrality of irony andparadox’ and ‘impetuous undoing of reason’, is never supported by asingle quotation from Ibn 2Arabi, whom Dabashi holds single-handedlyresponsible for the metaphysical murder of Sufism. The only evidenceoffered for this claim is an unconvincing argument from biography: 2Aynal-Qudat was executed as a heretic at thirty-three, whereas Ibn 2Arabi‘lived a full and long life’, ergothe former was deconstructively subver-sive, the latter in full complicity with metaphysics. What becomes clear,however, from any genuine reading of Ibn 2Arabi, is that his system is nologocentric description of essences and hierarchies inscribed in stone,but rather a series of ladders which ultimately lead one to a ‘station ofno station’.40Ibn 2Arabi’s system, far from being an example of meta-physics, actually leads us past it, to a place where (in Abu Yazid’s words)there is no morning or evening, no attributes or names.A second, connected point maybe that in constructing a provisionarysystem in order to be (ultimately) able to dispense with it – that is, usingnames and entities to talk about that which ultimately is ‘unknown’ andwithout ‘definition’41– Ibn 2Arabi could be said to be putting terms suchas ‘theology’and ‘God’under what Derrida calls ‘erasure’(sous rature).Although this textual strategy of forever deleting the validity of one’sassertions as soon as they are written – but nevertheless retaining thegesture one has deleted – has been used on several occasions by Derrida,the term ‘sous rature’ actually comes from Heidegger’s 1956 work ZurSeinsfrage(Towards A Question of Being). Here Heidegger is trying toreply to Junger’s request for a ‘good definition of nihilism’ (eine guteDefinition des Nihilismus).42Heidegger tells us how ‘no information[keine Auskunft] can be given about nothingness and Being...which canbe presented tangibly [griffbereit vorliegen] in the form of assertions’,which already sounds like Ibn 2Arabi’s understanding of the ungraspableReal. Such a problem, insists Heidegger, ‘leads us into a realm whichrequires a different language [der ein anderes Sagen verlangt]’.43Insuch a realm, Being could only ever be written as Being, just as Ibn2Arabi’s God can only ever be spoken of as God. Such a crossing out(Durchkreuzung) is not merely negative, not simply a reminder of whatone cannot say, but also a pointer towards how much infinitely remainsto be said. Spivak is quite correct in her remark concerning the differentthings Heidegger and Derrida put ‘under erasure’. Whereas Heidegger’sBeingrefers to an ‘inarticulable presence’, Derrida’s concept ofthetraceindicates rather ‘the absence of a presence, an always alreadyabsent present’.44Spivak’s deconstructive suspicion of Heidegger’s‘inarticulable presence’ would also apply to Ibn 2Arabi’s Real. In130The post-structuralist dissolution of the subject"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Derrida, words are placed under erasure because of a restless play withinlanguage, and not because of some semantic inability to express an elu-sive signified ‘out-there’. Semantic instability – that is, radical indeter-minacy within finiteparameters of play – makes such Durchkreuzungnecessary, not the presence of some ineffable unsignifiable which con-stantly makes us lament how ‘finite’ and ‘imperfect’ our language is.Possibly, in any comparison between a medieval Sufi thinker and aFrench post-structuralist, the consequences for the status, reception andultimate re-evaluation of Derrida’s writing remain more significant, bothqualitatively and quantitatively. The first of these must inevitably be a re-assessment of the relationship between deconstruction and the spiritualbelief systems it has (by various quarters) been set against. Which cer-tainly does not mean the sudden re-packaging of deconstruction as apost-religious mysticism, but simply an awareness of the theologicalprovenance of some of its gestures. Kevin Hart has already shown howdeconstruction was first received in the English-speaking world in ‘con-texts that were at the least secular and at the most determinedly atheis-tic’.45Replacing the usual trinity of Nietzsche/Freud/Heidegger, Hartsuggests, one could always try reading Derrida in the context of Jabés,Levinas and Celan. This re-contextualizing of Derrida’s work – the possi-bility that deconstruction might not simply be (in Mark C. Taylor’swords) the hermeneutics of the death of God – in turn suggests the re-linking of Derrida with a much longer tradition. Over the past twentyyears, a wide variety of scholars have been locating moments of anti-metaphysical decentring in a number of religious traditions –Coward’s Sankara, Loy’s Nagarjuna, Dabashi’s 2Ayn al-Qudat, Caputo’sEckhart, Yeh’s Lao-Tzu, to mention but a few. How valid these allegedprecedents are (including the example offered by the present study)remains debatable; what is certain, however, is that the familiar anti-religious/nihilistic reputation of deconstruction – considered in thepast as ‘antitheological scepticism’ (Goodheart), ‘counter-theological’(Gould), ‘non-theological’ (Dufrenne) and even ‘a swipe at Christianityfrom archéto telos’(Schneidenau)46– is going to be increasingly revisedin the light of such research.All of which, in turn, does cast doubt on the various ‘clarifying’ and‘serious’ versions of Derrida which have been offered by critics such asNorris, Gasché and Culler. What is most interesting about such readingsis that they see Derrida not so much as mystifying but explicating, as amethod which ‘accounts for a heterogenous variety...of discursiveinequalities...that continue to haunt even the successfuldevelopmentof philosophical arguments’.47An elucidating view of deconstruction’sThe post-structuralist dissolution of the subject131"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"raison d1êtréwhich stands in stark contrast to Derrida’s words in OfGrammatology: ‘To make enigmatic what one think one understands bythe words ‘proximity’, ‘immediacy’, ‘presence’ is my final intention inthis book’.48To ‘make enigmatic’ means, literally, to darken(from theGreek ainigma). To re-introduce a darkness into what was previouslyilluminated; to obscure something which was felt to be clear. In com-paring Derrida with Ibn 2Arabi, one cannot help how this parallel suspi-cion of rational clarity as something both illusory and restrictive leads toa subsequent affirmation of the uncertain, be it God or text, cloud ordarkness, amaor ainigma, an affirmation which in turn would belong toa much wider history of gestures. In his work Greek Myths and ChristianMystery, Hugo Rahner describes how the flourishing enlightenmentof Greek thought and the arts in the first four centuries after Christ pro-voked, in turn, the desire for a ‘mystery atmosphere’ once more:...the Apollonian brilliance of Greek sculpture...the acids of Atticcomedy, and later the rationalism of the Stoa, dissolved the traditionalbelief in gods and goddesses...[and] led the Greeks increasingly toseek refuge in the eerie realm of the cults.49The enlightenment certainties in Greek thought aroused in many anostalgia for the ancient mystery cults, a yearning for what Rahner callsthe ‘pre-Hellenic darkness’of earlier times: ‘What man now seeks is thebizarre...as against the Olympian calm of classical times’ (ibid.).Which is not to serve up Derrida as the latest swing against systemati-zation in some potted, dialectical history of light and darkness, reasonand feeling, structure and mysticism, but simply to show how the decon-structive gesture – and the authentic darkness it restores to our foolishand overambitious clarities – could be re-inscribed into a very meta-physical history of rebellions against the metaphysical.Perhaps, finally, the most interesting consequence of reading Frenchsixties’ deconstruction in the rather strange context of medieval Sufismis the oddly mystical meaning which many of Derrida’s terms take on –infinity, endless play, the unnamable, the trace, the elusive force whichis ‘“older” than Being itself’.50Of course, there is no God – not even adeus absconditus– in Derrida’s universe which would give these termsthe kind of meaning compatible with a ‘mysticism’. Derrida’s infinitetext, as we have already said, springs from an infinite emptiness, not aninfinite Mind; the Derridean unthinkable lies in the relentless play ofdifferences within the text, and not in some epistemologically ungras-pable notion of the Divine. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see how the132The post-structuralist dissolution of the subject"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"use of such terms cannot escape the echoes of God, cannot elude theghost of the divine; how even remarks concerning ‘the consciousness ofnothing, upon which all consciousness of something enriches itself...’51seem to push différance – as Derrida has already feared – in the direc-tion of the non-present, eternally generative God of negative theology.Derrida’s protestations to the contrary resemble all too well the cries ofthe author who wishes his text to wander in one direction, instead ofanother.Derrida and Ibn 2Arabi disconcert. They make us think twice about thethings we take for granted; they wake us up to the overconfidence withwhich, all too often, we dupe ourselves whenever we talk about ‘truths’we have never really questioned. They raise in us the unsettling possi-bility that all the things we have felt so comfortable about (‘God’,‘truth’, ‘literature’, etc.) may actually be radically unthinkable, formedmore from our own beliefs and experiences rather than embodying thethings themselves. Much in the manner of Eckhartian gelâzenheit, workslike the Futuhatand ‘Structure, Sign and Play’ ask us to remain open–in Derridean terms, open towards the Other, ‘an absolute opennesstowards what is coming’,52a voluntary self-dismantling of all our(pre)conceptions about the Other in order to encounter its true alterity.In Ibn 2Arabi’s case, this translates as remaining open towards God by‘freeing the locus (tafrWgh al-mahall) and sanctifying the heart (taqd3sal-qalb) from the stains of reflective thoughts’.53Once Ibn 2Arabi’s per-fect gnostic finally realizes that the centre he has always worshipped isnot really the centre, he is able to accept the Real in all Its manifesta-tions, without cluttering up his ‘locus’ with his own theologicalconstructs. This emphasis on opening in both deconstructive and Sufiepistemologies forms the most thematic – and yet the clearest – linkbetween two writers who, in their own original ways, make us realizethat what we call ‘God’may not always be God; that what we call ‘Truth’may not always be true.The post-structuralist dissolution of the subject133"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"NotesIntroduction1 Orhan Pamuk, The Black Book, trans.

Because of the importance of the Fusus, this secondary work(called the Naqsh al-Fusus– the ‘Pattern of the Fusus’) also received someattention in the commentary tradition – including, amongst others, JamW’sown Naqd al-nusus fi sharh naqsh al-fusus(‘Selected texts in commentingon the Naqsh al-fusus’), written in 1459.
