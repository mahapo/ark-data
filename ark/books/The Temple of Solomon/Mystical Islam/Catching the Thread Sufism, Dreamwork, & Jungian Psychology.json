It belongs to another dimension, the dimen-sion of the soul. Yet in Catching the Thread LlewellynVaughan-Lee has been able to describe many of thepsychological and spiritual processes experienced bythe seeker, the vicissitudes, the ups and downs, theslow progress on the path to the Real. He shows deepcomprehension of the relationship with the teacher. Inparticular he has described one important event that ishardly mentioned in the great spiritual literature of theworld: the union of the soul of the trainee with the soulof the teacher when the former has reached therequired level of spiritual evolution. This event is agreat mystery; perhaps the analogy of salt when it isdissolved in a glass of water comes nearest to describ-ing it. Using dreams to illustrate the inner happeningsof the soul, Catching the Thread describes the myster-ies of the path in clear, contemporary language thatmust be specially helpful to the modern seeker.Irina Tweedie"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Catching the Threadx"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"xiIntroductionINTRODUCTIONDreamwork is the modern equivalent of theancient Sufi teaching stories.Irina Tweedie1Spiritual life is a response to a call. Of our own accordwe would never turn away from the world and beginthe long and painful journey home. But Someone callsto us, calls to us from within the depths of our heart,awakening our own deepest longing. This call is likea golden thread that we follow, guiding us deeper anddeeper within, always pointing to the beyond. It is bothintimate and elusive, for it does not belong to the mindbut to the deepest core of our being. We hear it mosteasily when the conscious mind is still, which can bein meditation or when we are surrounded by thebeauty of nature. But it is often in dreams that this callcan be heard most clearly. In our sleep, when the outerworld vanishes, our innermost secret can speak to usand guide us on this most difficult journey.Dreams are like mirrors in which we can seeourselves. They reflect back our hidden self, revealingthe true face of our own nature. In our sleep we areshown the mysteries, the beauty, and the horror of ourinner world. Through dreams we can get to know thisstrange and yet familiar land. And when we wake, ourdreams can be a doorway through which we can walkback into this inner world, can step into the landscapeof the soul."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Catching the ThreadxiiIt is through this inner landscape that the spiritualtraveler must find his or her way. The spiritual questtakes us deep into the hidden places of the soul, acrossthe rivers, mountains, and great oceans of the psyche.We in the West have for so long looked only at theouter world that we have forgotten that the greatestjourney is within. It is inside us that the real beauty andmystery are to be found. In the words of St. Augustine:People travel to wonder at the height of themountains, at the huge waves of the sea, at thelong compass of rivers, at the vast compass ofthe ocean, at the circular motion of the stars, andthey pass by themselves without wondering.The path we must follow is within us and here,within the psyche, are the guides that can help us onthis journey. These are the inner figures of wisdom,like the wise old man and woman, and the innocent,eternal child. These figures have long been waiting forus to turn to them and ask their help. They know themost direct path that will take us home, and in ourdreams they come to meet us. Most often they speak tous in the ancient language of symbols and images. Inorder to make best use of their wisdom we need tolearn this symbolic language of the soul. It is for thisreason that Sufis have long valued the wisdom ofdreams and sought to understand the meaning of theirimages.Spiritual life is a process of inner transformation,in which the whole psychic structure of the seeker isaltered. These changes begin deep within the uncon-scious, in the very roots of our being; often theconscious mind is the last to be affected. Like seeds"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xiiiIntroductionplanted deep within the earth, the spiritual processesslowly germinate and may take years to flower intoconsciousness. But through dreams we are told ofthese changes, of the wondrous alchemy of the psychethrough which our inner darkness is turned into gold.If we listen to such dreams we will see our inner pathunfold. From this listening we can gain encouragementand also learn to live in harmony with these innerprocesses. If our conscious mind knows something ofwhat is happening in the depths, we are then able tocooperate as fully as we can and not interfere with thismysterious but highly dynamic unfolding.Modern psychology is invaluable, for it provides alanguage in which we can discuss and understand theprocesses of inner transformation. In particular, thework of Carl Jung and the school of Jungian psy-chology offers the most detailed exploration of thepsychological dynamics experienced on the spiritualpath. Before the advent of Jungian psychology, it wasthe alchemists who, within our Western culture, mostfully described these processes. What the alchemistswere working with in their retorts and crucibles werethe projected contents of their own unconscious, andthe symbolic and often paradoxical nature of alchemi-cal texts reflects the irrational world of the psyche.Jung rediscovered the inner nature of the alchemicalopus and translated the ancient wisdom of the alche-mists into the language of psychology. Through hisintegration of the alchemical tradition with his ownpersonal experiences of the unconscious, he charted amap of the unconscious that provides the contempo-rary seeker with a firm foundation for understandingwhat is happening within the psyche."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Catching the ThreadxivSufism has always stressed the importance of thepsychological aspects of the inner journey. Psycho-logical work is a necessary preliminary stage on thepath, in particular the work on the shadow, thepurification of our lower nature and inner darkness.The processes of psychological integration and purifi-cation create an uncontaminated inner space withinwhich the wayfarer can come to know the secrets of thesoul, the deep mysteries of the heart. However, thelanguage and terminology of most Sufi psychologicaltreatises belong to a different culture from that of theWestern seeker, and these works are not easily acces-sible. Integrating Jungian psychology within the frame-work of the Sufi path gives the wayfarer a valuable toolto work with in order to understand the psychologicaltransformations on the path: how the darkness of theshadow is confronted and transformed, how our innerpartner comes to meet us and helps us on the journey,how the Self arises from the unconscious and throughits symbols reveals our primordial wholeness, thepower and beauty of our innermost nature.Yet, at the same time, many aspects of the pathcannot be understood from a solely psychologicalperspective. The wayfarer seeks to journey far beyondthe ego, even beyond the boundaries of the psyche. Onthis path leading to the Infinite, a psychological ap-proach needs to be integrated with a spiritual perspec-tive, and this is particularly important in dreamwork.While some dreams can be understood from a purelypsychological standpoint, seekers often have dreamsthat require a spiritual context, an understanding of thenature of the journey that leads to love’s infinite ocean.Some dreams not only have a personal meaning to the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xvIntroductiondreamer but, like myths or fairy tales, tell us about thearchetypal nature of this quest. As with the Sufi storiesof old, discussing these dreams can help us to becomefamiliar with the mysterious ways of the heart and helpus to find and follow the almost invisible thread thatleads us home."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Catching the Threadxvi"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"1The Fools of GodTHE FOOLS OF GODThe sect of lovers is distinct from all others;Lovers have a religion and a faith all of their own.Rûmî1BEYOND THE MINDSufis are His most beloved fools, for He has a specialtenderness for those who are lost in love. We talk ofbeing madly in love with a human lover, but those whohave been embraced by a divine lover are lost in adeeper madness, which is at the same time a secret sointimate that it can hardly be told in words. Love cannever be understood by the mind. Those who wish toenter this path must accept that they can never explaineither to themselves or to others the mysterious innerunfolding that is taking them home. The dynamics ofthe heart follow laws so different from those of themind that the seeker needs to begin by accepting themind’s limitations, and realize that on the spiritualjourney rational thought is a hindrance rather than ahelp. In the words of ‘Attâr, “When love comes, reasondisappears. Reason cannot live with the folly of love;love has nothing to do with human reason.”2The thinking processes of the mind have beendeveloped to help us live in this physical world. Theyare very important for learning to drive a motor car orwriting out a shopping list. But from a spiritual per-spective, the mind is a limitation. It is known as “theslayer of the Real,” for it stands between the seeker andthe Real Self, while its constant chatter deafens us to"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread2our inner voice. The mind belongs to this world ofduality. It understands through comparison. If youlook at the workings of the mind you see that it isconstantly comparing (Today is warmer than yester-day, but there is more wind than usual...). The mind isalways caught between the opposites, their oppositionlargely created by the mind. As Prince Hamlet remarks,“there is nothing either good or bad, but thinkingmakes it so.”3Spiritual truth embraces rather than separates theopposites. Truth is not on the level of duality, but theexperience of oneness. It is not found in the mind butin the heart, and on the path the wayfarer is thrownbeyond the mind into a world that can be explainedonly in paradoxes. As the rational mind tries to assimi-late experiences that belong to a different level ofreality, the seeker is constantly left in a state ofconfusion. In the Sufi classic, The Conference of theBirds, ‘Attâr tells the story of how a man’s encounterwith the path results in bewilderment, robbing him ofboth his possessions and his mind through the simpleword “Enter.”An Arab once went to Persia and was aston-ished at the customs of the country. One day hehappened to pass the dwelling of a group of[dervishes] and saw a handful of men who saidnot a word. They had no wives and not even anobol, but they were pure of heart and undefiled.Each held a flask of muddy wine which hecarefully filled before sitting down. The Arabfelt sympathetic towards these men; he stoppedand at that moment his mind and heart fell onto"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"3The Fools of Godthe road. At this the [dervishes] said: “Enter, Oman of nothing!” So he went in, willy-nilly, justlike that! He was given a cup of wine and at oncelost his senses. He became drunk and his strengthwas reduced to nothing. His gold and silver andvaluables were taken from him by one of the[dervishes], more wine was given to him, and atlast they put him out of the house. Then thisArab returned to his own country, one-eyed andpoor, his state changed and his lips dry. Whenhe arrived at his native place his companionsasked him: “What is the matter? What have youdone with your money and valuables? Werethey stolen while you slept? Have you donebadly in Persia? Tell us! Perhaps we can helpyou!”“I was moving about in the street,” he said,“when I fell in with a group of [dervishes]. Iknow nothing else except that my possessionsand I were parted and now I have nothing.”They asked him to describe the [dervishes]. Hereplied, “They simply said to me ‘Enter.’”The Arab remained ever after in a state ofsurprise and astonishment, like a child, anddumbfounded by the word “Enter.”You too, put your foot forward. If you do notwish to, then follow your fantasies. But if youprefer the secrets of the love of your soul youwill sacrifice everything. You will lose what youconsider to be valuable, but you will soon hearthe sacramental word, “Enter.”4"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread4THE SUBVERSION OF THE MINDAs the wayfarer travels along the path, the energies ofthe heart gradually subvert the thinking processes ofthe mind. Because the energy of love is more powerfulthan the mind, it secretly slows down the mind, untilthe mind becomes empty and thus able to experiencethe inner reality of the Self, which is love. Thefollowing dream illustrates this dynamic. It left thedreamer with an experience of love such as he hadnever known before:I was in a hall full of men on soapboxes, whowere giving political speeches to groups ofpeople around them. However, in the hall therewas a small number of men who were subvert-ing all this activity by giving out little slips ofpaper to people around them. Slowly the hallemptied of people and the men on soapboxesleft. When the hall was empty, the five men whohad been secretly subverting the whole processcame together and there was such a feeling oflove between them. I awoke filled with thisfeeling of love.Our minds are so often like this dreamer’s hall, full ofmen on soapboxes bombarding us with differentopinions and ideas. To consciously confront this dy-namic would only feed more energy into the mind, fillthe hall with more people. The Sufi path is subversiverather than confrontational. It works from within, fromthe Self which lives in the very depths of the uncon-scious, in the secret recesses of the heart. The changesbegin far away from the conscious mind, where theycannot be interfered with. Then slowly the energy of"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"5The Fools of Godthe Self filters into consciousness, where it begins thework of altering our thinking processes.The spiritual dynamic is a process of being speededup. To quote St. John, “It is the spirit that quickeneth,”5and as we travel along the path, we tune into, or areinfused with, the higher frequency of our spiritualnature. The energy of the Self is far quicker than thatof our physical or mental bodies. As we meditate andaspire we create a deeper bonding with our Higher Selfwhich allows its quicker energy to be integrated intoour consciousness. It is this energy which transformsus. In the dream of the men on soapboxes, slowly thepeople leave the hall and the room is left empty exceptfor the five men who secretly instigated the process ofsubversion. The energy of the Self gradually speeds upconsciousness and in so doing throws out the slower,denser thought patterns. Then, when the ordinaryconsciousness is empty, the individual is able toexperience the inner reality of love. This is the dreamer’sfinal experience; he tastes the substance of the Self.This transformation is a gradual process becausethe inner energies are so powerful that the structure ofconsciousness needs to be attuned slowly in order tobe able to integrate them. In the words of T. S. Eliot,“human kind cannot bear very much reality”6; this isbecause ordinary consciousness would simply be shat-tered by the higher vibrations of the Self. Our mentalhospitals contain many people who have had anexperience of an inner reality which their conscious-ness could not contain. Just a glimpse of our truenature is awe-inspiring, “awful.” Sometimes, when anindividual begins on the path, when he begins tomeditate, he may be given such a glimpse. This can bean encouragement, but it can also be frightening,because it points beyond the ego and the mind,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread6beyond the known into the unknown. Then a teacheris needed, one who is a few steps further along the wayand speaking from experience can say: “No, you arenot going mad. What you have experienced is notunusual. You have just touched an inner dimensionthat is very different from the external world. It is agood sign.”However, there can also come the time when thehigher energies are necessary to shatter the rigidpatterns of our ordinary consciousness, to break ourself-imposed boundaries. This only happens when theteacher knows that the seeker is ready, usually afteryears of meditation and spiritual practices have silentlyprepared a new inner vessel. This inner work makesthe seeker both finer and stronger, and thus allows himto live in the world of everyday consciousness and atthe same time in tune with the inner dimension of theSelf.Such an experience of inner transition can be bothdramatic and disturbing. It can be triggered by an outersituation or specifically by the teacher. Somethinghappens, often a shock that throws the individual offbalance. Sufi teachers often use shock tactics, evenaccusing the devotee of something totally unjust, todeliberately bring about this unbalancing. When ourconsciousness is totally “balanced” there is no spacefor the higher dimension to come through. As aCanadian psychiatrist observed:When a human being is standing with both feetfirmly on the ground, with both legs on theearth, and is “quite normal” as we medicalpractitioners call it, spiritual life is very difficult,perhaps impossible. But if something is not"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"7The Fools of Godquite right with the mind, a little wheel notworking properly in the clockwork of the mind,then spiritual life is easy.7When the mind is thrown off balance, the higher,faster energies are able to come through, and it is theirvibrations that break up the barriers of consciousness,the patterns of conditioning. At this moment it is vitallyimportant that the seeker surrender to the process,however painful or unjust it may seem. Yet, becausethe values of the Self are so different from those of theego and the conscious mind, the seeker is presentedwith every reason to reject this process of innerdestruction.The values of the ego are a limitation, and for thesincere seeker the teacher or life itself will present theopportunities that will bring about both inner destruc-tion and freedom—if they are unconditionally ac-cepted. But in these situations of pain and inner panic,there is the danger that the seeker will try to hold ontothe wreckage, to find some security in the patterns ofthe past, in parental or social conditioning. Bombardedby the energy of the Self, the wayfarer can find nosecurity except in total insecurity; yet still the ego,frightened by the limitless horizons of the Self, clingsto the world of reason and the limited values of thepast. It clings to the wreckage of a ship that can nolonger take us on any journey, and yet this wreckageprevents us from realizing that we can swim, nakedand alone. In time the wreckage will decay or floataway and the final result will be the same, but it willhave been a longer and more painful journey. Spirituallife has its cycles and there are moments that must begrasped and totally surrendered to. Often these moments"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread8of greatest opportunity are disguised, appear“unspiritual” or cruel. It is said that the teacher puts allappearances against himself, and then tests the dis-ciple. Life does the same. It is best never to reject whatlife brings, and often the most difficult circumstanceshide something of infinite value. The light is hidden indarkness, but the darkness must be fully acceptedbefore the light reveals itself. When the Sufi Abû Sa‘îdibn Abî-l-Khayr was asked what Sufism entailed hereplied: “Whatever you have in your mind—forget it;whatever you have in your hand—give it; whatever isto be your fate—face it!”8KHIDR, THE GREEN MANWe all have free will, and to surrender to a painfulexperience that can appear unjust, even cruel, is nevereasy. This is why Sufi teaching emphasizes the impor-tance of unconditional surrender, surrender to theteacher and surrender to life. It shows how one cannever judge by appearances, as in the following storyof Khidr and Moses as told in the Qur’an:At the place where the two seas meet, Mosesmet Khidr, one whom Allâh had given knowl-edge of Himself. Moses asked Khidr, “May Ifollow you so that you may guide me by thatwhich you have been taught?”“You will not be able to bear with me,” Khidrreplied. “For how can you bear with that whichis beyond your knowledge?”Moses said, “If Allâh wills you will find mepatient; I shall not disobey you in anything.”"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"9The Fools of GodKhidr said, “If you want to follow me, youmust not ask any questions about anything, untilI myself speak to you about it.”The two set out. They embarked on a shipand immediately Khidr bored a hole in thebottom of the ship.“What a strange thing you have done!” ex-claimed Moses. “Have you bored a hole in orderto drown the ship’s passengers?”“Did I not tell you,” he replied, “that youwould not bear with me?” “Pardon my forgetfulness,” said Moses. “Donot be angry with me because of this.”They continued on their journey until theymet a young man. Moses’ companion killed thisyoung man, and Moses said: “You have killed aninnocent man who has done nothing wrong.You have committed a wicked crime.”“Did I not tell you,” Khidr replied, “that youwould not bear with me?”Moses said: “If I ever question you again,abandon me; for then I would have deserved it.”They journeyed on until they came to acertain city. They asked the people for somefood, but these people would not receive themas guests. Finding a wall on the point of fallingdown, Moses’ companion repaired it. Mosessaid to his companion, “If you had wanted, youcould have asked payment for your work.”“The time has now come when we mustseparate,” said Khidr. “But first I will explain toyou the meaning of those acts which you couldnot bear to watch with patience.“The ship belonged to some poor fishermen."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread10I damaged it because if it had gone to sea itwould have been captured by a king who wasseizing every boat by force.“The young man was a criminal, who wouldhave committed many crimes that would havebrought sorrow to many people, including hisparents.“As for the wall, it belonged to two orphanedboys in the city whose father was an honestman. Beneath the wall their treasure is buried.Allâh decreed in his mercy that they should digout this treasure when they grew to manhood.What I did was not by my own will.“That is the meaning of my acts which youcould not bear to watch with patience.”9Three times Moses judged Khidr by the appear-ance of his actions. Three times he failed to remainsilent and accept that one to whom God had revealedHimself sees and acts from a different perspective.What Khidr did was not his will, but the will of Allâh.Moses represents the rational, outer law, the exoteric.Khidr, one to whom Allâh had revealed Himself,“endowed with knowledge of Our Own,” representsthe inner, esoteric path of the mystic. He is thearchetypal figure of the Sufi saint, or wali, who hasdirect inner communion with the Absolute, and fol-lows the inner law, the divine hint, regardless of outerappearances. The Sufi master, Bhai Sahib, stresses howone should never judge by appearances:Saints are like rivers; they flow where theyare directed....

Sometimes the Saints have to dothings the people will misjudge, and which fromthe worldly point of view could be condemned,because the world judges by appearances. Oneimportant quality required on the Path is neverto judge by appearances. More often than notthings look different from what they really are.There is no good or evil for the Creator. Onlyhuman society makes it so. A Saint is beyondgood or evil, but Saints are people of the highestmorality and will never give a bad example.10The teacher may act with seeming coldness, eveninhumanity, but he acts from the level of the Self. Hefollows the laws of a world very different from thephysical plane and is concerned with the real freedomof the seeker, freedom from the ego and the duality ofgood and bad, just and unjust. In this world of illusionall that matters is our relationship with the Beloved.The eighth-century Sufi saint, Râbi’a, expresses this inher usual straightforward manner:O God! if I worship Thee in fear of Hell, burnme in Hell; and if I worship Thee in hope ofParadise, exclude me from Paradise; but if Iworship Thee for Thine own sake, withhold notThine everlasting beauty.11While the religious man avoids evil and strivestowards good, seeking a reward in heaven, the Sufisees the opposites of heaven and hell as a limitation.Furthermore, there is a danger in performing gooddeeds for the sake of the hereafter:"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread12It would mean that the self would reappearon the higher level. We may plant a huge weed,and to eradicate it would be practically impos-sible.12The wayfarer believes only in oneness and seeksthe total annihilation of the ego. Inwardly he seeks toembrace and thus transcend the duality of good andevil; yet, as he travels along the path, he instinctivelyavoids actions that are morally bad, and tends towardsthe good. Evil is denser and slower than good, and asthe wayfarer “speeds up” he is actually unable to enactevil. This does not happen through moral choice,which divides, but through a state of being.The Sufi is interested in neither this world nor thenext, in neither heaven nor hell. He will pay any priceto reach Reality in this life. The price is that “everythinghas to go,” and like any mental belief, the values ofgood and bad can be a limitation. Even the desire torenounce must be left behind. One Sufi poet wrote:“On the hat of poverty three renouncements areinscribed: ‘Quit this world, quit the next world, quitquitting.’”13Rather than being guided by the values andconcepts of the mind, the seeker travels a path thatleads to a natural state of being. As the mind issubverted, a different level of existence is experienced.This is imaged in the following dream:I am reading a book, but the light gets slowlydimmer and dimmer.

We have to reach a point of unknowing, anempty darkness, before we can realize our deeperknowing. The outer wisdom of the world will nevertake us home; we have to give it up, put down thebook, before we can be led back to ourselves, back toour essence. Yet, as this dream images, the seeker doesnot actively renounce anything; rather what she needsto leave behind is taken away. The light, the attitude ofconsciousness with which she followed the outerwisdom, grows dimmer and dimmer and finally goesout.The wise old woman is the dreamer’s inner teacher,who is both her deepest wisdom and the guide whowill take her there. Beckoning to the dreamer she leadsher downstairs, away from the mind into the radianceof her own natural Self, the tree of life that images herown deepest unfolding.14Dreams often amplify each other, describing thesame central dynamic from different perspectives. Thepsyche is not a logical or linear dimension, but a fluidplay of interrelationships whose meaning and signifi-cance are often best conveyed through a series ofdifferent scenes.

This image ofthe twin reflects an ancient tradition of the “heavenlytwin”: we each have our heavenly twin who lives in theworld of light. This twin is invisible to the eyes of thesenses, and is normally reunited with us only at death.The dying words of Mani, the founder of Manicheism,were, “I contemplated my Double with my eyes oflight.”15In the Sufi tradition this heavenly twin is our“witness in heaven” (shâhid fil-samâ), who sees withthe eyes of God and thus sees our life from a spiritualrather than worldly perspective. He or she is interestedonly in the evolution of the soul and can appear atmoments that are important for the spiritual directionof our life. This twin can manifest as an inner prompt-ing, a dream, or even as an external figure. It is usuallyonly afterwards that the importance of such a figure isrecognized, as when Jesus appeared to the two dis-ciples on the road to Emmaus.

They follow the natural lawof their own being, which relates directly to the wholeof life. Yet people who live according to their owninner nature are often a threat to others.

In the middle of thebox is a single hair.There is a custom among lovers that the belovedgives a lock of her hair which the lover treasures aboveanything else. In Victorian times this lock of hair wouldbe placed in a heart-shaped locket, or a ring. But thecustom is much older; it appears in this twelfth-centurySufi poem by ‘Attâr, in which the human beloved is asymbol for the Divine:If I could possess but one strandOf her tresses, I would treasure itAs the heart’s precious eye,As my soul’s own foster love.21The relationship of the lover and the Beloved isthe core of the Sufi path. To quote Bhai Sahib: “In thewhole of the universe there are only Two: the Loverand the Beloved.”22 At the beginning of the journey theBeloved may appear only as an abstraction, as an idearather than a reality. But later the Beloved becomes aninner reality, more tender and intimate than a humanlover can ever be.However distant the Beloved may seem, He isalways infinitely close—in the words of the Prophet,“closer to us than our jugular vein.” He calls to us fromwithin our own hearts, and it is only the mind and the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread18ego that separate us. This relationship is so intimatebecause it is inward—“No one is more inward thanI”23—always taking us deeper within our own being. Itis for this reason it seems so personal, so unshareable,this relationship of essence to Essence. When Krishnawas dancing with sixteen thousand milkmaids, eachthought that he was dancing only with her. Andbecause He, the Great Artist, created each of us unique,our relationship with Him will be unique, different foreach of us. The essence of this relationship is theoffering of our own individual self back to the Creator,an offering which is in its deepest sense an act ofprayer: “Every being has his own appropriate mode ofprayer and glorification.”24 For each seeker the spiri-tual path will be different, because each of us isdifferent. Every lover makes his own unique pilgrim-age within the heart. And He loves us each for our ownindividual self. He loves the fact that we are differentbecause He made us different.In this love affair there can be neither comparisonnor competition. We each must find our own way ofloving Him, of being with Him. The love affair with theBeloved is so inward that we will share ourselves withHim as with no outer lover. It is in this sense that a loveaffair with Him is easier than any other love affair. Weknow in our heart that He will never betray us. And justas we come naked to a human lover, we should comenaked to the Beloved. Our clothes are our personality,conditioning, and attachments that separate us fromHim who is our own deepest Self. When we are nakedHe can touch us more tenderly, be more intimate withus. “And the time will come when one wishes thattwenty-four hours should be twenty-five in order tolove someone one hour more.”25"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"19The Fools of GodPOEMS OF THE SOULThe relationship with the Great Beloved does notbelong to the ego or the personality.

It is a dream ofthe past, the present, and the future.The images of dreams have their own patternwhich reflects the pattern of the soul. But their mean-ing can also be unfolded, the richness of their tapestrymore fully understood. Such dreams can teach usabout the inner processes of the psyche, pointing fromthe psychological dynamics of the past to the transfor-mations that take us to the beyond.THE KING’S MISTRESSIn this dream the dreamer enters the house of her ownpsyche, to discover that behind its modern façade is anancient and “indescribably beautiful” inner world,imaged as a Middle-Eastern palace. This is the fairy-taleworld of the soul, where we are all kings and queens,princes and princesses, and also wizards and witches.Our dreamer is the mistress of the king and wears thejewels and perfumes of a woman of pleasure. The kingis the ruling masculine principle in the dreamer’s life,and later in the dream he is associated with her fatherand the world of her conditioning. From our parentswe inherit not just our physical features, but also ourattitudes and outlook on life. Their values become ourvalues, and the fact that the dreamer is the king’smistress indicates the way the dreamer allows her truefemininity to be used for another’s pleasure. Shesuffers the collective plight of the feminine madesubservient by centuries of patriarchal pressure.

For behind the pressure thathas made women subservient to men lies an inner andmore powerful dynamic: the repression of the femi-nine principle itself. The inner wisdom and creativemystery of the feminine have been buried and forgot-ten, and only the external goals of the masculineremain.Entering the bedchamber of the king, the dreamerplays the part of the mistress. But the inner dynamichas changed, for she knows that he is old and impo-tent, and “this is the last time.” The old and impotentking is a powerful mythic image, best known in theGrail legend of the Fisher King. In the story of theFisher King, the wounding and impotence of the kinghave resulted in his kingdom’s becoming a wasteland.In our dream the wasteland motif is suggested in thedreamer’s awareness that she is just “an object.” To be“an object” in a relationship is a denial of that which ismost precious: one’s own individual self. As “anobject” one cannot experience real relating, only asense of inner desolation. If the individual is notvalued, she becomes neglected and forlorn. Without areal exchange there can be no creativity; nothing canbe born. And just as this is true on the outer stage ofhuman relationships, it is also true of the inner dy-namic within the psyche. The inner and outer mirroreach other. The king’s impotence is the inability of thedreamer’s conditioning to relate to her real self.

The wind isalways the wind of the spirit, and this spiritual forcethat blows away the past comes from the left, from theunconscious. The seeds of inner change lie burieddeep within the psyche, hidden from the light ofconsciousness. In the innermost chamber of the heartthe Real Gardener tends these seeds, for they are theseeds of His own unfolding. There they germinate andgrow, until finally they force themselves into con-sciousness, and He begins to reveal Himself.With the wind comes a voice from the bed, theplace of her surrender to the king. In a dream adisembodied voice is usually the voice of the HigherSelf, and here the voice tells her to return everythingthat she has acquired in her life: “my conditioning andattitudes, everything that I have stolen or has beenthrust upon me by others, by my parents, etc.” We areborn into this world both physically and psychologi-cally naked, but only too soon are we clothed in thevalues of the world, burdened by our conditioning,imprisoned by the desires of the ego. Spiritual liferequires that we free ourselves of these burdens. Toquote Bhai Sahib: “You come naked into the world andyou go naked. When you come to the Spiritual Teacher,you have to be naked!”26You can only approach the spiritual path as yourtrue self, and much of the inner work that prepares theseeker for the path is a process of stripping away all thelayers of conditioning that hide and protect us fromourselves.

These inner gifts come from the arche-typal world of the soul, which the Greeks projectedonto the gods of Olympus. They can include the joyousecstasy of Dionysus, the dark wisdom and healingpowers of Hecate, the homemaking warmth of Hestia,or the valor of Ares. The gifts of the gods are many andbountiful, and we all have our share. But mostly theyare hidden beneath the shadows of our personalpsyche. In our nakedness, our archetypal essenceshines.

We are made in the image of ThatWhich Is The Source Of All Light, The Origin Of AllBeauty. Each human being is a unique manifestation ofHis light, a unique reflection of His beauty. And a partof the mystery of the creation is that the feminineprinciple of matter embodies these qualities. In discov-ering her deeper Self, a woman has access to thismystery and can realize the divine beauty of her ownbody.

This is not just for the superficial purposeof personal appeal, which is related to egogratification, but out of respect for the nature ofthe feminine. Her beauty derives from a vitalconnection to the Self.27Yet, with the repression of the feminine, thesacredness of this mystery has been abused; thisconnection with the Self has been almost lost. Just asthe dreamer adorned herself with finery and jewels forthe pleasure of the king, so has the beauty of thefeminine body been prostituted for the pleasure ofmen. Women have learned to value themselves inrelation to men rather than in relation to their innerselves.In returning the clothes of her conditioning, thedreamer is able to discover, to see “for the first time,”the real nature of her body’s beauty, which is that it is“radiant and full of love.” Love is the substance of theSelf, and beauty is love made manifest.

In becoming naked we cometo know our real nature, and then one of the greatspiritual mysteries is revealed: what we find under ourown clothes is none other than He. As Muhammadsaid: “He who knows himself knows his Lord.” Thedeeper we go within, the more clearly we realize thatthere is no separation, no duality, that the Creator andthe creation are one. It is only because of the coveringsof the ego that we ever experience separation. In thewords of the Sufi poet, Hâfiz: “Between the lover andthe beloved there must be no veil. Thou thyself artthine own veil, Hâfiz—get out of the way!”29Spiritual nakedness is our deepest and most natu-ral state. And while the act of undressing—of taking offthe clothes of this world—may require considerableeffort, nakedness is an effortless state. It is a state ofbeing. The seeker works with all her energy to removeher coverings, to polish the mirror of the heart.

In this mirror she can see her own light, whichis also the light of her Beloved’s eyes. This glance is agift, and it is not given to the seeker alone. The mirrorof the heart reflects upon all who look. In the story“The Emperor’s New Clothes” the king’s nakednessreflects the stupidity and ignorance of those who seehim. Only the innocent child sees the truth: that theemperor has no clothes on. Spiritual nakedness alsoreflects, but in wisdom, not ignorance. Those who lookcan see both their own beauty and their blemishes.They can see behind the coverings of the persona tothe deeper layers of both light and darkness. In justbeing herself the wayfarer has a dynamic effect uponothers: they are able to see themselves as they reallyare.The anxieties of the dreamer vanish when sherealizes that people will not see her nakedness but“only the light or themselves reflected back.” Then, inher new-found nakedness she is able to take off the lastarticle from the past: “the ring which the old king hadgiven me.” At this moment in the dream she realizesthat the old king is her father. As her father’s mistressshe was caught within the Oedipus complex, theprimary stage of sexual identification in which the sonis in love with his mother and the daughter with herfather. In this unconscious dynamic a girl first connectswith her own sexuality, her own deep femininity,through her relationship with her father. Later thisprojection is broken when the girl falls in love withanother man, but it can often be complicated by thedaughter’s being her father’s anima figure, “Daddy’slittle girl,” whom he does not want to lose to anotherman.30 But the dreamer’s father has given her a ringmade of four silver threads. Silver is the color of the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread28feminine, and four the number of psychological whole-ness. This ring symbolizes her feminine wholeness,which was given her by this first relationship.For our dreamer, the king, who symbolizes collec-tive masculine values, in particular the goals of mate-rial wealth, became identified with her father, and ashis mistress she was never true to herself. She wasgoverned by what she felt she ought to be, rather thanexperiencing her true nature. Even in consciouslyrebelling against her father’s values she was stillunconsciously a slave to them; she was still his mis-tress. But the dynamics of the psyche do not follow thelaws of reason. Jung said of the path of individuationthat “the longest way is often the shortest.” The king,her father, gave her something most precious: her owncomplete femininity.Although the ring is a symbol of her own feminin-ity, the fact that the four silver strands are twistedsuggests that, in her relationship with her king andfather, her feminine self had become twisted. She hadnot been true to herself and so twisted the strands ofher real nature. Now that she stands naked and is nolonger the king’s mistress, she is able to “untwist thefour strands of silver wire,” under which is somethinginfinitely precious, a “fine, gold filament.” This goldhair is a gift from the Beloved, given long, long ago:Before there was a trace of this world of men,I carried the memory of a lock of your hair,A stray end gathered within me, though unknown....From the moment of time’s first drawn breath,Love resides in us,A treasure locked into the heart’s hidden vault.31"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"29The Fools of GodThis image of the fine gold hair is the same love-token as in the dream of the gift of a box in which therewas a single hair. However deep it is hidden, we allcarry this love-token within our hearts. It is the goldenthread that will take us home. The way home is alover’s return into the arms of the Beloved; to makethat journey we must follow the thread of love that wehave within us. Sometimes we don’t find this thread;we search all over the world but never look “into theheart’s hidden vault.” Sometimes, as with the dreamer,we hardly notice it, because it is “dull from beinghidden so long.” But it is always there, waiting to befound. St. Gregory of Nyssa wrote that “The path ofLove is like a bridge of hair across a chasm of fire,” andthe dreamer recognizes that the golden hair is thatbridge. With this recognition her heart opens and sheis filled with an “overwhelming, indescribable feelingof love.”Love is the greatest power in creation. It is theenergy that transforms the seeker, dissolving the veilsof separation. “All you need is love,” for this power ofthe heart will take us where we cannot even imagine.The heart is as big as the universe; everything iscontained within it. In the words of the Prophet, “Myearth and My heaven containeth Me not, but the heartof My faithful servant containeth Me.”32Our dreamer has found the talisman of her realBeloved and is “magically transported” to the prince’sbedchamber. They are to be married and he will thenbe the new king. The mystic marriage is a sacredcommitment in which everything is surrendered intothe hands of love.

He willbecome everything for her and their love will trans-form her. When she wakes from the dream she knowsthis; she knows that she is going home. But then sheis “overtaken with tremendous grief, longing, and thefeeling of painful separation.” One sip of the wine oflove and one is lost forever. The world turns sour andone will do anything, even die, for just another sip.

The masculineside of love is “I love you.” Love’s feminine quality is“I am waiting for you; I am longing for you.” For theSufi it is the feminine side of love—the longing, the cupwaiting to be filled—that takes the seeker home intothe arms of the Beloved. The lover knows that longingis the most precious poison, as is expressed in a Sufi’sprayer:Give me the pain of Love, the Pain of Lovefor Thee!Not the joy of Love, just the Pain of Love,And I will pay the price, any price youask!All myself I offer for it, and the priceyou will ask on top of it!Keep the joy for others, give me the Pain,And gladly I will pay for the Pain of Love!2This longing, this pain in the heart, is planted likea seed by the One who knocks on the door of our heart"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread32and calls us to Him. Before we look for Him, He mustfirst look upon us. Then, when He wants us forHimself, He poisons us with longing. This poisonbrings about a painful death, as we die to the world ofthe ego. Sometimes it begins with a sense of discon-tent, what Saint Thomas Aquinas called “the divinediscontent.” Nothing in life seems quite right; some-thing is missing but one does not know what. There isa dull ache in the unconscious that begins to force itselfupon our attention. Slowly the outer world loses itsattraction, and it begins to dawn upon our conscious-ness that we want something else, something that doesnot belong to this world. Then the spiritual searchbegins. We meditate, aspire, look for a teacher, and aswe do, so the ache in the heart begins to burn, thelonging to grow. The more we aspire, the more weblow upon the flames in the heart. The tears that we cryare the homesickness of the soul and these tears pointout the path. The pain of love has only one cure: “Onlyunion with the Friend can cure it.” Not only is it ourpain, but because He is not other than us, it is also thepain of His love for us. It takes us along the burningroad that leads to the death of the ego. He will notallow any other comfort than His touch, any otherhealing than His embrace. A story from the life of theninth-century Sufi, Dhû-l-Nûn, the Egyptian, illustratesthis:I was wandering in the mountains when Iobserved a party of afflicted folk gathered to-gether. “What befell you?” I asked.“There is a devotee living in a cell here,” theyanswered. “Once every year he comes out and"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"33The Feminine Side of Lovebreathes on these people and they are allhealed. Then he returns to his cell, and does notemerge again until the following year.”I waited patiently until he came out. I behelda man pale of cheek, wasted and with sunkeneyes. The awe of him caused me to tremble. Helooked on the multitude with compassion. Thenhe raised his eyes to heaven, and breathedseveral times over the afflicted ones. All werehealed.As he was about to retire to his cell, I seizedhis skirt. “For the love of God,” I cried. “Youhave healed the outward sickness; pray heal theinward sickness.”“Dhû-l-Nûn,” he said, gazing at me, “takeyour hand from me. The Friend is watching fromthe zenith of might and majesty. If He sees youclutching at another than He, He will abandonyou to that person, and that person to you, andyou will perish each at the other’s hand.”So saying, he withdrew into his cell.3Sometimes we try to run away from this pain, hideourselves in other corners of our life. In the complexi-ties of the mind and its barrage of doubts we can try todeny this call:I fled Him, down the nights and down thedays;I fled Him, down the arches of the years:I fled Him, down the labyrinthine waysOf my own mind; and in the midst of tearsI hid from Him, and under running laughter.4"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread34But once the Great Lover has looked into our heartand planted His longing there, however far we fleefrom Him we carry within us our own deepest secret:that He wants us for Himself.

Are we prepared to give upeverything, even ourselves, for something of which themind knows nothing? Do we want the beyond of thebeyond? A woman had the following dream soon aftershe first came to our group:The teacher stood in front of me and said,“You should wear your hair back like this andhave a white cashmere sweater.” But I replied,“No. I want the beyond of the beyond.” Then theteacher grew in size and became enormous, vastand threatening, and said, “Is this what youreally want?” And I said, “Yes.” Then the teacherbecame smaller and said, “Actually it won’t betoo difficult.”This dreamer had suffered much in her life and herinner discontent had isolated her for many years beforeshe came to our group.

I am told that I have missed an oppor-tunity.This dreamer was not yet ready to pay the ultimateprice, himself. Other opportunities would follow, buthe would have to learn how to give himself away, howto allow himself to be taken.SURRENDERING TO THE PATHOn the Sufi path the greatest importance is given tosurrender. We have to learn to surrender to the inneralchemy that will transform us. The seeker does noth-ing; he simply allows this process to take place. It is aprocess that takes us far beyond the ego. It can neverbe grasped by the mind, for it belongs to the mysteryof the heart. The veils of separation cannot be removedby the wayfarer, only by the Beloved:Know that you are your own veil which con-ceals yourself from you. Know also that youcannot reach God through yourself, but that youreach Him through Him.

Thisprocess of withdrawal does not mean that the wayfarerphysically retires into seclusion, but rather that there isa period of introversion, a descent into the depths ofthe unconscious in order to find one’s true foundation,the rock of the Self. This period of introversion is oftenlonely and involves breaking the old patterns in whichexternal life was lived from the perspective of the egoand patterns of conditioning. The alchemists called thisstage the putrefactio. Putrefaction is the rotting thatbreaks down dead bodies. The old structures of con-sciousness have to be broken down before the new canbe born.This stage of introspection also has the quality of“brooding,” as the energy of consciousness withdrawsinto the unconscious.

It is really as if attention warmed theunconscious and activated it, thereby breakingdown the barriers that separated it from con-sciousness.7The energy which is withdrawn into the uncon-scious is needed to hatch the egg, the symbol ofpotential wholeness and new birth. This wholenesswill be the Self, the union of consciousness and theunconscious, which is also a preexistent center ofconsciousness. As an egg it has always existed in thedepths of the psyche, but it needs this inner concentra-tion of energy in order to be hatched and becomeconscious. After a period of depression another friendhad the following dream, which points to the cominginto consciousness of an aspect of her real nature.

There was the mostbeautiful feeling about this, and a voice said,“This time the birth will not be difficult.”The awakening of the Self is the most naturalprocess; it is the natural flowering of the soul.

One friend who haddeep counseling and healing skills spent this timedoing the most mundane job as receptionist in agarage. Each time she tried to change this job forsomething more interesting, she was given a hint toremain.It is very important that this process of innerreadjustment be completed before the outer worldbegins to make extra demands. Otherwise when exter-nal pressure is applied the individual will revert toprevious patterns and conditioned responses, and thework that has been done in centering on the Self isrendered useless. One needs to develop the quality ofpatience that allows the inner processes to mature intheir own time, and to hold the space in the psyche sothat the desires of the ego or the attitudes of amasculine, goal-oriented culture do not interfere. More-over, because such “feminine” soul-work is alien to ourculture, it often requires great strength and courage notto interfere with it. In the words of Lao Tsu:Do you have the patience to waittill your mud settles and the water is clear?Can you remain unmovingtill the right action arises by itself?8"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread40This “work without doing” is our natural way ofbeing, but like many aspects of the feminine, it hasbeen repressed and forgotten. The Sufi path teaches usto trust and surrender to something deeper than theego, to develop the feminine qualities of waiting andpatience. Thus we are able to remember the wisdom ofour own natural unfolding and the natural harmony inwhich the inner and outer work together. When theinner processes are complete, the outer situation willoften change of its own accord. When it was time forthis friend’s inner potential as a therapist and healer tobe fully used in service to others, the job as a garagereceptionist ended by itself.The fact that we live in a culture that does notvalue inner work has created a negative collectiveconditioning that is encountered by anyone who turnsaway from the outer world to look within. This collec-tive pressure makes us doubt the importance of whatwe are doing. Old friends will question us, may evenattack our need to look within. In abandoning the ego-goals of the external world, we are confronting apowerful collective force, a conditioning that is itselfthreatened by anyone who sincerely seeks to findsomething deeper. Furthermore, because the urge toturn away from the world does not come from the ego,but from deep within the unconscious, the consciousmind does not understand what is happening and istherefore easily influenced by collective pressure. Thisis why a spiritual group is so important. A group ofsincere seekers provides a sacred space which valuesthe inner processes and to some degree protects theaspirant from the collective forces that try to under-mine inner work. This is one of the reasons that theSufis give so much significance to just being together.Meditating, sharing dreams, or just talking about every-"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"41The Feminine Side of Loveday things, wayfarers support each other, create ahome away from home in which spiritual aspirationsare not attacked but accepted and understood.The Sufi group provides great support, but on thepath there is always the danger that any support canbecome a limitation, an obstacle to the wayfarer’sstanding on her own feet, making her own individualjourney. There is always the danger that introversioncan become stagnation, that withdrawal can becomeescapism. If there is the danger of this happening, theteacher will follow the ancient tradition of throwingthe seeker out of the group. Irina Tweedie spent a yearand a half with her Sufi teacher, Bhai Sahib, before hesent her back to England, sending her off with anger,in order to force her to experience a complete outerbreak with him: “Go!... I don’t want to see your uglyface again! Go away!” Thrown out, one is thrown upononeself, for although the Sufi group is a refuge whenit is needed, it is never allowed to limit the develop-ment of the seeker. It is a place for creative work, notfor escape.THE PARADOX OF THE EFFORTLESS PATHIn the dream in which the dreamer’s longing took heraway from people, out onto the open plain, the processof introversion and turning away from the world wasjust beginning. But the dream outlined the course ofher inner journey, helped her to understand whatwould happen. Dreams are signposts, and at importantmoments in our life they often point out the path weare to follow, so that we can consciously cooperatewith the changes that are happening in both our innerand outer lives."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread42On the open plain the dreamer prays for a sign, foran answer to her longing. When the longing starts toburn within the heart we cry from the very depths, andsuch a cry is always answered, though sometimes it isanswered in a way that we cannot see or understand.For this dreamer the answer is a little white cloudappearing on the horizon. A cloud symbolizes amessage from God, which here appears on the horizonof her consciousness and then comes towards her,growing and becoming gold-vermilion. The dreamerhad recently come to our Sufi group, which belongs tothe Naqshbandi tradition. Naqshbandis are known asthe “silent Sufis” because they practice the silent dhikr,the silent repetition of the name of God; they are alsoknown as the “Golden Sufis,” because the color of theenergy of this path is golden yellow. The energy of thispath had come into her life, was now being lived withthe bright red vermilion of life. This energy was ananswer to the prayer she had cried in her desolationand aloneness. In the dream it comes above her as acloud and “golden light” falls like rain. The grace ofGod falls like rain and is His gift to those who haveturned their faces away from the world to seek Him.The dreamer is then “sucked into this cloud andspun around very fast.” She is taken into the energy ofthe path which will transform her totally. In thisNaqshbandi Sufi system we are spun so fast we lose allsense of direction and in the end we lose everything;everything is thrown off by the spinning. The energyof the path activates the heart chakra, spinning it fasterand faster. This increases the energy of love which isthe driving force of spiritual transformation.

In a dreammentioned earlier, the dreamer resisted this energy,tensed his neck and did not let it be broken, and so wastold that he had “missed an opportunity.” Here thedreamer lets herself be sucked in and spun around. Itis “a tremendous experience.”After this tremendous experience the dreamerfeels thin and weak. This echoes a dream Irina Tweediehad in which she was looking at herself in a mirror andsaw that she was very thin and pale. Her teacher, BhaiSahib, gave her this interpretation: “It is a very gooddream. Thin and thinner, until nothing will remain.”9Everything must go—all attachments, all desires. Inorder to realize the Eternal Nothingness, the Reality ofRealities, the ego must die; we must become nothing.The dreamer’s being “thin and weak” also reflectsthe fact that the spiritual energies that produce thistransformation are very powerful. Their intensity isoften bewildering, and the process of inner change canbe very exhausting, both physically and psychologi-cally. In particular, these energies work on the sympa-thetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. These arethe autonomic nervous systems that function belowthe threshold of consciousness. According to Jung,“the unconscious is largely identical with the sympa-thetic and parasympathetic systems, which are thephysiological counterparts of the polarity of uncon-scious contents.”10 The spiritual energies, working onthese nervous systems, activate the contents of theunconscious. Therefore, on the physical level it isimportant to take care of the physical body by exercis-ing and eating well, and also to be prepared foremotional stress, as all the repressed feelings and pastpain come to the surface and are cleared out.

The animusis the figure which mediates between the inner worldof the feminine and the external world; thus hispositive support will enable her to integrate her innerexperiences into the fabric of everyday life.In the final image of the dream a young girl comesand asks the dreamer to help her have this experience.But the dreamer just points at her heart and says “It’sall in there. I can’t do anything; you have to do ityourself.” This response points to the paradox of theeffortless path: although everything is given, you haveto do it all yourself. A man once came to our group andasked someone about what the teacher did. “Does sheteach you?” “No,” was the reply. “Does she givepractices?” Again the answer was “No.” “What does shedo then?” “Nothing; you have to do it all yourself.” Theman left and never returned.The Naqshbandi Sufi path, as I have experiencedit, has little outward form or structure. At our meetingswe meditate, drink tea, and discuss dreams. Within thedynamic of the group the individual is given theopportunity to work upon himself, to meditate, aspire,to go deep within the unconscious and accept both thelight and the darkness that are found there. The pathto the beyond is unique for each seeker.

Work on thy salvation dili-gently.Every effort is required to walk along a path thatis as narrow as the edge of a sword. Two cannot walktogether, for it is the journey of the soul back to theSource, an offering of our own unique self back to theCreator. Within the group the seeker is given immensesupport, but there comes the time when any externalsupport becomes a limitation, and one must continuealone. Even in the midst of family life and surroundedby loving friends, one finds oneself so deeply alonethat it is like being in an empty desert with only thesound of the wind howling. Such inner states totallyovershadow external circumstances. This stage on theeffortless path was beautifully imaged in a dream inwhich people were sliding down a golden slide, butthere came a point where the slide narrowed andeveryone had to go through alone.

Abû Sa‘îd al-Kharrâzsummed up this paradox:Whoever believes he can reach God by hisown efforts toils in vain; whoever believes hecan reach God without effort is merely a travel-ler on the road of intent.12A NATURAL STATE OF BEINGThere are two ways to attract God’s love: either webecome perfect, and He has to love us; or we offer ourwhole self to Him in utter humility, and He cannot helpbut love us. The Sufi chooses the latter path, that of thelover who waits for the Beloved. The following twodreams point to differences between the masculineand the feminine attitudes to spiritual life. They weredreamt by a man. The first dream he had before hecame to our group, the second dream after he hadspent an afternoon sitting with us.FIRST DREAM: I am driving very fast up aroad which goes into the sky.

The dreamer is driving as fastas he can into the sun. The spiritual quest is always ajourney into the unknown, and the dreamer cannot seewhere he is going; but, even when the road curves tothe right, he goes “straight on.” The attitude in thesecond dream is very different; it is imaged by anAmerican Indian sitting in dhyana. Dhyana is themeditation of the heart practiced on this Sufi path. Thewayfarer fills the heart with love, and as thoughts comeinto the mind, they are drowned in the heart. Techni-cally it is not meditation, but a form of yogic relaxation,in which, as the heart chakra is activated, the indi-vidual mind is thrown into the universal mind. Throughsurrendering the mind to the heart, the seeker surren-ders the ego to the energies of love that will transformthe psyche and give birth to the Self. Rather than thedreamer’s driving into the sun, which is a symbol of theSelf, “the sun in the sky is coming towards us.”The figure of the American Indian points towardsthe feminine nature of this path, which works inharmony with the deepest forces of nature. Tradition-ally, the American Indians lived in harmony withnature and saw everything as part of one sacred whole.They understood the natural rhythms of life and theirspiritual purposes. Just as the Indians saw the outerworkings of nature as symbolic and sacred, so can wesee her inner workings as holy, and learn to live inharmony with our inner nature and the instinctualenergy that flows deep within the psyche.

There follows a peaceful-ness, joy, and truthfulness not to be put intowords. The teacher comes and hugs me aroundmy belly. I carry this wonderful state whereverI go.

Irina Tweedie describes howthis most challenging work was very different fromwhat she expected when she met her Sufi teacher:I had hoped for instructions in Yoga, ex-pected wonderful teachings, but what theTeacher did was mainly to force me to face thedarkness within myself, and it almost killed me.In other words he made me “descend into hell,”the cosmic drama enacted in every soul as soonas it dares lift its face to the Light.2The energy of love activates the unconscious,bringing us face to face with our own darkness,enabling us to purify the psyche and prepare a spacewhere lover and Beloved can meet.THE BIRTH OF THE SHADOWOnly when the sun is directly above do we not cast ashadow; only in the full light of the Self do we not havea dark side.

But all inner workbegins with work upon the shadow. It is the basicfoundation of any psychological or spiritual path. Onefriend had an auspicious first day at our group. Thetoilet drains had become blocked, and he offered tohelp clear them. Rather than sitting in meditation, hespent his first afternoon standing in sewage andunblocking the pipes. When the teacher heard aboutthis she said that it was a very auspicious sign: itshowed that he meant business. For the next few yearshe worked psychologically on what he had begunsymbolically. He went into the world of the shadowand cleaned out his own mess.But what is this shadow, this inner darkness?Where did it come from? Why does it haunt us? Theshadow belongs to the world of duality, to the worldin which light and darkness oppose each other. In theprimal oneness of the Self there is no shadow; in thedazzling darkness of the beyond there is no differen-tiation between light and darkness. As a child we comeinto this world from oneness, and in the eyes of a babyone can still glimpse an undivided wholeness. But aswe take on the clothes of this world, so we becomecaught in its play of duality. The child’s first experienceof this duality is often in his experience of the good andbad breast. In different ways duality begins to break upour inner experience of wholeness, and we are gradu-ally expelled from paradise.Mankind, with the gift of consciousness, has theability to know good and evil, to accept and to reject,to differentiate good from bad, to turn away from thedarkness and look to the light.

Thus the shadow isborn, the psychological split between the ego and itsdark twin.Our consciousness creates our shadow, and as wegrow up and take on the clothing and values of ourculture, we begin to be weighed down by this rejectedself. The wayfarer who wishes to make the journeyhome has to confront the split within himself, has todescend into his inner darkness and undertake thepsychological work of confronting and integrating theshadow. He has to accept his own dark side, what Jungdescribes asthe “negative” side of the personality, the sum ofall those unpleasant qualities we like to hide,together with the insufficiently developed func-tions and contents of the personal unconscious.3Consciousness creates the shadow, but the charac-ter of our dark twin is usually determined by our familyand culture. In A Little Book on the Human ShadowRobert Bly suggests that when we were one or twoyears old we were a whole ball of energy until webegan to notice “that our parents didn’t like certainparts of that ball.”4 In order to be loved and accepted,the child begins to put parts of itself into an invisiblebag that is carried behind. We are told not to be angryand so anger goes into the bag. If certain feelings arenot allowed to be expressed in the family, evenfeelings of love and tenderness, they find their wayinto this invisible bag, which slowly grows full of one’sown energy, energy that has no place in the externalworld.

Love and affection are“bought” by filling the bag with one’s own preciousindividuality, which by its very nature often makesunwelcome demands.Then, as we grow up and go to school, differentsets of pressures come to bear that force parts ofourselves out of the sunlight and into the darkness.Competition, the drive to work hard, and most of all thepeer pressure to fit in can result in more of our owntrue self’s being discarded to fester in the murkycorners of our lives, in our moods and reactions.In the journey towards adulthood we becomeindividuals and develop conscious identities. But at thesame time the opposite—that which we have no wishto be—constellates in the darkness. The ego developsits dark twin, and often the stronger the ego the darkerthe shadow; the greater the strength of the consciousself, the more power it has to repress unwanted aspectsinto the unconscious. If one is brought up to beindependent and value self-sufficiency, a needy childwill then begin to cry in the darkness. The greater thedrive towards independence, the louder are the un-heard cries of the child. The unacknowledged desire tobe mothered and looked after can easily harden intocoldness, a coldness towards one’s own vulnerabilityand needs, towards the child one carries within. Thechild then appears through projection: those peoplewho express their own neediness evoke anger ordisgust—“Why can’t they look after themselves? Whyare they so needy, so wanting to be mothered?”Caught in the duality of our shadow, we project itsdarkness onto others.

Then, if we follow our negativereactions to others, they will lead us to this rejectedself:I looked and looked, and saw and sawThat what I thought was you and youIs really me and me.First we have to find the shadow. Then once it isacknowledged, it can be embraced. To acknowledgethe shadow does not mean to live it out; we do not haveto become a needy child. Rather we have to accept ourshadow, nurture the child from within. If our shadowis bitchiness or cruelty, we have to look at and love thatdespised part of ourself. Such confrontation is no easytask: it is always easier to blame someone else. More-over, as we start to acknowledge our own faults andinadequacies, the ego identity which we have socarefully constructed begins to crumble:The individual’s specious unity that emphati-cally says “I want, I think” breaks down underthe impact of the unconscious. So long as [theindividual] can think that somebody else (hisfather or mother) is responsible for his difficul-ties, he can save some semblance of unity....

In these murky waters we will meet not only ourpersonal darkness, but also our dark family heritage.Every family has its skeletons, which are kept carefullylocked away from consciousness, and they are oftenpowerful bonding agents holding a family togetherwith shared guilt or co-dependency. This bond ofdarkness can last for generations, as expressed in thesaying “the sins of the fathers shall be visited upon thechildren unto the third and fourth generation.”In this shared darkness individual members of thefamily may also carry the shadow of others. In particu-lar children carry the shadow of their parents, which isone of the reasons that the relationship betweengrandparents and grandchildren lacks the conflicts thatdominate many parent-child relationships.A child grows up in the psychic atmosphere of hisparents. The repressed shadow of the parents domi-nates this psychic soup, and the child easily “picks itup.” Also the parent can unknowingly project his or hershadow onto a child.

From theage of two I had carried the sensitivity and vulnerabil-ity of his feminine self.From generation to generation such patterns canbe passed on in the unconscious. Only when they areconsciously accepted is the chain broken, and then notonly the future but also the past is healed.

This whole process is outlined in the followingdream:There was a basement which led downstairsto a locked door. There was a feeling of greatdanger there. I didn’t want to go in but I knewthat someday I had to. As I was leaving, a hugeferocious beast with great teeth came after me.I ran away and it charged after me. Then it camein another form, as a grey Volvo car with hugegrates on the front. It pulled up and this womangot out. She was emanating cruelty. I knew thatshe was very dangerous, but she was in a formthat was safe. Then at the end of the dream I amwatching a parade and there is a beautiful greenstar with golden letters which spell “ALCHEMY.”Behind the locked door in the basement lives theshadow. Repressed into the unconscious, our rejectedself is often locked away, and then, like a caged beast,it becomes dangerous. In the darkness the rejectedpsychic energy festers, and it also attracts to itself otherenergies from other parts of the unconscious. Then apersonal anger can become fueled from a deeper source.In the undifferentiated world of the psyche the personalshadow merges with darker archetypal energies.To venture behind the locked door in any base-ment is no easy task, nor should it be lightly under-taken. There are good reasons for keeping this doorlocked. Many monsters can be found lurking in theshadows behind it.

We may try to avoid or run away from thisdeeper destiny, but we know its significance and howour life needs us to live it.Understandably our dreamer is reluctant to unlockthe door into the basement, but as she is leaving, “thishuge ferocious beast with great teeth came after me.”Possibly, if she had opened the door and looked thedanger in the face, it would not have been so ferocious,for the power of the shadow is that it comes frombehind and attacks us through our fear of the un-known. Just as children are afraid of the dark, we areafraid of our inner darkness. Consciousness lights upthis darkness and so lessens its power. But in the greatteeth of the dreamer’s inner monster is more aggres-sion than she can face, and so it comes charging afterher as she runs away.Then her monster changes form, for the uncon-scious is the master of metamorphosis. In the uncon-scious, images shift and change, appear and reappearin different guises. The monster’s teeth become thegrates on the front of the Volvo, and then the drivergets out. Emanating cruelty, she personifies an aspectof the shadow, and although “very dangerous,” “shewas in a form that was safe.” In this way the uncon-scious presents the dreamer with her shadow in a formwhich she can relate to: first there is the namelessdanger behind the locked door; then the ferociousbeast; finally a cruel woman. As the energies of theunconscious come closer to consciousness, they takeon a more human guise.

Eventually our dreamer willhave to face the darkest monster within her, but herjourney to this “heart of darkness” begins with herconfronting her own personal cruelty, which the dreamsuggests she is now able to relate to and accept.The final scene of this dream is very different,however, and points beyond the shadow into the realmof the Self. The dreamer is watching a parade in which“there is a beautiful green star with golden letterswhich spell ‘ALCHEMY.’” In the heart the spark of theSelf burns like a star, and this spark is the guide whichwe follow along the pathway that leads us Home. Themore we aspire, the brighter this star glows and themore clearly it guides us. It shines through the cloudsof our confusion and takes us to the birthplace of ourown Self. That the color of the star is green is highlyauspicious, for green is the color of growth andbecoming, and for the Sufi it is the color of therealization of God.8 The journey home is a naturalunfolding. This was understood by the alchemists whocalled the inner light the lumen natura which “enlight-ens man as to the workings of nature and gives him anunderstanding of natural things.”9 We can only becomewhat we are in the most natural core of our being, andjust as a flower opens its petals towards the sun, sodoes the seeker open her heart to the Beloved.The green star with golden letters spelling “AL-CHEMY” images the natural alchemical process thatwill purify and transform the dreamer. This is the innerwork of a lifetime and a journey of no end. But for ourdreamer the doorway to the limitless world of the Selfis the recognition of her own cruelty. It may appearparadoxical that our own darkness is the beginning ofspiritual life, but this is what is meant in the Psalms by“The stone which the builders refused is become the"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread64head stone of the corner.”10 Our own shadow hasimmense transformative potential but is overlookedand disregarded by those who cannot humbly andsincerely accept their own nature. Spiritual and psy-chological work means taking a light into the darknessof oneself and loving and accepting what is foundthere. Most simple and yet most difficult, work uponthe shadow lays the foundation for all further pro-cesses of inner transformation.ALCHEMY AND PSYCHOLOGYAlchemy is the Western science of inner transforma-tion. Carl Jung’s first response to an alchemical text was“Good Lord, what nonsense.” But later he realizedthe psychological importance of alchemy, for hediscovered that what the alchemists were workingwith in their retorts and crucibles were not justchemical substances, but the projected contents oftheir own unconscious. The alchemical goal of turninglead into gold is fundamentally symbolic, and refers tothe process of psychological transformation. The al-chemical opus is what we would describe as “innerwork,” or working upon oneself, which aims to purifyand transform the basic contents of the unconscious.The alchemical “gold” symbolizes a state of innertransformation which relates to an awareness of one’sdivine nature, what the alchemists called, among othernames, the lapis, or philosopher’s stone, and Jungtermed the Self.One of the important aspects of Jung’s discoverywas that in alchemical symbolism there exists alanguage that describes the processes of inner trans-formation. This transformation happens in the world of"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"65The Transformation of the Shadowthe psyche, which is a world of images; thus, thelanguage of alchemy is a language of images, alanguage of symbols. Alchemical symbolism also ap-pears in the dreams of individuals who are engaged intheir own inner work, allowing the unconscious tocommunicate to the conscious mind and inform it ofchanges taking place in the depths. Through the workof Jung we are able to revalue this almost forgotten,symbolic language, and thus listen to and understandthe voice of the psyche.However, although Jung may have rediscoveredthis symbolic language for modern psychology, Sufishave always known about the inner processes ofalchemy. A great twelfth-century Sufi, al-Ghazzâlî,titled one of his most important books The Alchemy ofHappiness. Moreover, the Arabic word for ‘stone’ isassociated with the word for ‘hidden, forbidden’, and,according to the Sufis, the stone is the essence whichis so powerful that it can transform whatever comesinto contact with it. This relates to Jung’s concept of theSelf, and the idea that it is the philosopher’s stone, theSelf, that effects the whole process of alchemical/psychological transformation.For the wayfarer on the path the process ofalchemical transformation takes place fueled by aspi-ration and meditation. And although one’s spiritualjourney is always a solitary path—it is the journey “ofthe alone to the Alone”—the Sufi is in the hands of theteacher and in the company of other wayfarers, as isimaged in the following dream:The group is at a school for turning basemetal into silver. The basic material is blackearth which is swept up and sifted and finally asilver metal dust appears. We are all trying to"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread66make silver bowls from this stuff in our ownway. Then I am taken aside and shown thesecret way of doing this. You take a blank whitesheet and spread the metal dust over the sheetfive times. Then you clamp the sheet betweentwo bowl molds and squeeze. Then you take therough bowl and polish and polish till it shines.The alchemical process normally turns base matter,lead, into gold. But in this dream the “base metal” isbeing turned into silver, which is significant in thatsilver is symbolically feminine; for it is the longing, thefeminine side of love, the cup waiting to be filled, thattakes the Sufi to God. This cup is the “silver bowl” ofthe dream, which must be made in the workshop of theheart.The dream’s image of “black earth” as the “basicmaterial” evokes the alchemical notion of the primamateria, which must be found before the inner processcan commence. The prima materia is that which isrejected and considered waste:This Matter lies before the eyes of all; everybodysees it, touches it, loves it, knows it not. It isglorious and vile, precious and of small account,and is found everywhere.11Psychologically, the prima materia is the shadow, theundifferentiated contents of the unconscious that formthe basis of the opus and is most often experienced inthe form of projections, or unexpected moods orreactions. For in such forms unconscious feelingsexpress themselves; the unconscious ‘spills over’ intoour conscious life. The alchemical process is concerned"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"67The Transformation of the Shadowwith the differentiation and integration of the uncon-scious, and therefore this process cannot begin withoutthe individual’s “getting hold of ” the mercurial con-tents of his psyche.Whenever one finds oneself reacting with morefeeling or emotion than is justified by the objectivesituation, then something has “come up” from theunconscious, and there is an opportunity to “get hold”of the prima materia. It is, therefore, important to tryto differentiate between what belongs to the externalsituation and is an appropriate response, and what isprimarily a reaction, something belonging to one’sown unconscious patterns and projections which havebeen ‘triggered’ by the external situation. And becausesuch unconscious material is not valued by the con-scious mind, and is often considered humiliating, it isleft lying around in the dusty corners of our lives, inunpleasant or humiliating incidents, where it can befound by the simple act of “sweeping.” The opuscommences with our looking into those dusty cornersand valuing what is found there, however disagreeableit may appear. The very act of taking notice of one’smoods or reactions, and trying to understand theirsource, allows consciousness to begin to grasp andthus “work” with the unconscious.For most people today, the alchemical workshopis in the field of personal relationships. While thealchemists projected their unconscious into the myste-rious processes of chemistry, we project our psychiccontents most easily onto our relationships. Personalrelationships form the groundwork for most psycho-logical inner work, for it is here that we appear to haveleast conscious control of ourselves, and where theunconscious finds greatest room for expression. In"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread68fact, many personal relationships are wrecked by theexplosions of the unconscious. Within our society, thenuclear family and the importance attached to roman-tic love have placed immense pressure on personalrelationships, with the result that they are often thebattleground of the unconscious. Yet this battlegroundcan become a workshop for the transmutation of thehuman being, for it is in the feelings we project on toour relationships that we have the most direct accessto the unconscious. Here lies the prima materia for theopus which can be a human being’s most importantwork. Here is the “black earth” of this alchemicaldream which, when swept up and sifted, becomessilver.“Black earth” relates specifically to the first phaseof the alchemical process, the nigredo (terra nigra),which “has its parallels in the individuation process, inthe confrontation with the shadow.”12 From a psycho-logical perspective, the work of transformation beginswith the shadow, which in alchemy is “the black earthin which the gold or lapis is sown like the grain ofwheat.”13 Therefore, just as for a previous dreamer thepath began with the recognition of her own cruelty, soin this dream the opus begins with sweeping up the“black earth.”However, “sweeping” also has a specific Sufiassociation, for Sufis are known as “sweepers” or the“dustbins of humanity.” In one dream, Irina Tweediemet a great Sufi with his followers, and when she askeda disciple if he was a Bishop she was told:“No, no ... he is on the same Line as Bhai Sahib[Irina Tweedie’s teacher], and he is very fond ofjoking; speaking of himself and those like him"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"69The Transformation of the Shadowhe will say: ‘Nous autres balayeurs’” (whichmeans in French: “we sweepers”).“Oh, I see!” I exclaimed, “it is because theyclean the hearts of the people!”“Precisely!” the disciple said.14And the idea of the Sufi as a “dustbin” is reflected inanother dream told in our Sufi group:I had two dustbins full of rubbish. Theteacher came along and emptied my two dustbinsinto his one dustbin, and walked off.On the Sufi path the process of inner purificationhappens through the work of the wayfarer and thegrace of the teacher.After the black earth is swept up, silver dustappears. Then comes the stage of making silver bowlsand the dreamer is “taken aside and shown the secretway of doing this”: “You take a blank white sheet andspread the metal dust over the sheet five times.” The“blank white sheet” suggests the state of inner purifi-cation that comes from working on the shadow, andcorresponds in the alchemical process to the albedo,the “whitening.” The “whitening” is also the light, theillumination that follows the darkness of the nigredo,for out of the confrontation and acceptance of theshadow is born a purified state of consciousness.That the metal dust is spread over the sheet fivetimes is very significant, for five is the number ofmankind or humanity—we have five senses—and inorder for an inner transformation to be fully realized,it must be lived. An inner realization that remains justan idea is never fully integrated; it has to become part"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread70and parcel of our daily life. This is reflected in the factthat, according to Jung, the final stage in the alchemicalprocess, after the “whitening,” is the “reddening”:In order to come alive it must have “blood,” itmust have what the alchemists call the rubedo,the “redness” of life.15On the Sufi path this “reddening” is effected throughbeing “in the world but not of the world,” a practice inwhich the wayfarer lives an ordinary everyday life,bringing up a family, working, and yet at the same timekeeps the inner attention focused inwardly on theheart and the remembrance of the Beloved. In this waythe silver is spread five times, and then molded by thegrace of God from above, and by the experience of theworld from below. The coming together of the twoworlds is a central aspect of the Sufi way.In the dream the making of the bowl follows thethree major stages of the alchemical opus, the nigredo,the albedo, and the rubedo. But the “rough bowl” madeby this process should then be polished and polished“till it shines.” This image of “polishing” refers to theSufi notion that the heart is a mirror which the loverpolishes and polishes with his aspiration and longing,until the mirror of the heart can reflect the true light ofthe Beloved:Whether your lot be glory or disgrace, be pureof both hatred and love of self. Polish yourmirror, and perhaps that sublime beauty fromthe regions of mystery will shine in your breast—just as it did for the prophets. And then, withyour heart illuminated by that splendor, the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"71The Transformation of the Shadowsecret of the beloved will no longer be con-cealed from you.16FINDING THE PRIMA MATERIAFinding the prima materia is the essential first step inthe opus, and yet the alchemists describe it as notori-ously difficult to get hold of. The difficulty of findingone’s shadow is that the shadow is what is rejected,dismissed, and left in the darkness. But one of theeffects of spiritual practices is to energize the contentsof the unconscious, so that what had been repressedbegins to come to the surface of consciousness. Oncewe are sincere and prepared to cross over into theshadowlands of the underworld, then an opportunitywill present itself for this inner work to commence. Thefollowing psychological situation and dream offer anexample of “getting hold” of the prima materia and thetransformative potential this offers:First I was aware of resentment towards myparents, and instead of just repressing it Idecided to become more aware of it. Thisreleased a lot of energy and a dream followed:I am up a tower that is beginning to crumble,but I see a vast, beautiful landscape. Then I godown the tower and am shown a large, goldeagle.For a long time this man had felt his resentmenttowards his parents, but had repressed these feelingswhenever they began to surface. He had regardedthese feelings as useless. We have all experienced the"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread72violence and destruction when uncontained feelingsexplode in anger, or surface in poisonous remarks. Ifthese dark feelings have no place in our outer life, andcannot be expressed creatively, what are we to do? Thedreamer could have expressed his resentment, becomeangry with his parents, which might have created atemporary release. But he knew that his parents wouldnot have understood, or even been capable of under-standing his resentment. Accepting or understandinghis feelings would have forced them to confront andbegin to work on their own shadow, and this work isnot for everyone. Jung commented that it can be totallyinappropriate, even dangerous, to confront somebodywith a psychological truth which he does not wish toor indeed cannot accept and integrate. Truth can benot only useless but cruel; and “when there is completeunconsciousness, don’t say anything. The shock wouldbe too great.”17The alchemists stressed that their opus requires acontainer, the alchemical vessel. Psychologically thisvessel is an inner attitude of commitment to confrontand accept whatever is found within oneself; it must bea vessel strong enough to contain the conflict when theshadow comes into the light and “one becomes two.”The pressing need to know oneself and find the lighthidden in darkness provides this container, but with-out it one’s demons are best left undisturbed. I wasonce asked by a woman at a workshop why she didn’tdream. I replied that possibly she was so integratedand led such a balanced life that there was no need forher to dream. She knew that this was not the case. ThenI suggested that maybe she didn’t want to deal withwhat her dreams would tell her. She said, “Of courseI want to know what my dreams tell me.” “Are youreally prepared to spend the next five or more years"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"73The Transformation of the Shadowdiscovering and accepting all your negative qualities,your failings and unpleasant feelings?” “Oh no!” sheresponded. I admired her honesty. Without the rightattitude it is best to leave the door to the underworldclosed. One should never open this door just for thesake of curiosity, or without the commitment to workwith what one finds within oneself. There are goodreasons why our shadow was born, and why for manypeople the underworld belongs only to myths and fairytales.But the dreamer felt the need, the prompting, toallow his feelings to surface. Instinctively he knew theywere the lead that could be turned into gold. Althoughit was inappropriate to tell his parents how he truly felt,he was no longer going to repress his resentment.Then, one day as he was cycling to work, once againthe feelings of resentment surfaced. Rather than re-pressing it, he decided to look at it, to becomeconscious of it. Suddenly the whole energy flow in hisbody changed, and an enormous psychological shifttook place. He had made the decision to work with thecontents of his unconscious; in other words, thealchemical opus had begun. This actual decision initself may have been the trigger that “released a lot ofenergy,” as psychic energy held repressed in theunconscious began to flow into consciousness.“Awareness” is the most fundamental quality ofconsciousness, and in being aware of his resentmenthe formed a connection between consciousness andthe unconscious through which the energy in theunconscious could begin to be integrated into con-sciousness. One of Jung’s major discoveries was thatthe very process of being aware of the contents of theunconscious has a magical effect, vastly speeding upthe transformative processes of the psyche. Jung"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread74believed that individuation actually happens to every-one,18 but for most people it takes place only in theunconscious and is very, very slow. They hardly evenrealize that gradual changes are happening withinthem, changes that take them through the variousstages of life and eventually prepare them for death.But the moment the individual takes the step ofbecoming aware of what is taking place in the uncon-scious, a spark of consciousness crosses over into thedarkness. It is as if this spark then ignites an immeasur-ably faster process of individuation, and it is this“speeded-up” process which we tend to refer to by thepsychological term “individuation.” The participationof consciousness with the unconsciousness is like achemical catalyst. This is when the opus really com-mences, and the dream that the man was given after hebegan to look at his feelings of resentment offers aclear indication of the psychological process he initi-ated.The dreamer’s tower can be read as a symbol ofisolated consciousness, a consciousness separated fromthe reality of his own feelings and their connection tolife. There is a tarot card, “The Tower of Destruction,”19in which the tower images isolation and a state ofpsychological imbalance, being cut off from otherhuman beings and also from the earth. A masculinesymbol, it represents a mental attitude that can serve asa protection against chaos, particularly the chaos of theunconscious. Yet all too often does this self-protectionend as a prison for the inhabitant, who becomesisolated, cut off from his own feelings and the flow oflife. But once the individual begins to acknowledgewhat had been repressed and denied, the towercrumbles. Reality with all its richness and confusiontakes over from the ivory tower of our imagined self."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"75The Transformation of the ShadowMoreover, this dreamer is shown two veryauspicious symbols, “a vast, beautiful landscape” and“a large, gold eagle.” The vast, beautiful landscapesuggests new psychological horizons, no longer lim-ited by the restriction of repression. Dreams oftenshow these new landscapes, sometimes seen througha doorway, archway, or window. For as we accept andintegrate the contents of the unconscious there is anexpansion of consciousness; as we work upon ourconditioning, complexes, and shadow dynamics, sothey release the psychic energy which had been storedwithin them. Aspects of our own self which had beenlocked behind the doors of the unconscious becomepart of our conscious life. Thus in dreams people findnew rooms in their house, or even find a doorway toa whole new floor, possibly an attic which they did notknow existed. And because the shadow contains notonly the dark side of the ego, but also unlived poten-tial, so that too becomes integrated, with the result thatdaily life becomes richer and more creative.Psychological work is real and really changes ahuman being. We have become conditioned to believethat life can only improve externally, usually in quan-titative, material terms: more is better. But real mean-ing and fulfillment come from the inner and not theouter world; and deep psychological work results inlasting change that is not subject to the whims offortune. As the inner darkness is transmuted, so morelight comes into the psyche, and then the quality of lifechanges. External situations may change, as the indi-vidual discovers new potential that requires expres-sion. But one’s physical situation may also remainunchanged, and yet be perceived differently, just as weall know that the same street can be beautiful ornondescript depending on our mood. The Zen saying,"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread76“Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water.After enlightenment, chop wood and carry water,”expresses this truth about inner change.

The dreamer’simage of the “large, gold eagle” symbolizes the trans-formation of the instinctual energy of the unconsciousthat results from working with the prima materia. Thisgold eagle is the same as the lapis which is both thebeginning and the end of the opus. It is the spiritualprinciple within the dreamer that initiates the process,forcing him out of the tower and into contact with theunconscious. And this eagle is also the goal, his owndivine Self which he will meet at the end of the path.From something so simple and easily overlookedas his resentment towards his parents, the work of alifetime commences, the ancient alchemical opus ofturning lead into gold. The gold eagle, the higherenergy of the Self, is present at the very beginning,pushing the dreamer to change his attitude and allowthe fluid, amorphous energy of the unconscious intoconsciousness, opening the doorway into the under-world of his own initiation and transformation.

Ourpatriarchal culture has resulted in the wounding ofMother Earth, and also in the wounding of the feminineprinciple itself. A woman howling with anguish anddespair, her face hidden by her tears, haunts thepathways of the unconscious. This archetypal figure isnot as visible as the ecological disaster that threatensour planet. She belongs to the intangible inner world,a reality we have almost totally rejected as valueless.But anyone entering this inner reality will soon en-counter this figure and feel her pain.The tragic plight of our own feminine nature waspowerfully imaged for me in a dream I had soon afterI began my study of Jungian psychology:I was walking down a street and on the right-hand side there was a magnificent new hospital,gleaming white, with doctors walking in.

We are surrounded by the wonders of ourmasculine consciousness. Each time I fly in an airplaneI marvel at the technology that can lift so muchmachinery and so many people above the clouds andfly them around the world. Such wonders are not to bedespised, but they have been bought at a price. In ourfascination with the world of science and its tangibleresults, we have starved and neglected the innerfeminine world.

Because ourculture views the external, physical world as the onlyreality, we have collectively negated the inner world.Furthermore, the imagination is our primary mode ofaccess into the symbolic world; yet, over the centuries,it has been denigrated by being regarded as merefantasy. Rather than being held holy, the symbolicworld has become imaginary, the stuff of children’stales. We don’t believe in dragons anymore and haveeven lost the ability to walk in a symbolic world.

Personal feelings have beendevoured by the cold abyss of the unconscious, which,having sucked their blood, has then left them emptyand hard. But this process also happens in the depthsof the psyche. When we stop relating to the ancientfigures who inhabit this inner world, the warmth offeeling is withdrawn, and these figures too becomecold and isolated. Warmth comes from consciousness(the theft of fire symbolizes the birth of conscious-ness). The further from consciousness we travel, thecolder it becomes. The figures that we have leftforgotten and abandoned in the temples of the imagi-nation become stone sarcophagi, entombed in theirown isolation.Yet, as in the fairy tales, this magic can bereversed. The petrified figures can be freed from thespell that has held them. Just as the kiss awokeSleeping Beauty, so love can always redeem andtransform. If we love these inner figures, they will be"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"83The Pain of the Collective Shadowhealed and made whole. The inhabitants of the arche-typal world need us; they need the light of conscious-ness and the warmth of love. If we speak to them withtenderness, their eyes will open and their deep wisdomwill be at our service.Our dreamer finds herself in front of one tombwith a figure much like herself, although the figure haslong hair while her hair is short. She merges with thisfigure; she becomes one with this ancient part ofherself. At that moment a unicorn comes flying inthrough the window, a unicorn that needs her help inorder to be healed. The unicorn is a fabulous creaturerich in symbolic meaning. It is a lunar animal, and yetits single horn has a masculine quality. Jung exploredits symbolism in detail and found that it had no onesymbolic meaning, but he associated it with the spiritusmercurialis, which is the very spirit of alchemicaltransformation.3 According to legend the unicorn istireless fleeing from pursuit, but will lay its head in thelap of a pure virgin. Thus it is the purity of the receptivefeminine principle that is needed to integrate thispowerful, transformative psychic energy. The energiesof the unconscious can be wild and destructive, andwoe be to him who tries to harness them for the powerpurposes of the ego, for personal gain or greed. But ifthe seeker has purity of heart and is receptive to theinner processes, this psychic energy can be creativelyintegrated. According to the alchemists, the unicornwas Christ. The energy of the Christ principle, or theSelf (which is the prime force in the alchemical opus),will always be destructive to the desires of the ego andwill foster the growth of the soul.4Our dreamer’s unicorn is also able to fly and thushas the qualities of Pegasus, the mythic flying horse.Pegasus was a winged horse which sprang from the"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread84blood of Medusa, when Perseus cut off her head. Itthus symbolizes the transformation of the dark side ofthe feminine, of the petrifying forces of the GreatMother. Pegasus symbolizes the “innate capacity forspiritualization and for inverting evil into good.”5 Thusthis unicorn has immense transformative potential. It isthe spiritual force within the dreamer that, born out ofthe darkness, will carry her into the light.But as the dreamer told her story, I felt suchsadness at the forlorn plight of the unicorn. How hadthis magical beast become so neglected? This feelingwas intensified a few minutes later when a six-year-oldgirl, who was also present at this meeting, described avision she had had only a few nights previously. Shehad awakened to find at the end of her bed the mostbeautiful of unicorns, full of light and beauty. Herunicorn’s horn was not broken, but shining and sur-rounded by a rainbow ring of light. And on theunicorn’s back there rode a man of light. Such visionsare a glimpse into the real inner world whose verysubstance is light, and in response to this vision, theteacher suggested that next time the young girl saw herunicorn she should talk to its rider, and so form aconscious connection with her own inner man of light.That afternoon synchronicity presented us withthese two unicorns, adding poignancy to the questionof how the dreamer’s unicorn had become so ne-glected. The six-year-old girl still lived in the magicalworld of her own inner nature. The archetypal worldwas for her, as for many children, a living reality. Shehad not yet been told that dragons don’t exist nor hadher own magical self “fade into the light of commonday.”6 In “Ode: Intimations of Immortality” Wordsworthdescribes this sad transition:"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"85The Pain of the Collective ShadowThere was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,The earth, and every common sight, To me did seem Apparelled in celestial light,The glory and the freshness of a dream.It is not now as it hath been of yore;— Turn whereso’er I may, By night or day,The things which I have seen I now can see no more.7As the child goes to school and enters the world ofcompetition and peer pressure, unicorns slowly be-come less real. “Dragons live forever but not so littleboys,” and no doubt it is necessary that the growingchild step out of the ocean of the unconscious onto thedry land of consciousness. As the ego develops, thechild ceases to be immersed in the archetypal world.Yet the danger is that the magical world is not just leftto be returned to later in life, but is rejected and lockedin the darkness of the shadow. And it is even moretragic when we have lost touch with the faculty of theimagination, which would enable us to open thelocked door and enter into this world.Our culture has so firmly rejected the inner worldthat as the child grows into adulthood, its own innerreality can easily become part of the collective shadow.It is then that the unicorn loses its light, and its hornhangs almost broken off. Our dreamer’s unicorn hadbeen infected by this collective shadow and had almostlost its transformative potential. It needed herbs to behealed.But how does one heal a unicorn? The dreamerdidn’t know what to do. If we live in a world that"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread86doesn’t believe in unicorns, is it likely that we wouldknow how to heal them? And even when the unicorntold the dreamer exactly what herbs it needed, shedidn’t know where to find them.But why did the unicorn come to her unless itknew she was able to help it? These archetypal figureshave a deep wisdom and understanding. The unicornknows more about the workings of the inner worldthan the conscious mind of the dreamer. It knows shecan heal its wounded horn. She is the virgin in whoselap it can lay its weary head.In the inner life of a woman the term “virgin” hasa particular significance: a virgin is a woman who istrue to her own inner feminine nature, the Goddesswithin (“A girl belongs to herself while she is avirgin.... She is ‘One in herself ’”8). Our dreamer’shealing powers are within her deeper feminine selfwhich until now has been buried and petrified. This isthe golden-haired woman on the sarcophagus shemerges with and yet is also separate from. It is after thismerging that the unicorn flies down to her, knowingthat if she can reawaken the golden-haired figure theunicorn will be healed. It is this figure who under-stands the healing powers of herbs, which form part ofthe ancient mystery of the feminine. Herbs belong tonature, to Mother Earth herself, and their use belongsto the primordial knowledge of woman. Similarly,poison, which is the dark use of such knowledge,belongs to the “natural magic” of Hecate, the goddessof the underworld.Thus the dream suggests that if the dreamer canenter her own sacred inner space and reconnect withthe feminine power within, she will be able to heal thevery principle of spiritual transformation which has"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"87The Pain of the Collective Shadowbeen wounded. But the dream also makes the impor-tant statement that this inner descent, the mergingwithin, must be balanced by the presence of anobserving consciousness. When she merges with thestone figure she also remains separate, observing. Inthe myth of Perseus, the hero can only look at the faceof Medusa in the reflection of his shield. Reflectionsymbolizes consciousness:“Reflection” should be understood not sim-ply as an act of thought, but rather as an attitude.It is a privilege born of human freedom incontradistinction to the compulsion of naturallaw. As the word itself testifies (“reflectionmeans literally ‘bending back’”), reflection is aspiritual act that runs counter to the naturalprocess; as an act whereby we stop, call some-thing to mind, form a picture, and take up arelation to and come to terms with what we haveseen. It should therefore be understood as an actof becoming conscious.9Our reflective powers not only separate us fromthe animal world, they also allow us to look into thedepths of the unconscious without being assimilatedback into that primal world. It is the attitude ofreflection, of being a witness or inner observer, thatcounterbalances the devouring powers of the uncon-scious. It stops one from being turned into stone.At the end of the dream the unicorn can be seenstanding in a field. It is to be hoped that its sad plightwill impress upon the dreamer the importance of thetask before her. This is what Jung termed “a bigdream,” a milestone in the life of the dreamer. The"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread88dream is a cry from the depths, and if the dreamerheeds this cry and finds within herself the femininewisdom that will heal the unicorn, then the powerfulenergies of spiritual transformation will begin to changethe very structure of her being. The unicorn carries thesecrets of this transformation, and for the dreamer itwill be the most wondrous of journeys, one that willtake her far beyond the boundaries of her own con-sciousness: “We know how it begins, but we neverknow how it will end. It is the way leading into theinfinite.”10GOD ENTERS THROUGH A WOUNDThe dream of the wounded unicorn touches upon theprimal mystery that it is our wounds that take us home.It is because of our wounds, our pain and our sadness,that we turn away from the outer world and trace thethread of our own darkness back to its source. Thisthread leads us through the barriers of pain to the placeof our own healing; in the very process of making thisjourney, the light of consciousness which we carrywith us transforms our darkness. The individual whoarrives at the source is very different from the personwho set out upon the quest. During the course of thisjourney we have to accept and integrate what we findwithin us—our pain and our anger and all the manyforms which our darkness has taken. We will find thethief, the murderer, and the prostitute. We will see boththe hurt we have caused others and the hurt we havecaused ourselves. We will have to accept ourselves aswe really are, as our own naked self. Then this nakedself will be the chalice into which His wine can bepoured."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"89The Pain of the Collective ShadowOne of the foundations of the Sufi path is theunderstanding that this whole process of transformationtakes place in the heart, fueled by love. The heart is thealchemical vessel, in which we place the substance ofthe shadow, which is then transformed through the fireof love. It is for this reason that Simone Weil wrote:“We must not wish for the disappearance of ourtroubles, but the grace to transform them.” In thefollowing dream the dreamer’s feminine self is deeplywounded, but it is this wound that leads to the openingof her heart.I am with another woman. A man comes andfires a gun into my heart. I am taken to a stoneand lie there while women mourn about me.Then I see that the skin about my left breasthangs down, like a flap, and underneath are thepetals of a flower.The dreamer had been very hurt by her father asa child and thus this dream carries powerful personalassociations. The father carries the first image of themasculine within the psyche of the child, and ourdreamer’s primary masculine imprint had been a wound-ing of the heart. Yet this dream not only embraces thepersonal, but points beyond the personal into thearchetypal. Her wound results in her being carried toa stone, the most ancient of altars and a symbol of theSelf. There, in the depths of her own primal Self, sheis mourned by women. Thus the feminine mourns thewounding it has suffered at the hands of the masculine.In the depths of the psyche of both men andwomen the feminine feels betrayed, ravaged, andmisunderstood. This archetypal wounding will mani-fest for each of us in its own individual way. It can"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread90be a wounded feeling, an inner anger, or painfulvulnerability. It can manifest as an inability to relate,an undervaluing of one’s creativity, or a woman’sdisbelief in her own feminine wisdom. The collectivemanifests in the personal, and we can often trace apersonal conflict back to an archetypal source. In thisdream a personal and an archetypal pain are clearlyrelated, but the dream points beyond the pain to itsdeeper significance. To quote the English visionaryartist, Cecil Collins, “God enters through a wound”;underneath the skin that covers her heart the dreamerfinds the petals of a flower.There is a flowering that can only occur throughpain. This is the flowering of the heart. Pain takes usbeyond the surface world of the ego into the realm ofthe soul. Keats describes this world as a vale of tearswhich is also a vale of soulmaking. There is a sufferingthat purifies and transforms, destroying the structuresof the ego so that the vaster world of the Self can bemade visible:There was an artist once, and he painted apicture. Other artists had colours richer andrarer, and painted more notable pictures. Hepainted his with one colour. There was a won-derful red glow on it; and people went up anddown saying, “We like the picture, we like theglow.”The other artists came and said, “Where doeshe get his colour from?” They asked him; and hesmiled and said, “I cannot tell you”; and workedon with his head bent low.And one went to the Far East and boughtcostly pigments, and made a rare colour and"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"91The Pain of the Collective Shadowpainted, but after a time the colour faded.Another read in the old books, and made acolour rich and rare, but when he had put it onthe picture it was dead.But the artist painted on.

The other men looked about in all the potsand crucibles, but they found nothing they hadnot.And when they undressed him and put hisgrave-clothes on him, they found above his leftbreast the mark of a wound—it must have beenthere all his life, for the edges were old andhardened; but Death, who seals up all things,had drawn the edges together, and closed it up.And they buried him. And still the peoplewent about saying, “Where did he find hiscolour from?”And it came to pass that after a while the artistwas forgotten—but the work lived.11In offering oneself as a sacrifice on the altar of theheart, one does not seek suffering, but chooses not toavoid it. One allows the powerful energies of the Selfto burn away the impurities within the psyche. Forevery new birth there must be a breaking down of theold, and old patterns are best washed away with tears.Yet finally, the opening of the heart is always an act ofgrace. It is given. Suffering unlocks the door which isthen opened by the hand of God. Abû Sa‘îd al-Kharrâzdescribes this paradox of the effortless path:"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread92By suffering, none attainedthe treasure of mystic union;and, strange to say, without suffering,none beheld that treasure.12Spiritual life is free; like the sun it shines on allalike. Yet, at the same time, whatever you want youmust pay for. If you want the truth you must pay, notwith money, but with the blood of your heart. As afriend was told when he first came to our group, “Hereno money is charged; instead you will pay withyourself.” Mirabai describes this same bargain:I have bought God, I have bought God.The bargain was easy.I gave myself completelyAnd got him completely in return.13THE POWER OF THE GODDESSThe pain of the wounded woman dominates ourcollective shadow. Our patriarchal culture has rapedand pillaged, leaving inner and outer desolation. Man’sfear of the feminine has resulted in her instinctualwisdom being burnt at the stake and lost, buried deepin the unconscious. So powerful has been this collec-tive repression that today not only men but alsowomen are frightened of their own instinctual power.In the following dream the dreamer, a woman, encoun-ters the Great Goddess Maria, and yet is apprehensiveof her power:I am in a circus, in the arena.

Then the tigers gooutside; but after a while they come back and Ihave to let them in. I see them first through aglass wall and am a bit apprehensive.The dreamer meets the Goddess Maria in thecircus arena, under the tent. The tent and its centralpost are ancient Sufi symbols, for the Sufi teacher, thesheikh, is the post, the link between heaven and earthwhich provides a protected space for the disciple tocome closer to God. And in this dream the “membersof the group” are “moving around the post, like in amerry-go-round,” suggesting the circular path towardswholeness. The spiritual path is not a linear progres-sion; the Truth is not separate from the seeker. Ratherthe path is a spiral journey of uncovering what ishidden within us. I once had a dream in which,together with other members of the group, I was beingled round and round in circles by the teacher. In thedream there was a frustration about not going any-where, but when I awoke I laughed at myself becauseI remembered that there is nowhere to go:We shall not cease from explorationAnd the end of all our exploringWill be to arrive where we startedAnd know the place for the first time.14"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread94In this dream of meeting the Goddess Maria, the arenais a powerful symbol, for the Sufi, once committed tothe path, is taken into love’s arena to do battle with theego, the nafs. And the words of the Roman gladiators,“Ave. Operator, morituri te salutant” (“Hail, Emperor,those about to die salute you”), are appropriate to theSufi, for in that arena the ego is to die, reflecting asaying ascribed to the Prophet, that one has to diebefore one dies.To die before one dies is the death of the ego, the“I” that separates us from the experience of divineunity. But this “death” is not the obliteration of the ego,for one cannot live in this world without it. Here oneneeds to have an individual identity; otherwise con-scious life would be impossible: you would not knowthat you were separate from anyone or anything else.You and your neighbor would be the same, you and atable would be identical! Only in the state of the uniomystica does the ego disappear completely. In thisstate of union with God there is no individual identity,but a state of total oneness, as the individual isabsorbed into the whole. Coming out of this mysticalstate one returns to the ego with all of its painfullimitations. In love’s arena the ego is dissolved andtransformed so that it remains surrendered to theHigher Self and to God. For the disciple this transfor-mation is experienced as a death, a painful process ofdying to this world and the ego’s desires, in order thatone may fully awaken to the presence of the Beloved.There, in the arena, the dreamer meets the GreatGoddess known in the West as Maria, or the VirginMary. “The most beautiful woman I have ever seen,”she is adorned with stars, reflecting her archetypal"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"95The Pain of the Collective Shadownature, and she is playing with tigers. The tiger is avehicle of the Goddess (the Goddess is frequentlydepicted as riding on the back of a tiger), and is oftenassociated with her dark side, the terrible Goddess.The tiger symbolizes her power, her undifferentiatedprimordial energy, which is the aspect of the Goddessmost repressed in our patriarchal culture. This qualityof the Goddess is both beautiful and terrible, as isencapsulated in William Blake’s poem, “The Tyger”:Tyger! Tyger! burning brightIn the forests of the night,What immortal hand or eyeDare frame thy fearful symmetry?This is the primal power of the feminine of which menare most afraid. And in this dream this power isemphasized by there being more than one tiger.Moreover, it must be integrated by the dreamer: “I haveto let them in.” Understandably, she is “a bit apprehen-sive.” Like many women, she is frightened of her ownfeminine power.But her fear of her own instinctual power is notjust a result of our patriarchal shadow. This archetypalenergy belongs to the amoral depths of the uncon-scious. Just like tigers in the jungle, the archetypes areawesome but impersonal forces of nature, each follow-ing nature’s amoral and impersonal laws.

We have to takeresponsibility for our own power.The ethical responsibility demanded by the im-ages of the unconscious is reflected in a more personaldream which followed this archetypal dream. It illus-trates the subtle relationship between the collectiveand the personal unconscious, showing how an expe-rience of an archetype required the dreamer to lookclosely at an aspect of her shadow:There are two men, one of whom wants touse me as a prostitute. I don’t really want to, butan unknown woman is there who says that it isO.K.; she often does it, she just thinks aboutsomething else.Portrayed in sexual imagery, this dream describesa personal conflict within the dreamer, and one that isalso a central part of our patriarchal culture: thewoman allowing herself to be used by a man. In thisdream there are two men and two women, suggestingthe marriage quaternio, yet in this case the sexualunion would not represent integration, as the womanis being “used.” She is prostituting her own feminineself, her inner integrity, to the masculine. For just as awoman may outwardly allow herself to be used by aman, so does this drama happen inwardly, as the innerfeminine sells herself to masculine values.How many women have allowed masculine, goal-oriented values to dominate and guide them?

In jokingseriousness a woman recently told me that in herexperience of the American culture a woman is free todo anything she wants, as long as it is masculine.In this dream, the image of prostitution suggeststhat the dreamer does not respect the Goddess within.Significantly, it is an “unknown woman,” symbolizinga shadow figure, who “says it is O.K.” and “often doesit” without being fully aware of what she is doing—“she just thinks about something else.” As ever, theshadow acts unconsciously, without taking full re-sponsibility for its actions. Responsibility means con-sciousness, and the shadow often tries to limit ourconscious awareness, pulling us into its murky world.Furthermore, because it is a part of us, it knows theeasiest way to do this. Our shadow knows our weakspots, the arguments and suggestions that will mosteasily convince us.When discussing this dream, the dreamer wantedto know what to do, which is again a masculine attitudetowards resolving a problem. Instead, it was suggestedthat she just become aware of her relationship to themasculine, how she continually sacrificed part ofherself. Her awareness of her inner dynamic wouldalso mean taking responsibility for her own feminineself. A few days later she had a dream in which a tigercame and licked her face! After encountering theGoddess in the form of Maria, the dreamer needed torespect the Goddess within herself; she could nolonger unconsciously prostitute herself.

Consciousness and responsibilityprotect us against the negative effect of life’s primalenergies. History gives too many examples of a collec-tive energy causing destruction because individualsdid not take personal responsibility, but “looked theother way,” as when ordinary German citizens pre-tended to be unaware of the concentration camps andthe Nazis’ “final solution” for the Jews.The spiritual path takes us deep into the uncon-scious where we will find both collective shadows andthe awesome power of the archetypes. On this journeyconsciousness is our light and our protector; but as wego deeper within, so our ethical responsibility needs toincrease. We cannot afford to allow our shadow toremain unnoticed, but need to be aware of our failingsand limitations as well as the numinous wonder of ourinner self.THE DANCE OF THE WARRIORThe pain of the wounded feminine dominates theworld of the shadow. But for a man the confrontationwith the instinctual world can connect him with an-other archetype that now carries the darkness of theshadow, that of the warrior. The following dreamimages a process of transformation that takes thedreamer into the primal world of the warrior and thusinto contact with his essential nature:I am staring a black panther in the face.

Then I am back in mymother’s womb and am being born. Then Imyself am giving birth.This dream begins with a full confrontation withthe dark instinctual forces imaged by a black panther.These forces of the unconscious do not belong to thecivilized world; they follow the amoral laws of thejungle. To the world of consciousness this primalpower can seem a threat, for like the panther it is notconditioned by the duality of good and bad. It followsits own natural laws, and is itself. As our society hasbecome more and more civilized, we have failed tointegrate this energy, and it has taken on the darknessof our own ignorance. In order to return to the roots ofour own being we have to enter this darkness. Folkloresays that if you stare a wild animal in the eyes it will notattack you, and this is the best way to encounter thewild animal within.15 The full glare of consciousnessdisarms the shadow and allows its energy to betransformed.American Indians learned to consciously identifywith their “power animal,” and were thus able to tuneinto this source of power within themselves. Illnesscould be caused by someone’s losing contact with hispower animal, and then the shaman would journeywith him into the inner world to find this animal andthus reconnect him with his own source of instinctualpower and inner healing. Our dreamer has found hisown power animal, and it will lead him to his rebirth.The dreamer was an American and Jung noted thatfor white Americans the shadow is frequently repre-sented by a black person or an Indian.16 These racescarry the rejected, “primitive” side of the white people.Our dreamer goes to the African roots of the black man,"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread100to the root of his own shadow: “I find myself in Africa,holding a spear and dancing a tribal dance.” Dancesymbolizes integration and in this dance the dreamerbecomes part of the dance of his own primitivemasculine nature. He is honoring the warrior within.The warrior archetype embraces the figure of thehero, the individual who succeeds in his quest. Butthese figures have been wounded by Western technol-ogy: no longer is there trial by sword or spear.Characters like Rambo exert a fascination but do theycarry the honor and dignity of ancient warriors likeHector of Troy? Can Achilles be fully replaced by JamesBond? The warriors of today may enact the myth of theindividual fighting the collective powers of darkness,but where is the spiritual dimension of their quest?Rather than containing symbols of transformation,their stories are senseless tales of violence. The arche-type of the warrior appears to have lost its spiritualdimension and has become just a gladiator battlinganimals in the arena of a decadent civilization.Our cultural split between consciousness and theunconscious has compromised the warrior. Adolescentboys need the warrior’s masculine energy to becomemen, as is witnessed in their instinctive attraction toknives and guns. But instead of true tests of strength,our culture provides them only with video games andthe zapping of alien monsters.The warrior archetype may have been repressedinto the shadow, but its deeper purpose can be foundin the unconscious.

The inner path will test one to the limits ofone’s endurance. The confrontation with the shadowitself requires true courage and determination, for thenthe seeker finds that his enemy is in his own heart.W. B. Yeats remarked: “Why should we honour thosewho die on the field of battle? A man may show asreckless a courage in entering into the abyss ofhimself.”17The sword of the warrior is needed for this innerbattle; yet it should be a sword tempered with love.This blade is not cold and uncaring, not heedlesslydestructive. It is like the sharp surgeon’s blade that isat times needed to heal a diseased body. The warrior’ssword must carry the wisdom of understanding and yetat the same time be able to be ruthless—to learn “tocare and not to care.”18 The power of love has this dualdynamic. Like a powerful immune system it cares forthe needs of the soul by destroying the crystalizedpatterns of the mind and the structures of the ego. Itforces us to go beyond the limitations of our conscious-ness and embrace a greater wholeness. The processesof inner transformation take place only when oneperseveres beyond the limits of one’s seeming endur-ance. It is then that the enantidromia happens(“enantidromia” is a term Jung uses for “the emergenceof the unconscious opposite in the course of time”19)and darkness turns into light. On the path one is testeduntil one thinks: “‘What can happen—I cannot morethan die—’ and [if] one accepts it, then the test has beenpassed and one is ready for the high stage.”20Within the psyche of a woman the quality ofruthless perseverance belongs to the masculine part ofherself, her inner warrior.

This necessaryfirmness and strength of will are echoed in many otherfairy tales and myths, with the injunction not to turnaround or answer. It is far easier for a man to focus ona distant goal and reject what is close at hand. For awoman this is the most difficult of tests, and she willneed all her will power to pass it. But on the path onemust always focus on the essentials, on the realpurpose of the quest, for it will consume every ounceof energy we have. A woman needs this masculineone-pointedness and the resolution to continue to thevery end. One friend had a dream in which she and theteacher were cowboys, riding off into the sunset,together but alone. The cowboy images the Westernmyth of the warrior, encapsulated in the saying “Aman’s got to do what a man’s got to do.” As aninstinctual figure he embodies the dreamer’s gut deter-mination to pursue the quest for truth—the mostexacting task but the only really worthwhile one.In the dream of the black panther, the dreamer,dancing with a spear, integrates his own primal mas-culine energy, the energy necessary for the quest.

The Self is this knowledge, a knowl-edge that does not belong to the mind but spreads fromthe heart until it forms part of every cell of the body,or “every part, every cell of the body becomes aheart.”22 At the beginning this knowledge comes just inglimpses, but it slowly infuses itself into the wholehuman being—nothing is excluded; every cell knowsthat it belongs. In the words of Ghalib, “Those whoknow are always drunk on the wine of the Self.”23From the darkness this child is born, and it isnourished on meditation and aspiration. Its cry is thesigh of the soul. When it opens its eyes it sees infinitehorizons and directs our gaze thither.

For theprocess of inner transformation requires that the con-tents of the psyche be hermetically sealed in order “toprotect what is within from the intrusion and admixtureof what is without”:Nothing enters into it [the stone] that did notcome from it; since, if anything extraneous wereto be added to it, it would at once be spoilt.3Psychologically, this refers to the need to withdrawprojections and to discriminate between what belongsto oneself and what belongs to another, for one cantransform only the contents of one’s own psyche, andthe “intrusion and admixture” of external psychologi-cal material leads only to confusion. In fact, this needfor a “well-sealed vessel” often results in a period ofintroversion as the individual withdraws from theoutside world and “broods” on the contents of her ownpsyche.But, alone, the dreamer is unable to close thiswindow, for the power of discrimination within thewoman’s psyche belongs to the masculine, the animus.The animus provides the focus lacking in the “diffusedawareness” of the feminine mode of consciousness.Irene de Castillejo describes the animus as a “torch-bearer,” “holding aloft his torch to light my way”:In a woman’s world of shadows and cosmictruths he provides a pool of light as a focus forher eyes.4The masculine consciousness of the animus is neededto create boundaries, which is different from the all-inclusive nature of the feminine.

The dream isdescribing something of great significance for thedreamer, more important, more “real” than her every-day life. She finds herself alone with the monk, withthis spiritual aspect of her animus that will lead heraway from the world and towards God. The monk’scell, being “very, very small,” images this inner ratherthan outer orientation, and also reflects the dreamer’souter-life situation, which had an ascetic quality as shewas totally committed to her analysis and training as atherapist as well as her meditation.The monk’s cell also carries the symbolism of the“well-sealed vessel,” the container necessary for innertransformation. At this stage in her inner journey andher outer life the dreamer had decided not to let anyexternal psychological influences, such as might comefrom a relationship, interfere with her inner work.Relationships and the projections involved give usample opportunity to contact our own projections andget hold of the prima materia. But at times there is alsoa need to withdraw within oneself in order to workupon the contents of one’s own psyche, the alchemicalstage of “brooding.”The hermetic vessel is a place of transformation,and in the dream this is imaged first by her making lovewith the monk, her animus, and then by the visionarylandscape, the Navel of God, revealed through him.The union of the couple takes place on the floor of thecell, and their naked bodies give it an archetypalquality, for she is “white as the moon” while he is “slightlygolden,” suggestive of the sun.

Thealchemists describe the coniunctio not only as achemical combination, but also as a marriage or loveaffair in which opposing “natures” “embrace oneanother.”7 The dreamer’s feeling of being “containedand supported” echoes the “spiritual firmness andsupport” that Marie-Louise von Franz describes as animportant quality of the animus, a quality that isexperienced through this inner union.The dreamer then describes herself as an “ex-plorer,” as the integration of the positive, spiritualaspect of the animus gives her the strength, resolution,and focus necessary to explore the inner world. Inprevious ages explorers charted unknown lands; todaythe realm of the psyche is still largely uncharted.Exploring the inner world is a commitment to discoverboth the light and the darkness, the beauty and theterror, hidden within us.But as well as an explorer, she is also a “God givenperson,” which is her name in the dream.

To realize thateverything we are given comes from the Beloved is towalk the path of purification and poverty, the povertyof being totally dependent upon Him whom we love.This is reflected in the only clothing she has for thisjourney, “an old, black Indian dress.” Black is both thecolor of the feminine and the color of spiritual poverty,“the poverty of the heart” in which one looks towardsGod, knowing that He alone can answer our deepest"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread114needs. Often we have such a garment hidden within us,waiting for the right time to be worn, the time when weturn away from the outer world and pick up the threadof our spiritual destiny, a thread woven into the fabricof our soul. The dreamer’s “old, black Indian dress” isall the dreamer needs to cross the desert to “the Navelof God,” the place of being nourished by Him alone.She knows that the journey will be hot, and is fright-ened that her dress will absorb the heat of the sun, thefire of purification, but we are never asked to bearmore than we are able. The monk tells her, “It will beterribly hot, but just enough that you can bear it.”The dreamer’s embrace with the monk has awak-ened her memory of the “Navel of God,” a place thatbelongs to a dream she now must live. Spiritualawakening is the remembrance of a dream that belongsto the soul, a dream of belonging totally to God. Butsignificantly this dream, this memory, is awakened bya physical embrace, a “deep contact” with her animus.She kisses the navel of the monk and puts her headthere, and through his navel remembers the Navel ofGod. However incongruous it might seem that aspiritual quest is furthered through making love to amonk, particularly with reference to the dreamer’s ownCatholic background, her unconscious tells her “what-ever act I perform with the monk will enhance thisquality in me, ‘the God given person.’” Their embraceis a sacred act that will take her closer to her own divinenature, and at the end of the dream she says, “I knowhis body is the map to find the Navel of God. Throughhis body we will find the place.” This points to theimportance of her including the body in the spiritualprocess.The relationship between body and spirit within awoman’s psyche is very different from that within a"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"115The Inner Partnerman. For, while masculine consciousness, seeking tofree itself from the Great Mother, attempts to separatespirit from matter, within the consciousness of awoman these two “opposites” are experienced as anintegral part of one another:She understands, symbolically speaking, notwith the head but with the whole body, in thather spiritual and corporeal processes are boundtogether in a way quite foreign to the averageman.8The importance the dreamer attaches to the physicalbody of the monk and the way that the “Navel of God”is reached through his navel reflect the feminineprocess by which the “spiritual” is realized “within thebody.” As another woman was told in a dream, “Godbecomes conscious in the body.”The feminine principle itself is closely related tothe world of matter: “Since time immemorial thefeminine principle has stood for nature and matter—Mater Natura.”9 Just as the woman gives birth andnourishes her children, so does the earth. From MotherEarth are born all living creatures, and with her bodyshe feeds them. They drink from her streams and eatthe food she provides.Because the archetypal feminine is so closelybonded with the earth, a woman’s experience of herown feminine self will include the physical. In ancientmatriarchal societies this integration of body and spiritwas a part of the religious culture, embodied in thefigure of the “sacred prostitute,” for whom sexualityand spirituality were undivided. However, this attitude,which celebrated an essential part of the feminine, wasrepressed by the patriarchy, and in Christianity only the"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread116body of Christ is sacred. The Catechism asks us torenounce the “sinful lusts of the flesh,”10 and Saint Paulwrites: “Make no provision for the flesh, to fulfil thelusts thereof.”11 As a result, the body and indeed thefeminine principle herself have been rejected, re-pressed, and ultimately identified with evil. The alche-mists, in their search for the light hidden in the depthsof matter, sought to redress this imbalance, and todayany quest for wholeness needs to embrace the physi-cal. This is true for both men and women, but particu-larly so for women because in their very substancethere is this sacred bonding of earth and spirit.This dream emphasizes the inclusion of the physi-cal dimension. Possibly this is a compensation for theCatholic conditioning of the dreamer; but at the sametime as revaluing the feminine world of matter, thedream also stresses that spiritual life is a love affair thatinvolves the whole human being, and even affects thevery cells of the body. In mystical experiences of beingembraced by the Beloved, everything is included:In the night, for instance, one is resting in God—body, mind, everything. The body is included—this is an important point; it too is resting in Him,and this gives such an experience of purephysical bliss. It is like relaxing within theendlessness of love.12From the embrace of the monk the dreamer istaken to the “Navel of God,” a landscape of scorchingsun and no vegetation.

Thus the dream em-braces the physical in the form of the body of the monkand also images an attitude of spiritual renunciation.Spiritual poverty is not to deny the beauty andwonder of His creation, but to acknowledge that thecreation belongs to the Creator, which means to live inthe presence of God. Whatever your outward activity,inwardly you are with Him, and nothing else matters.In his invaluable little book, The Practice of the Pres-ence of God, Brother Lawrence describes such a state.Whatever Brother Lawrence did, he did with God: hepeeled the potatoes with God, he cooked with God.Throughout his daily work, amid the noise and theclatter of the monastery kitchens, he remained alwaysin an inner attitude of prayer, always in His presence.If one’s inner attention is turned towards God,then the secret beauty of creation reveals itself. Thewonder of a woman is that she contains this beauty inher body, because as a part of the Great Mother sheembraces the feminine principle of life, the beauty ofthe Creator made manifest.

But first she must be burntby the scorching sun, which will burn away all herattachments to this world, leaving her empty:When does Gold Ore become pure Gold?When it is put through a process of fire.

The masculine also givesher the support and perseverance necessary for thismost difficult task, and counters the natural inertia ofthe feminine, the pull of the Great Mother back intounconsciousness.But what is essential is that the masculine remainsin service to the feminine, like the Arthurian knightswho were always in service to Our Lady. The womanmust remain a “virgin,” true to her feminine self, andnever prostitute herself to the masculine.

Unable to face thedarkness within, he has persecuted his projection.Man’s fear of the dark feminine derives from hisfear of the Great Mother, the dragon mother, whorepresents the deepest powers of the unconscious.Hers is a realm in which there is no light of conscious-ness. In this primal place there is no morality, nodivision into light or darkness. It is the instinctualjungle world—“red in tooth and claw”—and the do-main of the tiger who symbolizes the undifferentiatedenergy of the goddess.This fear of the feminine is very real and shouldnot be dismissed. Towards the end of his life Jung said,“Woman is a very, very strong being, magical. That’swhy I am afraid of women.”4 If we are to make acreative relationship with the inner feminine we mustacknowledge this fear. In myths a virgin, symbol of theanima, is often held captive by a dragon. In previousages the heroic quest involved slaying the dragon. Manneeded to free himself from his instinctual drives andthe fearsome power of the Great Mother. Only thencould he find the anima, his individual feminine self.While the anima is an archetypal figure, with her rootsin the collective unconscious, she also symbolizes apersonal relationship to the feminine.

In order torealize his own individual relationship to the inner andouter feminine, he must free the virgin, his own purefeminine self.But in our era, too many dragons have been slain,and we now need the power of the Great Mother toheal ourselves and our world. The anima still needs tobe set free, but the dragon needs to be accepted, notkilled. We need to look at our fear of the feminine andin the mirror of consciousness see her darkest face.Only then will we cease to project this fear; only thenwill we integrate rather than reject the powerfulenergies of the feminine.The anima often first appears in her idealizedform. She is a pure and beautiful virgin. In our Westernculture we have separated the light and the darkaspects of the feminine. The heroic ideal honored“Mary, Queen of Heaven” and rejected and repressedher darker, earthier twin. This twin first appeared in theJudeo-Christian tradition as Lilith, the first wife ofAdam, who refused to be subservient to him. In killingthe dragon we may have freed a virgin but we haverejected the instinctual power of the feminine.

Here lies theheroic quest of our age, for the child of the future needsto ride on the back of the dragon.In descending into the unconscious, we meet thisnatural energy of the feminine, which the romantic,idealized image of the anima is unable to contain. Wesee this idealized image represented in Shakespeare’sHamlet, in the prince’s initial love for Ophelia. She is“the celestial and my soul’s idol, the most beautifulOphelia”; no earthly images intrude upon his vision.But like the moon, the feminine has a dark side whichcannot be ignored forever: “The baying of Hecate isalways there, whether it sound from near or from far.”5Hamlet’s destiny forces him to confront the dark sideof the feminine in his mother’s instinctual sexuality,her adulterous affair with his uncle Claudius. In disgusthe accuses her of bestial sexuality:Nay, but to liveIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,Stew’d in corruption, honeying and making loveOver the nasty sty!6Yet what this image evokes is not merely animalsqualor, but associations with the Great Mother. Inancient times honey was sacred to the Earth Goddess,and the “nasty sty” relates to the pig which symbolizesthe creative female, “the fruitful and receptive womb.”Both honey and the pig were associated with thefemale genitals: there is a Hindu marriage custom ofdaubing the woman’s genitals with honey, and “themost primitive and ancient of the pig associations iswith the female genitals, which even in Greek andLatin were called ‘pig.’”7"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"127The Inner Feminine and Her Dual NatureSexuality and fertility belong to the domain of theGreat Mother. Here Shakespeare images both hersensuality and her amoral, instinctual nature. Hamlet’sOphelia, his “soul’s idol,” cannot embrace this deeperand darker anima, and so she dissolves back into theunconscious, first into madness and then drowned inthe “glassy stream.” Later Hamlet is able to integrateboth poles of the feminine, and so realize its transcen-dent nature. When Ophelia has been buried, Gertrudedescribes this state of inner peace that follows the“madness” of Hamlet’s descent into the unconscious:Anon, as patient as the female doveWhen that her golden couplets are disclos’d,His silence will sit drooping.8Here the “female dove” corresponds to the femininespirit of God, the highest form of the feminine.9 This isthe transformation of the feminine archetype, whosedual aspects are recognized as the “golden couplets.”In the inner alchemical process the conflict of oppo-sites has become pure gold.A SEDUCTIVE AND CUNNING LADYThe negative aspect of the anima takes on many formsand she does not always appear projected onto anexternal figure. The anima is the mediator between theconscious mind and the unconscious and thus throughher a man has access to the creative energies of theunconscious. She is his muse but in her negative formshe does not allow a man to taste the fruits of hiscreativity. She would keep his potential trapped in theunconscious or, as in the case of some great artists like"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread128van Gogh or Wagner, she so overwhelms him with thecreative power of the unconscious that his own indi-vidual consciousness is lost in insanity.Jung experienced this aspect of the feminine as aninvisible presence full of deep cunning. When he wasworking with the fantasies of the unconscious, an innervoice told him it was “art,” and he realized that if hebelieved hershe might then easily have seduced me intobelieving that I was a misunderstood artist, andthat my so-called artistic nature gave me theright to neglect reality.10The dark side of the anima always tries to lure us awayfrom reality into the fascinating but murky waters ofthe unconscious. Our defense against her is the powerof consciousness, which keeps us grounded in theordinary, everyday world while at the same timefacilitating a bridge into the inner world. Jung stressesthe dangers of the anima and the importance ofconsciously working with the contents of the uncon-scious:The insinuations of the anima, the mouth-piece of the unconscious, can utterly destroy aman. In the final analysis the decisive factor isconsciousness, which can understand the mani-festations of the unconscious and take up aposition towards them.11One friend, whose work, like Jung’s, involvedboth factual research and working creatively with theunconscious, experienced this dark lady as a fascinat-ing sequence of ideas that suddenly came to him and"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"129The Inner Feminine and Her Dual Natureappeared to distract him from the main direction of hiswriting. For a while he deliberated as to whether tofollow these ideas or to stick to his previous direction.He was aware of their fascination and of the inherentdanger of being lured away from the central theme ofhis work; yet, at the same time, he consciously choseto follow up these new ideas. The importance ofmaking this decision consciously can not be overesti-mated, for it meant that he had not been seduced by theunconscious. It had a profound psychological effect aswas shown in a dream he had soon after. This dreamhas the quality of a myth or fairy tale:I am involved with others in a war against anevil man and his woman. Our base and strong-hold is a strange building like the upper half ofa huge, lichen-covered crab shell. It’s perfectlyround and symmetrical and has about ten ortwelve entrances arranged regularly all aroundit. It seems impenetrable.

Iknow exactly who she is but I consciouslydecide to play along with her disguise—hidingwhat I know just as she is hiding who she is—and I deliberately seduce and make love to her.The next morning the other people in thestronghold come up to us as we lie in my bed.We are not in a separate bedroom but next to"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread130one of the arches in the single vast room thatmakes up the stronghold. She gets out of the bedand as she does so, young and attractive as shewas, in front of everybody’s eyes she startschanging rapidly—second by second—into anold, senile, dying woman. I, the leader and hero,remain lying on the bed, dying of a diseasewhich I caught through making love to her. Thisis what she meant to do, and her seduction ployhas succeeded. But, as I am dying on the bed,the celestial voice of a woman speaks out clearlyand loudly as if from a loudspeaker whichreverberates throughout the building: “If youwrite a book which you owe (no matter why) tosomeone else, you cannot yourself write books.”I have heard that voice before and I knowwho she is. Only once in my life has she spokento me, when I was lying on my bed fifteen yearsago, and what she said then changed my life.This dream begins with a war, symbolic of an innerconflict, between the dreamer’s ego and his shadow,“an evil man,” and the dark side of his anima. Asfrequently happens, the shadow and the negativeanima are in league: she is the evil man’s woman.Furthermore, the dreamer’s stronghold seems impen-etrable. It cannot be defeated by a direct attack fromthe shadow. Direct confrontation can often be de-feated by reason, but the anima’s power of “insinua-tion” and “suggestion” can, as Jung warns, be far moredangerous. Her “ploys” can undermine a man’s con-sciousness, devalue what he is doing, misdirect hisattention—often without his even being aware of whatis happening. (In contrast the negative animus will"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"131The Inner Feminine and Her Dual Natureoften attack directly with well-reasoned arguments:“Nobody will want to read the book you are writing,”or “Can’t you see you are a total failure? You are unableto relate properly to a man.”)12However, at the beginning of this dream, thedreamer’s ego, which is the “leader in the war,” is also“totally dissociated from the leader—whom I canwatch and observe as a distinct person.” The impor-tance of such an attitude of detachment, or “observ-ing,” is that it “counterbalances the devouring powersof the unconscious.” It is this attitude which enablesthe dreamer to experience the dark side of the animawithout becoming lost in her seductive embrace.The anima is the mistress of disguise, and in thisdream, as in many fairy tales, the evil witch-likewoman takes on the guise of a beautiful, sensuouswoman to beguile the hero. However, the consciousdetachment of the dreamer enables him to see throughher disguise, though he allows himself to play alongwith it. In the real-life dynamic he was aware of thedangerous fascination of the ideas that had come fromthe unconscious, but decided to work with them.Playing a perilous role, he “deliberately seduced andmade love to” the evil man’s woman.To make love is symbolic of integration; throughaccepting the deceitful nature of the dark aspect of theanima, the dreamer was able to consciously experi-ence and thus integrate her negative energy. Whenthese lovers awake the next morning, the other peoplein the stronghold come up to them, which also sug-gests an integration (as aspects of the psyche cometogether). Furthermore the lovers are not in a separatebedroom, but “next to one of the arches in the singlevast room that makes up the stronghold.” The dreamer’s"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread132psyche is thus imaged as a single inner space withoutthe experience of separation. The arch also carries anauspicious symbolism, for to pass under an arch ininitiation ceremonies symbolizes “being reborn, leav-ing behind the old nature.”13The integration of the dark aspect of the anima isa profound initiation, but first the dreamer must expe-rience the stage of putrefaction, decay and death, asthe old attitudes of consciousness break down. Thebeautiful, seductive woman becomes an old and senilewoman. This is an image found in many fairy tales, asthe negative anima loses her powers to bewitch and isshown in her true form as an old witch. But this womanis not only senile, but dying, and so is the dreamer,dying of a “disease ... caught through making love toher.” This is what the woman had intended; she hadmeant to destroy him, to lure him into the unconsciouswhere his consciousness would be lost forever. But,because of his conscious acceptance, this death willnot leave him lost in the unconscious; rather it will leadto a transformation of consciousness. In particular, hisold attitude towards the feminine and his relationshipwith her creative potential will die so that a newrelationship can be born. The negative anima has beentransformed into Sophia, the divine aspect of thefeminine, the figure of wisdom. Hers is the voice henow hears speaking out. Purified of her distorting,negative aspect, the highest form of the feminine cannow be heard clearly through his whole psyche.The dreamer has heard Sophia’s voice once, fif-teen years before, and it changed his life. He has neverforgotten it, and now, through integrating the dark sideof the anima, he will be able to have a direct relation-ship with Sophia. She will guide him in his work, butfirst she tells him what must be a basic principle for his"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"133The Inner Feminine and Her Dual Naturework: “If you write a book which you owe (no matterwhy) to someone else, you cannot yourself writebooks.” This may appear to be just a simple precept,“to thine owne self be true,” but it has a profoundpsychological significance. In working with the cre-ative potential of the anima we are channeling energyfrom within. If we are not true to our deepest self, thenthis energy can become distorted. If this energy fromthe unconscious is distorted, it can corrupt and becomevery destructive.Our only motive in working with the energy of theunconscious should be to serve our deepest creativepurpose; this purpose is always in harmony with ourtrue inner self. If the individual is not free to follow hisown inner guidance, if this creative energy is used toserve any other purpose (if the book is owed, forwhatever reason, to someone else), this energy willbecome contaminated and will contaminate. This ap-plies to any allegiance to an external cause or ideal,because however justified a cause may be, it imprisonsthe individual within a certain conscious framework.The most dangerous case is when this energy is usedfor the power purposes of the ego, for the sake ofpersonal gain or prestige. This primordial energy isnuminous, dynamic, but essentially amoral. It has noquality of discrimination, and will feed the power-hungry shadow, which in time will become strongenough to dominate the ego.Before the full potential of the unconscious can beused creatively, the shadow must be confronted andthe dark side of the anima unmasked. We need a purevessel to contain these powerful forces. It is for thisreason that the deeper we go into the unconscious andthe more we channel its energy, the higher is theethical standard which is required. It is not that we"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread134need to be a morally “better person,” but that ourconsciousness needs to be pure enough not to becorrupted or distorted by the primal energies fromwithin.BEHIND THE DANCE OF ILLUSIONThe anima is a temptress, deceiving a man not onlywith the bewitching nature of the unconscious, butalso with the myriad attractions of the outer world. Sheis the mistress of illusion; hers is the dance of maya.Jung describes maya as an aspect of the anima:She is the great illusionist, the seductresswho draws him [man] into life with her Maya—and not only into life’s reasonable and usefulaspects, but into its frightful paradoxes andambivalences where good and evil, success andruin, hope and despair counterbalance oneanother.14As Salome she is the temptress, keeping man entrancedin the beauty of this world, hiding her real purposebehind a seductive veil. The ascetics who turn theireyes from women and punish their flesh try to escapeher power. But only too often this temptress is merelyrepressed, and she exerts her fascination through theshadow. She becomes a demon who haunts the dreamsof the pious.But once a man has confronted her dark, seductivenature and is no longer in her grip, then the femininereveals her higher nature as Sophia. Sophia carries thedeep wisdom of the soul, and allows us to see through"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"135The Inner Feminine and Her Dual Naturethe veils of the illusion and glimpse the real beauty thatlies behind. She enables us to see the secret face ofcreation. Sufi poetry speaks of the beauty of the humanform because it is a reflection of the formless. The formof woman holds the highest essence because she is themost beautiful creation of the Great Artist. Accordingto Ibn ‘Arabî, “Woman is the highest form of earthlybeauty, but earthly beauty is nothing unless it is amanifestation and reflection of the Divine Qualities.”15Thus, in Sufi poetry, each of her features has symbolicsignificance representing qualities of the Eternal Be-loved. The eye symbolizes the quality of the mystery ofGod’s vision; the mole or beauty spot signifies theDivine Essence itself; the twist or curve of her curl isa metaphor for Divine mysteries:16By the fragrant breeze from your tresses’ ringletI am forever drunk;While the devastating guile of your bewitching eyesdevastates me at every breath.17The eternal beauty seen projected in the wonderof romantic love is a glimpse of our own eternal nature.Sophia draws aside the veils of the dancer, and allowsus to wonder at the divine beauty of the feminine sideof God. He for whom we long comes to us in so manyguises, and with the wisdom of the feminine we areable to recognize Him in His creation, hear the musicthat is beneath life’s surface, and see the true beauty ineveryday life. I was once on an airline flight with myteacher, and looking down the aisle saw a heavilymade-up stewardess walk towards me. I have alwaysbeen prejudiced against women wearing a lot of make-up, particularly when it is an attempt to disguise their"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread136natural age. But just as this thought came into my mind,my teacher turned to me, and with the simple wisdomof Sophia awoke me, saying, “Human beings are sobeautiful, aren’t they? Aren’t all human beings sobeautiful?”THE SECRET PLACES OF THE SOULWithin the psyche the feminine carries the mysteryhidden in the dance of creation. As much as she is atemptress, she is also a guide who, like Dante’sBeatrice, can lead a man to the secret places of the soul.Once we have accepted her dark face, she can nolonger devour us or lead us astray. She shows us thebeauty of our inner self, which is none other than herown face unveiled. This is her role in the followingdream:I am in a castle and am being taken by anextremely beautiful woman to a part of thecastle which is not open to the public. It is asecret place which nobody else is allowed tosee. I go in. It is a most wonderfully beautifulroom with chandeliers. It contains a huge pool,rectangular like a ballroom. In the middle of thepool there are beautiful water lilies in a mandala-shaped flower arrangement.The pool is full of the most beautiful fish Ihave ever seen. They are absolutely extraordi-nary. They have just been fed and I am able tofeed them a little bit. They are a beautiful coralcolor and are big and fat like those very oldgoldfish one finds in Japan.

Sometimes a dream will open awindow through which we can glimpse the wonderthat we really are. In the public world our beauty isusually veiled, not only to others but to our self.

Let my beloved come into hisgarden and eat his pleasant fruits.18The feminine takes us into her garden, a place richwith the fruits and the flowers of the soul. The longingto find this “secret garden” is deeper than sexualattraction; the garden is filled with the wisdom that"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread138belongs to the heart. This is the real meeting place oflovers; in the fleeting moments of sexual bliss we tasteits fruit. Sexual ecstasy is a momentary experience ofthe bliss that lies within the heart, given to us for thesake of procreation. According to Irina Tweedie it is“really the soul and not the body that is theexperiencer.”19 If a couple make love with both theirsouls and their bodies, and in the moment of bliss giveeverything as an offering to the One True Lover, theycan then enter this fragrant garden that is the ecstatichome of the mystic. Mystical states can be very erotic(though the energy is not felt in the sex organs but inthe throat chakra); in these moments of bliss, themystic is always the receptive one, the lover impreg-nated by the spirit of the Beloved. Whether man orwoman, we become feminine in this experience; andin its ecstasy we are both enslaved and freed, ravishedand purified:Take mee to you, imprison mee, for IExcept you enthrall mee, never shall be free,Nor ever chast, except you ravish mee.20The mysteries of the soul are feminine. In thebeautiful room hidden in the castle of the dreamer allthe images are feminine. There is a huge pool in themidst of which there are beautiful water lilies. The lilyis a flower sacred to the Virgin Goddess, but it alsoexhibits the quality of the lotus, for it rises from themud to flower only when it reaches the surface of thewater. Thus the lily images the process of innertransformation, which begins in the muddy depths ofthe unconscious and only flowers when it finallyemerges into consciousness.

Thealchemical processes that change our whole beinggrow silently in the depths, transforming the structureof our psyche from within. Transformations that arenot rooted in this way are rarely lasting; they are merelylike waves on the surface. Real inner work requirespatience and perseverance; only those who are trulycommitted will continue to walk along the hard andstony path without experiencing obvious results.But the flowers have opened and the water liliesform a mandala. The beauty of the Self opens beforethe eyes of the dreamer, and that beauty is always awe-inspiring, for it brings into consciousness our owndivine nature. It reminds us of our real home.What a wonderful lotus it is, that blooms atthe heart of the spinning wheel of the universe!Only a few pure souls know of its true delight.Music is all around it, and there the heartpartakes of the joy of the Infinite Sea.21The pool is also full of fish, symbolizing thecontents of the unconscious which the alchemicalprocess brings together and transforms. But these fishare “the most beautiful fish I had ever seen,” for hereagain the dreamer sees the true beauty of his inner self,hidden in the unconscious. They are “a beautiful coralcolor.” Coral is the tree of the Mother Goddess, andbecause the inner transformation takes place in thedepths, it is under the dominion of the Great Goddess.The Great Mother may resist the evolution of individualconsciousness, but the heart is the king and the Self isthe master and the “source of every power.” Even theGreat Goddess follows the will of the Self.

Coral is also suggestive of pinkwhich is the color of love. This hints at an inner secretof the path of love: that it infuses the whole psyche ofthe seeker with the energy of love. The psyche and allof its contents become permeated from within with thetransforming energy of love.In addition to the fish, there is a frog in the pool.The frog is a lunar symbol of renewal and transforma-tion, emphasizing the feminine potential for innerchange. But then the dreamer notices that the pool isalso “full of giraffes.” With its long eyelashes and gentleways the giraffe is the most graceful and feminine ofcreatures. These giraffes are happy underwater, forthat’s where they live. In the unconscious are thebeauty and grace of the feminine. These qualities havea deep wisdom, a wisdom of silence rather thanspeech. The graceful walk of a woman is movement inharmony with nature; for the Sufi the curve of hereyebrow symbolizes the subtlety of Divine beauty. Wehave become so conditioned to value only knowledgecommunicated through words that we have forgottenwhat is contained in the senses: how touch can evokehidden qualities of feeling, how a caress can conveyunderstanding.

She is thepersonification of his creativity, and meeting with herbrings its fire flowing from the source of his being.Connecting us with our inner powers, she bringsmeaning into our everyday world, which each of usmanifests in our own unique way. With her handsevery act can be an offering of the soul, each gesturecreative. Baking bread or writing a song, painting apicture or planting a flower, each can speak of theinner mystery and allow its beauty and meaning to beheard.Meaning does not come from the external world,but from within, from the archetypal world. Theprimal, archetypal beings who inhabit it are imprintedwith meaning. The archetypes do not have an identi-fiable meaning; they do not mean something specificin the sense that bon in French means “good” inEnglish. They rather have qualities of meaning; theymake things meaningful. Huston Smith, the contempo-rary American philosopher, designates this type ofmeaning as “existential”; it is “the kind we have in mindwhen we say that something is meaningful.”22 How-ever, because our language has developed to describethe external world of the senses, it has very few wordsto describe this type of meaning. We can say thatsomething is “very meaningful” or “quite meaningful,”but the different ways in which things feel meaningfulcannot be expressed. This is true of our language forfeeling as well.

In our language there is only one word;the poverty of our feelings is reflected in the povertyof our language. We have not named the differentqualities of feeling because we have not valued them.Our rejection of the feminine has caused the qualitiesof meaning she brings with her to be left out of ourlives.The anima is the messenger of meaning. Embrac-ing the physical and symbolic worlds, she lets us tastethe substance of our soul in our day-to-day life. Butwork with the anima should never be self-indulgent; itshould be directed towards a greater understanding ofthe inner world. This need for a greater understandingwas encapsulated in a dream in which the dreamer wasabout to make love with his anima figure when theteacher appeared at the other end of the room, and,pointing to a symbol on the wall, said to the dreamer,“What does this mean?” The dreamer had to under-stand the symbolic meaning of his relationship with hisanima. This has to be a conscious union, for only thenis the meaning of the symbolic inner world infused intothe outer world, a place which today has too oftenbecome a wasteland.The highest form of the anima is Sophia, who,personifying the wisdom of the soul, brings the deep-est meaning of the Self into our everyday life. InShakespeare’s King Lear she is Cordelia, Lear’s daugh-ter who refuses to flatter his ego and is banishedbecause of her refusal and her silence. The king thenhas to confront the dark, power-hungry aspect of theanima in his other daughters, Goneril and Regan.

Ibn ‘Arabi described Sophia as“an image raising its head from the secrecy of theheart.” She connects us with our own divine nature andso allows us to see the inner purpose hidden withineverything.

The Beloved is in love with the slave (asynonym for the Sufi, who is known as a slave of God),for it is the Beloved who is seeking us, calling to us,longing for us. We always think that we are the seeker,but the deeper mystery is that we are called. The seekeris in reality the sought, as it is said in the Qur’an: “Heloves them, and they love Him.”2 Rûmî describes howit is always the Beloved who secretly seduces us backinto His arms:sultan, saint, pickpocket;love has everyone by the eardragging us to Godby secret waysI never knewthat God, too, desires us.3When the slave awakens from her embrace, it is asif from a dream, for dreams are the meeting point ofthe inner and outer worlds.

Yet it can happenthat suddenly the projection is withdrawn, and theother is no longer magical, but just an ordinary humanbeing.THE BEAUTY OF GOD’S FEMININE FORMPart of the fascination of the feminine is that sheembraces the wonder of creation. The principle ofmatter itself is feminine and the whole of creation canbe seen as God’s feminine form. When a man projectsthe anima onto a woman, what he experiences is asense of both completion and awe. The beauty of theinner and outer are fused together.

She is the Goddess clothed in aman’s own personal imagery.The anima, who can initiate a man into the mysteryof his own feminine being, is projected onto a womanwho is able to embody, however fleetingly, thefeminine’s fascination and beauty. Yet a woman whoattracts an anima projection does not have to bephysically beautiful.

She feels that sheis not seen for herself and may try to break or escapefrom the projection. Could this be because we do notknow what to do with this image of divinity and soconfuse it with the personal? If a woman can see herselfas a priestess of the divine Feminine, can the projectionthen be honored in its own place?

Ionce asked this question to a very wise old man, whoreplied with two words, “unconditional love.”For those who are prepared to suffer the depths oflove, unconditional love can open a doorway that canlead us out of the inevitable disillusionment of projec-tion. Unconditional love is all-inclusive. It does notdemand but accepts. It is the quality of love describedby St. Paul:Love suffers long and is kind; love does notenvy, love does not vaunt itself, is not puffed up ...does not seek her own way, is not easilyprovoked, does not think evil of another ...bears all things, believes all things, hopes allthings, endures all things.9Unconditional love does not belong to the ego, forit transcends duality. Containing the opposites, thehuman and the divine, the person and the projection,unconditional love is not a peaceful state, for the loveris thrown between these opposites, confused andtormented by their contradictions.What happens during this painful process is that inthe alchemical vessel of the heart the lover’s projec-tions are burnt away together with the ego of the lover.The animus/anima returns to its place within the heart,not rejected but transformed through the fire. Then thelover sees in the eyes of his partner not the mystery ofhis own projection, but the beauty of her soul. Thebeloved can be seen as she really is, both human anddivine.

For awoman the masculine spirit of God touches her and inthe form of a man takes her in its arms. In this alchemywe are confronted by the ultimate human paradox: thatwe are both human and divine. This is our greatestglory and our greatest suffering. Through falling inlove we are able to touch the hem of our own divinity,enter into its timeless world in which a kiss can lastforever. But each time we taste this wine, we also tastethe pain of separation and the anguish that both weand our lover are human. We long to unite, to mergeinto the oneness of love, and yet we enact this mysterywith another—with a human being who has feelingsand desires that are often different from our own.Duality always remains, and on the human stage theecstasy of love will always bring anguish.The greatest love poems, Romeo and Juliet, Tristamand Iseult, Layla and Majnun, tell the same story: howlove in this world is the tragedy of separation. Only indeath do lovers unite forever. Death takes us beyondthe ego and the world of opposites. Only then is thereno separation.

And this great journey often begins with theenigma of human love. A man once came to the Sufimaster Jâmî and asked to become his disciple. He hadstudied all the scriptures in depth, and was verysurprised when the master asked him, “Have you everbeen in love?” He answered, “No.” And the master said,“Go and fall in love and suffer, and then come back.”The man went into the world and learned to love andsuffer.

In both states individual conscious-ness ceases to exist; there is a feeling of primal unityas the oneness of life is experienced.But between these two there is the greatest differ-ence, for the mystic lover’s madness is containedwithin the vessel of the Self.

However, thespiritual path points beyond ego-consciousness andthere comes the time when the seeker must leavebehind any mental or psychological security. Then theseeker focuses not on his individual consciousness buton the divine consciousness of the Self.In turning away from the ego toward the Self, thelover forges a crucible that can contain the mostpowerful energies of the unconscious. Meditation,aspiration, and prayer strengthen this crucible, andconstant witnessing or self-awareness stops cracksfrom appearing. Then, when the crucible is strongenough, it can hold the fire that reduces the ego toashes from which the phoenix is born. Only if there isa secure relationship with the Self can this process takeplace; otherwise the energies of the unconscious willdestroy the ego and nothing new will be born.The Self is the master of the energies of theunconscious.

This is ouressential nature, the Self, which the alchemists calledthe philosopher’s stone, the lapis. The psychologicaland spiritual work of inner transformation is a processof uncovering this divine consciousness which existswithin the heart, “that Person in the heart, no biggerthan a thumb ... maker of past and future, the sametoday and tomorrow, that is Self.”2The Self is our innermost center, the part of ourbeing that is not separate from God. This immortalsubstance exists within the “heart of hearts,” the organof divine perception that is within the heart chakra.The Sufi says that it is not the ego that makes thespiritual journey, but this mysterious substance whichis both the pilgrim and the path.

In the consciousness of the Selfthe knowledge and the knower are one, the lover andthe Beloved are united.The Self awakens us to our real nature and thentakes us homeward. Without the Self there would be noawakening, no pilgrim, and no journey. The alchemistsdescribe the paradoxical nature of this journey with thesaying, “One must start with a bit of the philosopher’sstone if one is to find it,” and the Sufi expresses thissame mystery with the saying, “The end is present atthe beginning.”This awakening happens in the very core of ourbeing as the Self turns our attention away from the egoback to Itself. Yet this happening takes place so deepwithin us that we have little direct consciousness of ourown awakening, or of our higher nature that guides us.Also the Self is so powerful—it is like our Father inHeaven to whom we can pray—that until we havebeen prepared by the path we would be overwhelmedby even a glimpse of Its light. Instead the Self appearsto us in dreams or visions as a symbol. The Self comesin many forms, in many different images, each imagereflecting an aspect of our divine nature.Jung’s research into dreams and spiritual imagerydocumented many of the symbols of the Self. To namea few: an ordinary stone or the magical lapis; a crystal,whose mathematically precise arrangement suggeststhe union of extreme opposites—of matter and spirit;3the symbol of a mandala, suggesting the orderingprinciple of the Self; a helpful animal, representing Itsinstinctive nature and our primal connectedness to oursurroundings;4 or an elephant, whose great strengthimages the natural power of the Self.

But these symbols are not just images of the Self;they carry and communicate the numinosity and spiri-tual direction of our higher nature. They connect us tothis deepest source of wisdom and power that existswithin us. Symbols of the Self bring into consciousnesswhat is hidden in our center and help in the work oftransforming us, as the following dream and interpre-tation suggest:I dream that I am taken to a large room wherethere are a number of people, male and female.At one end sits a spiritual Teacher, who instructsus to go to the opposite side of the room wherethere is a large table covered with objects. Allthese objects are to be worn on the physicalbody, and will cause considerable discomfort,even pain. I remember seeing a hair shirt, andsomething to be worn around the head andfastened tightly. I choose a round pebble, to beplaced in the shoe and worn all the time. I takethe pebble and place it in my shoe, and walktowards the door. As I am leaving the teachershouts after me, “It is possible to wear it, withoutit hurting too much.”I awake from this dream feeling very “high,”full of lightness and ecstasy.

Then the conscious and uncon-scious work together in harmony. In fact, if theindividual does not respond to the hints offered by theunconscious, the Self has the ability to attract externalsituations that force the individual to listen, evencausing an illness or an accident. Jung said that if onedoes not deal with an internal situation, it can happento one as fate. One just “happens” not to notice a redlight...Individuation is a powerful process, channelingenergies from the depths of the unconscious.

When I go toher flat I return some food which I had takenfrom there, but again this doesn’t interest hervery much. Instead she takes a dark stone fromher pocket which glows bright and pulses withlight and she says I should take this stone outfrom time to time and look at it.In this dream, the dark stone “which glows brightand pulses with light” is undoubtedly the philosopher’sstone, to which the dreamer has access, as the teachertells her to “take this stone out from time to time andlook at it.” The philosopher’s stone is always in ourpossession; it is only that it has been forgotten andneeds to be uncovered. This dream also makes avaluable distinction between spiritual and solely psy-chological work. The “twins which die” and the “foodwhich I had taken from her flat” suggest psychologicaldisturbances within the dreamer, and yet the teacher isnot interested, but rather turns the attention of thedreamer towards the stone.

All ourdisturbances, neuroses, and shadow dynamics willcome to the surface, to be accepted and loved. Yet thecore of the path is not about psychological integration,but about the greater wholeness of love, a love thattranscends boundaries and does not belong to thedualities of this world.THE JOURNEY INTO DARKNESSThis love is always present, although buried, some-times very deeply, under our conditioning and otherpsychological patterns. The substance of the Self islove, and it comes to us in many forms and images,turning our attention away from the outer world, backto the root of the root of our own being. This love isalso the light of the Self, which will take us into thedarkness, where our real nature is hidden.

The swan beckons heraway from the noisy party of outer life, towards adifferent horizon:I am at a party but I leave because I find it toonoisy.

How"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"187Symbols of the Selfoften does spiritual life begin with a need for solitude,a need to withdraw into oneself? For only when one isalone with oneself can a new direction, a new depth ofmeaning, emerge from within. There, from the beach,she sees the swan, an image of her true, royal nature.A hadith (a saying attributed to the Prophet) states,“When you take one step towards Him He takes tentowards you.” As the dreamer steps towards the path,the Self appears, which is both her guide and her goal.Becoming the swan, she begins her spiritual journey,leaving the shores of this world for the infinite ocean.But why in this dream is the swan swimmingtowards the setting sun? Surely this departure shouldbe towards the rising sun, symbolizing the dawn of anew consciousness. When I first heard the dream I waspuzzled about this, but then I found the answer in analchemical text quoted by Jung:“Know,” says Ripley, “that your beginningshould be made towards sunset, and that fromthere you should turn towards midnight, wherethe lights cease altogether to shine, and youshould remain ninety nights in the dark fire ofpurgatory without light. Then turn your coursetowards the east, and you will pass throughmany different colours.”5And to this Jung comments: “The alchemical workstarts with the descent into darkness (nigredo), i.e. theunconscious.” Thus, symbolized as “a swan swimmingtowards the setting sun,” the dreamer is embarking onthe great journey into the depths of the unconscious,which is the work of a lifetime. Furthermore, thiswhole process begins with her identification with the"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread188swan: “I become the swan.” She begins with recogniz-ing her own higher nature, the lapis, and becoming onewith it. Only the Self can take us Home. Instinctively,with a wisdom far deeper than the mind, we know thatwe need to give ourself to this process, allow onenessto lead us back to Oneness.For those who are not on a spiritual path, theirpsychological opus will be consciously directed to-wards living in a more balanced and integrated man-ner, and indeed Jung stressed the importance of living“in this world, and this life.”6 Sufism is neither amonastic nor an ascetic path. The Sufi lives in theworld, and may bring up a family, be a craftsman orbusinessman, yet his primary orientation is towardsannihilation in God, a mystical state of union. And so,although the wayfarer’s psychological work may re-flect problems about living in this world, the opus isfocused on the beyond. Thus, in the dream about theswan, the woman’s journey (both spiritual and psycho-logical) points away from the party of life and theshores of this world.The Self is both the beginning and the end of thespiritual quest, a quest which takes the seeker far fromthe security of the known world. And yet the Self issomething most natural, often imaged by a baby ordivine child. The birth of the Self is a wonderful butpainful process, for it is a stripping away of all of theillusions and identities with which we cover our realnature. In the words of love’s martyr, al-Hallâj, “WhenTruth has taken hold of a heart she empties it of all butHerself.”7 The following dream alludes to this divinebirth, and points to its “dark side.” The central qualityof this dream is a feeling of fear:"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"189Symbols of the SelfThere was a tremendous feeling of fear inthis dream. Three old men got into my flat underfalse pretenses (saying that they were deliveringa package) or they actually broke in. They wereshabbily dressed and looked like hobos.

The old men who looked like hobos are theMagi, and their gifts point towards the birth of the Self.In fact there is a suggestion that the Magi who came tohonor the birth of Christ were early Sufis.

It was said that these wise men used tomove their lips in silent prayer, a custom which was notknown to the Greeks. People would see them movingtheir lips without talking, and when asked, the Sophossaid that they were praying. This is the silent dhikr, theremembrance of God, practiced by the Sufis.But why were these three men in the dreamdressed like hobos rather than kings, and why was thedreamer so frightened? Sufis are known as “travelers”or “wayfarers on the mystical path,” following thesaying of the Prophet, “Be in this world as if you are atraveler, a passerby, with your clothes and shoes full ofdust.” We are like tramps, not in the sense that we wearold clothes, but in the sense that we have no real homein this world because we belong somewhere else. Wefollow the will of God and not the ways of the world.This is simply expressed by the saying of Christ, “Thefoxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests;but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.”8It is not surprising that the dreamer is frightenedby the old men. If one seriously embarks on the Pathof Love, one becomes, like Majnun, lost to this world,wandering in the wilderness known only to those whohave drunk love’s wine. Maybe it does not happen sodramatically, but it happens. In fact the woman whodreamed about the hobos was already facing this crisis,in that she was in her mid-thirties, having given up asuccessful career in order to be with her teacher; andher mother was worried about her because she didn’thave a proper job, or a house, or a husband, orchildren.In the eyes of the world the Sufi is mad.

They bring gifts ofremembrance and awaken a fear that blinds the dreamer.This fear is very real, the fear of freedom, of leavingbehind the known, the rational, the ways of the world.Once the heart is awakened, then the lover becomeshomeless, for “the heart is ever restless until it finds itsrest in Thee.”What do we do with this fear, this primal insecuritythat often swamps consciousness with doubts?

I embrace the woman friend whoinvited me to the meal and there is a feeling ofgreat love.The path offers much nourishment, of which theseeker is invited to partake; yet in addition to thecooked foods there are also books which she needs toeat. Books suggest conscious knowledge, and thedreamer would rather be nourished by the uncon-scious, “a deliciously grilled fish,” than by these books.She is reticent about eating a book; there is anattraction in keeping the path hidden within oneself,unpolluted by the conflicts of consciousness and thearguments of the mind. This is particularly true forwomen, who have suffered only too much from thenegative effects of masculine consciousness. When themysteries remain hidden even from one’s own mind,they will not suffer from the limitations of consciousunderstanding and the fragmentary effect this canhave.But the dreamer does “start to eat a book,” onewith “a green cover.” Green is a very auspicious color,the color of growth and becoming; and, according to"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"195Symbols of the SelfSufism, it is also the color of Khidr, the figure of directrealization of God.

If we are going to follow the hintsand inner guidance of the Self, of Khidr, in ourconscious life, we need to have some understanding ofwhat this may mean.For many years after I came to the path I put awayall spiritual books, and allowed the heart’s secret loveto change me without my knowledge or interference.But then one night I had a dream in which I was toldto read the works of Jung. When I opened his booksand read his description of the symbolic processes ofindividuation, I saw how some of these processes hadhappened within me, and I was filled with wonder.Many dreams rich in symbolism followed, and I cameto have some understanding of my own transformationand the new consciousness that had been born. Thisunderstanding enabled me to live my outer life morein harmony with my inner nature. I began to glimpsethe ways of the Self, and to take conscious responsibil-ity for living this deepest essence.Both my conscious and my unconscious joyfullyresponded to this new development. However, inmany instances an inner drive towards consciousnessmay also be met with a certain resistance that can comefrom a reluctance to take responsibility for one’s ownspirituality.

She needs to become conscious of herown innermost wisdom, the wisdom of the heart.Finally she embraces the woman friend who invitedher to the meal. Whether this woman is an aspect of thehigher Self, a helpful part of her personality, or anaspect of the shadow is unclear. (It is worth remember-ing that the shadow is not always unhelpful, and attimes pushes us to become more conscious.) But whatis important is that at the end of the dream there is “afeeling of great love,” for the journey towards the Selfis a lover’s return to the arms of the Beloved, in whoseembrace all the aspects of the psyche are contained inoneness and “great love.”THE CITY OF THE SELFThese dreams that contain symbols of the Self areinfinitely precious because they form a bridge betweenordinary consciousness and the greater wholeness ofthe Self that is hidden in the unconscious. Experienc-ing these symbols the dreamer connects with an innerreality that is, at that moment, still unborn, still separatefrom consciousness. From a Jungian perspective, animage of the Self acts as the “transcendent function,”which is Jung’s term for a function that facilitates atransition from one psychological attitude or conditionto another.

Just as a previousdreamer left a party for the beach, so this dreamer,empty-handed, leaves the high street and its worldlyvalues and goes directly to the house of his teacher, forwhat the dreamer is looking for cannot be found in themarketplace.Entering the room which leads to the teacher’sgarden, the dreamer sees the teacher on his left,wearing black. Black is no color; it represents renun-ciation, or spiritual poverty, a total turning away fromthe world, complete dependence upon God. Ulti-mately black symbolizes a state of fanâ, annihilation inGod:It has been said that mystical poverty is thewearing of black raiment in the two universes.This saying expresses the fact that the mystic isso totally absorbed in God that he has no longerany existence of his own, neither inwardly noroutwardly in this world and beyond; he returnsto his original essential poverty, and that ispoverty in the true sense.

The image,Like quivering boughs reflected in a stream,Of that eternal Orchard which abidesUnwithered in the hearts of Perfect Men.13In turning his attention away from the outsideworld towards the inner reality of the heart, thedreamer is shown that the teacher and her room areessentially a “skeletal” space within which anotherdimension can be revealed. This is a profound state-ment about the nature of a Sufi teacher who, “totallyabsorbed in God,” is nothing but a space within whichthe seeker can realize another reality. Essentially theteacher does not exist.What the dreamer experiences within this “skel-etal” space is a city made of light, which the dreamersees in its entirety, “unitary, unfragmented, whole.”This experience is a glimpse of the Self, of his owndivine nature in which everything has its true place,everything is included.

The dreamer insists that these“dimensions are not in the sense of geometric relationsinherent in our everyday experience of physical spaceand perspective,” and St. John’s city is “coming downfrom God out of heaven,” and thus its geometricproportions belong to another reality.This dream of a city made of light points to thetranscendent reality that lies behind the symbols of theSelf. This is a dimension totally different from that ofeveryday waking consciousness; it is a world of light-within-light that cannot be described or explained interms of our normal perception. This is why it is said,“Of those who make the journey no news returns.”There are no words to describe the world of Truth. Yetthe similarity of this dreamer’s city to that experiencedtwo thousand years earlier by St. John suggests that thisinner reality has certain definite qualities of wholenessand luminosity, though they can only be hinted at.For the Sufi, this inner world of light, “the Throne,”lies behind the veil of the sensible world, and isreached through the heart.

When this door is open, then HisLight fills your life, and everything you experiencebecomes permeated with Him.

Itresides on the right side of the physical body.2 Theteacher is in the “heart of hearts” because the relation-ship with the teacher takes place on the level of theSelf. A friend woke up one morning and found that herteacher was inside her heart, so intimate and so near.Yet when she went that afternoon to the group meetingand saw the teacher sitting, talking to people, she wastotally confused. Was this the same person who waswithin her own heart? The teacher sitting among all thepeople seemed in many ways so distant, so unap-proachable. She always found it so difficult to talk tothe teacher, to express herself; and yet within her heartthere was such nearness.The real relationship with the teacher does notexist at the level of ego-consciousness but on the innerplane of the Self. This relationship can be very confus-ing because it belongs to a dimension totally differentfrom that of our everyday waking consciousness. Thelevel of the Self does not belong to duality or the worldof separation, and yet for many years the conscious-ness of the wayfarer remains caught in duality andseparation. We may glimpse the real inner relation-ship, a relationship that belongs to the oneness of theheart, but not have the container to understand it. Wemay try to understand this inner connection in terms ofnormal human relationships, but this will only make usmore confused.The relationship with the teacher has a quality ofintimacy that reflects the inner experience of theoneness of the Self, a oneness in which individuality isnot lost but retains its essence.

This union at thelevel of the Self is closer than sexual union becausethere is no separation, and yet at the same time it is totallybeyond the level of the personality. It is an impersonalrelationship. On the level of ego-consciousness werelate through our personality, and therefore anycloseness and intimacy has a personal dimension. Thecloseness of the inner relationship with the teacher isreflected into our waking consciousness; the wayfarerfeels the “soul intimacy,” and tries to relate this feelingto the normal patterns of ego-consciousness, tries togive it a personal dimension. But because this relation-ship does not belong to the ego there is no recogniz-able pattern into which it will fit, and the wayfarer isoften left in a state of confusion.The real relationship with the teacher is from heartto heart, from soul to soul. And the most fundamentalpart of this relationship is that the teacher is not there.The teacher is just an empty space through which theBeyond, the Infinite Emptiness, can be experienced.There can be no relationship with the teacher on thelevel of the personality, because the teacher is one whohas been made empty, who has been made “featurelessand formless.” Because the teacher is empty, haspassed away and is free from self, the teacher is a spacein which the lover can meet the Beloved.A teacher, or guide, is essential.

The heart of the seekerknows that its deepest longing is being spoken to, thatits most precious desire can be realized. The teachercalls to the seeker not with the voice of the personality,but with the song of an ancient spiritual tradition, withthe song of all those who have gone before. The Sufiteacher is the human representative of a lineage, of aspiritual line of masters, each merged into the other.Each Sufi is a ray of energy that links the wayfarer tothe many great masters who have gone before us; andthese great beings look after us, help us to walk thelonely and desolate path home.As the human representative of a lineage, theteacher often appears as the physical focus of thewayfarer’s attention. The teacher holds the aspirationof the seeker, knows the heart’s deepest longing. Theteacher encourages the wayfarer, increases the long-ing, and confuses the mind. A woman once said to myteacher, “I have this terrible longing, and I come to youbecause I hope it will grow less.” My teacher saidnothing; she smiled to herself, because she knew thateach time the woman came the longing would in-crease. It is the job of the teacher to feed the fire oflonging within the heart and to keep the wayfarer’sattention always on the path.The teacher is the focus of attention because he orshe has been made empty.

In theSufi tradition the teacher is “without a face, without aname.” It is the teaching and not the teacher thatmatters, and yet this is a teaching which is conveyednot through words but through the very essence of theteacher. The essence of the teacher speaks to theessence of the seeker, and it speaks the most intimatethings: the mysteries of the heart, the intoxication ofthe soul.I once had a dream in which I said that the onlyway I could possess my teacher was when she turnedinto a basket of bread and wine. If the teacher is toconvey the essence of the path, there must be noattachment to personality—only an openness to theinner nourishment that is offered. Attachment to thepersonality of the teacher will only limit what can begiven. If something is named, it is limited. This is why,according to the ancient tradition, the disciple neverspeaks the name of the teacher. One friend called Alexhad a dream in which he was led to an Indian man whostood behind a bar.

The dream’s description of the two menwho sit on either side of the empty space directlyalludes to a passage in the Qur’an, although thedreamer belongs to a Hindu family and had no con-scious knowledge of the Qur’an.

Butthere comes the time when the fire has burnt awayenough of the ego that there can be no resistance;nothing can put out its flames. Then the seeker is takenover by the process and there can be no going back.No longer is there any need to blow on the flames, forspiritual life has become an all-consuming passion.The seeker is then fully in the hands of God.

Once the ego has learned tosurrender then He takes over, and “how can there beeffort with Divine things?”12 Through surrendering tothe will of the teacher, who is one with God, the seekerovercomes the greatest obstacle for spiritual life:To be a Sufi is to give up all worries and thereis no worse worry than yourself. When occupiedwith self you are separated from God. The wayto God is but one step: the step out of yourself.13One friend saw this surrender imaged in a dreamhe had soon after he met his teacher:I walk out of the house and meet the teacheron the street.

But just as one whois not frightened of death can help another to die, sodoes the very presence of a teacher who is surrenderedto God make it easier for the wayfarer to surrender. Iwas once clearly told, “It is easier to surrender in thepresence of one who is surrendered.” The being of theteacher radiates the inner security that can come onlyfrom this ultimate sacrifice. In this way the teacherinvisibly supports the wayfarer during this period oftransition.In essence the surrender is not to the outerteacher, who, like any human being, will have faults,but to His light which is within the teacher. This lightwithin the teacher is the same Divine light that existshidden within the seeker. In surrendering to the lightwithin the teacher, the seeker is therefore surrenderingto the light of the Self that is within his own heart.Because at the beginning of the quest the wayfarer’sown light is too veiled to be directly perceived, it ismore easily experienced as a reflection in the clearmirror of the teacher’s heart.Because the purpose of surrendering to the teacheris to surrender to one’s own inner light, it is veryimportant to find a teacher who is free from self (whoseego is surrendered to God), who is “not there” and willtherefore mirror the light of the wayfarer’s Higher Selfwithout getting in the way. The Indian saint, AnandamayiMa, describes how precious it is to find such a guru:Finding a genuine guru is indeed a blessing.One must follow his advice unconditionally.While obeying the guru and treating him withreverence one must not become attached to hispersonality. The true guru will naturally empha-size the fact that he is merely the vehicle of God"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread214and discourage personal veneration. It is thefalse guru—still in ego-consciousness—whopermits the development of a personality cult.14The danger of a false guru is that the seeker surrendershis will to the will of another, rather than to an emptyspace in which the seeker’s will can be embraced byGod. It is in the empty space within the teacher that thetransformation of the seeker’s ego takes place.THE PROCESS OF PROJECTIONAn important part of the relationship with the teacheris often the process of projection. The dominant role ofthe teacher makes him a “hook” for many differenttypes of projection, the most frequent of which is theprojection of the Self. The Self is something so awe-some, so luminous and dynamic, that at the beginningit is very difficult to own it as a part of ourselves. Ratherthan acknowledging that we have this inner wisdomand guidance, it is easier to project it onto the teacher,who is supposed to be full of wisdom and light.Through the projection a previously unknown, unac-knowledged part of ourselves becomes conscious,even if it appears to belong to somebody else. Project-ing the Self onto the teacher, the seeker is able to forma relationship with his divine light, as is often apparentin dreams in which the teacher images the Self. Thus,through the relationship with the teacher, the seekerwill be able to connect and become familiar with theSelf, without being overwhelmed by the true nature ofhis inner being.However, there comes the time when such aprojection is a limitation, when it is time for us to fully"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"215The Relationship with the Teacheracknowledge our own divinity and learn to live inrelationship to the Self without the mediation of theteacher. A year or more after the dream in which theteacher told him he was not in control anymore, thesame man had the following dream:Sitting with a small group of people, theteacher asks, “What do you need from me so thatyou don’t need me anymore?”The teacher is like a ferryman who helps the seeker tocross over from the outer to the inner world. But oncethe seeker has arrived on the shores of his inner being,the ferryman’s work is done. The wayfarer must thenleave the boat behind, and, standing firmly on his ownfeet, journey on, for the road itself is infinite. In thewords of Bahâ ad-dîn Naqshband:We are the means of reaching the goal. It isnecessary that seekers should cut themselvesaway from us and think only of the goal.15On the inward path any outer relationship is a limita-tion. The outer teacher only points to the inner teacher,the aspect of one’s own being that is one with God.In the Zen tradition it is said, “If you meet Buddhaon the road, kill him.” As the wayfarer travels “from thealone to the Alone,” he reaches the stage when thereshould be no reliance on an outer teacher, and anysuch projection must be withdrawn. In our group manypeople have dreams of the teacher dying. This pointsto the death of the projection onto the teacher and theintegration of whatever was projected. One friend,whose teacher had actually physically died a few yearsbefore, had a dream in which he saw his teacher,"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread216Babaji, sitting in a chair, dead. Then he came aliveagain, and the dreamer said to him, “You must be agreat yogi to come back from the dead.” Babaji replied,“I am not a great yogi. I am you.”The teacher can only point us back to ourselves,away from the world of duality into the oneness of theSelf. Yet when the teacher “dies” this does not meanthe end of this relationship but rather its transforma-tion. A relationship in which there was duality mergesinto oneness. The teacher and wayfarer merge togetheras the wayfarer experiences what was always, in fact,the true nature of this relationship. The call and theecho are one. The light within the teacher calls to thelight within the seeker but it is really one light, callingto itself, evoking itself. Within the heart it is “light uponlight.”A CLOSED CIRCLEThe teacher is a mirror in which the seeker can firstglimpse, then slowly become familiar with, and finallyrecognize, his Real Self. The teacher sees this innerpotential from the very beginning, and whatever theouter appearance, relates directly to this essence. Therelationship of the true teacher to the seeker is one oflove from essence to essence. As such it can neverchange but is always complete:Love cannot be more or less for the Teacher. Forhim the very beginning and the end are thesame; it is a closed circle.

As the disciple"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"217The Relationship with the Teacherprogresses, he feels the Master nearer and nearer,as the time goes on. But the Master is not nearer;he was always near, only the disciple did notknow it.16The teacher embraces the whole of the seeker,accepts him in his entirety, without judgment andwithout comparison. The teacher takes the seeker fromwhere he is standing, and through the process ofreflection guides him on the path back to himself.Seeing the full potential of the seeker, the teacherholds that potential regardless of whatever self-doubtsthe seeker may have. Even when the seeker seems tofail or deviate from the path, the teacher still believesin his spiritual capability—his capacity to be filled withGod—and holds that belief as in trust until the seekeris able to realize it for himself. The teacher can neverreject the seeker, just as God can never reject a humanbeing, for we are all part of Him.At times the teacher needs to be hard and cruel,even to appear to reject the seeker, but this is only tohelp the seeker to grow: “The Master must be strict, hehas to be hard, because he wants the disciple to reachthe highest state.”17 In particular, if the seeker is notable to withdraw the projection of the Self when it isnecessary, if the seeker becomes too dependent on theteacher, the teacher may need to throw the seeker backupon himself. In the Sufi system the seeker may bethrown out of the group; according to the tradition thisperson should then be left alone by the other membersof the group in order to realize his own inner strength.If the group as a whole is projecting too much upon theteacher, the teacher traditionally just disappears.

It can be for two weeks, two months, oreven a year. Then, when the time is right and the grouphas learned to be more self-reliant, the teacher willreappear. Through outer insecurity the wayfarer is ableto reach a greater degree of inner security.The teacher must always be free from outerconstraints so that at any instant he can follow the hint,even if this means leaving in the middle of a conferenceor appearing to abandon people at the time of theirgreatest need. But if at these moments the seeker fullysurrenders, he will find that the inner connection withthe teacher has grown stronger. In his outer absencethe teacher is inwardly more present. Through beingoutwardly rejected the seeker realizes the real innerlink which has always been there and belongs toneither time nor space.THE FALSE GURUEven when the teacher figure is not free from the ego,the projection of the seeker’s Higher Self onto theteacher can still take place, but there is the danger thatthis projection can get caught and not be able to bewithdrawn. The projection of the Self onto anotherinvests that individual with a certain power, whichcould gratify the ego. If this happens, the teacher figuremight not want this projection withdrawn and couldsubtly encourage the seeker to remain dependent. Asin psychological analysis, the relationship with theteacher usually involves a “transference.” The teachercarries the projection of the seeker, but unlike inanalysis there should be no “countertransference” (i.e.,there should be no projection by the teacher onto the"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"219The Relationship with the Teacherseeker). The teacher should not be attached to the roleof teacher, nor project the role of disciple onto theseeker. The seeker must be left free.If the teacher figure is in any way attached to therole of teacher, he will not be able to reject anindividual at the moment when it is necessary to breakthis projection. If there is any ego gratification from hisposition he will not be able to abandon the group at theright moment. In the inner dynamic of both, theindividual and the group, moments arise that must begrasped in order for the full potential of a human beingor a group to be realized. The true teacher is one whois both free and fully surrendered, so that when the hintis given, when the moment is right, he acts withouthesitation or self-concern. Often the teacher will haveto follow a hint which he does not understand at thetime and which may even seem to be against his bestinterests or those of the seeker.However, even though there are these dangers ifone has a teacher who is not free from self, it is theattitude of the seeker that is all-important. For one whoaspires and is humble enough to accept what lifebrings and to go beyond any feelings of resentment, afalse guru can be a stepping stone to a true teacher.Indeed, a seeker can even realize God through a falseguru:What if one has unwittingly found a false guru?Even this is only seemingly a misfortune forthere will come a time when one awakens fromone’s error and then one will assuredly knowhow to discover a genuine guru.

We have to find it. Thus it is thata sincere seeker, seeing God behind his guru,however imperfect that guru might be, will beable to go beyond the guru and reach God.18Through the process of projection the seeker seesthe teacher as an image of his own deepest aspirations.If the seeker has sufficient faith in this image and staystrue to his aspirations, he can go beyond the form ofthe teacher to find his own divinity; he can see his owntrue face reflected back. There was once a poor Indianwoman who needed to visit her sick son. But he livedon the other side of the river, which was in flood, andthe ferryman would not take her across. On the rockybanks of the river a holy Brahmin was performing a fireceremony with the ritual incantations. The poor womanapproached him to ask for some divine charm to helpher to cross the river. The Brahmin, not wishing tointerrupt his sacred ceremony and thus have to repeatthe complicated ritual, wanted to get rid of her asquickly as possible. “Just repeat ‘Ram, Ram,’ and youwill cross the river,” he told the old woman andreturned to his incantations. Later, as the evening sunwas setting, the Brahmin was still sitting beside theriver, having finished the sacred ceremony. He wassurprised to see the old woman again approaching himand was even more surprised by the look of joy andreverence on her face. She bowed before him and said,“Oh holy one, so great are your wondrous powers.Repeating ‘Ram, Ram,’ I walked across the river andwas able to stay and comfort my son.

He felt humbled beforeher and the power of her faith.THE CALL OF THE SELFThe teacher is a stepping stone, allowing the wayfarerto cross from the world of the ego into the largerdimension of the Self. Through the relationship withthe teacher the Self is brought closer to our conscious-ness, and the ego is attuned to its faster vibrations. Asthe seeker’s attention is slowly shifted from the ego tothe Self, he learns to live constantly listening to thehints that flow from within.The Self is the core of our being. As much as it is“smaller than small,” hidden within the heart, so is it“larger than large,” embracing and permeating everycell of the body, every aspect of the human being. It iscontinually sending messages to the ego, trying toguide it and point it towards the goal. However, ifsomeone is not interested in spiritual life, sees theworld of the senses as the only reality, his ego will cuthim off from this continual stream of inner guidance.A friend had this explained to him by a voice in adream:People with a strong sense of ego cannotlead a guided life.

So the Self remains an onlooker, boredby the limited perspective of a human being who doesnot acknowledge the limitless world of his inner being,who remains a prisoner in a world of time, caughtbetween the opposites of life and death.The spiritual quest begins when an individualturns his attention away from the outer world ofillusion and listens to the call of the Self:I am calling to you from afar;Calling to you since the very beginning of days.Calling to you across millennia,For aeons of time—Calling—calling.... Since always....It is part of your being, my voice,But it comes to you faintly and you only hear itsometimes;“I don’t know,” you may say.But somewhere you know.“I can’t hear,” you say, “what is it and where?”But somewhere you hear, and deep down youknow.For I am that in you which has been always;I am that in you which will never endEven if you say, “Who is calling?”Even if you think, “Who is that?”Where will you run?

For this reason the egowill never instigate the journey that leads to its owndeath.

I mentioned earlier how a friend had twodreams which described the beginning of this journey.In the first dream the teacher said, “You are not incontrol anymore, I am,” and in the second asked him,“What do you need from me so that you don’t need meanymore?” This dreamer had a third dream whichamplified the other two:The teacher takes my expired driver’s licenseand throws it away.

So often we are the slaves of ourown ego, driven by its desires. Spiritual life meanslearning to be free from the ego and its attachments.For the dreamer this ego identity had “expired” andwas thrown away. He was free for a different “driver”to take over and direct his life. It seems from the dreamthat the teacher’s work is now done; she has helpeddestroy the patterns of the ego and can do nothingmore. The dreamer is also told that he can do nothingfor himself either. Yet this dream does not mean thatthe dreamer has either reached the goal or beenabandoned. Rather, it points beyond ego conscious-ness to the Self, which is not about doing, but is a stateof being.The teacher does nothing, for even the desire tohelp creates a barrier. My teacher calls herself “thecaretaker of her apartment”; she just looks after a spacein which the sincere seeker can come closer to his orher essence. In this space people change; it is “a houseof drunkards and a house of change.” For those whostay, mysterious and wonderful things happen in theirinnermost being and sometimes also in their outer life.People are healed, both physically and psychologi-cally. Obstacles that impede inner growth are re-moved; life becomes richer and more complete. Butthe teacher herself does not do anything; rather “thingsare done.” People do not believe her when she saysthat she is just a caretaker, for they like to project ontoher all kinds of special abilities and powers. The realityof spiritual life is often too simple to be fully appreci-ated.

By tree I mean a real saint. Asaint is like a tree. He does not call anyone,neither does he send anyone away. He givesshelter to whoever cares to come, be it a man,woman, child or an animal. If you sit under atree it will protect you from the weather, fromthe scorching sun as well as from the pouringrain, and it will give you flowers and fruit.Whether a human being enjoys them or a birdtastes of them matters little to the tree; itsproduce is there for anyone who comes andtakes it. And last but not least, it gives itself. Howitself? The fruit contains the seeds for new treesof a similar kind. So, by sitting under a tree youwill get shelter, shade, flowers, fruit, and in duecourse you will come to know your Self.21The teacher just is and so allows the seeker to findthat same innermost core within himself. One friendhad a vision of the teacher as a tree. As more peoplecame, the tree put out more branches. Some peoplewere close to the trunk; others were out sitting on theends of branches, talking among themselves. Still otherpeople were on the ground, looking up at the tree.People want different things; not everyone wants theTruth. On this path there will never be many, becausethe price for the Truth is oneself, and not many areprepared to pay the whole price. Yet, as with the imageof the tree which gives shelter, flowers, and fruit to allthose who come, it is the job of the teacher to givepeople what they want.22 A woman who was trainingas an opera singer once came to our group.

For her, as for the dreamer, an old driver’slicense had expired and been thrown away, and shehad found something far more precious. And how didthis happen? Whenever she had time she just came andsat in the presence of the teacher.THE TEACHER FINDS YOUAccording to the Sufi tradition a teacher is necessary.But how do you find a teacher? As with many aspectsof the quest, the process of finding a teacher is verydifferent from what you might expect. You do not finda teacher; the teacher finds you. Through her aspira-tion and inner work the seeker lights a lamp on theinner plane. When this light is shining brightly enoughit will attract the attention of a teacher with whom theseeker has a link, an inner connection. Then theteacher appears. The seeker may “just happen” to reada book or meet someone who tells her about a teacher;but such occurrences are never chance.Often a dream will guide a seeker to the teacher.One friend who lived in New York had a dream inwhich she was in the green fields of England, in lovewith an old woman. When she awoke from this dreamshe still felt in love, but with whom? She was in NewYork, totally in love with an old lady in a dream. Whatwas she to do?

She traveled to England to meet this old womanand when she sat in front of her she just cried and cried.For years, each time she saw her she just cried.Because the relationship with the teacher does notbelong to the physical world, but to the level of thesoul, it is a mysterious connection that is outside ofspace and time. When the moment is right, when theseeker is ready, this relationship will manifest; theteacher will be there. The teacher might live on theother side of the world or be just around the corner.The seeker might meet the teacher on this physicalplane only a few times, or even never meet the teacherdirectly but make contact through someone who fol-lows the same path. The seeker might spend much timein the physical presence of the teacher. Whatever isneeded will be given, for it is the job of the teacher togive the seeker the best opportunity to reach Reality.For many people the physical presence of the teacheris necessary; until they have progressed far enoughthey need the physical presence of the teacher to makethe path a living reality.

Each in its different waycan help the seeker realize the inner nature of the realrelationship with the teacher. When one friend wasleaving her teacher, almost in tears because she did notknow if she would ever see her again, she was told,“On this path we do not acknowledge physical sepa-ration.”At the beginning it can be necessary to be in thepresence of the Teacher to make the connection“stick,” to tune the vibrations of the seeker to those of"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread228the path. But human beings are so individual that foreach this most important spiritual relationship will bedifferent, and life and circumstances always give thehuman being what she needs at each moment. Ifsomeone is able to be in the physical presence of theteacher only once a year, he will still be given exactlywhat he needs. Maybe he will be given as much ormore in that one meeting as others might get who sitevery day in the teacher’s presence. Being in thepresence of the teacher is like “charging up thebatteries,” a process during which the seeker’s atten-tion is dynamically refocused on the goal. During oureveryday life it is easy for our inner attention to wanderaway from the path, and during the first few years theteacher’s presence can help the seeker to stay focused,and thus be able to realize his highest aspirations. Aftera few years the wayfarer should be so attuned to theinner vibrations of the teacher, which are the same asthe vibrations of the path, that the outer, physicalconnection is no longer necessary.On an outer level the teacher can be a usefulfigure, helping to guide the seeker through the difficul-ties that are encountered in day-to-day life. It is noteasy to live in the world and follow a spiritual path. Tohave someone who is one step further along the pathcan be a great help. Although the teacher rarely offersdirect advice, he may hint at the core of a particularproblem or, through the process of reflection, help theseeker to see what is actually troubling him. Problemsare immensely useful, for they are the rungs of theladder by which we are able to ascend. Yet there areparticular problems encountered on the spiritual paththat can be very confusing, and the teacher may helpthe seeker find the best way to untangle these knots."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"229The Relationship with the TeacherSometimes guidance is given in private conversa-tion, particularly if the problem has to do with personalrelationships. However, as often as possible things arediscussed within the group. Bahâ ad-dîn Naqshbandsaid:Our way is that of group discussion. Insolitude there is renown and in renown there isperil. Welfare is to be found in a group. Thosewho follow this way find great benefit andblessing in group meetings.23If problems are discussed in a group they are shared inthe light of the sun and their burden is lessened. Onecan learn from another’s experiences and difficulties.Sometimes direct guidance is given by the teacher; atother times he will “speak to the door that the wallmight hear.” He will say something to one person thatis meant for another. In this way the wayfarer learns tobe always alert, always ready to catch the hint. Inlearning to catch the hint from the teacher, the way-farer will learn to catch the hint from God, which isquicker than lightning. Also, however it may appear,every situation in the group is a teaching situation.Thus the wayfarer has to learn to be watchful andreceptive, to distinguish between appearance and thereal teaching which is often hidden beneath groupdiscussion or even seemingly mundane conversation.The teacher always wants the best for the way-farer, just as a parent wants the best for a child.

God can only be knownthrough the Master. If you are being merged intothe Teacher, you will know God. Only theTeacher is important for you. Only the Teacher.The Divine Master is complete in every way. Bysimply becoming like him one becomes com-plete in every way.24The Absolute can be compared to a power station,which if it were plugged into the household electricalsupply would blow every fuse. The teacher is thetransformer, transforming millions of volts into the oneor two hundred necessary for individual use. Throughthe teacher the seeker can connect with the energy ofthe Absolute—through merging with the teacher hecan merge into the Absolute.Sitting in the presence of the teacher helps theseeker to tune into the higher vibrations of the Self.However, the real process of spiritual transformationdoes not take place on the physical plane; it takes placeon the level of the Self.

The Self exists within the “heart of hearts”;thus this process of teaching can be understood as a“reflection from heart to heart”: the Higher Self of theteacher is reflected into the Higher Self of the wayfarer.At its deepest level this teaching is about merging,for this is the essence of the mystic’s relationship withthe Absolute. The mystic longs to be so merged withthe Beloved that only the Beloved exists; in the finalstages he is so absorbed in the Beloved that he does noteven know it:“The first time I entered the Holy House,”stated Bâyezîd Bistâmî, “I saw the Holy House.The second time I entered it, I saw the Lord ofthe House.

But consciousness necessitates duality—a separation of subject and object. In states of totaloneness there is neither subject nor object. When thelover is completely annihilated there is no longer anyawareness; there is no longer any mirror in which Hisface can be seen reflected:Neither am I aware of being a lover, nor of love,Neither of my self, nor of the beloved.26Such complete annihilation is the goal of the lover:to be so lost that nothing remains. This is the stamp ofthe real master, who can be either living or dead.Through the relationship with such a teacher theseeker receives that same imprint within the core of hisbeing and slowly he learns to merge into it.

The heart of the seekeris united with the heart of the teacher and in thesemoments separation dissolves. This inner experience,which takes place far beyond the conscious mind, is agift.

It is when the dreamer accepts that she willbe given nothing that she is shown the true relationshipwith the teacher—“I and the teacher are the same.”As the training progresses, the sense of dualitywith the teacher gradually disappears until the Self ofthe wayfarer is united with the Self of the teacher.Although this union takes place on the inner planes, itis slowly integrated into the ordinary life of the Sufi, aprocess that may take many years. Finally it becomesa living conscious reality. Irina Tweedie explains howthis process took place within her:The goal of every yoga is to lead a guidedlife, which is to listen to the voice of the HigherSelf, which at the end of the training is the voiceof the teacher. It is said in the scriptures that thesoul of the disciple is united with the soul of theteacher. When my teacher, Bhai Sahib, told methat, I in my ignorance thought that my soul willdisappear. Now how can that be? It doesn’thappen that way. It is united with the teacher inthe sense that it can receive the instruction orthe orders of the teacher not as a duality, that isthe teacher and me, but as direct knowledgeinborn in the soul.When my teacher died I thought that he hadbetrayed me. He had made me give away all mypossessions, all my money had been given tothe poor, and he had seemingly given menothing, no teaching, nothing, so I thought.Then, one night in the Himalayas I contactedhim in deep meditation.

But gradually, very gradually, without myeven noticing it, a kind of transformation hap-pened. There was no teacher and there was.There was no teacher in the sense that I couldn’tsee him anymore, I couldn’t contact him any-more. But when I needed, only when I needed,I knew.

In essence there is neitherwayfarer and teacher, nor lover and Beloved—onlyone light revealing itself. This revelation happenswithin the heart, which is the meeting place of thewayfarer, the teacher, and the Beloved. Within theheart He calls to Himself: light calls to light; lightevokes light; light merges into light. The more com-pletely the wayfarer merges within the heart, thedeeper he is immersed in this process.

I come to him and look into the bowl, butinstead of seeing either my face, the teacher’shand, or the mala, I just see light.With the beads of the mala moving through hisfingers, the teacher prays. The deepest prayer iswithout words; it is a silent merging into the emptinesswhich is the fullness of God. As the teacher immerseshimself in prayer, the wayfarer too is a part of thatprayer, for the merging of the teacher is reflected intothe heart of the wayfarer. Looking into the bowl, thedreamer sees the true nature of this reflection. There isnot her face, nor the teacher’s hand, nor the mala.There is only light.

On this journey every desire is a limitation:An intending disciple said to Dhû-l-Nûn, theEgyptian: “Above everything in this world I wishto enroll in the Path of Truth.”Dhû-l-Nûn told him: “You can accompanyour caravan only if you first accept two things.One is that you will have to do things which youdo not want to do. The other is that you will notbe permitted to do things which you desire todo. It is ‘wanting’ which stands between manand the Path of Truth.”2Those who travel along this path are known in theEast as “dervishes” (darwish in modern Persian), aterm which refers to their holy poverty; to quoteHujwîrî, “The poor man is not he whose hand is emptyof provisions, but he whose nature is empty of desires.”Poverty is an essential quality for the wayfarer, thepoverty of the heart which embraces every aspect ofhis life and leads to a lover’s state of absolute innerdependence upon his Beloved."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread240Poverty is a state of both helplessness and free-dom, in which the wayfarer, without desire or direc-tion, has nothing and nowhere to go. Such totalpoverty is the real patched coat of the Sufi:A dervish wearing a sackcloth coat andwoolen cap once came to meet Master Abû ‘Alî.One of Abû ‘Alî’s disciples tried to humor him,saying, “How much did you purchase that sack-cloth for?”The dervish answered, “I purchased it for thesum of the world. I was offered the hereafter inexchange, but refused to trade.”Ultimately, if everything must be given up, even thedesire for spiritual progress is a limitation. The roadwhich seemed to lead to a far distant horizon is seenas just another illusion. For the seeker who hasfollowed the path of his longings and placed all hisvalues in the idea of the quest, it can be very hard togive up this spiritual attachment. But not only must thisworld be given up; any idea of spiritual transformationmust also be abandoned.Spiritual poverty is to be totally naked, to be aformless piece of wax in which He can stamp Hisname. Because this state is beyond desire, povertycannot be sought. Like everything that belongs to Him,it is given as a gift. The path takes the wayfarer towhere he can travel no further and is left in a state ofdesolation and hopelessness. Then, when the seekeraccepts there is nowhere else to go—when the pathseems to lead to a total dead end—then there isfreedom, freedom born from the deep realization thatthere is nothing one can do.

It is a journey that sometimes leadsaway from the sunshine of the world into the darknessof our inner being. The following dream describes thisjourney. It images a process that took many years andmuch suffering but led the dreamer beyond the ego tothe ocean of the Self:I was walking along a dirt road which stretchedparallel to a main, paved road.

They too were thick and abun-dant, twisting like huge sinews.I felt a tremendous pull to enter this tree.Where the branches were bending down thereseemed to be an opening. At the same time Iknew that this meant leaving the sunny, openspaces and part of me was reluctant to do this.There was a split second of hesitation. Finally,I let myself go.

I felt themaround my body, really wrapping me over, andthen I had to crawl on the ground because therewas no space to walk, even bent. As I wascrawling the branches were wrapping me evenmore.“Soon I won’t be able to move,” I wasthinking. “I’ll have to stay where I am, frozenand immobile.” This was not an alarming thought,it was just an evaluation of the situation. I alsothought that now I would become a pupa, withall these layers of leaves and branches wrappingme over. Then I felt that I was gliding, as ifsomething was gently pushing me forward. Icompletely let myself go and enjoyed the feelingof surrendering to whatever was doing thegliding for me.Soon enough I was on the other side of theforest and there in front of me was the sea. It wasat sunset or dawn, with pinkish-gold light, as ina Turner painting. Into the mirror-calm sea ariver was flowing from the right, wide and calmyet definitely moving. I just gazed, wondering,“After all it was not that difficult.”In this sequence of symbolic images this dreamtells half a lifetime’s story. It begins with the dreamerwalking on a dirt road beside a main, paved road. TheSufi traveler does not walk along the world’s mainroad; his is a dustier path. “Be in this world as if youare a traveler,” goes a saying ascribed to the Prophet,“a passerby, with your clothes and shoes full of dust.Sometimes you sit under the shade of a tree, sometimesyou walk in the desert. Be always a passerby, for thisis not home.”3"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"243The Poverty of the HeartThe main road is on the dreamer’s right and furtheron are fields and blue skies.

On the left side of this dirt road lies the forest,“dark and shady,” imaging the primordial world of theunconscious. Standing out of the forest, close to theunconscious, is a huge tree. The tree is one of the greatarchetypal symbols. It is the tree of life, the world treewhich stands on the axis of the world, the axis mundi.Drawing water from the very depths of the earth, itgives nourishment and shelter to all life. Yet, at thesame time, the world tree is not other than ourselves.It is our own being which is rooted in the center of thecosmos. Joseph Campbell describes how the axismundi isthe central point, the pole around which allrevolves. The central point of the world is thepoint where stillness and movement are to-gether. Movement is time, but stillness is eter-nity. Realizing how this moment of your life isactually a moment of eternity, and experiencingthe eternal aspect of what you’re doing in thetemporal experience—this is the mythologicalexperience.4The tree of life is one’s inner axis that grows from thedepths of the earth and reaches to the heavens.

The spiritual path always takes us back to thecenter of ourselves—not to the little conscious ego butto the depths and glory of our real being. At first, as onewalks the dusty path of the spiritual traveler, there isusually a sense of conscious direction. Seeking aspiritual goal or ideal, an individual often follows thecodes or ideas of a specific spiritual tradition. Shepractices a certain meditation or other spiritual exer-cises, and may read some of the sacred texts. But therecomes the time when the seeker feels a pull that takesher away from any conscious path, a pull that is the callof her own inner nature, that takes her from the knownworld into the unknown depths of herself.

At the core of the Sufi path are the practiceof surrender and the necessity of having faith andtrusting a system that will totally transform you.

The deeper we travel within ourselves,the more we are shown our own inadequacies, ourown failures. Finally, we are taken to the point wherewe realize that we can no longer make this journey,that we can do nothing, that we can go no further. Wehave given everything to achieve our goal; yet wecannot reach it. This often manifests on the psychologi-cal level as a problem which we are totally unable toresolve. We have tried everything and it is still beyondus. It has demanded everything; it has pushed us to ourown limits and past them. This is often the moment ofdeepest despair.

This surrender is most painful, for it involvesthe death of the ego.Once the ego steps out of the way, something elsecan take over. Our dreamer had been pushed bypainful inner and outer circumstances to the pointwhere her ego could no longer even attempt todetermine her actions.

We cease to resist the energies of theHigher Self and thus are able to experience ourindividual life as a part of the universal sea of ourdeeper existence. This is the final image of the dream,when the dreamer leaves the forest of the unconsciousto glimpse the inner world of the Self.

Once one has given up, the energiesof transformation can flow freely. The darkness ofdespair is only a passing stage that takes one to thepoint of acknowledging one’s own poverty.

In another friend’s dream, asthe dreamer drives uphill, the way becomes more andmore difficult:I am in a white car, driving along a road.

The dreamer must hold the wheel ofher car “with both hands,” suggesting a maximizedattention with both the right and the left side, themasculine and feminine in balance.In the dream it is “raining heavily” which makesthe drive more difficult, even causing a landslide. Rainis often symbolic of grace, falling from above to below.One of the paradoxes of the path is that at thebeginning the spiritual influences are often confusingand appear to make the journey more difficult. Simi-larly, the teacher will seem to put obstacles in the wayof the seeker, will seem to be confusing and contradict-ing. This is because the spiritual reality is so differentfrom that of our ordinary consciousness that in orderfor us to experience this inner reality, the patterns ofworldly conditioning need to be broken. Spiritual truthappears so contradictory to our logical mind that it isoften expressed in paradoxes, which confuse ournormal patterns of thought.

Empty of direction, the Sufican then become an instrument in the hands of theOne—can be His slave, working in the world as Hewills.TURNING BACK TO THE WORLDOn the first stage of the journey the traveler turns herattention from the outer world, returning within to findthe source of her individual life.

This process of turning back to theriver of life is imaged in a subsequent dream of thewoman who dreamt of the journey up the steep andnarrowing road:I was walking up a huge rocky mountainwhich had many waterfalls.

As I stood next to her at the edge of a cliff,I could see a huge cascade on the right, withpure, clear water which was very deep. Thewater was running down the mountain withtremendous force.

Instead the childrenplay in a waterfall; this suggests an innocent and joyfulrelationship between the dreamer and the pure es-sence of life that falls from above. Christ’s words,“Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to comeunto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven,” reflectthe innocence of our essential nature.9 This is thesimplicity and beauty of life that is lived close to thesource and which sadly we have almost lost in oursophisticated world.

Thisinner child is a dynamic state of being. It is the flow oflife itself in which the inner qualities of beauty aremade visible.

True innerpoverty is total non-attachment; everything must beleft behind. Then the dreamer sees the teacher sittingon a rock, which is a symbol of the bare essence whichis the Self. The Self has many aspects: innocence,purity, beauty, and bliss. The Self also has a quality ofbarrenness, as empty as a desert, as bare as a rock. Theteacher’s back is towards the dreamer and she iswearing black. Black is no color; it represents “mysticalpoverty,” a state of total annihilation in God.The teacher, dressed in black, images the ultimatestage of spiritual poverty—fâna, complete annihila-tion in God, a state of total nothingness.12 Although thisstate of annihilation exists as a potential within thedreamer, it is not yet known to her; she can only seethe teacher’s back. However, facing the teacher is a“woman about my age who was in a meditative state,with her eyes closed.” This figure is reminiscent ofJung’s dream of a yogi sitting in deep meditation. Thisyogi had Jung’s face; and Jung awoke from the dreamwith the thought, “Aha, so he is the one who ismeditating me. He has a dream, and I am it.”13The meditating yogi images Jung’s Higher Self,what the Sufis refer to as the “witness in heaven”"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"253The Poverty of the Heart(shâhid fi’l- samâ). It is through the witness that Godcontemplates the beauty of His creation. Just as thedreamer contemplates the beauty of her inner child, sodoes the Beloved contemplate the beauty of His child,the lover, through the eyes of the lover’s Higher Self,the witness. Furthermore, just as our shadow, our innerdarkness, separates us from the beauty of our ownessential nature, so does this same darkness fall likeveils between the Beloved and the lover. In climbingthe uphill path the seeker is working on the shadow,removing the veils of darkness. When the veils areremoved the Beloved sees the face of His lover;through the eyes of the witness He realizes His ownbeauty.The relationship between the lover and the Be-loved has a two-way dynamic in which the witness isan intermediary. The beauty of the Beloved is such thatthe lover would be blinded by even a glimpse; yet thelover can come to know the witness, the “Inner Man ofLight.” The Sufi saying, “He who knows himself, knowshis Lord,” refers to the fact that through self-knowledgethe seeker comes to know his Higher Self, “his Lord.”The Higher Self is the part of our being which has neverbecome separate from the Source. It is one with God;this is what Christ meant when, speaking from the levelof the Self, he said; “I and my Father are one.”14By forging the link with the Higher Self, not onlydoes the lover come to know her own divinity but shealso allows the Beloved to know His creation. In thisway the lover fulfills the deepest purpose of creation:He who is alone and perfect created the universe inorder that He might know Himself.

This image points towards the essence ofthe teacher-wayfarer relationship, which takes placeon the level of the Higher Self. At this level the teachermakes the wayfarer like herself: the spiritual poverty ofthe teacher is impressed into the heart of the wayfarer.But in order for this inner process to be realized, thewayfarer must work in the world as God’s slave. Thisrelationship between the inner teaching and the outerwork is an essential aspect of the Sufi path, for it is thecombination of the inner secrets and the ordinaryeveryday world that makes the path a dynamic livingreality within the wayfarer. The most sublime and themost ordinary are fused together in the selfless serviceof the Sufi; the “highest” and “lowest” are broughttogether and nothing is excluded. The full potential ofthe human being is in our belonging to both the worldof spirit and the world of matter.

Spiritual povertyis therefore a state of inner emptiness and outerservice, as is movingly expressed by Mother Teresa:I don’t claim anything of the work. I am alittle pencil in His Hand. That is all.

Simply through keeping this connectionbetween the inner essence and the outer world, theSufi allows the higher energies of the Beyond to healand transform life.The period of introversion, of turning inward tofind what was hidden and to reconnect with the Self,is followed by turning back to the world. In theNaqshbandi Sufi tradition, the wayfarer is sent, orthrown, back into the world when he or she is ready.Only the teacher knows this moment:I send my people away, as soon as theTraining is finished. Now go and work, I say,and they go. My people are tested with Fire andSpirit, and then sent out into the world, andnever, never do they go wrong.20Sometimes a new “work opportunity” will unexpect-edly present itself to the wayfarer. Sometimes thisreturn to the world is simply a change of inner focus,away from introspection into a fuller involvement withouter affairs. There is often a feeling that this changeis not spiritual, for it appears to involve a loss ofattention to inner aspirations. One friend was verydisturbed by the fact that his suddenly increased workload involved such a degree of mental attention (he"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Catching the Thread258was working with computers and other machines) thathe could no longer keep his conscious attention on hissilent dhikr. But on this path we are not even attachedto our spiritual practices. Every attachment is a barrier;even spiritual ideals can become a limitation. Thisfriend’s dreams, together with the hints of the teacher,encouraged him to continue with this work, for throughthis process he would realize how his spiritual commit-ment had become part of his whole being. It is said,“First you do the dhikr, then the dhikr does you.” Thisfriend’s inner focus and aspiration had taken him to thestate where the connection with his Higher Self wassecure and dynamic enough to work on its own. TheHigher Self could now manifest in his ordinary, every-day life. But in order to realize this he had to give uphis conscious spiritual attitudes; only then would herealize how his whole inner being was walking thepath home.We easily form attachments and on the path anyattachment is a limitation. Even the concept of spirituallife with its focus on inner aspiration can itself becomea form of security that must be surrendered. To freeourselves may require a shock, or a push back into themarketplace of the world. Our dreamer did not knowwhether she was pushed by the teacher or fell into thewaterfall. She only saw herself “disappearing into thedepths of the cascading water,” for it is in the depthsof life that the annihilation of the wayfarer takes place:in service we forget ourselves. This service carries thestamp of poverty: we want nothing, and even to wantto help another creates a limitation and a barrier.From this state of self-forgetfulness, mystical pov-erty becomes a living reality. The opposites of theinner and outer worlds fuse together and are containedwithin the heart.

St. Catherine of Genoa,who combined a life of service (organizing and admin-istering her hospitals) with that of a contemplativelover, described such a state of total poverty:Since Love took charge of everything, I have nottaken care of anything, and I have never beenable to work with my intellect, memory and will,any more than if I never had them. Indeed everyday I feel myself more occupied in Him, andwith greater fire.... If I spoke of the spiritualthings that often beset me, at once my Lovewould reprove me, saying that I ought not tospeak but let myself wholly burn, without at-tempting any word or act to bring relief to soulor body. If I was silent and took no heed ofanything, but simply said: “If the body is dying,let it die. If it can’t carry on, let it be. Nothingmatters to me,” then Love would still reprove mesaying: “I want you to shut your eyes tight sothat you see nothing of the work that I am doingin you as if it were in you. I want you to be dead,and every sight however perfect annihilated inyou. I do not want you to do anything whichmay be of yourself.”When I had locked my mouth and stood likean inert thing from Love’s tightening graspwithin me, I felt such interior peace and content-ment that I was unsupportable to myself.21The mystical path takes the traveler to a state ofabandonment that is so total it cannot even be under-stood.

In the words of a Sufi master, “There is nothingbut Nothingness.”23 By our own efforts we cannotreach this Ultimate Nothingness, but through povertywe can be taken there—through poverty we canbecome Nothing.There was a king, who, one day, entering hisroyal court, observed one person, who amongall those present was not bowing down beforehim. Unnerved by the impudent act of thisstranger in the hall, the king called out: “Howdare you not bow down before me! Only Goddoes not bow down before me, and there isnothing greater than God.
