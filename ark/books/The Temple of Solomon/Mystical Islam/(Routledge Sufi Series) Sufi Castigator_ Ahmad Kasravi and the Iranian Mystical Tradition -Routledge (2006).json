Whether in his celestial study in Newcastleor else on the telephone, we spent many hours discussing Kasravi’s thought. Ouropinions on Kasravi differ somewhat; I am more unforgiving of Kasravi’spolemical works on Sufism and Persian literature, yet this difference in our viewsfostered greater interest. I hope that we can continue to collaborate in this way onmy next project, whatever it may be.I was thrilled to discover Dr Matthijs van den Bos’s superb book,Mystic Regimes,halfway through my research, and subsequently we met in Glasgow andAmsterdam and shared our academic interests. He kindly supplied me withvarious photocopies and books, and he also read and made valuable commentson Chapters 2 and 3.Initially the project was small in scope, as I had intended to focus only onKasravi’s Sufigari. Reading the text ofSufigariwas problematic enough, and I owea huge debt to Dr Ali Shiri, for we spent many hours together, studying Kasravi’stext, trying to fathom the badly edited text and rendering it into coherent English.Gratitude is also due to a number of scholars who contributed in a variety ofways. These include Dr John Gurney, Prof. C.E. Bosworth, Dr H. Katouzian andProf. Majd al-Din Keyvani.It has taken about four years for this project to bear fruition, and in the courseof this period many other researchers and friends have helped me in a number ofways.

Over the years I havebeen very fortunate to receive a number of travel grants from the British Instituteof Persian Studies (BIPS). The latest grant enabled me to spend some time inTehran in the summer of 2002, where I was able to meet with several eminentscholars to discuss my research on Kasravi. This financial assistance from BIPS isindispensable, as field work in Iran not only assists in current research, but it alsopermits researchers to network and establish contacts that I have found can bevery fruitful in future projects. It is hoped that BIPS continues its support.Chapter 5 of the present book was first published in Iran(2004), the journal ofBIPS, under the title “Ahmad Kasravi’s Criticisms of E.G.

Yet for thelatter group, the concern about the effects of Sufism was focused on a new socialunit, the nation-state, which had been emerging during the nineteenth century inthe Middle East but was actively promoted to a greater degree in the aftermathof the First World War. Modernisation for intellectuals in the Middle East was notmerely a matter of establishing the political and economic institutions of a strongnational, centralised state, for modernisation required a certain mentality that inessence focused on “rational” behaviour and religion. A rational form of religionwas desirable because it contrasted with emotional and uncontrollable mysticalforms of worship and “experience”, which some witnessed in a form of Sufism,that attempts to transcend reason to reach the Truth through rituals such asecstatic dancing and bodily deprivations. Sufi belief and ritual epitomised whatwas worse in the Islamic tradition for modern Islamic reformists of the Salafi tra-dition, which attempted to strip Islam of all the innovations and corrupt beliefsthat had perverted “pure” Islam. Typical of such reformers was the SyrianRashid Rida (1865–1935) whose acerbic rejection of Sufism reached boilingpoint when he witnessed the ecstatic dancing of the “whirling dervishes” inTripoli.4Another reason for anti-Sufi sentiment was the hegemonic power itenjoyed among its adherents and its sympathisers, which was enshrined withinArabic, Turkish and Persian literature to the extent that the works of Persian Sufipoets enjoyed prestige that for many were second only to the Qur’an.Aside from explicitly “Islamic” reasons for anti-Sufism, there were politicalreasons that help to explain why the mystical tradition was sometimes perceivedas a threat. The socio-political power of Sufi leaders over their followers was a1"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"potential danger to the existence of the nation-state, and therefore, for example,the leader of the secular Turkish republic, Kemal Ataturk, banned the Sufi broth-erhoods in 1925 (following a major rebellion by a Kurdish Naqshebandi Sufi,Sheikh Sa‘id), and other anti-Sufis such as Ahmad Kasravi engaged in an annualbook-burning ritual when mystical literature was flung into the flames.Anti-Sufi activity that was undertaken for the benefit of the nation-statebelittled the relationship between modernity and freedom. Indeed, the linkage ofanti-Sufism with nationalism in itself hints at coercion and the attempt to imposea new hegemonic order on society. Katouzian has claimed that nationalism“conceives of ‘the nation’ as an organic body, and underrates the importance ofethnic, linguistic and social divisions within it. It is aggressive and offensivetowards other peoples and races”.5Of significance too is that it can underratereligious diversity within the imagined nation. Nevertheless the persistence of reli-gious belief, in particular, attachment to mysticism (whether Sufi, Christian,Jewish or other forms of mystical claims) despite its “irrationality”, indicates thatthe appeal of the mystical tradition was too great for the reforms of Ataturk orthe polemics of Kasravi to overcome. Although there is little doubt that tradi-tional forms of Sufi activity have declined dramatically over the past one hundredyears in many parts of the Islamic world,6scores of leading Iranian intellectuals,politicians and religious figures have either been inspired by the mystical tradition(as shown in the writings of Khomeini,7Shari‘ati8and Sorush9) or have noted itsresilient staying power (Motahhari10). The reasons for the durability of Sufism arecomplex but its survival in one form or another may be attributable to the per-ception that Sufism serves as a form of dissent against authoritarian power struc-tures (such as Ataturk’s secular state) and that it provides individuals with whatthey consider to be an intimate relationship with God. The panaceas offered toMuslims in the twentieth century that have ranged from various attempts at formsof Westernisation and socialism to a “puritanical” form of Islam (whetherWahhabi, Salafi or Shi‘ite) ironically may have contributed to the preservation offorms of Sufism in the Middle East.In recent years there has been an expansion of academic literature on anti-Sufism,11and perhaps the most useful of general surveys is Elizabeth Sirriyeh’sSufis and Anti-Sufis.12Despite this interest in modern anti-Sufism, it remains truethat “a high proportion of the research [on modern Sufism] has been undertakenby sociologists and anthropologists and sometimes also by political scientists but[there is] certainly far less by those for whom the classical Sufi tradition is ofmajor concern”.13It was a result of such observations that persuaded me toengage in a research project that combined my own interests in both mediaevalSufism and modern Iran, and it was Ahmad Kasravi’s anti-Sufi writings that pro-vided me with such an opportunity. The decision to pursue this project was attrib-utable in part to his reputation as one of the foremost (and controversial)intellectuals of twentieth century Iran. Indeed, he has been termed “outstand-ing”14, and even his opponents, such as Ruhollah Khomeini, have stated that hewas a “a historian well-versed in history and a good writer”.15THE BACKGROUND2"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"I first became acquainted with Kasravi’s writings as an undergraduate studentat Durham University, where I read passages of his History of the ConstitutionalRevolutionwith Dr Paul Luft. Having graduated, I continued my studies in Japan,where I was introduced to Dr Iraj Parsinejad who asked me to translate an arti-cle that he had written about Kasravi as a literary critic (and which contains abrief section on Kasravi’s anti-Sufi views). When Sirriyeh published her book, Iwas conscious that an investigation into Kasravi’s anti-Sufis views would be ofbenefit to those interested in modern Sufism, contemporary intellectual activity inIran and the Middle East and Islam in general. Very ambitious in scope, Sirriyeh’sSufis and anti-Sufiscovers a wide historical span (about two hundred years) andfocuses on the Arab, Turkish, Indian and Iranian thinkers (the only Iranian to bestudied in any depth, however, is ‘Ali Shari‘ati). The work presented here buildsupon Sirriyeh’s pioneering efforts and offers a more specific and detailed analysisof Ahmad Kasravi.Whether or not one agrees with Kasravi’s views on Sufism, his position as oneof the major forces on the intellectual scene in Iran in the first half of thetwentieth century cannot be denied. His writings on diverse topics ranging fromlanguage,16gender,17history18and religion19were all concerned with the well-being of Iran, and an analysis of these works assists modern scholars to appreci-ate the strength of Iranian national sentiment during a period when chauvinisticIranian nationalism emerged as a significant factor in socio-political affairs.Kasravi’s nationalism and his attacks on irrationality certainly had an effect on asubsequent generation of leading Iranian thinkers, including Jalal Al-e Ahmad20and ‘Ali Shari‘ati.21Moreover, his criticisms of Shi‘ism galvanised the clericalforces to respond in writing, and indeed, Ruhollah Khomeini’sUnveiling of Secretswas written to refute such works.22Ironically then, Kasravi contributed to there-assertion of clerical participation in society which had its ultimate conclusionin the 1978 revolution which elevated Khomeini to the position of Iran’s spiritualand political leader.Given the significance of Kasravi in the modern Iranian intellectual tradition,it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to him by academics. InEnglish there have been several articles published on various aspects of Kasravi’sthought that are worthy of mention. These include two articles written by the lateMohammad Ali Jazayery who was an active member of the Azadegan, the partyestablished by Kasravi in 1941. Jazayery’s two articles that were published in theInternational Journal of Middle Eastern Studiesconcentrated on the issue of Persianpoetry,23and he also wrote a long article entitled “Kasravi, Iconoclastic Thinkerof Twentieth Century Iran”24which serves as a summary of Kasravi’s views.Ervand Abrahamian’s “Kasravi: The Integrative Nationalist of Iran” provides abrief survey of Kasravi’s life, his “ideology of solidarism” and his form of nation-alism.25The subtext of nationalism once again appears in an article by AminBanani, “Ahmad Kasravi and the ‘Purification’ of Persian”.26There is also someunpublished material in English that is devoted to Kasravi’s thought, and thisincludes William Staley Jr‘sThe Intellectual Development of Ahmad Kasravi,27andTHE BACKGROUND3"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Minoo Ramyar’sSayyid Ahmad Kasravi: Historian, Language Reformer and Thinker.28The most extensive treatment of Kasravi’s life appears in a chapter within IrajParsinejad’sA History of Literary Criticism in Iran,29in which the main focus is onKasravi’s views on literary criticism in general, novels and reform of the Persianlanguage.Translations of Kasravi’s writings in English are even fewer in number thanscholarly analysis of his works. The only texts that have been published are DarPiramun-e Islam(“On Islam”) and Shi‘ehgari(“Shi‘ism”), which were translated byM.R. Ghanoonparvar.30Providing a full list of Kasravi’s numerous writingswould be inappropriate in this book, however, a selected bibliography of sixty-sixworks is provided in On Islam and Shi‘ism. Kasravi continues to be of interest toIranian scholars, and two works that appeared just before the Islamic revolutionare worthy of mention, namely H. Asil’sA Survey of Kasravi’s Political Thought,31and‘A. Dastghayb’sA Critique of Kasrvi’s Works.32More recently, Iranian scholars havepaid attention to Kasravi with the publication of a series of articles on various ele-ments of Kasravi’s thought in the 2002 publication ofIran-nameh33and in the col-lection of articles that originally appeared in the first year of publication from hisnewspaper,Payman.34The assassination of Kasravi has also been covered in Qatl-e Kasravi(“The Murder of Kasravi”) by Naser Pakdaman.35This book is composed of four analytical chapters and two chapters that aretranslations of Kasravi’s own works. Chapter 2 describes the variety of opinionsof Sufism in Iran in the generation prior to and during Kasravi’s life. A wide crosssection of views including those of clerics, intellectual reformers (some influencedto a great extent by the West, others more comfortable with their traditionalIslamic and mystical heritage and yet others who rejected Islam or at least desiredmajor re-interpretation) and Sufis themselves are presented to reveal whetherKasravi’s criticisms were unique or not. Following this, Chapter 3 analysesKasravi’s criticisms of Sufism, in particular those that are found within a sectionof his book Sufigari. This critique is then compared to the views of Kasravi’s con-temporary Islamic reformers (although from different geographical locations) todemonstrate that contrary to Kasravi’s opinion, Sufism (regardless of its rationalityof otherwise) could have been utilised as a force for social integration. Chapter 4is an annotated translation of the whole text of Kasravi’sSufigari(“Sufism”). Oneof Kasravi’s major complaints regarding Sufism is that it had been promoted byEuropean orientalists in their attempts to undermine Iran and preserve Westernhegemony in the region. Kasravi was particularly critical of Edward G. Browne,and Chapter 5 weighs Kasravi’s rejection of Browne’s scholarship by first assess-ing Kasravi’s criticism and second by investigating the motives behind Browne’sstudy of Iranian literature and religion. Chapter 6 investigates Kasravi’s dislike forcertain forms of Persian literature, in particular, Hafez, the celebrated “mystical”fourteenth century poet, and Chapter 7 provides a translation of Kasravi’s book,Hafez cheh mi-guyad?(“What Hafez Says?”).The difficulty of translating Kasravi’s works has been noted elsewhere, and inthe translations of Kasravi works presented here I have tried to remain as literalTHE BACKGROUND4"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"as possible, and only on a few occasions have I yielded to the temptation to ren-der a much more “reader-friendly” approach. The translation ofSufigariis basedupon the third edition (which includes Kasravi’s introduction). I have not beenable to see earlier editions.Kasravi’s lifeAhmad Kasravi was born in 1890 in the Azari speaking city of Tabriz in north-east Iran, where his father, Mir Qasim, was a carpet trader. Mir Qasim was a reli-gious man yet he disapproved of manifestations of popular Shi‘ism includingrawzeh-khani(commemoration of the massacre of the third Shi‘ite Imam, Hosayn,and members of his family at Kerbala) and ta‘ziyeh(passion plays depicting theevents of Kerbala). His religiosity, however, led him to send his eldest son MirAhmad to study in a Najaf seminary, and when he died, Ahmad, the second son,was responsible for fulfilling the father’s desire of having a scholar of religion inthe family.Ahmad Kasravi’s studies were cut short by his father’s death, yet by his family’sinsistence (and despite his own reluctance and distaste for traditional religiouseducation – “by pressure and force they made me become a molla”36) he resumedhis studies at the new seminary that had opened in Tabriz. After four years, at theage of twenty he graduated and he was persuaded to become the local preacher.However, his distaste for his occupation became evident:I didn’t behave like the mollas. Just as I said, I refused to wear the big,tall, loose turban, I didn’t wear yellow or green shoes, I didn’t put onwhite trousers, and I didn’t let my beard grow. I wore shoes with heelsand machine-woven socks, and I fastened a belt around my waist...andsince my eyes-sight had become weak, at the doctor’s orders I wore spec-tacles. This was another reason that I was considered “Westernised”. Allof this did not accord with “justice” which was a condition for being apreacher and a molla.37In 1911 the Russians occupied Tabriz, and the anti-constitutionalist formermonarch, Mohammad ‘Ali Shah, attempted to re-instate himself on the throne.Kasravi gave sermons in Tabriz in which he encouraged people to take up armsagainst the Russians and supported the aims of the Constitutionalists, while otherclerics in Tabriz were suspicious of Constitutionalism because of its supposedconnection with secularism. Some clerics collaborated with the Russian forces inorder to take revenge on their religious opponents, and Kasravi described how heforced himself to watch the executions of these supporters of Constitutionalismso that he would never forget the savagery of the bigoted clerics.In the same year, Kasravi became aware of the need to learn Europeanlanguages to further his knowledge. He mentioned that in the seminary in Tabrizthere were classes in the astronomy of Ptolemy to which he would occasionallyTHE BACKGROUND5"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"listen, and he would also read the writings on astronomy by the sixteenth centuryscholar, Sheikh Baha’i. Interest in astrology was increasing in this period becauseof the appearance of Haley’s Comet, which in some way was linked by some to thepossible re-appearance of Mohammad ‘Ali Shah in Iran. Kasravi sought furtherinformation on astronomy in Arabic journals and also in European literature. Hisentry into European literature came through Camille Flammarion’s “Astronomy”,which had been translated into Russian and then into Persian by Talebof.38Kasravi’s command of Arabic was first class and he had published severalarticles in Egyptian and Syrian Arabic journals, but he realised the importance ofunderstanding French and English. To this end he began to learn English fromthe teachers of the American Memorial School in Tabriz where he was employedas a teacher of Arabic. However, he resigned from this school because of thesectarianism between Muslim and Christian students.At this time, the Russian revolution of 1917 inspired many movements in Iranwith socialist leanings, and one of these was the Azarbayjan Democrat Party. Kasraviwas involved in mediating between the various factions within this party,indicating his standing within the region. He also organised the Democrat Party’slocal food relief committee during the severe famine of 1918. However, Kasravidistanced himself from the Democrat Party when it adopted a more separatistposition and declared the independence of the Republic of Azadestan. Kasravifelt that his life was threatened because of his political and religious views, andsince most of those who sympathised with his opinions were in prison, he decidedto flee to Tehran.Once in the capital in 1919 he met with ‘Ali Asghar Hekmat (who was thenthe head of personnel at the Ministry of Education). It is worth noting Kasravi’saccount of this encounter, as it reveals an interesting dimension of his personality:In Tehran I tried at first to find a job for myself, and I knew it was best toask for work at the Ministry of Culture [Education]. One day I wentthere. Mr. ‘Ali Asghar Hekmat was the chief of recruitment, and he askedabout my intentions. When he saw me with a [a molla’s] turban and cloakhe couldn’tbelieve that I knew English. He said, “Are you prepared forsomeone to test you?” I replied, “First, I will give that person a test, andthen I’ll sit [his] test.” He said, “How [shall we do this]?” I replied, “Inan English dictionary there are 450,000 words, and an English speakerknows no more than 10,000 of them, for he doesn’t need to know anymore than this. Now it is likely that the person who wants to test me willchoose the words from the dictionary, and he will want to show that hehas stumped me. Therefore it would be better if I go first, and show thatI have stumped him.” He said, “Well, this will be the test, and it is clearthat you know English.” Then we talked to each other a little in English.39Kasravi was offered a position as an Arabic teacher. It was most probablyaround this time that he became acquainted with several of the new generationTHE BACKGROUND6"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"of men of letters, including Sa‘id Nafisi, whose recollection of Kasravi is worthmentioning:At that time Kasravi wore a black turban, an outer cloak and a longtunic, and he threw a black sleeveless cloak over that. His small blackturban was the best evidence that he had been a religious student inTabriz. He had a thin face, high cheekbones, a troubled and irritatedcountenance...He spoke Persian with a distinct Azarbayjani accent, buthe talked very deliberately. The first conversation that I had with himproved to me that he was a very fearless man, and he even voiced his ownparticular beliefs without any special concern. He had no fear of sayingsomething that was contrary to tradition or contrary to the beliefs ofothers. The famous expression that “his head smelt of lamb and spinachstew (qurmeh-sabzi)” is quite appropriate.40The expression “his head smelt ofqurmeh-sabzi” is a colloquial idiom, used fre-quently with a political implication. The person who is described in this way ischaracterised as rash and invites trouble.41Kasravi soon returned to his family inTabriz,42and in 1921 he entered the Ministry of Justice, where he worked for thenext ten years in various locations within Iran. This gave him the opportunity tobecome acquainted with the languages and histories of these regions, providinghim with the background for his academic works. Kasravi was uncompromisingin establishing justice and rooting out corruption in his work within the Ministry,and unsurprisingly he made several powerful enemies, which resulted in his recallfrom various places and his relocation in remote areas. Yet during this period,Kasravi continued his academic writing, the value of which was recognisedby Denison Ross who summarised some of Kasravi’s work.43It was probablyat about this time that Kasravi was made a member of the RoyalAsiatic Society (although it seems he was unaware of this).44It was as a resultof the good opinion that European orientalists had of Kasravi that Taymurtash,the Minister of Court, on his return from a European trip, offered Kasravi ascholarship to devote his attention to academic work. Kasravi declined the offer,claiming that all of his writings had been produced while employed at theMinistry of Justice, so there was no need to resign his position. Kasravi was prob-ably worried about the implications of receiving a stipend from the state, whichcould easily be withdrawn if he wrote anything that was perceived to be againstits interests.Kasravi’s commitment to pursuing justice even resulted in his judgementagainst Reza Shah, when he defended some farmers against the claims of the firstPahlavi monarch. However, as a result of the pressure against him, Kasraviresigned from the Ministry of Justice, and he decided to pursue the career of alawyer, while at the same time teaching Iranian history. As a lawyer he wasinvolved in a number of high profile cases, including his defence in 1938 of theso-called 53, a group of Marxists led by Taqi Arani (see Chapter 2).THE BACKGROUND7"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"During the 1930s Kasravi’s activities in the fields of journalism and researchintensified. He set out his world-view in 1932–3 in a work called A‘yin(Creed)which also served as a refutation of left-wing ideas that were becoming increas-ingly popular in Iran. In 1933–4 he published The Five-Hundred Year History ofKhuzestan45and between 1934 and 1941 he published The Eighteen Year History ofAzarbayjan,46the aim of both works being to denigrate separatism within Iran.Moreover he launched a monthly journal in December 1933 entitled Payman,ofwhich he was editor and “almost sole writer”.47Recognised as one of Iran’s lead-ing academic figures, Kasravi was a target for the Ministry of Education whowere seeking staff for the newly established University of Tehran. However,Kasravi’s views on the detrimental effects of classical Persian poetry (includingHafez, Khayyam and Sa‘di) on Iranian society, which he had made public in hiswritings and speeches, resulted in the Minister of Education denying Kasravi alectureship (see Chapter 6). Kasravi was not prepared to compromise and heremained an iconoclastic figure among literary circles, breaking with many of themost respected academics of the era.In 1941 Reza Shah was forced to abdicate, as Britain and the Soviet Uniondesired an Iran that was secure from the threat of the influence of Nazi Germany.Reza Shah’s young son Mohammad Reza became the new Shah, and thereensued a period of relative political freedom which permitted greater publicexpression through books, periodicals and newspapers. From 1941 until his deathin 1946 Kasravi published a remarkable number of pamphlets and articles. Manyof these were composed of articles that had already been published in Payman,and this accounts for much of the repetition that one finds in Kasravi’s writings.The political freedom allowed Kasravi to establish an organisation called theAzadeganthat served to promote his ideology throughout the country, withbranches in all major cities. Kasravi believed that reform of Iran could only beachieved through educating the masses, and the main elements of reform (thepromotion of democracy, economic welfare and education and the improvementof social and personal life) were contained within sixteen points that he outlinedin a speech in 1941. These points were further disseminated within the officialnewspaper of the Azadegan,Parcham, edited by Kasravi, and variations ofParchamwere printed between 1942 and 1945. The perceived radicalism of the ideasespoused by the Azadeganand their ritualistic burning of books that they dislikedresulted in members being beaten up, imprisoned, dismissed from governmentaljobs and denied promotion.48(Kasravi notes that the first day of the Persianmonth ofDeywas set aside for the book-burning festival.49Moreover, he notesthat this festival was observed in Tehran, Ahvaz, Tabriz, Maragheh, Urumieh andKashmar.)50The strength of the Azadegan, however, has been questioned, asAbrahamian states that at its height the party could only attract no more than afew thousand supporters.51By 1945, Kasravi believed that having awakened Iranians to the problemsfacing the country, the Azadeganwere ready to take control of Iran, however, amonth later an attempt was made on his life. The individuals responsible for theTHE BACKGROUND8"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"assassination attempt were members of a group called the Feda’iyan-e Islam(Devotees of Islam), a radical group of Shi‘ites who were outraged by Kasravi’s1944 critique of traditional Shi‘ism. Yet the public disquiet caused by the Azadeganresulted in greater opposition from the clerics, who forged an alliance withelements within the government, including the speaker of the parliament whopublicly accused Kasravi of advocating anti-Islamic views, and furthermore,Premier Sadr brought charges of propagating “heretical ideas” against him.52On11 March 1946 Kasravi was shot dead by members of the Feda’iyan-e Islamduringthe last session of the preliminary hearings of the heresy charges brought against him.That Kasravi was a man full of contradictions there can be little doubt; hiswritings range from the polemical and over-exaggerated rantings of an individualblinded by his own ideology to careful and sophisticated historical observations.Yet the polemical writings, such as those on Sufism, Shi‘ism, Persian poetry andliterature, are significant because of the reaction that they caused. Kasravi’s workson these topics touched a raw nerve among Sufi sympathisers (or those whoappreciated traditional Persian literature) and Shi‘ites not because they were rea-soned works (indeed, they were not) but because of the general secularising trendof the times and the need to defend these major elements of Iranian identity.Moreover, Kasravi’s polemical works and his activities were taken seriouslybecause of his reputation and position in Iranian society. He was respected as ascholar by European academics and even his critics admired his work on theConstitutional Revolution.Kasravi should be lauded for his bravery in questioning sacrosanct opinionsregarding religion and literature. His patriotism cannot be questioned, and eventhough his views on how to promote Iran were questioned by many within Iran,his steadfast rejection of superstitious beliefs (including elements of Sufism andShi‘ism) and his opposition to the wholesale absorption of Western cultureinto Iran struck a chord with many Iranians. It is worth noting how he wasremembered in Sokhan, one of the leading journals of Kasravi’s era:One of the most tragic events that has occurred in recent times is the assas-sination of Ahmad Kasravi in the Palace of Justice...He was one of theintellectuals of this country, and his equal, unfortunately, are few in num-ber.

Such a wide temporal horizon will be investigatedbecause the intellectual currents and prejudices of one generation always have abearing on the subsequent one. The whole period was one of remarkable, if notunprecedented, change in Iran, as from 1850 onwards the forces of modernisa-tion and the threats of European imperialism from both Britain and Russiaresulted in the realisation that Iran was placed in a precariously weak economic,political and military situation. The international circumstances and increasinginformation about the advances in science and the socio-economic welfare ofEuropean countries contributed to the growing demand among some of Iran’sintelligentsia and religious classes for reform of the autocratic royal court and fora change in values among Iranians. Aside from the turmoil associated with con-tacts with the West, there were also indigenous factors that presented the state andother power-brokers with potential threats. One of the most explosive issues wasthe emergence of Babism, out of which developed Baha’i-ism. A combination ofall of these factors helps to explain why Iran was in such a state of ferment in thesecond half of the nineteenth century and the subsequent fifty years witnessedcircumstances that perpetuated a sense of upheaval. These included the grantingof a constitution which limited the autocratic rights of the Shah (and which alsogave rise to the subsequent chaos and civil war), the continuing threat to Iranfrom Britain and Russia (and then the Soviet Union) and the rise of Reza Shahand his policy of absolute rule, modernisation and secularisation.One might suppose that in such circumstances the attention given to Sufism bythe court, the intelligentsia, the Shi‘ite establishment and other groups interestedin Iran would have been overshadowed, but this was far from the case.1Althoughthese groups had varying degrees of concern about Sufism, the intelligentsia andthe Shi‘ite clerics remained conscious of the Persian mystical tradition andcontributed to the on-going discussion of its place in modern Iran. Moreover, theSufis too did not remain as an isolated group within society that was immune from13"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"national and international developments and opinions, and some Sufis adoptedthe new trappings of modern life and embraced contemporary ideals to meet thechallenges of the twentieth century.Despite this there did seem to be a consensus that traditional forms of Sufiritual and practice were on the decline. In the words of the celebrated historianof Persian Sufism, ‘Abd al-Hosayn Zarrinkub,Towards the end [of the Qajar era], aside from the discovery andpromotion of the new thinking – and what has been called “progressivethought” which regarded mysticism and Sufism as the cause of thedecline of the kingdom and nation – the existence of perpetual conflictbetween the [Sufi] sheikhs in defending [their claims to] qotb-ship[i.e. spiritual leadership] was also among the reasons for its acceleratingdecline, and with the start of the Constitutional Revolution and in sub-sequent years, the market day of Sufism in Iran virtually ceased to exist.Despite this, there is a literature worthy of consideration from the longhistory of Sufism and its ups and downs that remains as a legacy.2Although Kasravi claimed that the Sufis were not few in number, his views accordwith those of Zarrinkub concerning the hidden influence of Sufism throughPersian literature, which contained the Sufi “evil teachings”.3Another respectedintellectual who lived and wrote in this period was Sa‘id Nafisi, and he expresseda similar view to that adumbrated by Kasravi, although he was more favourablyinclined to Sufism. He observed:Sufism has been completely adopted from the day it appeared. Allthinkers, poets from Iran and India have, whether they want to or not,been Sufi-natured up to today. This wisdom has settled so deeply in thepeoples of these two countries, that they themselves do not know to whatextent they are Sufi.4The challenges facing Sufism in the modern period were unique, because inaddition to the traditional complaints and criticisms against it (such as the per-missibility within Islam of certain Sufi beliefs and ritual activity) there were newquestions that were raised concerning the desirability of such beliefs and ritualswithin a modern nation-state with a rational, secularising tendency. At stake wasthe creation of Iranian identity and the ability to influence those who possessedpower, and this involved not only the court and politicians but also the Shi‘iteclergy and the intelligentsia.Before describing how various groups in Iranian society responded to Sufismbetween 1850 and 1950 it should be stressed that use of the terms “Sufi”, “Shi‘itecleric” and “intellectual” are not mutually exclusive. Each of these is an umbrellaterm including a wide variety of followers; Sufis may also be Shi‘ite clerics, andintellectual in the Iranian context included secular individuals, devout Shi‘iteOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195014"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Muslims and also Sufis. Examples abound of Sufis who were Shi‘ite clerics ormojtaheds,5and likewise there are examples of modernising intellectuals who wereaffiliated or sympathetic to Sufi groups, as will be shown in this chapter.Shi‘ite clericsShi‘ism became the state religion of Iran under the Safavid dynasty (1501–1722)which had emerged at the beginning of the sixteenth century as a mysticallyinspired movement that was supported militarily by Turkish tribes that bestowedtheir allegiance to their spiritual master who was the leader of the Safavid Sufiorder. However, the eclipse of Sufism under the Safavids probably reflected therealisation by the Shah that the maintenance of law and order would be difficultto effect given the claims of competing and conflicting groups, including the var-ious extreme Sufi movements (such as the Qizilbash) and the Shi‘ite clerics. Asidefrom political considerations, the criticisms of Sufism by the Shi‘ite clerics of thisperiod reflected a combination of distaste for the theological implications of Sufibelief and disgust at Sufi rituals. For example, in the seventeenth century MollaMohammad Taher Qommi complained of the ritual ofchelleh, a period of fortydays for spiritual contemplation during which, according to Qommi, the Sufiexperienced visions and believed he had ascended to God and sometimes viewedhimself as God.6Such theological criticisms and also the accusation that someindividuals use Sufism as an excuse to satisfy their greed and participate inmusical concerts were common during this period.7Clerical authority was based upon the claim that the senior Shi‘ite clerics, ormojtaheds, were responsible for guiding the community, because they were thosebest qualified through their learning and rationally derived knowledge to inter-pret the probable will and desire of the Hidden Imam. This notion of authorityand power based on learning contrasted with the Sufi belief in mystical experi-ence, through which the individual could gain access to God. Even though mostof the Sufi orders, at least by the end of the Safavid dynasty, had themselvesadopted Shi‘ism as their own form of Islam, the Sufi claim of direct experienceof the divine by-passed the mojtahed’sargument to be the best representative of thesacred realm on earth. Such Sufi claims continued into the Qajar period, and so,for example, Safi ‘Ali Shah (d. 1898), one of the most prominent Sufis of the latenineteenth century, described how just as the Mahdi (or the Hidden Imam) willarrive in the world of phenomena (the Shi‘ite doctrine being that the Mahdi willestablish a brief period of justice prior to the end of time) he also appears mysti-cally within the gnostic possessing the power of “spiritual witnessing”.8Trueauthority lies with the Imam to whom all obedience is due, but since the Imam isin occultation and it is the gnostic that has direct contact with him, the Imam’s“guiding functions devolve practically upon the qotb[the Sufi gnostic]”.9Somescholars have claimed that the Sufis actually recognised the mojtahed’sdeputyshipof the Imam in juridical matters;10however, acceptance of this view must betaken with caution, especially in the light of Safi ‘Ali Shah’s remark that the SufiOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195015"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"sheikh or piris the successor (khalifeh) of Mohammad Mostafa in the holy law(shari‘at) and the deputy of ‘Ali’s vicegerency through the designation of friendship(be-nass-e valayat) in the Sufi path (tariqeh).11It would be too simplistic, however, to describe the Shi‘ite clerics as claimingabsolute authority over believers, as Sachedina concludes that Morteza al-Ansari,the leading Shi‘ite cleric of nineteenth-century Iran, held that “the rescript of thetwelfth Imam, although in some sense portending the general deputyship of theImamate jurist, lacks sufficient evidence to establish total discretion of the juristover the lives and property of believers”.12Bearing this in mind, the clerical revul-sion for the absolute obedience given by Sufi disciples to their masters is under-standable. The reformist cleric Shari‘at Sangalaji (1890–1944) abhorred theauthority of the Sufi sheikh over his disciples and that they frequently comparedthe relationship of the disciple to the sheikh in terms of a cadaver in the hands ofthe washer of the dead.13An example of obedience by a disciple to a sheikh can be witnessed in the episodeconcerning the aforementioned Safi ‘Ali Shah and his disciple Zahir al-Dowleh(1864–1924) who was the Shah’s son-in-law and Minister of Public Ceremonies.Naser al-Din Shah (r. 1848–98) sent Zahir al-Dowleh to Safi ‘Ali Shah’skhanaqahso that he could know what was going on there; however, Zahir al-Dowleh wasspiritually affected by Safi ‘Ali Shah and became one of his disciples.14Followingthis there is the remarkable story of how on Safi ‘Ali Shah’s command Zahir al-Dowleh came to the khanaqahhaving walked slowly in a “female fashion” throughthe streets of Tehran in dervish clothing, carrying the Sufi kashkuland axe andpraising ‘Ali. At a certain crossroads he paused for a quarter of an hour andcontinued his praise of ‘Ali in a loud voice, and passers by were astounded that aminister of the Shah’s court behaved in this manner. They dropped gold andsilver coins into the kashkuland Zahir al-Dowleh proceeded on to the khanaqah.When Safi ‘Ali Shah saw Zahir al-Dowleh he was happy and said, “I wantedto make you fall from that peak of grandeur that the pride of royal connectionhas brought about in you.” He then commanded Zahir al-Dowleh to changehis clothes and to serve the people.15It is unclear whether this episode actuallytook place, but it has certainly been reported within Sufi circles as fact and servesas an good illustration of how the disciple must be loyal and obedient to hisspiritual master.It was also the spiritual teachings of Sufi masters or sheikhs that was thecause of some distaste for the clerics. The Sufis are well known for their spiritualinterpretation of sacred texts, including the Qur’an, and for some, their methodof “spiritual unveiling” permitted too great a degree of hermeneutical flexibility.Sufi hermeneutics contrasted with that of the clerics, so that one of the prevail-ing tendencies in Mashhad in the early twentieth century defended “theindependent understanding of Qur’anic knowledge...from allegoricaland rational inferences from Islamic texts, and firmly rejects Islamic philoso-phy and mysticism”.16(This later was known as maktab-e tafkikor school ofsegregationism).OPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195016"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Another source of power over which the Shi‘ite clerics and Sufi competedagainst one another was financial. Traditionally, the clerics could expect to receivethe religious taxes (khoms). From this source of revenue the clerics were then ableto offer bursaries to religious students, and the number of bursaries a cleric wasable to create was an indication of the esteem he enjoyed. The Sufis had to com-pete financially with the clerics, and Chahardahi claims that the Sufi ordersreceived a tithe, rather than the zakatandkhoms, and he cites a Ne‘matollahi Sufi,Shams al-Orafa (d. 1935), who stated, “One eighth of yearly profit, properlyaccounted, must be handed over to the sheikh’skhanaqahwhich will be used forthe benefit of the poor [Sufis].”17Whether those who donated one-eighth of theprofit and the khomsto the Sufis and to the clerics can only be conjectured.However, it can be assumed that as Iran’s economy deteriorated in the nineteenthcentury with the dramatic increase in European imports, it would certainly havebeen difficult for Iranians to meet all of these financial “obligations”.The competition between clerics and Sufis for Iranian hearts and pocketsapplied even to the person of the Shah. The Shah did not wield absolute andunquestioned power in Iran, for the monarchs of the Qajar dynasty were awarethat their claims to legitimacy were somewhat tenuous, as Shi‘ism denies politicallegitimacy to monarchs, which belongs to the Hidden Imam, and in his absence,to his representatives. Believing that they were these legitimate representatives,the clerics recognised the de factolegitimacy of the monarchy so long as Islam wasobserved. The institutional power enjoyed by the clerics in Iran during this periodalso helped to guard their privileged position in society, as they controlled the reli-gious courts, officiated at the signing of commercial agreements in the bazaar,and were largely responsible for education. The influence that the ulemaenjoyedat the royal court depended to a large extent upon the religious proclivity of theruler, but an example of the extent of clerical power can be illustrated by the factthat Fath ‘Ali Shah (d. 1834) was pushed into a disastrous war with the Russiansin 1826 by clerical persuasion.18Moreover, the attempts of Naser al-Din Shah togenerate income by granting concessions to Europeans failed partly due to theresistance of the ulema.19Sufism re-emerged in Iran in the nineteenth century after its eclipse under theSafavids, and inevitably it was regarded as a threat by some clerics to their ownposition in society. This was particularly the case during the reign of MohammadShah (1836–48) who was attracted from an early age to Sufism. During his reignthe Sufis and their shrines enjoyed lavish royal patronage, and Sufis were evenawarded with posts at court. The advances made by the Sufis during MohammadShah’s reign were “never entirely lost, and they enjoyed a position of securityand even respect in the reign of Naser al-Din Shah”, yet they never representedanything more than “a mild irritant for the ulama”.20Aside from issues of power, finance and theology, Shi‘ite clerics were alsoconcerned with Sufi practices, which the scholarly Shi‘ite clerics regarded assuperstition and innovation. (Of course, the Shi‘ite tradition too had its own shareof “superstitions” and here it is possible to witness a convergence of folk SufismOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195017"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"with folk Shi‘ism.)21Typical of the criticisms of Shi‘ite clerics are those ofKhalkhali, an influential cleric during the period of the Constitutional Revolutionin the first decade of the twentieth century. In a treatise written in 1907 Khalkhalicondemned the Sufis for transgressing the law, superstition, pomposity, beggingand smoking opium.22The Sufis have often been associated with the smoking ofopium, and indeed, Safi ‘Ali Shah freely admitted to smoking it at a khanaqahinHaydarabad as if there was nothing unusual or problematic about the practice.23Another issue of concern for the Shi‘ite clerics surrounded the lack of respect thatthe Sufis paid to the Qur’an and to the holy law. Safi ‘Ali Shah mentioned howsome people complained about his rendering of the Arabic Qur’an into Persianverse, thus providing a tafsirof God’s word for literate Persians.24Safi ‘Ali Shah’sresponse was that he had put into verse the interpretation of the Qur’an, not theQur’an itself.25At this point it is necessary to distinguish clearly between popular Sufism,which its critics sometimes associated with begging, smoking opium, excessiveasceticism and ecstatic dancing, and a “higher” and more intellectualised versionknown as ‘erfan(sometimes translated as gnosis).26The difference between Sufismand‘erfanwas not something that emerged during the period of Qajar Iran;indeed, eminent scholars of the School of Isfahan during the Safavid era werealso critical of the ecstatic Sufi tradition and its superstitions and tricks,27prefer-ring a more philosophical and theoretical approach to metaphysical questionsthat at the same time did not negate the possibility of mystical experience. In thelatter half of the nineteenth century the study of‘erfanwas led by Hajji MollaHadi Sabzevari, Molla ‘Ali Modarres Zonuzi (who was also a Sufi initiate andwrote a response to questions posed to him from a Qajar prince)28and AqaMohammad Reza Qomsha’i, and Tehran became the centre for following Islamicphilosophy and ‘erfan.29The study of‘erfanwas adopted too by some of the leading clerics of the firsthalf of the twentieth century, thus Shari‘at Sangalaji was taught ‘erfanin Tehranby one Mirza Hashem Eshkevari,30and Ruhollah Khomeini (1902–89) tookclasses in the same subject offered by Mirza Mohammad ‘Ali Shahabadi(1875–1950) and Mirza ‘Ali Akbar Hakim Yazdi (d. 1925). Khomeini mentionsthe suspicion that some clerics held for mysticism to the extent that it was neces-sary to find a preacher to testify from the minbarthat Mirza ‘Ali Akbar HakimYazdi actually read the Qur’an. Sympathetic to the tradition of‘erfan, Khomeiniwas later to observe, “Those who wear cloaks and turbans and denounce the mys-tics as unbelievers do not understand what they are saying; if they did they wouldnot denounce them.”31Another example of the suspicion surrounding ‘erfancon-cerns the difficulty in obtaining mystical texts; as a young scholar in Mashhad (theholiest city in Shi‘ite Iran because of the existence of Imam Reza’s tomb) in the1920s, Badi‘ al-Zaman Foruzanfar could not find a copy of Rumi’sDivan-e Shams(perhaps due to the Sufi nature of the contents, or, as Franklin Lewis suggests,because Rumi was a Sunni).32Such caution about ‘erfanresulted in some holdingsecret classes (as in Khomeini’s case),33and even if the classes were public thenOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195018"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"the prerequisites for entry into the class prevented access to those who were notserious or academically minded. E.G. Browne has recorded the difficulty inattending Hajji Molla Hadi Sabzevari’s classes on metaphysics and Molla Sadra.His students would have had to have shown proficiency in preliminary studies ofArabic grammar, logic, mathematics, jurisprudence and scholastic theology.34There were some clerics, however, who regarded both Sufism and ‘erfanas dan-gerous; perhaps the best example is provided in the writings of ‘Allameh Abu FazlBorqe‘i, which were probably published in the 1950s.35Of particular note isBorqe‘i’s works entitled Haqiqat al-‘erfan: taftish dar shenasa’i-ye ‘aref va sufi va sha‘er vahakim va dervish(“The Truth of Gnosis: A Search to Recognise the Gnostic, theSufi, the Poet, the Wise Man and Dervish”).36This book is 391 pages in lengthand is divided into seven sections: the words of God, the prophet and the immac-ulate imams (peace be upon them) on the subject of Sufism and the dervishes; thewords of the Shi‘iteulemaabout them; mention in the books of the Shi‘ite learnedones on this topic; the states (ahval), ways, saying and beliefs of the gnostics andthe spiritual elders; refutation of their innovations with rational and legal proofs;the infidelity of the gnostics, spiritual elders and philosophers, and an expositionrefuting them; that the originators and heads of the orders have not been Shi‘itesand that all of the Sufi sects are the same in being lost.These headings offer an indication of Borqe‘i’s opposition to the Sufis, but themajority of the text contains two sections, five and six, which examine the Sufiinnovations (bi‘dat) and Sufi heresies (kofr), respectively. The fourteen Sufi innova-tions that Borqe‘i discusses are primarily concerned with practice, and 131 pages aredevoted to this topic. The sub-titles in chapter five reflect the Sufi innovationswhich are “causing disunity among Muslims”; the long moustaches of the Sufis(which for Borqe‘i contravened the practice of Mohammad); “passionate love(‘eshq)”; “poetry and the poets”; “inappropriate interpretations and filthy, gnosticexplanations and accounts”; “the silent and loud zekr”; “chelleh, asceticism (riyazat)and spiritual witnessing (mokashafeh)”; “spiritual witnessing and charismatic pow-ers (mokashafeh va karamat)”; “establishing the morshed, the pole and the vali-ye amr”;“knowledge, books, asceticism (zohd), piety (taqva) and the [refutation] of them”;“music, dancing, and singing,”; “going to the khanaqahand abandoning themosque”; “unity between enemies and friends without [feeling] revulsion”;“inventing hadiths, defamation and lying” and “customs, etiquette and Sufi para-phernalia”. The sixth section reflects Borqe‘i’s dislike of Sufi theology and faith,and this chapter (which is fifty pages in length) contains twelve heresies: denial ofthe fundaments of religion (osul-e din); making legal (halal) prohibited things(haram); the unity of existence (vahdat-e vojud), unification (ettehad), religious actsthat may or may not be performed and the relinquishing of obligatory acts,claiming connection (vesal) to the Truth, the pre-determinism (jabri) of the Sufisand gnostics, the fatalism (qadari) of the Sufis and gnostics, devotion to the morshedin worship, witnessing the Truth, and reincarnation (tanasokh).Having explained in detail the innovations and heresies of the Sufis, Borqe‘ithen provides a summarised version in an index (or a list that appears at the veryOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195019"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"end of the book), of fifty-two beliefs of the gnostics and Sufis that stand incontrast to Islam, and he offers the “correct” Shi‘ite understanding directlyopposite to the Sufi innovations.As one might expect, Borqe‘i utilises much of that dimension of the Shi‘itetradition that rejects Sufism. In chapter one he focuses his attention on sacredscripture, in particular the sayings of Mohammad and the Imams. The mostextensive section in this chapter is a discussion of fourteen hadith(fromMohammad and the Shi‘ite Imams); the seventh hadiththat is cited serves as agood example and is traced to Imam Reza who said, “No one speaks of Sufismand dervish-hood unless he wants to deceive people, or unless he [himself] is lostor is stupid.”37Borqe‘i’s discussion of how the Sufis made certain Qur’anic versesnull and void is short and disappointing. It is significant, however, because of hisdesire to protect the sacred texts of Shi‘ites from Sufi “distortions” while at thesame time utilising them to reveal the evils of the Sufi tradition. This methodol-ogy is a feature that distinguishes Borqe‘i’s anti-Sufism from those anti-Sufis whodid not write from within the clerical context. What they all share in common,however, is an appeal to reason, and Borqe‘i’s anti-Sufi text states in the intro-duction that the logic of Islam is based on revelation and the sayings of theimmaculate Imams, and there is no other evidence for Muslims, although reason(‘aql) is a proof in all religions.38The protection of Shi‘ism through revelation andreason was necessary for Borqe‘i because he felt that in the contemporary periodthere was a danger that greed and self-promotion could result in religion beingmanipulated and in an increase in conflicting opinions. This is a serious problembecause “foreign enemies” have taken advantage of this situation and they sup-port minorities, overturn Islam, pollute and destroy the nation (mellat) and takeriches in plunder that make their own countries flourish. “We would prefer thatthere are no intellectual differences and schisms in the nation so that our state andnation can be at peace, because schisms cause misfortune and destruction.”39Thislinkage of Sufism with the weakening of the nation, and its connection with for-eign powers, is a theme that re-occurs among anti-Sufis in the twentieth centuryas will be shown in the course of this book.Not all clerics were opposed to the Sufi or ‘erfanitradition, however, as theinterest shown by Ruhollah Khomeini in mysticism clearly demonstrates. In 1930Khomeini completed his first independent treatise on ‘erfanin Arabic calledMesbah al-hedayat(“The Lamp of Guidance”), and although it was not printed, itwas circulated in manuscript and several of his elders in Qom wrote glosses uponit.40Parts of this work include sections inspired by the ideas of Molla Sadra whoportrayed a mystical journey to perfection composed of four stages. These fourstages, as explicated by Khomeini, depict the type of ontology of which Kasraviwas so critical. In the first stage, man casts aside the veils of sensuality which hadpreviously tempted him to enjoy worldly pleasures and he is able to witness thedivine through creation: “the face of the Presence of the Truth and the face ofGod is revealed for him and the end of this journey is when he sees all creationas a manifestation of His Majesty, the Truth, and he observes everything asOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195020"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"His signs”.41Khomeini uses the terms that have been common currency amongSufis and gnostics for centuries, and so, for example, he says that during the firstjourney, the seeker has a truthful existence through the state of annihilation (fana).In this state, it is possible that God bestows his favour upon the individual and thestate of annihilation is terminated and the seeker recognises himself as nothingbut a slave to God. It is here that the second journey commences, a journey “fromthe Truth [witnessed in creation] to the Truth by means of the Truth”. Again,Khomeini utilises the familiar Sufi terminology by stating that in this station, theseeker enjoys the state of subsistence in God (baqa’). During this state, the seekerexperiences God directly, and worldly concerns are completely transcended.During the third journey “from the Truth back to man” the mystic returns tothe creatures, and although having a share in prophethood, he does not have theauthority to legislate. He is able to “see the reality of things and their perfectionand the circumstances of their progress to the first station and their return totheir original homeland”. In the fourth journey, “from man to man by meansof God”,he watches over creatures and their work and needs...and in so far ashe can, he makes them return to God, and he informs others of every-thing he has known and of everything that is an obstacle for the travel-ling in God, and it is during this time that legislative prophethood isyielded for him.42He brings religion and religious law and he makes exoteric commandspertaining to the body and he gives information about God Most Highand His attributes and names and the rightful mystical learnings to thedegree that the able ones have the talent for comprehending.43The implications of Khomeini’s mystical world-view are difficult to unravelbecause his texts offer a somewhat ambiguous presentation of the identity of theindividual who engages in the four journeys. Some scholars have suggested thatKhomeini himself believed he had passed these journeys; for example, BaqerMoin claimed, “Khomeini’s strength and self-righteousness...was based upon hismythical view that he had been through the four journeys sought by the Sufis, toreach absolute unity with God.”44Other scholars have been more cautious, asVanessa Martin observes that for Khomeini the perfect man who completes thefour journeys has the status of a prophet or Imam, although she also adds thatthere are hints to the effect that the status of the perfect man may also be identi-fied in ordinary mortals.45It is significant, however, that Kasravi did not mention the political ramifica-tions of Khomeini’s writings, and this was because the text was only distributedamong a select élite and was not published. However, on the subject of power andkingship, Kasravi comments that it is the Sufis who claim to bestow kingship uponothers rather than taking it themselves, and he gives examples from the medievalperiod as well as from the modern era.OPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195021"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Khomeini’s interest in ‘erfandid not come to an end with the publication ofMesbah al-hedayatas in 1944 he published a work entitled Kashf al-asrar(“Unveilingof Secrets”). This was partly a response to the work of ‘Ali Akbar Hakamizadehwho had once been a cleric, but had been attracted to the kind of world view thatwas advocated by Kasravi, and had published a short essay entitled Asrar-e hezarsaleh(“Thousand-year old secrets”) which questioned some of the fundamentalsof Shi‘ism46(and which was published by Kasravi’s press).47In Khomeini’sresponse (in Kashf al-Asrar) he made use of the ‘erfanitradition and cites Ibn ‘Arabiand Molla Sadra.Khomeini’s attachment to ‘erfanwas so strong that it informed his teaching ofethics, in which he held classes on Thursdays and Fridays. The effect that theseclasses had upon his students is, perhaps, best expressed by Morteza Motahhari,who attended Khomeini’s lectures: “the ethical lessons delivered by the figure Iadored (each Thursday and Friday) made me inebriated. The lessons were, inreality, lessons of divine knowledge (ma‘arif va sair va suluk) and not only ethicallessons in the narrow technical sense”.48At about the same time that Khomeini was teaching his ethics and ‘erfan,Seyyed Mohammed Tabataba’i (1901–81) was also asked to teach Molla Sadra’s“four journeys” when he moved to Qom. His course became very popular, to theextent that over one hundred pupils attended, yet the stipends of all those whoattended the lectures were curtailed by Grand Ayatollah Borujerdi, the leadingclerical figure in Iran. Borujerdi’s reason for this action is somewhat vague (“theopen teaching of the Asfar in an official seminary setting, that is not appropri-ate”), but even more revealing is his admission that he had also studied the text asa student, but in secret!49‘Allameh Tabataba’i’s reason for teaching this text wasbecause of his belief that it was Islamic philosophy and mysticism that had a bet-ter chance of challenging the secular ideologies that were becoming increasinglypopular in Iran than the obscurantist literalism of some of the traditionalShi‘ite clergy.Tabataba’i’s concern with mysticism and philosophy should not be regarded asmerely intellectual, as it appears that he engaged in traditional Sufi ascetic prac-tice (although not the antinomian variety) and certainly believed that he hadreceived certain spiritual unveilings. Tabataba’i’s writings include an account of adream in which he was spoken to by the prophet Idris, and this dream “was thefirst transformation that connected the material world of nature to the supernat-ural realm for me”.50Another indication of Tabataba’i’s active engagement withthe mystical tradition that went beyond mere speculation was his practice of bib-liomancy (determining a course of action with reference to the message containedwithin a random ghazalfrom the Divan-e Hafez).51Moreover his description withinhis work “The Kernel of the Kernel” of what the wayfarer witnesses and experi-ences during the spiritual journey suggests that he may have believed that he hadgone through something similar himself (although it may also be possible that hewas drawing on the works of celebrated mediaval Sufis such as Najm al-DinKobra whose writings also describe such mystical, visionary journeys).OPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195022"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"In his ‘erfaniperspective, Tabataba’i did not see any contradiction betweenmysticism and Shi‘ism, for he describes how the particular guide for the wayfareris the Twelfth Imam forthe source of all that which finds concrete existence and manifestation inthe world of creation is the Divine Names and Attributes, and the realityof the Imam is the same as the Names and Attributes of God...Accordingly, in the process of wayfaring, the traveler traverses within theplanes of the Imam’s luminosity. Any spiritual station he may ascend orstatus he may attain, the Imam already possesses and accompanies thewayfarer in that plane and station.52Moreover, Tabataba’i’s portrayal of the spiritual journey is one that conforms toShi‘ite piety and the observance of legal norms, and those who believe that theyhave reached such advanced spiritual stations that the shari‘ais no longer applicableto them merely make prevarications and false assertions.53Sufi critics among the intellectualsFrom the late nineteenth century to the period in which Kasravi was composingthose works of his that were critical of Sufism and mystical Persian literature, thereemerged a growing criticism of Sufism within circles that may be characterised asreformist and intellectual. Perhaps the most famous of all nineteenth-centuryIslamic reformers was Seyyed Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, frequently associated withthe popularisation of Pan-Islamism. Afghani believed that Sufis had contributedto the decline of the Muslim world; specifically, he believed the Sufis were irra-tional, encouraged fatalism and blindly followed their sheikhs.54SubsequentIranian reformers (especially those who were not so interested to preserve theirIslamic heritage) were concerned with “social critical realism” which some con-sidered to be the antithesis of Sufism. Such reformers included Mirza Fath ‘AliAkhundzadeh (1812–78) who criticised the poetry of Rumi for its “pantheism”,doctrine of annihilation (fana) and the return of the human spirit to God.55Butperhaps the most virulent opponent of Sufism among these nineteenth-centuryreformers was the Babi sympathiser Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani (1853–96) whosecritique of Persian poetry includes the following:As a result of their exaggerations and excesses, lying has been implantedin the simple nature of people. Their eulogies and admirations haveencouraged kings and the viziers to commit atrocities and stupidities.Their mystical and Sufi poetry has led to nothing but laziness, animalis-tic sluggishness, and the production of beggars and vagabonds.Their sonnets about roses and nightingales has encouraged the youth topursue pederasty and booze...it was the otherworldly mysticism andSufism of Sheikh Iraqi, Maghribi and others which has produced somany lazy, spineless, passive beggars.56OPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195023"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"In the tradition of Kermani was Zayn al-‘Abedin Maragheh’i (1838–1911) whodeplored the content of Sufi love poetry in Persian literature and regretted thatthe poets had not spoken of love for the country or nationalism.57He claimed,“Till now no one in our dear land has spoken a word about love of country, norput down in writing useful matters from which the common people may benefitas required.”58“Our compatriots ought to know that there is another ‘love’besides the love of Leili and Majnkn, Farhad and Shjrjn, Mahmkd and Ayhz.”59Zayn al-‘Abedin Maragheh’i adds that there is no more demand for the allusionsfound so frequently in Sufi poetry, and he says, “Instead of ‘Black Mole Above theLip’ one should speak of the black coal in the mine...the‘Story of the Candleand the Moth’ is worn out, speak about founding Spermaceti Candle Factory.”60Mention should also be made of Jamal al-Din Va’ez (Isfahani) who was a greatsupporter of the Revolutionary Committee, one of the secret societies set up inthe years leading to the Constitutional Revolution and which advocated the over-throw of despotism and the establishment of the rule of law and justice.61(It isinteresting to note that Abrahamian claims that among the members of this com-mittee was the leader of a Ne‘mati order.)62Jamal al-Din was a great exponent ofsecularism; indeed, he had been thrown out of Isfahan for his “audacious advo-cacy of secular ideas”,63and his criticisms were levelled at the Shi‘ite clerics andSufis. In his essay of 1900 Lebas-e taqvahe complained of the Sufi nomadic life andtheir parasitical nature as they had no jobs to procure a livelihood, and he alsorebuked them for gambling and engaging in “other forbidden deeds”.64Criticisms of Sufism also emerged in the decade after the ConstitutionalRevolution, for Sa‘id Nafisi mentions a controversy that erupted within theDemocrat Party in the wake of the First World War, in particular betweenBahar65and one Mirza ‘Ali Asghar Khan Taleqani. Taleqani published a series ofarticles in his newspaper Zaban-e Azad(Free Speech) under the title, the “Schoolof Sa‘di”. In these articles Taleqani argued that traditional Persian poetry hadinculcated a “dervish spirit” among Iranians which was the cause of their weak-ness and backwardness.66Nafisi claims that this dispute raged not only in Tehranbut in other cities too, especially in Shiraz (which was the birth place of Sa‘di),and he concludes that the controversy over Sufism and mystical Persian literaturewas not an event instigated by Kasravi (for this occurred in the 1930s) but that hemerely “rekindled the fire”.67With the rise of Reza Shah and the increasing contact with the West, the intel-lectual currency in Iran developed an increasing secular flavouring. This can beattributed in part to the rising level of cultural and scientific knowledge derivedfrom the West, in particular, forms of nineteenth-century liberalism, reason, thestress on individualism and positivism. During the nineteenth century Westernintellectuals were increasingly critical of established religion and were adopting amore “rational” world-view, and this perspective was adopted by some of theIranian intellectuals. Typical of such intellectuals was ‘Ali Dashti (1894–1982)who achieved fame during the reign of Reza Shah as editor of the newspaperShafaq-e Sorkh(“Red Dawn”) which ran between 1922 and 1935.

Although not a “practicing” Muslim,69there are references in this work to God, and Islam as the best religion to renderhumans happy due to its ethical duties.70The concern for the welfare of the com-munity at large resulted in Dashti rejecting mysticism as a means of socialprogress. Moreover, the practical circumstances of humans in the modern age(especially the dependence on material things) has resulted in life being an endlessstruggle which can only be resolved through effort. To engage in mystical renun-ciation in order to attain happiness is considered impractical by Dashti becausehumans cannot free themselves from “love of the self ”.71Consequently, he recog-nised that Sufism was instrumental in “paralysing the powers of resistance andstruggle in the individual members of a nation and weakening the moral fabric ofa society”.72Dashti’s distaste for Sufism increased when he was researching abook on Rumi (published in 1958)73and he visited some khanaqahsand met withsome Sufi sheikhs. “He was struck by the hypocrisy, the pretentiousness, theamateurish, superstitious-filled, and pseudo-magical trickery of the Sufi clergy.”74An intellectual who possessed a similar opinion of Sufism and mysticism wasSadeq Hedayat (1903–51), who is regarded by many Western observers as Iran’smost famous modern novelist and whose fiction is dark and pessimistic. Hedayatwas one of the leading literary figures of his time, and therefore his writings rep-resent a certain trend within the Iranian literati. The themes of oppression anddespair are prominent in his work, as is biting criticism of much of the Islamicreligious tradition in Iran. Perhaps a good reflection of the type of personalitythat was Sadeq Hedayat is manifested through his works about and opinion of‘Omar Khayyam, the great twelfth-century composer of quatrains, made famousin Britain in the nineteenth century by Fitzgerald’s rather loose translations. Butjust as Fitzgerald distorted Khayyam’s poetry to suit the sensitivities of elementswithin Victorian Britain, Hedayat too had a tendency to push Khayyam into thebackground and bring forth his own thoughts and psychology in the guise of aninterpretation.75Hedayat claims that Khayyam should be considered a Deistwho denied an immanent God who acted in the particulars of the world, andtherefore the world-view of Hedayat’s Khayyam stands in opposition to that ofthe Sufis.76Hedayat’s refusal to witness any ultimate values in Sufism is best reflected in ashort story entitled Mardi ke nafs-ash-ra kosht(“The Man who Killed his Soul”)which appeared for the first time in a collection of his short stories entitled “ThreeDrops of Blood” in 1932.77This story tells the fate of Mirza Hosayn ‘Ali, a schoolteacher who had a keen interest in Sufism, to the extent that he lived in seclusionand whose pleasure was in reading Sufi and gnostic texts. He regarded SheikhAbu’l-Fazl, a teacher of Arabic,78as a guide on his Sufi path, although he is por-trayed as rather pompous. Yet Mirza Hosayn ‘Ali had some doubts concerning themystic path, especially when he pondered some of the verses by Hafez andOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195025"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Khayyam which he understood as enjoining humans to worldly pleasures. In anattempt to resolve his problem Mirza Hosayn ‘Ali decided to refer to his sheikh,but on reaching Abu’l-Fazl’s house he found an irate man accusing the sheikh ofmaking his daughter pregnant. Mirza Hosayn ‘Ali’s doubts about the sheikh deep-ened when he learnt that he ate roast partridge privately while publicly partakingof crusty bread and mouldy cheese. Realising that the sheikh was a charlatan,Mirza Hosayn ‘Ali became depressed and thought that he had wasted his youthin his Sufi yearnings. So he then went to a bar where he drank wine, listened tomusic and returned home with a prostitute. The story ends with the non-appear-ance of the teacher at school, and the readers are left to assume that he has com-mitted suicide; rather than killing his lower, selfish ego, or soul (nafs), MirzaHosayn ‘Ali took his own life.In itself the story is not that convincing. Why would Mirza Hosayn ‘Ali becomeso full of doubt about the truth of mysticism because of the actions of one indi-vidual? Indeed, those learned in Sufi texts would be familiar with warnings aboutthose who abuse Sufism for their own personal gain. Yet, the story serves as abarometer for the anti-Sufism that was prevalent among a group of intellectualswho reacted against the hypocrisy of some “Sufis” and who also rejected the ulti-mate truths that could be derived from following the Sufi path. Is it the voice ofMirza Hosayn ‘Ali or Hedayat himself when on drinking wine in the bar, and onlooking at the prostitute’s face he comprehended the mystery of life – to enjoyworldly pleasures, as advocated by Hafez and Khayyam? Salvation through mys-ticism is not the answer to the pain of existence, and this rejection of religion hasits ultimate expression in the suicide of Mirza Hosayn ‘Ali (or Hedayat), as suicideis forbidden within the Islamic tradition.79Towards the end of his life Hedayat became associated with the Tudeh Party,80Iran’s Communist movement. The forerunner of the Tudeh Party emerged in the1930s, and in 1935 a study group of young Marxists was formed, with its chiefideologue being Taqi Arani, a German educated university professor. This grouppublished a newsletter called Donya(“The World”) in which Arani presentedhis views. Arani and his fellow Marxists, amounting to fifty-three individuals,were arrested in 1937 and brought to trial, and Arani received a maximumten-year sentence, but he died within two years. Kasravi had little time for Arani’sleft-wing views, and indeed, the former’s first book,Ayin, “was aimed [inrejection] at the theory of class struggle”.81Nevertheless, ever a man ofprinciples, Kasravi was prepared to defend his Marxist adversaries during theirpolitical trials in 1938.82Arani’s opinions of Sufism are contained within a fifty-nine page article pub-lished in Donya, called ‘Erfan va osul-e madi(“Mysticism and the Principles ofMaterialism”).83The basis of Arani’s argument lies in his argument that allthought is subject to material influences; the brain is composed of matter and itis influenced by external, material factors, including food, temperature, and itssocial environment. Humans become aware of universal laws by reflectingon their needs and their classification of the information about their materialOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195026"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"conditions. The input of God, or a divine being, is something that is notconsidered in Arani’s view and stands strikingly in contrast with Sufi thought.Arani views mysticism in general as a belief that appears in times of despair andmaterial loss; when a group in society has no hope for progress and advancementit finds solace in mystical ideas by scorning worldly pleasures that are beyond itsreach and by considering the existential differences between itself and the morefortunate group as imaginary and superficial. In this way, Sufi ideas are an attackon the enemy.84With regard to the emergence of mysticism in the Islamic tradi-tion, Arani seems to believe that its origin was the result of opposition to the cen-tralised and despotic caliphate in Baghdad. Indeed, he argues that Sufis such asMansur Hallaj were middle class, and his declaration of “I am the Truth” was nota claim to divinity, but rather it was a cry against “power and the special impor-tance [attributed to] God”, and Hallaj’s execution was to preserve the centralpower of the caliphate,85which was necessary given the support that mysticismenjoyed in Iranian villages.Arani’s understanding of Sufism is in some ways more sophisticated thanKasravi’s because the former recognises important distinctions among the Sufis(such as the different ideas of the unity of existence (vahdat-e vojud), incarnation-ism (holul) and union (ettehad)).86Moreover, he does not regard Sufism as static, ashe mentions that Sufism develops in response to changing material conditions.However, although the language and tone may be milder than that found inKasravi’s writings, there is little doubt that Arani had no sympathy for Sufism,and his criticisms of the Sufis include their use of narcotics to induce “states ofyearning and attraction”87, the invention of chains of initiation88and the scantregard for reason.89True to his Marxist beliefs, Arani argued that dialectic materialism wouldinevitably prevail and mysticism and Sufism would disappear. He does not discussin depth the state of contemporary Sufism in Iran, yet in his introduction he com-ments that the aim of the article is to “awaken the masses to avoid the disease ofmendicancy, contentment, seclusion, opium, and the madness of claimingdivinity, and to encourage people to [adopt] a material life and to [engage] in astruggle to preserve life”.90Obviously Arani believed that there was a certainmentality among some Iranians at least, which needed to be cured. However, healso seems to recognise that “formal” Sufism was declining, as he claimed thatthe Safi ‘Ali Shahs and the Gonabadi Sufis of Iran were disappearing andthat although Eastern Sufism may merge with European mysticism for awhile, ultimately the world would no longer listen to the preaching of suchmystics.91Arani’s positive prediction for the future of materialism is due to hisbelief thattoday, the principles of materialism and logic have connected humans toall sciences, industries, societies and arts, and it has liberated humansfrom common superstitions whether through nature, biology, physiologyor sociology, and it has shown humans the path of happiness.92OPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195027"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Supporters of Sufism among the intellectualsThus far presented, the modernist intellectual tradition in Iran has been verycritical of Sufism, yet a full picture must take into account the emergence of agroup of intellectuals and academics in the 1920s–30s, some of whom enteredthe political world and became great supporters of mystical Persian literature.Within this group we may include Mohammad ‘Ali Forughi, ‘Ali Asghar Hekmat,Sa‘id Nafisi, Badi‘ al-Zaman Foruzanfar, Mohammad Qazvini and MohammadMo‘in, who were all inspired by the literary and ethical merits of the texts,although their formal affiliation to Sufi orders remains unclear.93Forughi first emerged as a politician during the constitutional period andbecame Reza Shah’s prime minister on two occasions (1926, 1933–5). He had agreat affection for Persian literature, in particular for Sa‘di and Ferdowsi, and healso published a selection of Hafez’sghazalsin 1937.94Yet he was severely cen-sured by Kasravi because of the belief that Iran should promote its internation-ally recognised poets, including those such as Khayyam, Hafez and Rumi whohad all received much attention from the European community of scholars in theeighteenth and nineteenth centuries.Another politician who was active in publishing Sufi related material was ‘AliAsghar Hekmat (who was the minister of education (1933–8), and also chancellorof Tehran University between 1935–8). His publications on Sufis and mysticisminclude “A Lesson from the Divan of Hafez”,95a book on the fifteenth-century Sufi,‘Abd al-Rahman Jami96(and in 1947 he translated into Persian the third volume ofE.G. Browne’sA Literary History of Persia, something which probably would haveincurred the wrath of Kasravi (see Chapter 5) had he been alive at the time).97Kasravi’s anger was, no doubt, exacerbated further by some of the academicswithin the Faculty of Theology of Tehran University that had opened in 1935.Badi‘ al-Zaman Foruzanfar (1900–70) is a good example of such scholars; havinggraduated from a religious seminary, he was appointed vice-president of theFaculty of Theology and became professor of Islamic mysticism soon after.98Hisfirst publication was a history of Iranian poets of the early centuries, whichappeared between 1929 and 1933, and after completing his dissertation on Rumiin 1936, the Iranian Ministry of Culture asked Foruzanfar to prepare selectionsfrom the Masnavifor students. So in 1943 he published Selections from the Masnavi,which included an introduction in which he defended Sufism from the kind ofcriticisms that Kasravi levelled against it.99There were other prominent academics associated with the University ofTehran who were publishing and editing works written by Sufi authors. For exam-ple, Sa‘id Nafisi’s publications during the 1930s and 1940s included editions ofpoetry from Rudaki,100Kashani,101‘Attar102and Hafez.103Nafisi’s colleagueRezazadeh-Shafaq (1895–1971) was also productive, having published a popularwork for high schools entitled The History of Literature in Iranin which he praisedthe mystical poets.104His views of Rumi’s verses provide a typical example of hisOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195028"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"attraction to mystical poetry, which accepts the “reality” of mysticism:105The special quality of Mawlana’sghazalsis the effervescence and tumultof love that moves anyone possessing a heart and arouses his or her emo-tions.

Also worthy of mention is Mohammad Mo‘in (1917–71) who pub-lished in 1940 a work of some 800 pages on Hafez, a book that he dedicated tothe “pure spirit of Hafez”. In his introduction, Mo‘in lamented that materialismruled the contemporary world and stated that humanity feels the need of spiritualconsolation. Returning to the great poets of the past could assist in this, and hisdescriptions of Hafez as having discovered “the secret of happiness” and “thereality of life”108are based upon his view that Hafez was essentially a mystic.Mo‘in even described Hafez as a “celestial poet” (sha‘er-e malakuti)109who had a“heavenly book” (ketab-e asemani)110and claimed, “After Jalal al-Din Mawlavi,Hafez is the most obvious manifestation of the gnostics (‘arefan) in this period.”111Another great scholar of Hafez was Mohammad Qazvini (1877–1949) whosepublications on Hafez include An Investigation of the Works, Thought and Life ofHafez.112Like Mo‘in, Qazvini considered Hafez the greatest of all Persian poets,and in a conversation with Dr Ghani he remarked that if a statue from each coun-try were to be erected in Hyde Park, then the form of Hafez would be found inLondon as the Iranian representative.113Western opinions of SufismA source worthy of inspection in an inquiry concerning Iranian opinions ofSufism can be found in the literature written by Western scholars and travellers inIran during the period in question. Although caution needs to be exercised wheninvestigating such literature, it is probably true to say that the comments of suchtravellers reflect to varying degrees the opinions of their Iranian friends or hosts.Many European writers were undiscriminating in their portrayal of Sufism,lumping the various Sufis groups within a single mould, yet there were great dif-ferences in the types of Sufism that existed in this period, especially when theKhaksar-Jalali dervishes are compared with the Ne‘matollahi Sufis. In this sec-tion, the descriptions of Sufis by Morier, Lady Sheil and C.J. Wills probablyreflect their experiences with Khaksar dervishes who have been characterised asOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195029"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"wandering dervishes.114Zarrinkub claimed that they were prevalent in the lateQajar period and were numerous in Tehran, Khorasan and Fars.115Western criticisms of Sufism in nineteenth-century Iran can be found in a satir-ical novel by James Morier, entitled The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Isfahan, whichwas published in 1824.116This English work was then translated into Persian inthe late nineteenth century by Mirza Habib Isfahani; yet many Iranians believedthe book to have been written by a native Iranian, so accurately portrayed were thecustoms, traditions and foibles of Iranians.117The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Isfahanincludes extensive sections in which Sufis are presented in a derogatory fashion(for example, the names of the Sufis are Dervish Sefer(“the wandering dervish”)andDervish Bideen(“the dervish without religion”). At one point, Dervish Seferadmits: “We hold men’s beards as cheap as dirt; and although our existence isprecarious, yet it is one of great variety, as well as of idleness. We look on mankindas fair game – we live upon their weaknesses and credulity.”118Although Morierpresents a caricature of Sufism in his book, it was certainly the one that Iraniansrecognised, and it confirms that there were individuals who regarded the Sufis ascharlatans and tricksters.Writing some time after James Morier, Lady Sheil recorded her memoirs andexperiences of travelling in Iran in the early 1850s.119In a section relating herobservation on antinomian Sufis (including a dervish who spent his time exclaim-ing “Wool! Wool!” as he wandered through the bazaar in Tehran, encouragingothers to reject the material world, and another who on begging would declare “Athousand toumans! I won’t accept anything less!”), Lady Sheil remarked thatthe character of these derveeshes is exceedingly low in general estima-tion, and yet a certain reverence is attached to the profession. Under thepretence of abandoning the vain cares of a fleeting world, they devotetheir lives to idleness and the inebriation arising from chers, roving fromcity to city, by the orders of their moorshids, or spiritual chiefs, andlevying contributions from the multitude.120Lady Sheil also described how the Sufis exacted taxes on the wealthy by sowing afield of wheat, a yard square, adjacent to the property of respectable household-ers. The Sufi then blew his horn and screamed devotions until he received hispresents. Other Sufis hurled “dreadful abuse” on those whom they met, cursingthose who refused to submit to their extortion.121Another negative portrayal of dervishes is found in C.J. Wills’ account,Persia AsIt Is, which was published in 1887. (Wills was a doctor who spent fifteen years inIran between 1866 and 1881.) He considered all dervishes as mendicants whotold stories, had marvellous memories, possessed the arts of the ventriloquist andthe mimic and were mesmerists and conjurors. Moreover,Dervishes have all the vices of the Persians.

Browne, the British orientalist about whom thereis much to be said in Chapter 5. At this point, however, it is worthwhile to referto his A Year Amongst the Persians,127which is an account of the year he spent in Iranbetween 1887 and 1888 and in which there are many references to Sufism. In thiswork Browne often recorded the anecdotes told to him by Iranians, and one suchepisode reveals, perhaps, a stereotype and caricature of a certain form of Sufi.Browne was told that a poor man was travelling alone in a desert when he saw aterrible looking dervish coming towards him, carrying “an enormous and pon-derous club”. The poor man climbed a tree to get out of the path of the dervishwho decided to sit beneath the shade of the very same tree. The dervish set outfive clay figures before him and addressed the first as ‘Omar, the second Caliphrecognised by the Sunnis and rejected by the Shi‘ites for usurping the rights of ‘Alito guide the Muslim community. The dervish asked the clay figure why he hadnot recognised ‘Ali’s rights, and of course there was silence in response to thequestion. Angry at this the dervish smashed the figure with his club.

Atthis juncture, the poor man, still hiding in the tree, lost his fear of the dervish andangrily objected in a loud voice at the smashing of Mohammad and ‘Ali andwarned the dervish that God’s wrath would smite him.

The poor man came downfrom the tree and discovered that the cloak of the dervish concealed a hiddentreasure of golden coins.128This anecdote pokes fun at the wandering dervishes, who are commonly asso-ciated with poverty but who were also viewed by many of their non-Sufi contem-poraries as avaricious, money-seeking hypocrites. Yet as a caricature it reveals anantinomian dimension of Sufism that the “orthodox” considered reprehensible.Browne’sA Year Amongst the Persiansis littered with references to dervishes that hemet, yet despite his favourable opinion of the Sufis, his following remarks about adervish that he chanced to meet betray the sentiments of Iranians themselves:He was one of those dervishes who inspire one with respect for a namewhich serves but too often to shelter idleness, sloth, and even vice. Toooften is it the case that the traveller, judging only by the opium-eating,hashish smoking mendicant, who, with matted hair, glassy eyes, andharsh, raucous voice, importunes the passers by for alms, condemns alldervishes as a blemish and a bane to their country.129The opinions of Western scholars concerning the glories of Iranian civilisationand history (which included the Sufi tradition) became significant in the 1920sand 1930s because of the activities of an organisation named Sazman-e Anjoman-eMelli(Society for National Heritage). This was an organisation that was formedin 1921 around a nucleus of some of the leading academics and politicians of theday, including Mohammad ‘Ali Forughi, ‘Ali Asghar Hekmat, ‘Isa Sadiq, ‘Abd al-Hosayn Taymurtash (the court minister) and Hasan Pirnia (a former prime min-ister). The organisation’s aim was to “preserve, protect and promote Iran’spatrimony”,130and in its attempt to achieve this end, Western academics wereinvited to Iran to offer their opinions about the importance of Iranian heritage.The German archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld was invited to Iran in 1925, as was theAmerican art historian Arthur Upham Pope. Pope’s lecture in 1925 was heard bythe power-brokers in Iran, including Reza Khan who was soon to become primeminister. In the course of his speech, Pope praised Persian poetry, indicating thatthe voices of Ferdowsi, Sa‘di, Hafez and Khayyam stirred hearts everywhere.Although the Sufi nature of some of these poets was to be questioned by Kasravi,his general point that the Western academics praised Persian poetry (much of itSufi) remains valid.

It is perhaps worthwhile noting the extent to whichforeign opinions on Iranian culture and civilisation were considered in this period,in an attempt to recultivate “good taste”. In 1934 the Congress of Orientalistswas held in Iran to celebrate the millennium of Ferdowsi, and many Westernscholars were invited to attend and participate. In addition to presenting theirpapers, trips were arranged to Tus (where Ferdowsi’s grave is located), and onroute the visitors were taken through Nishapur, where the grave of Khayyam canbe found. The story of the trip is recounted by ‘Isa Sadiq who described the pleas-ure of the Middle East specialists when they approached Khayyam’s tomb. Someof them read Khayyam’s verses in Persian, and Sir Denison Ross recitedFitzgerald’s versions aloud. One of the visitors began to weep because of theemotion and passion of the occasion, and the other guests followed suit.131It islikely that Kasravi would have heard of this episode, especially since he was amember of the Congress of Orientalists,132and he must have been bemused onhearing these events that celebrated a poet whose verses he detested and whomwas not generally considered by most Iranians to be a great poet until Fitzgeraldhad published his translations.133The SufisIncreasing calls for modernisation from 1850 until the rise of Reza Shah includedthe accountability of the royal court and regulation of the political processthrough more open suffrage, equality, justice and greater efficiency in thebureaucracy. In essence, the demands for modernisation were appeals for greaterparticipation within an orderly system. Furthermore, the reformism advocatedby individuals such as Akhundzadeh in the late nineteenth century and ‘Ali Dashtiof the twentieth century was a form of modernism that included the demys-tification of religious beliefs. Order, discipline and control of religion weremajor elements defining the rule of Reza Shah that transformed Iranian societyand culture dramatically.134Reza Shah’s form of modernisation was onethat was imposed from the top down, and therefore the democratic aspect ofmodernity was not accorded much importance. Potential threats were dealt withaccordingly, including religious (whether Sufi or jurist), so that the clericalauthorities, although not completely ignoring the challenge of the Sufi tradition,had to focus their energies elsewhere in their attempts to preserve and promotetheir interests in Iran.135Likewise, the Sufis had to respond to the challenge ofmodernity, which predates the emergence of Reza Shah, for as we have seen, thecriticisms of Sufism from the intellectuals appeared towards the end of thenineteenth century.This section presents a case study that will highlight how one of the Sufi tradi-tions in Iran responded to these new circumstances (a task that has been madeeasier due to the publication of informative pieces of work in English in recentyears).136The focus of attention will be directed to the Safi‘alishahis, one of theOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195033"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"largest of the Ne‘matollahi groups of Sufis.137The Safi‘alishahis have beenselected as a case study for a number of reasons: first, their fame and relativenumerical strength in Iran; second, because their response to the changing timesoffers a contrast to the stereotypical portrayal offered by the critics of Kasravi’silk; and finally because there is a substantial quantity of literature (both primaryand secondary) with which to work.The Safi‘alishahis: an aristocratic order searching for Sufi universalism?One of the most celebrated Sufis of the late nineteenth century was Safi ‘Ali Shah(d. 1898) who was a disciple of the Ne‘matollahi sheikh, Rahmat ‘Ali Shah(d. 1861), and then Monavvar ‘Ali Shah until he severed his connections with thelatter. In 1877 he created the nucleus of what was to become a separate line ofNe‘matollahi Sufism, which was eventually institutionalised by royal decree in1899 in the form of an organisation known as the Society of Brotherhood(Anjuman-e Okhovvat), see Figure 2.1.The Ne‘matollahis were well known for their aristocratic connections, andsome of Safi ‘Ali Shah’s poetry would have done nothing to quell the resentmentof those who disliked the corruption and nepotism of the royal court. Safi ‘AliShah’s works include sycophantic praise of the fourth Qajar monarch, Naser al-Din Shah, who was unfortunate to live at a time when Iran was caught betweenthe two superpowers of the age (Russia and Britain). These two nations preventedeach other from gaining the upper hand in Iran, thereby preventing Iran fromachieving significant socio-economic development. Although there were someattempts at social reform and modernisation, the reign of Naser al-Din Shah isnot usually known for its freedom,138and the weakness of the central governmentwas partly attributable to the extravagances of the royal court (including expen-sive royal tours in Europe), the non-remittance of taxes from the provinces andOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195034Safi ‘Ali Shah (d. 1899)Zahir al-Dowleh (d. 1924)Binesh ‘Ali Shah (d. 1932)Dr Isma‘il Marzban, Amin al-Molk (leader of the Consultancy Council)Figure 2.1The Safi‘alishahis and the Society of Brotherhood Leaders."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"the granting of monopolies to European companies. Despite this, Safi ‘Ali Shah saidthat in forty years of rule, (the Shah) had made Iran flourish just as if there had beenforty world-experienced, wise, perfect and just monarchs.139Moreover, he describedthe Shah’s royal court as just, and Iran was referred to as enjoying such security thateven small children could carry gold and jewels from one city to another, whereasin previous times thieves and villains abounded.140The charges of nepotism andsycophancy would have been all the more stronger in light of the gift of land madeto Safi ‘Ali Shah by Mohammad Mirza Sayf al-Dowleh (who was the son of ‘Azdal-Dowleh, one of the sons of the second Qajar monarch, Fath ‘Ali Shah) so that akhanaqahcould be built for Safi in Tehran.141The relationship of the Safi’alishahis with the Iranian aristocracy needs furtherinvestigation because these Sufis claimed that their form of Sufism addressed theproblems of Iran’s hierarchical social structure. Given the increasing demands forwidening participation within social institutions, the claims made by Safi ‘Ali Shahand his successors may be regarded as a self-conscious attempt to respond to theforces of modernity.142The Safi‘alishahi order became structured through theSociety of Brotherhood, and its leaders stressed the “brotherhood” of its mem-bers regardless of rank and status; yet despite this, the aristocratic connections ofthe organisation persisted well into the Pahlavi dynasty.143Safi ‘Ali Shah’s successor was ‘Ali Khan Qajar who came from an aristocraticfamily and whose father was a minister of state and had twice been the governorof Shiraz.144‘Ali Khan Qajar also had a distinguished career at court as he wasmade minister of public ceremonies by Naser al-Din Shah, received the honorifictitle of Zahir al-Dowleh, was also given the Shah’s daughter in marriage and wasgovernor of Gilan, Hamadan, Kermanshah and Tehran. Zahir al-Dowleh (whoseSufi names were Safa ‘Ali Shah and Mesbah al-Valayat(lamp of friendship)) wasable to extend the patronage of the highest echelons of court society to Sufism,and he achieved this through the creation of the Society of Brotherhood.Sympathetic sources claim that Safi ‘Ali Shah had desired to create this societyhimself,145but it was Zahir al-Dowleh who founded the Society of Brotherhood,to which end he received royal assent in 1899.The names of the leading members of the Society of Brotherhood in its form-ative years under Zahir al-Dowleh betray its aristocratic leanings,146as do its con-nections with the latter Qajar monarchy. These connections included an interestexpressed by Ahmad Shah (the last monarch of the Qajar dynasty, deposed in1925) who sent the crown prince, Mohammad Hasan Mirza, to the Society’s basein Tehran. It is claimed that he was even initiated as a dervish in 1911, on theoccasion of the twelfth anniversary of the Society’s establishment. On this occa-sion, Zahir al-Dowleh was able to stress the principle of equality of its members,claiming that, “it was the Society of Brotherhood that smashed the face of thearrogant ones, and made the contemporary leaders and the sons of the rulers ofthe age sit on their knees with the poor (foqara’) and tradespeople”.147These idealsreflect Zahir al-Dowleh’s support of the Constitutionalist Movement, and indeed,as an aristocratic supporter of Constitutionalism he was subject to intimidationOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195035"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"from Mohammad ‘Ali Shah. The aristocratic tag and the connections withmonarchy persisted despite the demise of the Qajar dynasty and the death ofZahir al-Dowleh. Indeed, the cordial relationship between the Society ofBrotherhood and the Pahlavi dynasty may have been based upon the positionenjoyed by Zahir al-Dowleh’s successor Binesh ‘Ali Shah (or Seyyed MohammadKhan Entezam al-Saltaneh), who served as Reza Shah’s director general in theInterior Ministry.148In addition, Binesh ‘Ali Shah’s son, who a member of theSociety, was a friend of Reza Shah’s son from 1936.149It seems unlikely that the Safi‘alishahis encouraged universalism and the con-nections with the aristocracy for their own mercenary purposes. There are suffi-cient indications that leaders of the movement were genuine in their efforts toeradicate social distinctions. For example Safi ‘Ali Shah’s attempt to presentSufism as a spiritual and ethical reformist movement is revealed in an endeavourto spread his message beyond aristocratic circles. His versified Persian interpreta-tion (tafsir) of the Qur’an (Tafsir-e Manzum)150was written to render the Qur’an(and its mystical meanings) intelligible to all literate Farsi speakers.151(This musthave been regarded as a threat by some of the Shi‘ite clerics who viewed them-selves as the legitimate interpreters of the Qur’an, and some may also have beenrepelled at this “tampering” with the divine word. The controversy over this tafsirreached as far as Naser al-Din Shah who was tempted to exile Safi ‘Ali Shah fromTehran but was persuaded to refer the case to the leading Shi‘ite cleric, AyatollahShirazi, whose fatva decided in favour of Safi’s work.) Zahir al-Dowleh was alsocommitted to eradicating social distinctions and his slogan and that of the Societyof “brotherhood, equality and service to the people” is reflected in his pro-con-stitutional activities, which resulted in the anti-constitutionalist monarchMohammad ‘Ali Shah destroying his house in Tehran (which also served as thehead-quarters of the Society of Brotherhood). Subsequently, Zahir al-Dowlehorganised charitable activities called the Festival of Charity in the summer of1909 to raise funds for the families of those killed and wounded in the constitu-tional struggles. He was able to “invite” senior state officials to these events whichlasted for about two weeks, and many of them donated large sums of money tohelp. Donators included the minister of war, the interior minister, the prince ‘Aynal-Dowleh and Qavam al-Dowleh.152The Anjuman-e Okhovvat: a modernist Sufi organisation?The emergence of a well-organised society (which had a register, a constitution,a system of financial accountability, chairs to sit on (instead of sitting on acarpet))153with Sufi ethical ideals at this time should not be surprising for aplethora of secret societies with socio-political agendas appeared on the death ofNaser al-Din Shah. The development of Society of Brotherhood is an interestingcase, however, because it demonstrates how Sufism could operate within a societythat was increasingly turning to modern and Western models of organisationswith socio-political agendas.OPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195036"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The modernising tendency was initiated by Safi ‘Ali Shah, although it is notalways easy to distinguish between the trappings of modernity with elementsalready existent within Sufi life-styles. For example, Safi ‘Ali Shah’s attempts to“cleanse” Sufism included his advise to Zahir al-Dowleh to wear normal clothesand his order that no one should remain idle without a job or profession (a rejec-tion perhaps of the life-style of the wandering dervishes).154Yet this advise has acertain resonance with the Malamati Sufi tradition of the mediaeval period, a tra-dition that attempted to conceal outward manifestations of piety and spiritualityin order to avoid the pitfalls of pride and reputation. Safi ‘Ali Shah’s viewsreflected, perhaps, the mushrooming of individuals claiming overarching spiritualauthority, as he commented that “in Tehran the morshedsof poverty are greater (innumber) than professional and craft masters”.155(Safi ‘Ali Shah also discussed agroup of “Sufis” who were opposed to the Imams, but they merely wore Suficlothing and were “wolves” in sheepskins. Such individuals not only made use ofSufism (also claiming to perform “charismatic powers”), but their kind were alsofound among the ulema, and it is on this point that Safi ‘Ali Shah stated that heviewed no incompatibility between those who follow the shari‘atand those whofollow the haqiqat.156)Some of the trappings of Western culture, which have been associated withmodernity, were embraced by the Safi’alishahis, and this is nowhere more evidentthan in the charity raising events of Zahir al-Dowleh in 1909. During these eventsthe guests were entertained with a Western-style orchestra, a lottery, and werenourished with “expensive” food (it is assumed that the proceeds of these eventswere used for charity),157and there were stalls selling books and haberdasherygoods.158These features, the Western-style orchestra and, in particular, the lot-tery159indicate that this “quasi-tariqa”160was comfortable with new modes ofactivity, and perhaps more significantly, it felt at ease in promoting an ethical code,which some Iranians viewed as a Western import and also un-Islamic.161A feature that should not be ignored in this discussion of the Anjoman-e Okhovvatis the presence of women. It seems likely that the wife of Zahir al-Dowleh,Malakeh-ye Iran, the daughter of Naser al-Din Shah, shared her husband’s mys-tical inclinations, and indeed, she is shown in a photograph with her two daugh-ters in dervish costume, carrying the Sufi axe and begging bowl. Of more interestis that the ladies are virtually bareheaded.162While it could be argued that thisphotograph of bareheaded ladies was intended for private viewing and did notnecessarily reflect the “modernising” tendency of female liberation from the hejab,it is significant that Malakeh-ye Iran used to go to the meetings of the Anjoman-eOkhovvatunveiled, and moreover, she used to address the members of the orderwhich included both men and women.163Another remarkable episode surround-ing Malakeh-ye Iran was that she composed a song that became popular and wassung by both men and women.164While it was not unheard of that femalescomposed poetry and songs, in general in Qajar Iran, the composition of poetrywas a male domain and it was considered shameful for females to expose, or“unveil” themselves in this literary fashion.165OPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195037"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The modernising tendencies of the Society of Brotherhood are also evident in itspublications. Based in Tehran, the Majmu‘eh-ye Akhlaq(“Magazine of Morals”) waspublished from 1905 and continued to print in total eighteen issues which containedcontributions in verse and prose from Zahir al-Dowleh.166This magazine of eightpages discussed ethical issues, mainly written by Mirza Ibrahim Khan (the Deputyfor Isfahan in the Second National Assembly), and according to Browne it “pro-fessedly avoids political and religious matters”.167(Zahir al-Dowleh was also instru-mental in founding a weekly paper in Hamadan, called ‘Adl-e Mozaffarand thenchanged its name to Ekbatana.)168Another member of the Society of Brotherhood,Hajji Dadash, established a branch in Kermanshah, and from there he publisheda journal (The Magazine of Brotherhood) which “explored current, worldly affairsand in many cases related them to patriotic or nationalist themes”.169One of the major issues that plagued the Sufis of the late Qajar and earlyPahalvi period concerned qotbiyyat, or spiritual leadership, which demanded ulti-mate allegiance to a spiritual master, the position of which was often earnedthrough hereditary succession. Discussions and conflict surrounding qotbiyyatwerepresent in the major Sufi orders of Iran during the period in question,170and dis-putes over succession frequently led to an ever increasing splintering of theorders. The Safi‘alishahis suffered this problem as much as other orders, as fourindividuals claimed to be the exclusive successor to Safi ‘Ali Shah,171and Binesh‘Ali Shah (the successor of Zahir al-Dowleh) was also opposed by Vafa ‘Ali Shah(d. 1949) (who Kasravi claimed was a disciple of Safi ‘Ali Shah) and Hajji Dadash.It was perhaps a result of the Society’s ideal of equality, combined with a self-con-scious recognition of the damage that the squabbles over qotbshiphad on publicperceptions of Sufism, and the increasing awareness of equality within othersocial institutions (Iranian or otherwise) that Binesh ‘Ali Shah, as vice-presidentof the Society of Brotherhood’s Consultancy Council, decided to abandon thetradition of appointing a successor and qotb. Indeed, during his own lifetime theleader of the Consultancy Council was more of a first among equals (perhapstaking the ideal of brotherhood and equality of the Society to its ultimateconclusion), standing in contrast to the charismatic, authoritarian guide, whichwas the traditional Sufi model. Although the Society remained without a qotb,itwas agreed that Sufi sheikhs could be appointed by the Consultancy Council forthe spiritual guidance of the Sufis.172Although the organisation seems to have been comfortable with the trappingsof modernity, this did not mean that it jettisoned its Sufi heritage both in terms ofritual and belief. The life and writings of Safi ‘Ali Shah manifest elements of theSufi tradition that anti-Sufis and modernists criticise as irrational and incompati-ble with the modern age. For example, his writings contain stories in which hebelieves that he heard a guiding, divine voice,173that Ne‘matollah Vali appearedin his heart and acted as his host during a pilgrimage to the saints tomb inMahan174and that he was miraculously saved from drowning in a river (the waterof which rose dramatically, caused by divine wrath for Safi’s intention to drinkwine) by his sheikh’s brother.175Critics of Sufism, such as Kasravi, would alsoOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195038"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"have disliked Safi’s espousal of the unity of existence (vahdat-e vojud) which iscommonly associated with Ibn ‘Arabi (d. 1265) and has been understood by itsopponents as a monistic or pantheistic worldview.176Yet Safi ‘Ali Shah was also critical of elements of the “Sufi” tradition in Iran,perhaps a reflection of the splintering of the Ne‘matollahi order, and the abusethat Sufism has always suffered at the hands of the unscrupulous. Indeed, his fol-lowing comments could easily have been written by Kasravi a generation later:Some make claims to qotbiyyatin their writings and they boast of ‘I andno other’, contrary to [the practice of] famous and unknown [masters].And some others claim perfection through the subjugation [of nature],alchemy, summoning spirits, talismans, the [mystical] wisdom of lettersand words, the exorcism of evil spirits, and zekrrecital in [their attempts]to curry favour or cause separation, and some others speak aboutdervish-hood by reciting litanies and reading the treatises of past masterssuch as the Masnavi177and the Fosus178without learning the science ofSufism from its adherents, and they deny the recognised or unrecognisedgnostic of their time.And some others invent unknown things in mentioning the circum-stances of their contemporaries, and in each gathering they say that wewere assembled together in so and so a time, in so and so a party, withso and so, and this and that took place.They always talk of these things with reference to the dead or thosewho are absent, but not to those worthy who are present.179Under Zahir al-Dowleh the Society of Brotherhood maintained a traditionalSufi perspective, typified in his six principles for membership: respecting God’scommands, compassion for God’s creatures, serving the people of God (the fellowSufis), devoting oneself to God’s path, concealing the mystery of God and obedi-ence to the friend (vali) of God, which for Zahir al-Dowleh meant Safi ‘AliShah.180Moreover it is possible to see within Zahir al-Dowleh’s ideas an attrac-tion to a mystical dimension of letters; thus he spelt out that the real meaning ofdervish (which in Persian is composed of the letters d, r, v, i, and sh) in the fol-lowing fashion: the ‘d’ in dervish represents dorosti(correctness), the ‘r’ is symbolicofrasti(honesty), ‘v’ stands for vahdat va yeganegi(unity and oneness), ‘i’ representsyaqin-e kamel(utter certainty) and ‘sh’ is for shokr dar asayesh va sakhti(gratitude inboth comfort and in adversity).181In addition, Zahir al-Dowleh opened theSociety of Brotherhood with 110 members, a number which has the very samenumerical value of the sum of numbers contained in the letters ayn,lamandye,which spell ‘Ali. It is not clear whether this was designed with the intention ofreceiving some mystical blessing or whether it was purely symbolic and had moreto do with asserting the identity of the society.The society met weekly on Thursday evenings, and distinctly religious activitiesalso took place during the months of Moharram, Safar and Ramadan when theOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195039"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"members observed lamentations and recited religious poems in its khanaqah.Moreover, the Society celebrated the births of Mohammad and ‘Ali and thelatter’s appointment as the prophet’s successor at Ghaderr182, and each yearduring the month of Farvadin the Society held the Festival of Flowers duringwhich special songs were composed and played by the orchestra.183Yet the Sufism of Zahir al-Dowleh has a very different taste from the moreecstatic form contained within his master’s writings, and it would seem that theSociety of Brotherhood served as an extension of Zahir al-Dowleh’s political andSufi perspectives. Afshar claims that as governor of Hamadan he was known as asupporter of the Constitutionalists and a friend of the people and that such opin-ions spilled over into the Society of Brotherhood,184and Safa’i observes that formany years people had imagined that dervishes conditioned their body, abstainedfrom work, wore patched and dirty clothes, adopted seclusion as a way of life andsometimes begged. For Safa’i, the greatness of Zahir al-Dowleh was that he usedmysticism to serve society and brought the spiritual and Sufi teachings out of thekhanaqahand took them to the centres of society in order to awaken people’s mindsand improve their ethics and make them aware of the concept of freedom.185The Society of Brotherhood was particularly concerned with worldly mattersand ethics, and this is reflected in its constitution (written by Zahir al-Dowleh)which does not mention any kind of mystical vision and only refers to God oncein the context of not performing ugly acts since God is everywhere and witnesseseverything. The mention of Sufi ritual practice is also very brief, with passing ref-erence to the observance of reciting zekrand litanies. Instead, the constitution ismore concerned with external behaviour, the general tenor being an exceedinglysober manifestation of Sufism. It rejects the kind of Sufis who beg for a living orelse rely on the charity of others: “The pinnacle of honour is when (Sufis) earn aliving through their own labour and effort.” Interestingly too, the constitutionstates that it is impermissible to “insult the ulemaof the holy law, rather one shouldexpress amity (mavaddat) because the kernel requires a skin, and the body needsclothes”.186The stress on ethics was continued after Zahir al-Dowleh, as itsleaders were people who did not “pretend to spiritual unveiling and vision, andneither like the other shaykhsof the path, to supernatural things”.187Zahir al-Dowleh’s poetry reflects the concerns of Sufism and its aim of servingGod, and union with him on the one hand with humanistic ethics on the other.The latter is typified in a poem contained in Varedatin which he protests at thepractice of grain hoarding, something of which he had first-hand knowledge asgovernor of Hamadan, when he threatened to resign unless he was given theauthority to take appropriate action to make the hoarders sell at a reasonableprice. Having assembled a large mass of angry and hungry people, he instigatedthem to march on the stocks, and the grain was subsequently sold at reasonableprices:188If we have a Shah he is building up a store of grainIf we have a minister he is a thief and despises humanityOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195040"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"All the princes drink the people’s blood...What is their sorrow if the poor are all dead?Neither the full person has any mercy for the hungryNor the prince has any sympathy for the poor.You see a dead person in every roadFrozen to death from cold and hunger.There is much food everywhere,In the kitchens, stores and shopsBut there is no pity in heartsThat they could show mercy for people in this state...We must go and smash the storesOpen them up and eat, there is no other choice.189His Sufi poetry, however, is traditional in describing complete devotion to animmanent God;Listen to a short account about the people of the path,Listen to a secret of theirs, in truth.A path has sprouted from the heart and soulAnd from all places they have turned to God.They are strangers to everyone, they are people of the heart –Unaware of themselves and united to the Truth (be-haqq vasel-and)–There is nothing except trust (in God) for themThere is nothing except poverty in their thoughts.They are in the stage of traversing the pathThey have amassed gnosis, in truth.The path-revealer is on the way to annihilation (fana)The masters of honour are [leaning] on the throne of subsistence (baqa).190In this survey a wide variety of opinions related to Sufism have been described,ranging from outright rejection to sympathy and ardent support. By the time thatKasravi commenced his criticisms of Sufism in the 1930s, the nature of Sufism inIran had changed dramatically from its mediaeval or even its nineteenth-centurymanifestations. Kasravi himself admitted this in his Sufigari, for he claims in theintroduction that Sufism no longer has the power to attract individuals torenounce their worldly possessions and leave for the khanaqahor adopt a wander-ing life-style. Life in Iran during the 1930s and after would certainly not have per-mitted such a life-style; certainly, the centralising reforms of Reza Shah would nothave tolerated the kind of antinomian Sufi activity that is commonly associatedwith groups such as the Qalandar. Indeed Kasravi notes that one of Reza Shah’saccomplishments was the eradication of the Sufis in public: “He cleansed themarkets and streets from the filth of the mollas and the dervishes.”191Yet as hasbeen shown, some groups of Sufis had adopted the kind of world-view of whichOPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195041"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Kasravi would have approved, including performing acts of charity, working forone’s livelihood and marrying and having children.

Since much of Iran’sliterary heritage is of a mystical nature, Sufism became one of the topics that wasa cause of intense debate. One of the intriguing points in this debate is the lackof information concerning Reza Shah’s position on Sufism,194although the opin-ions and policies of Hekmat and Forughi in promoting Sufi literature served hispolicy of fostering a sense of national glory in Iran. While Kasravi shared the aimof establishing a modern nation-state in Iran, he was concerned that Iranians didnot possess the requisite mentality to achieve this and, in particular, he pin-pointed the hegemonic Sufi world-view that was enforced by a rich literature thatdated back over a thousand years. As already noted, many scholars, both Iranianand otherwise, have noted the influence of Sufi literature, and its power has beensummarised by de Bruijn who commented, “Classical Persian literature...up tothe present century, continued to be the most conspicuous element of the Persiancultural identity.”195It was with this that Kasravi wished to engage in battle, as heconsidered it a threat to the nation-state of Iran.OPINIONS OF SUFISM IN IRAN, 1850–195042"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Figure 2.2Safi ‘Ali Shah."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Figure 2.3Zahir al-Dowleh in dervish clothing."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"3SCOURGE OF THE SUFISKasravi’s rejection of Persian mysticismIntroductionIn the previous chapter the diverse opinions of Sufism that exited in Iran in thelate nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were examined, and even thoughthere was no uniform or systematic opposition to the Sufis there was commonground between some clerics, intellectuals and even some Sufis who opposed themore antinomian aspects of the Sufi tradition. The most virulent opposition toSufism, however, came from the pen of Ahmad Kasravi, in particular his workSufigari(“Sufism”). This anti-Sufi work was the result of Kasravi’s despair for aweak and disintegrating Iran, a process that he had witnessed ever since theperiod of the Constitutional Revolution. In addition to this, Kasravi’s own under-standing of modernism and his “rational” theology most surely contributed to histirades against Sufism. In contrast to Kasravi’s polemical discourse there werereformers in Islamic lands who regarded Sufism as one of the components thatcould be utilised for the creation of a nation-state. Two good examples of this areZiya Gökalp, from the Ottoman-Turkish context, and Mohammad Iqbal, theIndian intellectual.This chapter will present the nationalist context in which Kasravi formulatedhis ideas about Sufism, and following this, his work Sufigariwill be examined andthen contrasted with the views of his contemporaries, Gökalp and Iqbal.Although Gökalp and Iqbal lived in contexts different from those of Kasravi, bothAnatolia and British India were experiencing political and social difficulties whichperhaps were on a par with the problems that existed in Kasravi’s Iran; therefore,the aim of strengthening the nation remained the same, and the conflicting viewsof these three scholars on Sufism reinforce the view that imagining nationalism isan exercise in myth-making.Kasravi and Iranian NationalismThe rich cultural diversity of Iran is manifested in the composition of its peoplesthat include the Azaris of the north-east, the Gilanis of the central-northernregion where Iran meets the Caspian Sea, the Turkomans of the north-east, the45"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Baluchis of the south-east, Arabs of the south-west, Lurs of the west and Kurdsof the west and north-west. All of these groups have their own language, althoughlinguistic differentiation has been mitigated by the commonality of bi-lingualism(the uniting language being Farsi (or Persian)). These regional, linguistic and eth-nic groups are separated from each other by natural geographical features, and itis pertinent to speculate on the possibility that the inhabitants of the Iranian ter-ritorial periphery might share greater cultural affinity with their neighbours onthe other side of the Iranian border than with the centre in Tehran. In this lightone wonders what it is that binds Iranian society together (if indeed one acceptsthat it is bound together).Hopes of Iranian unity were weak in the aftermath of the First World War,when Iran became embroiled in entanglements with the Soviet Union and Britaindue to its strategic importance. Foreign exploitation of regional grievances againstthe central authorities in Tehran exacerbated local uprisings into articulate move-ments demanding autonomy. Thus, strong regionalist demands (including landdistribution and the assembling of provincial councils) emerged from the provi-sional branch of the Democrat Party in Azarbayjan under Sheikh MohammadKhiyabani.1In Gilan too, the Jangali movement under Mirza Kuchek Khancalled for administrative autonomy, and the movement made an alliance withSoviet forces (that had landed in Iran in 1920) which resulted in the proclamationof the Gilan Republic and the formation of the Communist Party of Iran. In thenorth-east of Iran, Colonel Mohammad Taqi Khan Paysan formed a revolution-ary committee with local Democrats to establish a provincial government ofKhorasan with its own National Army.2National disintegration also seemed to bea possibility in the south too, as there were rumours that the British intended toseparate the oil-rich region of Khuzestan (which was becoming known as the“emirate of the Arabs”3) from Iran and invest power in the local chief, SheikhKhaz‘al.4These regional movements with their demands for autonomy or increasedparticipation within the Iranian structures of power failed for a variety of reasons,and regionalism was laid to rest (temporarily, at least) by Reza Shah. Nevertheless,these examples reveal just how immanent was the danger of foreign interventionand the consequence of national disintegration. It is in this context that Kasraviwrote in 1942, “Our younger intellectuals cannot possibly understand, and thuscannot possibly judge the reign of Reza Shah. They cannot because they were tooyoung to remember the chaotic and desperate conditions out of which arose theautocrat named Reza Shah.”5Kasravi was not the only Iranian of his generation to be vexed about the lackof unity within Iran. Another example expressing this concern is found in thewritings of Hosayn Kazemzadeh, who published the newspaper IranshahrfromBerlin between 1922 and 1927. In an article on “Religion and Nationality” withinIranshahr, the author wrote, “the problem of communalism is so serious thatwhenever an Iranian travelling abroad is asked his nationality, he will give hislocality – not the proud name of his country”.6SCOURGE OF THE SUFIS46"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"As a nationalist, Kasravi was not a great theoretician, and Abrahamian hasremarked that he did not compose a single detailed, analytical work on the topicof nationalism in which the structures that shape perceptions of the nation, suchas political will and consent, language, culture and origins could have been dis-cussed.7Instead, there are comments scattered throughout his oeuvre such as thefollowing, which appears to endorse a nationalism based on self-determination:Nationalism is when twenty million people who live in a single countrymake an agreement among themselves to co-operate and support oneanother in [all] circumstances. If someone from Kerman or fromKhuzestan is injured then the people from Azarbayjan and Gilan and allthe others should assist him. And if a problem arises in Khorasan, thenthe people of Mazandaran, Gilan and all the others should rush to help.Everyone should see this country as his own house, and they should joinhands and attempt to make it flourish.8In Kasravi’s opinion, regionalism was not the only reason for the weakness of theIranian nation, for religious sectarianism (even within individual cities)9had alsocontributed to this problem, which existed prior to the appearance of Westernpowers in the Middle East, but who worked at this fissure to promote their hege-mony over the region. Kasravi claimed to be a first-hand witness of such religioussectarianism and he offers the examples of Sunni–Shi‘ite hatred10andNe‘mati–Haydari communal conflicts that were common between the sixteenthand nineteenth centuries.11Kasravi did not believe that religion was necessarily an obstacle to the progressof the nation, although he viewed the contemporary understandings of Islam(throughout the whole of the Islamic world) as having deviated from the essenceof Islam and religion. Unadulterated religion was composed of six elements: theworld has a creator, God; the world is orderly and operates through God’s laws;human beings are God’s chosen and select creation; good and evil exist in theworld, and humans must strive to overcome evil; humans possess the faculty ofreason by which they are able to discern right from wrong; there is another lifeafter existence in this world.12These six points mirror Kasravi’s understanding ofthe beliefs that Mohammad taught during his prophetic career; yet this representsonly half of the prophetic message which also included a political dimension (thecreation of a state in the name of Islam, laws, taxes, fighting the infidel and striv-ing to advance Islam).13Kasravi argued that the dimensions of belief and politicsno longer existed in the twentieth century in a symbiotic fashion, for the dimen-sion of belief had been perverted by erroneous teachings and the political unityof Islam had long vanished; indeed, Western advances had made the singleIslamic state a remote dream. In these circumstances, Kasravi remarked thatsome Muslims had attempted reform by stating their desire to return to theessence of Islam, and he cites the example of the Wahhabis, who are well knownfor their anti-Sufi and anti-Shi‘ite views. (Indeed, Kasravi regarded the SunniSCOURGE OF THE SUFIS47"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Muslims as being “less corrupt” than other Muslim groups,14and he observedthat the Wahhabi Sunnis “are the best group among Muslims”15.) However, heremarked that this aim of re-capturing the essence of Islam was doomed to fail-ure because the circumstances of the contemporary age are so different fromthose of Mohammad’s time, and it is implied that the political dimension ofMohammad’s Islam must be jettisoned and replaced with a system more suitedfor the modern age.16It is not surprising that many Shi‘ites found Kasravi’s views so problematic,especially when he commented, “The Moslems’ claim that Islam was the last reli-gion is a baseless statement and is incompatible with God’s law and progress.”17This statement is not so startling as it appears at first glance, especially whenKasravi’s understanding of religion (the six principles mentioned earlier) is con-sidered. The “Islam” included in the above quotation refers to a reified versionthat includes “traditional” rituals and its political heritage rather than the“rational” version that Kasravi elaborated in his pak-dini(or pure religion).18Thisform of religion can be viewed as a process theology that responds to the chang-ing circumstances of history and allows for flexibility, and indeed, Kasravi did notconsider it an abrogation of Islam:Pakdini is a replacement for Islam; it is what follows it. In essence andfoundation, there is no difference. The differences lie in the pathand some of its bases. And this must be so. This has been the will of Godand this is His law.19The religion that Kasravi envisaged was one in which God’s active presencewas removed from the world and forms of contact with the divine, such as thatclaimed by the Sufis or the claims of representation by the mojtahedsfor theTwelfth Imam, were denied. In effect, Kasravi was very much a Deist, and hisunderstanding of religion, although universalist, did not necessarily negate thedevelopment of the nation-state. Despite his claim of the congruency ofpak-diniwith Islam, Kasravi was criticised for proclaiming a new religion, with himself asthe new prophet. In addition to this, his criticisms of Shi‘ism20resulted in hisbeing charged with “slandering Islam”, and during his trial he was assassinated bymembers of a radical Shi‘ite group, the Feda’iyan-e Islam.Aside from trying to reform Islam, Kasravi made strenuous attempts to providea basis that could unite the peoples of Iran. One of the major elements was thereform of the Persian language, an issue which had occupied the minds of manyintellectuals prior to Kasravi. Mirza Malkam Khan (1833–1908) had suggestedthe use of a brand new alphabet to replace the Arabic alphabet in which severalof the letters have the same sound when pronounced by a Persian,21andJamalzadeh had satirised the inability of Persians to communicate with oneanother in his short story “Persian is Sugar” (published in 1921) because of theirinclinations to Arabic words or European expressions or because of their regionaldialects. Under Reza Shah the movement to “Persianise” Farsi became serious,SCOURGE OF THE SUFIS48"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"perhaps inspired by similar nationalist movements in the Middle East, includingTurkey (where in 1928 the Arabic script was abolished in favour of a Latin alpha-bet). The official “Persianisation” of the language was promoted by the PersianLanguage Academy which had been established in the 1930s to remove unneces-sary words of non-Persian origin. This policy enjoyed the support of a wide crosssection of intellectuals, ranging from Kasravi to the novelist Sadeq Hedayat,whose interest in ancient Iranian languages may have contributed to his promo-tion of modern Persian. (Indeed, Hedayat was indignant at the AzarbayjaniDemocrat Party’s attempts to replace Persian with Turkish after the Second WorldWar.22) Kasravi’s independent “reform” of the Persian language was undertakenthrough his publications, and his use of extremely obscure Persian words at theexpense of easily recognised Arabic or Turkish equivalents necessitated the inclu-sion of glossaries at the back of his pamphlets and articles. The difficulty ofunderstanding Kasravi’s writings and some of the flaws in his aims for languagereform were succinctly expressed by the Persian scholar Ehsan Yarshater:In order to understand his writings in the newspaper Parchamone musthave a special dictionary to look up word after word. And what isperplexing is that a rationalist scholar like Kasravi, fired up with zeal forPersian-worship and Arabic-purging, remained unaware of the funda-mental point that language is the instrument of comprehension, not anarena for innovation.23(After Kasravi’s assassination a dictionary of his obscure Persian words waspublished, which in itself is indicative of his failure in the reform of the Persianlanguage.24) Some of his alternatives for non-Persian words are quaint andunderstandable, such as using bashandeganinstead ofmawjudat, while others areunfathomable without an explanation, such as sat, meaning pages (instead of themore usual sahfeh).Reform of the language is extremely important in this analysis of the emerg-ing Iranian nationalism because of the religious associations embodied withinArabic words. To remove such words and replace them with Persian equivalentsis an additional step in the transformation of Islam. For example, prayers arerecited by Muslims in Arabic, since the prayer is composed of various verses fromthe Arabic Qur’an, God’s word. If a Persian speaker performed his or her prayersin Persian, it is possible that the perceived “spirituality” of such ritual activitywould have been severely diminished by the demystification of language.Likewise, the linguistic reforms advocated by Kasravi would have divorcedIranians from much of their rich literary heritage, especially the mystical litera-ture, such as Rumi’sMasnaviand many others. However, given Kasravi’s negativeattitude towards Sufism, this may well have been one of the un-stated aims in hisdesire to reform the language.Through his writings on religion and language it is clear that Kasravi’s ultimateconcern is the defence of Iran, and encompassed within both of these spheres ofSCOURGE OF THE SUFIS49"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"religion and language lies the Iranian mystical tradition, in particular, Sufism. Thefollowing will focus upon Kasravi’s criticisms of Sufism and at the same time offeralternative views of Sufism that were elaborated by his contemporaries to showthat elements of Sufism could have been utilised to bolster the message of nation-alism, that is to say, progress in the modern nation-state does not necessarily haveto be hampered by belief in, or sympathy for, Sufism.Kasravi’s criticisms of the SufisThe most substantial work that Kasravi published on Sufism is an essay of someeighty pages that first appeared in 1943–4 entitled Sufigari(“Sufism”). The essayconsists of an introduction and eight chapters: the origins of Sufism, the evilsattributable to Sufism, Sufism’s evil conduct with Islam, Sufism has been nothingbut a source of the spirit’s weakness, the Sufis have not had the least fear in lying,how the Iranians were vanquished by the Mongols, the benefits gained by theSufis from the Mongol episode and the truths that one can find in Plotinus’s dis-courses. Following on from these 80 pages and 8 chapters there are 15 exceedinglyshort footnotes and no bibliography.Kasravi commences his essay by claiming that Sufism had not been eliminatedwith the onset of modernity; instead, Sufism (and therefore its evil teachings) wasthriving. Moreover, these evil teachings had been absorbed unnoticed by theIranians into their culture, especially through literature. Second, Kasravi arguedthat modernity, or modern knowledge, was unable to defeat Sufism. He claimedthat modern knowledge and Sufism had weakened each other; Sufism was weak-ened in the respect that knowledge no longer permitted the individual Sufi to bea “wanderer of the world” but restricted him as an “armchair” Sufi. Knowledgewas weakened in the respect that Sufism acted as an antidote to the harmfuleffects of knowledge; as for Kasravi, knowledge was twinned with materialism.He implied that modern knowledge had reached a pinnacle in Western Europeand also Communist Russia; yet even so, Christianity had not been destroyed inthese places, implying perhaps that Christianity survived because it served tolighten the darkness and prevalence of materialism. Kasravi’s real targets here arethose sympathetic to “materialism”, namely the Marxist group associated withTaqi Arani. He also ridicules the views of an opposing group (but recognisable asa reflection of the views of Mohammad ‘Ali Forughi) which maintains that Sufismcan serve to remedy the evils that materialism has in society.Third, and perhaps more controversially, Kasravi believed that the Westernpowers utilised Iranian Sufism in their political aims of maintaining a weak Iran.He accused Western orientalists of editing classical Persian Sufi texts anddistributing them in Iran in conjunction with the Iranian Ministry of Culture.It is in the first of the points mentioned here, Sufi evil teachings that receivedmost attention in Sufigari. However, Kasravi’s criticisms consist merely of gener-alisations that have been made by the opponents of Sufism over the centuries,and his main points will be analysed in depth later in this chapter. One of theSCOURGE OF THE SUFIS50"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"weaknesses of the second point centres on Kasravi’s linkage of Sufism withChristianity, because the two are not alike. Christianity has had its own mysticaltradition which has been viewed in a very suspect fashion by the more “orthodox”Christian establishment, and the survival of Christianity may have nothing to dowith the characteristics and circumstances that have enabled mystical Islam tosurvive, despite the growth of “modern knowledge”. The third point also lackssubstantiation, and its venom seems to have been directed at a Persian edition of‘Attar’sMemoirs of the Saints, produced by R.A. Nicholson25who has not beennoted for the form of orientalism that depicts the “other” as lazy, irrational orinferior. Kasravi’s criticisms of European orientalists are scattered in his workson literature and Sufism, and his criticisms of E.G. Browne are detailed inChapter 5.Despite the flaws in his arguments, Kasravi’s criticisms of Sufism meritattention because they represent an interesting reaction of an Iranian modernistto Iran’s mystical heritage. This section focuses on the issues raised by Kasravi’sfirst point, the evil teachings of the Sufis, simply because this focus on the evilteachings by far predominates in Kasravi’s text. Although it is the “evil teachings”of the Sufis that dominates the whole of the text, Kasravi attempted to guardhimself from accusations of making gross generalisations by qualifying his criti-cisms on a few occasions. Thus he claims that not all Sufis have been bone-idleand parasitic, as some leading Sufis taught their disciples about the necessity ofearning one’s own living, and in addition, he states that not all “Sufis have beenevil, and sometimes some of them were merely content in sincere purity, and theprevention of lust and selfishness”.26Yet, he concludes that such Sufis have beenfew and, taken all together, Sufism has been a calamity for Iran.27The unity of existenceKasravi’s first complaint about the Sufis concerns the doctrine ofvahdat-e vojud,commonly translated as the unity of existence and associated with Ibn ‘Arabi(1165–1240) and his school of mystical thought. Kasravi criticises this Sufi schoolfor claiming a relationship with God that borders on pure monism, and heincludes celebrated mystics of the mediaeval period such as Najm al-Din Raziand Jalal al-Din Rumi among its proponents. He indicates that this school is aliveand well even in the twentieth century, typified by the activities and discourses ofthe Indian mystic, Mehr Baba.28Kasravi summarises a number of theologicalproblems associated with the unity of existence. His first question is that ifhumans are all “of God” (az khoda) and will ultimately return to him, then whatis the need for human effort on earth in following the divine injunctions broughtby the prophets? Kasravi’s second complaint is that followers of this school ofSufism have belittled the significance of humanity, the noblest of God’s creation,by linking the idea of the unity of existence with beasts and animals. The thirdproblem raised is that followers of the unity of existence hold this world in con-tempt, and therefore they abstain from worldly pleasures. For Kasravi, this isSCOURGE OF THE SUFIS51"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"incompatible with their belief that all creation is somehow “of God”. If Godcreated or manifested the world and humans share in its or his existence, thenwhy should anything be held in contempt?29The unity of existence has aroused controversy within Islam since it was artic-ulated in a coherent fashion in the medieval period of Islamic history.30Theologians, jurists and Sufis themselves have all at one time or another opposedthe common perception of what Ibn ‘Arabi is supposed to have said. Indeed, evenin the modern age, the unity of existence has been the subject of debate,31epito-mised by the writings of the distinguished Pakistani scholar Fazlur Rahman whoechoed Kasravi’s own criticisms when he described Ibn ‘Arabi as “thoroughlymonistic” and his world-view as a form of “polytheism”32which “produces afatalism that could not fail to numb the moral faculties”33. Yet a close examina-tion of Ibn ‘Arabi’s works reveals that the unity of existence has its basis not indivine immanence or presence within the individual, as Kasravi supposed. Ibn‘Arabi’s world-view has been the subject of much scholarly activity in recent years,and a consensus has emerged that the essence of the school of unity of existenceis neatly summarised by Ibn ‘Arabi’s expression “He/not He”.34This reflects theQur’anic explanation that in some respects man resembles God, since the Qur’anstates that God “blew of His spirit” into man.35Yet the Qur’an also confirms that“nothing is like Him”.36Thus the unity of existence both affirms and denies theidea of the divine human, and for this reason it is incumbent for Muslims to fol-low the guidance offered by the prophets and to strive for perfection rather thanadopting a fatalistic perspective.Kasravi’s second criticism of the unity of existence, that it belittles humansby encompassing wild beasts and animals, is a gross simplification and mis-representation ofvojudithought. Many Sufis of this school portrayed man as thegreatest of God’s creation, as the perfect man functions as a mirror in which it is pos-sible to witness God’s attributes. Animals too manifest certain of God’s attributes, butthey cannot be compared to the comprehensive nature of man who is able to reflectthe fullness of the divine, although in a condensed and summarised fashion.The third criticism of the vojudischool, namely abstaining from this-worldlypleasures, is also a mis-representation of Ibn ‘Arabi’s thought. The task for vojudiSufis is to recognise the reality of each and every thing, which means under-standing its position in the world in relation to the divine, and to derive pleasurefrom it accordingly. The ultimate manifestation of the divine according to Ibn‘Arabi was during sexual union because it imitates God’s relationship with man.Ibn ‘Arabi perceived triplicity inherent in all things in the cosmos.37Sexual union is that which, by the joining of two parts, produces a third,and thereby imitates God’s creative act of “breathing” into the form ofman to create him in His own image.38In other words, Sufis may, with some legitimacy, enjoy worldly pleasures so longas the spiritual realities inherent within them are recognised.SCOURGE OF THE SUFIS52"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Sufi idlenessThe second major criticism of Sufism offered by Kasravi concerns their allegedidleness. He complains of their practice of remaining in the khanaqahand yet stillacquiring a source of livelihood (usually by begging). Indeed Kasravi considersbegging a great evil and refuses to contemplate the benefits that Sufis claim thispractice has in taming the ego, or soul, and rendering it humble. He offers severalexamples from the classical Sufi tradition, in particular from the biography of thetenth-century Persian Sufi, Abu Sa‘id Abi’l-Khayr, to illustrate his case.39Yet throughout his work, he is very selective with his citations. One can findnumerous cases in Persian mystical literature in which the necessity of working fora living and earning one’s own daily bread is a pre-requisite of the Sufi path.40Sufi idleness was instrumental in fostering additional sins, according to Kasravi.Apart from begging in their attempt to secure their livelihood, the Sufis alsoresorted to fabricating lies and claiming that they were able to perform supernat-ural feats such as walking on water or flying through the air. Since they were ableto exercise considerable influence among the uneducated masses through claimsof such powers, the Sufis were able to exert a significant hold upon the imagina-tion of the people and therefore, they were a potent political force with which tobe reckoned. Their “lies” extended into the political realm, for Kasravi arguedthat the Sufis were political opportunists in the respect that they claimed to havethe power to make a person king or to bring calamities upon those who opposedthem. The brevity of Kasravi’s text probably limited him in providing examplesof this, but he offers the case of Abu Sa‘id Abi’l-Khayr who is said to have “given”Khorasan and Iraq to Toghril and Chagri, leaders of the Seljuq Turks whodefeated the Ghaznavid Sultan, Ma‘sud,41and he also cites the contemporaryexample of the Indian spiritualist Mehr Baba (mentioned earlier), who claimedthat he was instrumental in the advent of Reza Khan to the throne of Iran.42Political opportunism also resulted in the Sufis praising political leaders ofdubious spiritual qualities, such as the Sufi poet who lauds the justice of TimurShah43(who is more commonly known for his tyranny). Kasravi could have pro-vided more contemporary examples, especially episodes taken from the Zahabiorder. The thirty-sixth leader of the Zahabis, Jalal al-Din (d. 1913), received thetitle of “Majd al-Ashraf ” (d. 1913) from Naser al-Din Shah, and he subsequentlydedicated his Resaleh-ye Mozaffariyehwritten in 1899 to Mozaffar al-Din Shah.44Areflection of continued Zahabi loyalty to the royal court is evident in their sup-port for the Qajars during the Constitutional Revolution, a loyalty that is perhapsattributable to the Qajars’ recognition of Zahabi custodianship of the importantshrine of Shah Cheragh in Shiraz.Another form of Sufi lying was the adoption of the prevailing, popular mani-festations of Islam at any given time. Kasravi claimed that the Sufis did not reallyhave a religion at all45, and this contributed to their adaptability. In his own words:[The Sufis] have gone along with the faith of the people wherever theyhave been. In Iran they became Shi‘ite, and they linked themselves withSCOURGE OF THE SUFIS53"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"‘Ali Ibn Abi Taleb, and in the Ottoman empire they were Sunni and theytraced their selselehback to Abu Bakr.46Kasravi’s arguments are unsubstantiated. There is no proof that the Sufis have“gone with the faith of the people”, for it is just as easy to argue that the “peoplehave gone with the faith of the Sufis”. Kasravi’s argument is vague because hedoes not say when the Iranians became Shi‘ite. Since he mentions the Ottomanempire in the same sentence, it could be speculated that he believed the wholesaleadoption of Shi‘ism in Iran occurred at the beginning of the sixteenth centurywhen Isma‘il declared Twelver Shi‘ism as the religion of Safavid state. Modernscholarship has indicated that Isma‘il’s inclination to Shi‘ism may reflect theabsorption of Shi‘ism into the religious traditions of many Iranian communities,especially those which adhered to a form of Folk Islam.47It seems that in thefifteenth century, “the intermingling of Sufism with Shi‘ism in the light of a re-achieved Islamic unity, in accordance with the attempt to return to a kind of reli-gious pluralism...was a constant factor in Muslim society at that time”.48TheShi‘ite nature of the Kobraviyyeh and Nurbakhshiyyeh orders is well-attestedprior to the Safavid period. And the Safavids themselves had shown Shi‘ite ten-dencies several generations before they came to power. Kasravi’s claim that theSufis became Shi‘ite because it was the faith of the people, therefore has noground. The Sufis were such a major component of pre-Safavid society that it isincorrect to consider them a separate category outside of “the people”. In light ofthe above, it is difficult to regard the movement by some Sufi orders to a Shi‘iteaffiliation as being politically motivated. Yet in fairness to Kasravi it must also bestated that there were some Sunni-based orders that became Shi‘ite-inspiredorders, for S.H. Nasr has affirmed that the Ne‘matullahi and Qadiri becameShi‘ite during the Safavid period.49Kasravi offered another example of Sufi lies, caused by their desire to conformwith society. He claimed that during Iran’s Constitutional Revolution, Sufis’other-worldliness was criticised by the people, and therefore the Sufis changedtheir attitudes and cited sayings of ‘Ali to the effect that it was necessary tobecome involved in worldly matters.50Indeed, some Sufis were actively involvedin political affairs during the Constitutional Revolution, most noteworthy ofattention was the Society of Brotherhood, discussed in the previous chapter.Moreover, during the Constitutional period, Ne‘matullahi Sufis offered support tothe Constitutionalists and even gave refuge to sympathisers.51Kasravi’s criticismsof the Sufis on this point are weak because he fails to mention that in the courseof the nineteenth century the Iranians as a whole were becoming more educatedand aware of concepts such as democracy and constitutionalism. This being thecase, it was only natural for Sufis as well to become more engaged in socio-politicalstruggles of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Moreover, as a “historianwell-versed in history” (to use Khomeini’s description),52Kasravi should also havebeen aware of Sufis’ increasing socio-political activity resulting from vigourousEuropean imperialism. For example, one can point to the resistance of ShamelSCOURGE OF THE SUFIS54"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"and the Chechens against Russian imperialism during the 1840s–50s, and againby the Naqshebandis in Central Asia during the 1890s, again the Naqshebandisin 1925 against Turkish secular reforms, and the Sufis of the Mahdi movement inSudan during the 1880s.In his second major criticism of Sufism, Kasravi wants to argue that the Sufisare idle, and at the same time he castigates those who are active in politics asbeing motivated merely by social pressure. It would seem that whatever socialstance the Sufis adopted would have been subject to Kasravi’s criticism, suggest-ing that he had a pre-conceived conclusion in mind. In addition, his rejection ofthe Sufi “lies” of performing miracles or supernatural feats was based on his read-ing of the Qur’an as he refers to the Qur’an which repeatedly states thatMohammad does not perform miracles, as the only miracle is indeed the Qur’anitself. Kasravi is correct in the respect that the Qur’an does not depict the Prophetof Islam as a miracle worker, yet there are several Qur’anic verses which do por-tray breaks in the laws of nature, demonstrating his selective reading of the text.For example, the Qur’an describes the miracles of other prophets, and also theaction of God through Mohammad, such as in sura8:17, which states, “You[Mohammad] did not slay, but God slew them, and when you threw it was notyou but God.” The Qur’an also speaks of God’s direct intervention into thisworld, thus breaking the laws of nature when he sends down sakinah(or tranquil-lity) on the hearts of the faithful (48:4, 48:17, 48:26). A literal reading of theQur’an (as I.R. Netton has argued in his Qur’anic Creator Paradigm)53indicatesthat God does indeed act in the world, and Kasravi’s failure to acknowledge thisis surprising given that he claimed to be a hafez.54But modernity and its rejectionof the miraculous persuaded “rationalists” like Kasravi to jettison both miraclesand God from the world.Celibacy and sodomyThe third criticism centres on the Sufi practice, according to Kasravi, of celibacyor not taking a wife.55The sin of not marrying, according to Kasravi, is badenough, since men who have chosen a single life deprive women of the opportu-nity to marry, yet worse was the Sufi “practice” of paedophilia and sodomy. Heoffers examples from Sufi literature such as the famous story of Fakhr al-Din‘Eraqi (d. 1289) who wandered off to India, following a Qalandar youth. Kasravialso inserts the story taken from Jami’sNafahat al-Onsof the occasion whenShams-e Tabrizi asked Rumi for his son. Kasravi deplores this as an example ofthe debauch nature of Sufism, perhaps ignorant of the didactic elements withinhagiographic literature. The point, spelt out by Jami in the original text cited byKasravi, was not that Shams desired Rumi’s son, but that it was a test of Rumi’sobedience to a spiritual master.56Kasravi’s criticisms ignore the possibility thatstories taken from hagiographies do not necessarily reflect historical truth, as suchliterature functions in a variety of ways, one of which is the didactic; an effectivemethod of conveying a teaching is by shocking the reader out of prejudices andSCOURGE OF THE SUFIS55"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"pre-conceived ideas. Such a method can be found in other religious traditions too(e.g. the Zen Buddhist koanoperates in a similar fashion57). Another effectivemethod of education is entertainment which exists in a symbiotic manner withthe didactic element of the hagiography. Just as in our own age the cinemafunctions on the basis of a “suspension of disbelief ” so too Sufi hagiographiesmay have worked in a similar way. Of course for some Muslims hagiographieswere perceived in a literal fashion and may even have contained elements ofhistorical truth. Yet Schimmel’s remarks about Persian poetry apply equally wellto the genre of the hagiography:It seems futile, therefore, to look for either a purely mystical or a purelyprofane interpretation of the poems of Hafiz, Jami or ‘Iraqi – theirambiguity is intended, the oscillation between the two levels isconsciously maintained...One cannot derive a mystical system out ofPersian or Turkish poetry or see in it an expression of experience to betaken at face value.58Rejection of this world and despising lifeWith the Sufi rejection of worldly life, Kasravi claimed that the Sufis were infactcontradicting their doctrine of the unity of existence. Moreover, he argued thatinteriorising such a negative attitude to the world resulted in a certain noncha-lance and laziness among Iranians and permitted successive waves of invaders tooccupy Iran. Such an argument is of course unsubstantiated and little more thana gross generalisation. Kasravi argues that by the time of the Mongol invasions inthe thirteenth century, Sufism had spread across the Islamic world includingEgypt, Syria and Asia Minor59and that this was the reason for the sweepingMongol victories in the Islamic heartlands. He is quick to blame Sufism for theIranian defeat, but he remained silent concerning the Mongol defeat at ‘Ayn Jalutin Palestine in 1260 by the Mamluk army from Egypt, where Sufism was alsothriving. (During the thirteenth century Cairo had many khanaqahs60andproduced several eminent Sufis who advocated ideas of a vojudinature, includingIbn Farid.61)‘EshqThe application of the word ‘eshq, or passionate love, was problematic for themediaeval theologians because it implies a physical love, which of course isimpossible for the incorporeal divinity. Kasravi went beyond the discourses of thetheologians concerning ‘eshqand focused upon the devotional Sufi practices, suchas the sama‘, or listening to Sufi music and dancing in ecstasy. In Kasravi’s ownwords: “They played the lute and flute, stamped their feet, clapped their hands,spun and jumped around in such a way that they foamed at the mouth, becamedizzy and fell over.”62Moreover, the sama‘was performed by the Sufis not due toSCOURGE OF THE SUFIS56"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"their love for God, but rather “most of them witnessed either a beautiful youth orwoman, and danced in memory of him or her”.63Although there may be someelement of truth in Kasravi’s remarks, one should not forget that many Sufis wereprobably genuine in their devotional activities and also spoke of exercisingextreme caution when practising the sama‘. It was frequently the case that thedervishes were advised to perform the sama‘when the common people were notpresent, at a suitable time and when permission had been given by the spiritualmaster. One should not forget either the beneficial sociological consequences ofthe so-called commoners participating in the sama‘. Through a combination ofentertainment, devotional practice and ritual performance, the sama‘served as atool in the integration of society.The Sufis’ irrationalityIn Kasravi’s previous criticisms there is ample “evidence” of Sufi “irrationality”such as the contradictions within the theory of the unity of existence, Sufi lying,Sufi idleness, etc., so that it is not necessary to discuss this last criticism any further.Kasravi, Gökalp and Iqbal, and the relationship between Sufism and nationalismMany of Kasravi’s criticisms of Sufism are not so much important for their content,since they had been propagated at an earlier date by other Muslims,64but theirsignificance lies in the whole-hearted rejection of Sufism by a modern reformer,who claimed that there was no difference in the essence and foundation ofIslamwith the reforms he desired and set forth in his pak dini.65Such a whole-heartedrejection of Sufism can be found within the Iranian tradition of some Shi‘ite cler-ics and the secular intelligentsia, but Kasravi was a representative of the Iranianmodernists who were outside the seminary but still wished to preserve a religiousand perhaps an “Islamic” perspective and who at the same time repudiated Iran’smystical legacy. The influence of modern European rational thought and evenpositivism helps explain Kasravi’s attitude towards Sufism. For Kasravi, mod-ernism meant the rule of science and reason. It was an acceptance of natural lawas opposed to a mediaeval form of occasionalism, and natural laws entailed livingin the world, getting married and having children, an appreciation of the divineas something remote about which man can say very little (in contrast to the schoolof the unity of existence and the ineffable “experiences” of the Sufis). Moreover,the positivism that developed in nineteenth-century Europe argued for the devel-opment, progress and survival of the fittest societies and nation-states through science and reason (although Kasravi rejected materialist and Darwinianworld-views).Nationalism was a predominant theme in the writings of Turkish intellectualswriting within the Ottoman empire in the late nineteenth and early twentiethcenturies. Of particular interest are the works of Ziya Gökalp because heSCOURGE OF THE SUFIS57"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"provided a framework for reform in which Sufism would play an active andpositive role. Gökalp’s views on Sufism have been studied in relative detail else-where,66so a summary of his views will suffice to provide a contrast with those ofKasravi. Gökalp’s main aim was to promote Turkism, perhaps in response to thechallenges of the European powers and also from the more aggressive demandsof the various nationalities within the Ottoman empire who were voicing theirown demands, such as the Christians in the Levant who were seeking independ-ence from Istanbul, and also from Muslims such as the Syrian Kawakibi(1849–1902) who agitated for an Arab Caliphate. Gökalp’s solution for thedecline of the Ottoman empire was to build national solidarity by emphasisingnative and “authentic” Turkish culture with appropriate elements of civilisation(which included Islam). He believed that the Turkish people possessed their ownform of religion, distinct from that of the “High Islam” of the Ottoman state, andso he promoted the “Turkish” form of Islam. His proposals for Islamic reforminclude five main points which are linked with Sufism.First, the form of religion of which Gökalp approved included rituals such ascommunal prayers because they promoted social solidarity. Moreover, individualties to society were strengthened through Sufi rituals of a communal nature, suchas the zekr. Gökalp also discussed “negative” Sufi rituals which were those thatassisted in overcoming egoistic inclinations (which of course, have a detrimentaleffect on society). There are a few individuals, “great heroes”, who provide rolemodels in the performance of such negative rituals for the general masses. Theseheroes spend their time in fasting, renunciation, poverty and respond to humiliationand insult with compassion and kindness. The only hero that Gökalp cites in thiscontext is Ibrahim Adham, one of the celebrated Sufis of the eighth century. Suchindividuals are not of course the norm, but they serve as models for those who areweak in will, who strengthen their own morale by seeing what miracles anintensified will is capable of performing.Second, Gökalp’s attachment to Sufism as a manifestation of Turkish culture isalso apparent in his approval of the mystical poetry of the fourteenth-centurypoet Yunus Emre who in the words of Schimmel “transformed his Turkishmother tongue into a vehicle for mystical expression; he left Turkey a treasure ofhis simple, deep-felt, touchingly memorable poems, which are still known todayby school children”.67Gökalp held that such literature should be promoted notmerely because it was written in Turkish rather than Arabic or Persian, butbecause its recital is “an expression of the aestheticism in the practice of their [theTurkish people] religion”.68Linked with this is his appreciation of Jalal al-Din Rumi among his Turkish “heroes”.69The third factor that contributed to the usefulness of Sufism for Gökalp wasthat it was more compatible with “authentic” Turkish culture than the civilisationbrought with “High Islam”. He saw similarities in the pre-Islamic Turkish sky-god(who did not have the power to punish and whom the Turks loved and regardedas beautiful), with a kind of Islam free from ascetic and fanatic practices, and heassociates the poetry of Emre with this kind of Islam which maintains a strongSCOURGE OF THE SUFIS58"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"and sincere piety. Another example of this type of Islam is to be found in thetekkes, or Sufi institutions.70Fourth, if Sufism reflects the “authentic” culture of a nation, on occasions itcan provide the inspiration to resist the restrictions imposed upon it by “religiousand political imperialisms”. Gökalp cites the example of the Toscan Albanianswho had dissented from the Muslim community by accepting the Sufism of theBektashis order.71The last reason for Gökalp’s endorsement of Sufism is his opinion that themystical world-view of Ibn ‘Arabi contained everything that modern Westernphilosophy had to offer. In other words, Muslims do not have to feel intellectuallyashamed and inferior vis-à-visthe West. Gökalp argued that Ibn ‘Arabi portrayedthree stages of mystical “reality”,72the first of which is where the Sufi regardsphenomenal existence as an “idea” or “imaginal”. At the next stage the Sufirealised that these ideas are shaped by the perceiver, as explained in the aphorismof Jonayd: “The colour of the water is the colour of the container.” At the thirdstage, the mystic perceives and constructs those ideas or perfections which oughtto exist; in other words, the mystic is able to comprehend what Ibn ‘Arabi calls the“immutable entities” or in other words, knowledge of things as they really are.The significance of this is that the individual who has reached this stage will knowthe best way to reform or reconstruct society. These three stages, according toGökalp, correspond to the philosophical trinity of Berkeley–Kant–Nietzche in theWest. Gökalp’s linkage of Ibn ‘Arabi’s world-view with that of the modern Westhas been termed an “eccentric interpretation [which] is surely not a dispassionateenquiry into comparative philosophy”.73Nevertheless, what is significant is hisattempt to find positive elements in the Sufi heritage, to built on the foundationsof the past, thus by-pass the alienation that the Turks might have felt in endorsinga host of half-understood European philosophical and cultural constructs.Moreover, Gökalp’s understanding of Ibn ‘Arabi’s world-view indicates a greatersensitivity to the subtleties of the doctrine of the Unity of Being than thatcontained within Kasravi’s works. Gökalp held that anyone who believed Ibn‘Arabi’s thought was pantheistic was “mistaken”, since the “Absolute One” cannever be reached, although humans attempt to “approach” the Absolute One,which causes them to reach a “believed-in god”. And eternal essences are nothingother than the manifestation of the believed-in god.74Gökalp’s vision of a reformed Islam that includes a strong element of Sufismis contained in an article attributed to him in which he proposes a new system forreligious institutions within the Ottoman empire. He envisaged a centralisedreligious institution under the Sheikh al-Islam to administer spiritual affairs, orthose matters pertaining to piety, similar in function to the Vatican in Rome. Thisestablishment, called the Mashikat, would be responsible for appointments to andadministration ofmosques,madrasasand the Sufi tariqas. Moreover, specialisedschools would be established to provide the staff for these institutions. The tariqaswere to be a “social institution in accordance with their original aims” andthetekkeswould be transformed into “genuine educational institutions”.75SCOURGE OF THE SUFIS59"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Thus Sufism was included within Gökalp’s view of the Turkish nation, althoughthere is no convincing proof that he did so because of his inclination towardsmystical Islam. His main aim was the strengthening of the Turkish nation, andthe structures and heritage offered by the Sufis could be utilised to this end.The Indian context provides another perspective on how Sufism was under-stood in relation to the nation-state. Of particular interest in this respect are thewritings of Mohammad Iqbal (1876–1938), who perceived that the position ofMuslims in India was being threatened by a Hindu majority. His Reconstruction ofReligious Thought in Islam, published in 1934, addresses the problem of howMuslims could be modern, and in this he rejected Western conceptions of nation-alism and the mediaeval form of Sufism. Iqbal disapproved of the nationalism ofthe West which he believed nurtured ruthless egos and uncontrollable hunger thatalienate the individual from himself. He claimsboth nationalism and atheistic socialism,76at least in the present state ofhuman adjustments, must draw upon the psychological forces of hate,suspicion, and resentment which tend to impoverish the soul of man andclose up his hidden sources of spiritual energy.77Similar results had emerged in the Muslim world as a result of mediaeval mysti-cism, for it had advocated a “false renunciation” which had duped Muslims tolook to Western ideologies for a cure:No wonder then that the modern Muslim in Turkey, Egypt, and Persiais led to seek fresh sources of energy in the creation of new loyalties, suchas patriotism and nationalism which Nietzsche described as “sicknessand unreason”, and the “strongest force against culture.”78And he composed the following on Ataturk’s “Godless nationalism”:The morningbreeze is still in search of a garden/Ill lodged in Ataturk, the soul of the east is still in search ofa body.79Both mediaeval mysticism and modern nationalism then led to alien-ation: “neither the technique of mediaeval mysticism nor nationalism nor atheisticsocialism can cure the ills of a despairing humanity”.80Iqbal’s concept of an authentic nationalism contained two main elements.First he was concerned with the condition of Islam in India, and this led him in1930 to declare his support for a single state for the diverse Muslims in India,despite their varied languages and cultures. This, he believed, would be thestart of a process that would ultimately transcend local nationalism amongMuslims and result in the ideal nation; a universal nation of Muslims,81the cre-ation of which could be assisted by an assembly of religious scholars “to protect,expand and if necessary to reinterpret the laws of Islam in the light of modernconditions”.82SCOURGE OF THE SUFIS60"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"His writings reveal that he believed certain forms of Sufism were detrimentalin the formation of the ideal nation:Tasawwufis always the sign of decline of a nation. Greek mysticism,Persian mysticism, Indian mysticism – all are signs of decline of thesenations; the same is true of Islamic mysticism...Any philosophy orreligious teaching that prevents the blossoming of the human personal-ity is worthless.83It seems unlikely that Iqbal meant all forms of Sufism in the above quote, as hisworks identify various schools of mystical Islamic thought. His ambivalence toSufism was a recurrent theme in his works, and perhaps his clearest treatment ofthis appears in his The Development of Metaphysics in Persiain which there is a three-fold classification of Sufism. The first group is “essentially monotheistic and con-sequentially more semitic in character”, and their main characteristic is “piety,unworldliness and an intense longing for God” which leads such Sufis “not tophilosophise but principally to work out a certain ideal of life”. It is action thatdefines this group.84The second group is identifiable through its “Pantheism”,which holds that the world is a reflection of God’s beauty, the realisation of whichthe “innate Zoroastrian instinct of the Persian Sufi loved to define as “the SacredFire which burns everything other than God”. The “characteristic feature” of thisschool, then, is of “impersonal absorption”, and it became “wildly pantheistic”.85The third group in contrast to the second posits a difference between man andGod, since Reality is Light or Thought, “the very nature of which demands some-thing to be thought or illuminated”.86It is the second school of “Pantheistic Sufism” that comes in for Iqbal’s harsh-est criticism, and perhaps the most striking example appears in his poem of 1915,Asrar-e khudi(“Secrets of the Self ”). In this work, Iqbal compares the Arabs tofierce tigers who are victorious over the Persians, or the sheep. The tigers’ natureenables them to conquer the sheep at first, but a cunning sheep convinces themthat real honour lies in sacrificing the self and that life is unstable through theexercise of power.87(The triumph of the sheep, paradoxically, could have been anargument for the compatibility of Sufism with nationalism; however, this wassurely not the message that Iqbal wished to convey.)The reason for his dislike of Pantheistic Sufism was that Iqbal believed itopposed the development of the self, which he held to be ultimately finite. Thegreatest ontological human state for Iqbal was one where individuality was notlost through pantheistic absorption, for this would entail a loss of uniqueness andself-possession. Such a personality would survive under the greatest of trials:Even the scene of “Universal Destruction” preceding the Day ofJudgement cannot affect the perfect calm of a full grown ego: “And thereshall be a blast on the trumpet, and all who are in the Heavens and allwho are in the Earth shall faint away,save those in whose case God willsotherwise.” [39:69].88SCOURGE OF THE SUFIS61"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Iqbal cites approvingly a Persian verse that speaks of Mohammad witnessing thedivine Essence and maintaining his consciousness, and this, he says, is “perfectmanhood”, a view that “Pantheistic Sufism obviously cannot favour”. Iqbal’sargument focuses upon the nature of the intensity and extensity of infinitude. “Itsnature [the Infinite] consists in intensity. The moment we fix our gaze on inten-sity, we begin to see that the finite ego must be distinct, though not isolated, from theInfinite.”89Another problem associated with Pantheistic Sufism was that although Iqbalrecognised that Sufism in general had a positive element in its encouragement offreethinking (and therefore was in accordance with rationalism), it placed toomuch emphasis on the baten, that is the reality of things, at the expense of thezaher, or appearance. He believed that included within the zahersphere was theIslamic imperative of social polity which had been weakened because of Sufiother-worldliness and its preference for the batenthat had attracted the best mindsthat the Muslim world had produced. And as a result the Muslim state was left inthe hands of “intellectual mediocrities” and the uneducated masses blindly fol-lowed the legal schools of Islam.90The Sufi emphasis on the batenat the expenseof the social polity is best illustrated in the words of one ‘Abd al-Quddus ofGangoh, repeated by Iqbal in The Reconstruction: “Muhammad of Arabia ascendedthe highest Heaven and returned. I swear by God that if I had reached that point,I should never have returned.”91As suggested earlier, Iqbal admitted that there were positive dimensions toSufism. It has already been noted that he believed Sufism attracted the best mindsbecause of its freethinking and its close affinity to rationalism, attributes that hesought in his reconstruction of Islamic thought. Moreover he speaks of a “higherSufism in Islam” which is distinguished by a unitive experience in which the finiteego does not efface its own identity “by some sort of absorption into the InfiniteEgo; it is rather the Infinite passing into the loving embrace of the finite”.92This“higher Sufism” is actually an endorsement of the position advocated by Ibn‘Arabi and the vojudischool, namely “he/not He”, (compare this with Iqbal’s“distinct/though not isolated”, described before). He does not mention Ibn ‘Arabi byname; however, in his work of 1908, The Development of Metaphysics in Persia, Iqbalparaphrases the views of al-Jili (d.c. 1408–17) (who he acknowledges was greatlyinfluenced by Ibn ‘Arabi’s teachings), and this summary mirrors the“distinct/though not isolated” conclusion. The highest spiritual stage a man canreach is that of the perfect man, whose “Higher Knowledge...is not seen by theindividual as something separate from and heterogeneous to himself ”.93And Iqbalgoes on to state that this experience of the “god-man” is not permanent, for if ithad been then a “great moral force would have been lost and society overturned”.Although Iqbal’s view of Sufism is not completely flawless, (the inclusion ofthinkers such as Hafez and Ibn ‘Arabi among the pantheists is somewhat simplistic),his understanding of Sufism is more sophisticated than that of Kasravi.Sufism does not necessarily have to hinder the advancement of the nation-state, and this was all too clearly argued by Gökalp and Iqbal. The former wasSCOURGE OF THE SUFIS62"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"more concerned with Sufi ritual and heritage in providing Turks with a sense ofidentity and belonging; that is to say, it was an integral and valued element ofTurkish culture. Sufism, as a form of spiritual renewal (in a conventional sense),played a significantly lesser role in Gökalp’s writings than in the philosophy andpoetry of Iqbal. The reform of Islam and Sufism for Iqbal starts with individualexistence, and so the emphasis is upon metaphysics rather than culture. Hisattempt to distinguish a “true” Sufism as opposed to a “false” Sufism permittedhim to criticise many elements of the Sufi heritage and as a result his perspectiveof Sufism as a whole shares more in common with that of Kasravi than Gökalp’s.Both Iqbal and Kasravi are concerned with the detrimental effects that Sufismhas had on society, but Kasravi’s criticisms are harsher, and he states that Sufismwas also an excuse for those who “opt out” and choose an easy life. Kasravi’sarguments are very loose generalisations, however, his text is worthy of note asit demonstrates the existence of a certain trend in Iran during the first half ofthe twentieth century, in which a re-interpretation of religion is regarded as apre-requisite to the improvement of Iran. Such a re-interpretation, for Kasravi,involved stripping away many elements that composed Iranian identity andculture, including mystical poetry. If Kasravi’s aim in writing Sufigariwas topersuade the Iranian populace to abandon its mystical heritage then it can besafely said that it was a dismal failure. The populism in Sufigariyielded a distortedimage of Iranian mystical Islam, which is a major component of Iranian identity,as Kasravi and others have correctly observed.SCOURGE OF THE SUFIS63"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Figure 3.1Portrayal of a Sufi on the cover of a Qajar era Divan-e Hafez, reproducedcourtesy of the Trustees of the Chester Beatty Library, Dublin (Per. 389)."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"4“SUFISM”Ahmad KasraviIntroductionMany readers know that we have taken a stand and made efforts over the pasteleven years, in fighting against all the erroneous paths and ignorance that existin Iran and other places. Sufism is among the worst of these erroneous paths. Itspread a thousand years ago, sinking roots with which we have also engaged inbattle. At first we occasionally wrote about Sufism in the discussions in Payman1andParcham2. Then last year we published a booklet of all my speeches, printedunder the title Sufism. Because the copies of this were few in number, we areprinting it again with additions and other changes.Sufism has been interpreted in the book [Sufism], and whatever was worthyof discussion concerning its lack of foundation and its harmfulness has alreadybeen outlined. But there are several things that must be presented in thisintroduction.1 People say, “The Sufis are a small group and they are scattered here and there,and it is not worthwhile for anyone to bother with them.”But this a crude opinion because the Sufis are not few in number. Rather thereare many. They have organisations now in several Iranian cities including Tehran,Maragheh, Gonabad, Mashhad and Shiraz. Sufis are not just those dervishes withfelt hats and hair-plaits, nor are they merely those dirty, polluted masters andthose beggars who carry an axe or a begging bowl. There are thousands of otherswithout hats and hair-plaits, and there are dervishes without axes and beggingbowls whose minds are blemished with Sufi evil teachings.Among the state employees and bureaucrats you can find many people who aredervishes, and each one considers himself a follower of this “Mast ‘Ali Shah”3andthat “Bahman ‘Asheq Shah”4. Behind office desks are those in charge of people,and these are the kinds of thoughts that have settled in their minds: “This worldlasts but a few days. Good and bad will pass. The eminent ones have not raisedtheir heads to bother with the world. (It too will pass, o God.)”In addition, Sufi evil teachings have existed not just among the Sufis, that is tosay, its harm is not only to Sufis. Just as we have described in the book [Sufism],65"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"this erroneous path has sunk roots in all directions, and most people are not Sufisyet they are contaminated with its evil teachings even though they do not realise it.From this perspective there are many books contaminated with these evil teach-ings. Moreover, the Sufis have passed on thousands of books, in poetry and prose,as a keepsake which are now in the hands of the people, in their homes. Our poetsand advisers have all benefited from Sufism. The poets who have followed the“content” regarded the evil teachings of the Sufis as a treasure. They had thesame attachment to Sufism as those advisers and leaders. Books on the subject of“morals” in Arabic and Persian have been written; all of them have their basis inSufism. I’ll say just one thing. This old erroneous path has wound its way in alldirections, spreading its poison in the body of the people.Aside from this, Sufism is a tool in the political world. For years Europeanorientalists and the Ministry of Culture of Iran have joined hands in its circu-lation.Memoirs of the Saints5of Sheikh ‘Attar6has been printed in Europe andsent to Iran. The Masnaviof Mowlana7, his ghazalsand other poems have beenprinted and widely circulated. The Iranian Ministry of Culture holds classeson Sufism in places of learning, and money is poured out annually in printingSufi books.These are the things that must not go unseen, and one should not consider thatthe damage and harm of Sufism is slight.2 People also have offered a criticism, arguing along the lines, “the knowledgethat develops today will make all of these erroneous paths disappear”.This is another crude opinion. What is knowledge? According to you knowl-edge includes those fields of science, physics, natural history, astronomy, medicine,mathematics and others like these. Which one of these is it that will make Sufismdisappear? Which one of these is it that will stand up in battle with Sufism orother erroneous paths?We see that in these past forty years, knowledge has increased and advanced inIran, and despite this, neither Sufism, nor Shi‘ism or any other of the erroneouspaths have vanished. They have only weakened. Knowledge has weakened all ofthese erroneous paths, and they in turn have weakened knowledge. There is a uni-versal rule that when two contrary things oppose each other, they are both weakened.Now, in the name of dervish-hood and Sufism the humblest among the edu-cated renounced his home and his life and went to the khanaqah. The humblestperson sat for the chelleh8and gave himself hardships or took up the horn, walk-ing stick, begging bowl and axe and became [known as] a “wanderer of theworld”. Sufism no longer has that power. But when those educated peoplebecame aware of the Sufi teachings, they adopted them and absorbed those evilteachings in their minds ([whereas] in the classes that they studied the thingbehind the futility and evil of those teachings has not existed). So it is inevitablethat their inner feelings (sehash) will be contaminated, and their will becomesweak. This is the same state of affairs that pertains to the other erroneous pathsand is something that we witness now in Iran. It is a state we had to explain indiscourses elsewhere.9“SUFISM”66"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"If knowledge could destroy the root of the erroneous paths it would have beendone in Europe. But you see that it has not done this, indeed it could not do this.Knowledge has been current in Europe for more than two hundred years, and ithas reached into all corners. In addition, the movements for democracy, socialism,communism and others like these appeared, and each one in its turn has causedsome change. In these circumstances they were not able to destroy Christianity,which in its present state is a great erroneous path and mistake. They were onlyable to weaken it.Most worthy of our attention is the experience of Russia and communism. Themovement appeared with such great depth and turned the whole country upside-down. The communists revealed their enmity to the priests and their establish-ment, and they rose up in great effort and opposition. Yet after all this, it is nowclear that Christianity and other faiths have not vanished from that country, andonce again, the state has given ground to the priests and mollas.This in itself is worthy of discussion because it is necessary to combat theseerroneous paths and cut down the inroads they make and replace them in thoseareas with truths. The secret of the task is this: truths should replace errors. If not,the errors will never vanish. On this topic too we have presented our opinionselsewhere.10Let us put this to one side. Knowledge itself is twinned with another great erro-neous path. Knowledge, wherever it is found, exists along with materialism. Weheld that knowledge can eliminate Sufism. What benefit would there be in a placewhere materialism replaces [Sufism]? Materialism is not weaker than Sufism;indeed, it is worse in today’s world.Sufism has made people weak, lazy and cowardly and arrests the developmentof the world. Materialism makes people greedy and cruel; indeed, it turns theminto thieves and tricksters and ruins the welfare of life. Moreover, successive warshave erupted in the world’s present condition, and cities have been destroyed(as we witness today).There is an incredible story told by one group that the solution to [theproblem] of Sufism will be knowledge (or it is better if we say materialism,which is concomitant with knowledge). Another group, manifesting support forthe Sufis, says, “The only thing that can save the world from materialism isSufism.”If we want the truth, neither knowledge (or materialism) can be the solution to[the problem] of Sufism, and Sufism too will not be able to obstruct materialism.These are two erroneous paths, and both of them can exist together. Each onecan take root in a new place in peoples’ minds. A person can be both materialistand Sufi. It is possible that someone may consider life as nothing, and have nocare for anyone or anything, and have no concern except for his own enjoyment.And at the same time, the same person may consider the world worthless andephemeral, and not yearn for its pleasures, and he may withdraw himself, Sufi-like, from any task that requires some effort. This is the condition that we seetoday in many people.“SUFISM”67"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"“SUFISM”68It is this difficult battle which we have commenced that can destroy both Sufismand materialism and relieve the world from their harmful effects. It is religion thatcan soothe the people from these erroneous paths. We can say this in a better way.We have opened a highway of life to the world.I am so surprised that people have not been satisfied with this deep-rooted andeffective struggle, and they have found faults and given advise [to the effect] thatknowledge will be the cure. I myself don’t know what name to give this.3 For many years Sufism has been praised from Europe. I say “from” Europeand not “in” Europe because they praise it for us. Whatever Europeans say andwrite, whether in Farsi or in European languages, is for our benefit. They are trapsthat are set beneath our feet. It is like something bitter that they want a child toeat. A grown up comes and says something like, “Give it to me, I’ll eat it. O howsweet it is!”This is a great crime committed by the Europeans who in their politicalmanoeuvrings have joined hands with the Eastern peoples in these matters. Initself, this is a disgraceful blemish that will remain on the skirt of European his-tory. That very Europe which showed the world all that knowledge and caused allthose movements in life. This too is an example of its evil, for it tries to plunge thepeople of the East further into ignorance. In the history of Europe, in contrast tothose bright moments, there will also be these dark ones.Three years ago, in a European journal that was written in Persian, we seeopinions printed in praise of the Sufis. For example, one of the articles discussesFakhr al-Din ‘Eraqi and tells the story of how he lost his heart to a child dervishand his journey to India (which we too have presented in the text of the book).It describes this ugly and irrational story and begins with praise, saying:So, these lazy dervishes, dressed in tatters (whose ignominy is derivedfrom their reputation, and their reputation comes from theirignominy)11, were busy in singing and dancing, and they obtained theirdaily bread in the dervish path. Today we live in different times. In thisrational and mechanical world we are fascinated with other idols. Wehave another way of life, and we have lost ourselves in this new-world tosuch an extent that it appears that we have totally forgotten the spiritualstrength of the old world. Therefore when we hear the story of theQalandar,12perhaps immediately we call them mistaken or mad. Butwhat madness is it that (like these vagrant, lazy, dervishes) discovers spir-itual beauty with such clarity and goodness, [and] leaves God’s deepimprint in the heart?All of these are sentences that we read in a European journal. Europeanscholars send these to us as presents. They sing these treacherous nursery rhymesfor us. I don’t see the need to engage in a discussion about them all. I hope thereaders have a look at the story of ‘Eraqi in the book (on page 26)13and then read"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"“SUFISM”69all of this twice and think well what this European writer is praising, what thingshe calls “spiritual meaning” or “imprint of God”.It is necessary to reply to this writer, “If you speak the truth, why don’t you tellthe same things to Europeans? Why don’t you write these things in European lan-guages and spread them among Europeans? Iranians have taken the requiredshare, and more, of Sufism. They have discovered much of that ‘spiritual beauty’of which you speak, and there no longer remains any unexplored point. If thesethings are good, wish them for your own people.”One must not be deceived by their lies. If the Eastern people are deceived bytheir lies, in addition to the damage that they want to inflict, those who aredeceived will become even more abject in European eyes. They will cometogether and say to each other, “You see how we deceived them!”If one day those Europeans happen to portray Sufism, dervish-hood and thelike to us, they will say, “You still have been unable to stop the begging Qalandars.You have been unable to cut the root of Sufism. You are half a desert, you are notworthy of freedom.”In any case, this kind of clamour from Europe does not arise from well-wishersand the pure in heart. The people in Iran who make the same clamour with them,in writing and publishing books in an attempt to spread Sufism, are those whowish evil on this country. One must not pay them any respect. It is necessary tojoin hands, and with haste and vigour, and dig up the root of this pollutionand error.Sufism has been mistaken in its very root, and during a thousand years andmore it has caused damage and harm to Eastern people. Now it is the time to pullup this root once and for all.It is necessary to destroy these Sufi institutions in Iran and India. And thoseparasiticpirs14and those around them must go in search of work and a profession.How Sufism appearedSufism, like many other things, arose from the philosophy of the classical world(falsafeh-ye yunan). The founder, it is said, was Plotinus who was one of the philoso-phers of Greece or Rome.Plotinus wrote many works in a philosophical tongue. A summary of themin a simplified way is that whatever exists in the world is just one thing; Godexists and other things have become separate from him; the human spirit (ravan)has come to this world and has been trapped in matter; it must continuallyflee from this world and its pleasures and hope for connection with its sourceor home.He said that in this world too, if someone leaves himself in ecstasy, he canconnect to that source of existence (or it is better if we say “God”). “It is necessaryto close the eyes of the head and open the eye of the heart. Then we will see whatexists within ourselves, indeed, [that] which is in us.”15"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"These following sentences are the words of Plotinus:All of us are of God (az khoda), but we have become separated from him,and we will return to him. The human spirit descended from a world,free and pure. In this world it became trapped in matter and becameimpure. Therefore any person who does not pander to the desires of thebody but takes care of the spirit will be less impure. And the person whowants to escape from this trap must turn aside from the pleasures of thisworld and engage in abstinence.These foundational sentences of Sufism, as we will see, are illusory and there isno proof that they are correct. They are things that Plotinus imagined and said,without producing any proof.The last sentence, where he says, “The human spirit descended from a world,free and pure, and in this world became trapped in matter...” is not that far wideof the mark. We can say his meaning is the separation of the spirit from the soul(jan), (we also say that too, and several times we have spoken about it). But the firstsentence where he says, “We are all of God, we became separate from him andwe will return to him,” is very wide of the mark. One must ask, “How can yousay this? What proof do you have of this.” Likewise, there are other sentences ofhis without proof.He says, “Each person must flee from this world and its pleasures.” One mustask, “So for whose sake are these pleasures?”[Plotinus] says, “If someone leaves himself in ecstasy, he can connect to God.”One must ask, “How can one leave oneself in ecstasy?” Such a thing, except asan illusion, is impossible. In addition, if someone is of God, then he is of God. Sowhat need is there for leaving oneself in ecstasy?[Plotinus] says, “Then we will see what exists within ourselves, indeed, thatwhich is in us.” If we analyse this sentence, its meaning is that there is no God,and we ourselves are God. This is something that many Sufis have said:You are those who seek God. You are God.He is you, not external to you. He is you.Why do you seek something not lost?Why are you searching for something you haven’t lost?But this idea is also nonsense for it ignores the reality of God.Where is the path that we have taken to God? When have we accepted God’sexistence? When we ponder and think about this world, we see it cannot exist byitself, and this order and adornment that is apparent is not derived from this worldin itself. We see that we are humans and we are greater than all existents of thisworld, each one of us came unwillingly into this world and we will leave unwill-ingly. Because of this we know that there is something else behind this world. Weknow there is a hand outside this world. It made it appear and also makes it move.“SUFISM”70"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"“We don’t know what God is or how he is. This we know, that he exists and he isoutside this world.”In any case, when we have seen that this world and these human beings cannotexist by themselves, we remain helpless. We have said that God exists outside thisworld, so now how can we say, “That God is those very human beings.”This resembles the trees that we see in a desert, standing in a line next to eachother, and a water channel has been dug beneath their roots. When we realise thatthe existence [of the trees] cannot be due to the trees themselves, we assume thata gardener has planted them and dug the water channel for them, and so wesearch for the gardener and his dwelling. Then someone among us who has beenshown the trees says, “That gardener is this very thing.” Wouldn’t we laugh at hiswords? Wouldn’t we say that if these trees could exist by themselves what needwould we have to believe in the existence of a gardener and go searching for him?We repeat, Plotinus’ words, like the discourses of other classical philosophers,have been a source of nothing but fancy. Anyway, just as we have said, from thestart Plotinus had a number of followers in Greece.During the first centuries of Islam, when classical knowledge (danesh-ha-yeyunaniyan) and philosophy reached the Muslims, this view of Plotinus too reachedthe East. Here its circulation among Muslims was greater, and it caused a greatshock throughout the Islamic lands. When in time reason became weak, manypeople accepted the discourses of the classical philosophers and followed them.[They considered that] it was fortunate that they had heard that man was onewith God! It was fortunate that they recognised themselves as God, and theyboasted, “I am God.” This was a cry that was heard among the weak-minded.In time small groups appeared and khanaqahswere established. Plotinus, as isclear from his works, used to talk only about humans and said that only thehuman spirit had been separated from God. But it was here that the larger fieldfor “the unity of existence” opened up. They made its skirt encompass the fourbeasts and wild animals, indeed everything. “There is nothing in existence exceptexistence.”So, the purity or turning away from the pleasures of the world (about whichPlotinus spoke) caused people to exchange these pleasures of the world for a lifewithout work, remaining unmarried, and they crept away to a corner and did notbother with the world, or else, they wandered from city to city, in a nonchalantstate, which was another cause for the rapid advancement of Sufism.Also at this point, the tradition of the master and disciple took hold, for in eachgroup there existed a master, and others were in his hands or those of his deputies.Each master would have received the kherqeh16from another master. In this man-ner, there were groups of men, and many selselehs17appeared, with various names.Wearing clothes of dark blue wool because they had turned away from the world,they also shaved their heads.18In addition, the Sufi masters claimed that they had reached God. They madeextravagant claims and pretended that the chain of events in the world was intheir hands. They could improve the fate of someone if they wished, even making“SUFISM”71"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"them kings, and they could do the reverse, turning them into nothing.They claimed to know the hidden, the apparent and each person’s secrets, andthey claimed to be able to speak to the animals, in addition to flying in theair. They called themselves “the friends”, raising themselves to an equal foot-ing with the prophets. Many of them considered themselves superior to theprophets.In their opinion, religion or the ordinances that the learned establish are for thecommon people, and the pious are nothing but worshippers of the husk. ButSufism is for the élite who worship the kernel, and they regard others beneaththeir status.They named the state of being without work and women (which are amongbad practices) “blindness to the world and to its pleasures”, and they lived happilyin that state, although it was inevitable (due to their idleness) that they resorted tobegging and requested bread and money from people. They did not consider thisa disgrace, rather, they called the people, “people of the world”, and they werenot slow to describe them with reproach and censure:May God curse the People of theWorld, the young and old, all of them.They called the bazaar in which they begged every day “Satan’s den”, and theyreproached the merchants. A Sufi should not work and should refrain from activ-ity in the house and every day life. He should be with others in the khanaqah.Ifsomeone was inclined to the Sufis he had to give up his own wealth and posses-sions to the dervishes and become penniless like them.It is worth reading what they wrote in their books about these kind of people:“He renounced worldly attachments”; “he washed the filth of worldly possessionsfrom his hands”, “don’t prostrate to worldly goods”.In the beginning when Sufism appeared among the Muslims, the people wereterrified, especially of the foolish sayings that they heard from some of the Sufis.One such beggar of the Baghdad bazaar said, “there is nothing in my cloakexcept God,”19to that very ruffian of the khanaqahwho said, “Glory be to me howgreat is my majesty.”20These foolish sayings were very troublesome to theMuslims, and they did not hinder any opposition to the Sufis. Thus, Hallaj21wascrucified in Baghdad for sayings of this ilk. One of the Turkish kings, BaqraKhan, killed Sufis there.On the one hand Sufism advocated easiness in life and it accorded with lazi-ness and satisfying one’s bodily demands, yet on the other hand many people likedto withdraw from the masses and form a separate group. So Sufism proliferateddaily, and gradually the people (with their ears full of the foolish Sufi sayings) losttheir fear and no longer tried to molest them. Indeed many people among thewealthy ranks supported them and built khanaqahsand established bestowments(vaqf) of towns and houses. They donated much money. The Sufis also attemptedto Islamicise their origins. Thus some of them traced their selselehto Imam ‘Ali IbnAbi Taleb, and others to the Caliph Abu Bakr.Until the beginning of thirteenth century, which is the period of the Mongoltriumph, Sufism had advanced and built khanaqahsin all places, in Iran, India,“SUFISM”72"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"“SUFISM”73Khwarazm, Bokhara, Turkestan, Asia Minor, Iraq, Syria, Egypt and others. Aswe will see, this was one of the reasons for this Mongol victory.Subsequently, it became even more widespread during the Mongol era. As aresult of the stories that the Mongols had killed millions of people, carried offmillions of women and girls, plundered and ruined the whole country, Iranianshad a choice. They could either pluck up courage and devote themselves to pro-tection and unity with one another, rise up in a great historical movement, emergevictorious over the enemies and take revenge on them. Alternatively they couldclose their eyes from everything, entrust their country to the enemies, surrendertheir lives to merely eating, sleeping and passing time, and they could devotethemselves to Sufism or going to the kharabat22for their peace of mind. Therewere only these two options. Since the Iranians didn’t have skilful and zealousleaders they chose the Sufi option (and so to going to the kharabatand other practiceslike this), and it was this that made Sufism grow.Indeed, the Mongols wished for that, for it was in their interest that Iranianssuddenly closed their eyes to the country and its sovereignty and engrossed them-selves in Sufism and other such activities. The Mongol period was the spring ofthese mistaken paths and evil teachings.It was during and after this Mongol era that many large groups appeared inIran and other places. Some of them performed amazing things, such as walkingin fire and playing with vipers. One group called the Qalandarshaved all the hairsfrom their heads (including their beards and eyebrows) and they carried out otherastounding things.In addition, some of the masters (having their eyes on crowns and thrones),with the assistance of the dervishes, prepared the ground of kingship for them-selves. In Iran one of them was Mir Qavam al-Din Mar‘ashi (or Mir Bozorg)23who in Mazandaran founded the Mar‘ashi dynasty. Another was Sheikh JonaydSafavi24who rose in the hope [of establishing a dynasty], but he himself and hisson Sheikh Haydar25were killed in their efforts, and in the end the task of found-ing a dynasty was left for Shah Isma‘il,26the son of Haydar.The Safavid dynasty emerged from a Sufi movement. Despite this, during theSafavid era Sufism did not thrive very much; indeed, it was towards the end ofthat dynasty that Sufism, whether in Iran or in other places, began to decay. Dayby day its glory and beauty diminished, and until the present day it has declined.Despite this, in our age there are many Sufis, whether in Iran or in other places,and they have put their own institutions in order. Now in Iran, in Tehran, Shiraz,Maragheh and Gonabad there are masters from India, and we hear the names ofMehr Baba, Shah Khamush and others.This was a short history of Sufism. One can say that in these 1300 years that havepassed since the beginning of Islam there have been several things that have beenvery influential in Iranian life and that of neighbouring peoples and which havebeen the source of their misfortune. One of the most influential of them is Sufism.The point here is that Sufism has inter-twined with every aspect of daily life,and its poison has polluted everything. It has polluted all aspects of life: in the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"recognition of the world, daily life and God, nurturing the spirit, wisdom and itspursuit, reading and research, nature and habit, work and business, cultivation ofcities and the countryside, house-holding and wedlock.There is one thing worse than this. The Sufis have made poetry, which has hadmuch currency in Iran, the tool of their task. They have engaged in weaving longverses, and they have poured out their harmful illusions in the form of poetry. Inthis way they have occupied people’s minds.During these 1000 years great poetry weavers have appeared in Iran among theSufis. From Sana’i,27Abu Sa‘id,28‘Attar,29Mowlavi,30Owhadi,31Jami,32Shabestari33and others – each one composed much poetry, from masnavi, lyricand couplets (to say nothing of the many books that they wrote in prose).Worse than this is that other poets who have copied the stories [of Sufi poetry],in order to compose a poem, have taken and used the evil teachings of Sufism astheir source. They have told the stories of Sufi masters (from Shebli,34Bayazid,35Sa‘ri,36Ibrahim Adham37and others) and have written elaborately in poetry.The result is that the baseless illusions and poisonous evil teachings of the Sufiswere united together so that not only the Sufis and their followers but others toobecame polluted by them. Today in Iran there are many people who have theseevil teachings in their minds even without them understanding or wanting [them],and they are trapped in its persistent poison.This is what we say: Sufism has been and is one of the causes of the Iranian peo-ples’ misfortunes. You see orientalists who wish evil upon the East, and they makegreat efforts in maintaining this institution, writing books and making speeches onSufism. You see that the Iranian Ministry of Culture, which promotes this institu-tion, wishes evil upon the Iranian people and regards Sufism as its cultural sourceand therefore has engaged in printing books and propagating Sufi words.The evils attributable to SufismAs we said previously, in addition to being nothing more than baseless illusions,much harm appeared from Sufism when it spread into every corner of life. Formore than a thousand years this mistaken path has found a place for itself amongthe people, spread into several other countries, formed into different denomina-tions and become entangled in historical events. If we want to speak of its evils(since they should be discussed) and busy ourselves in historical episodes, wewould be forced to write such a lengthy book. But we do not have the opportunityfor that, and there is no need for such long compositions since our aim is merelyto awaken people. Therefore we have summarised the discourses in the presentwork and will offer only several clear criticisms.First, as we said, the basis of Sufism is “the oneness of existence” (vahdat-e vojud).They say, “God is that very simple existence” (absolute existence,vojud-e motlaq)that all things possess. As we said, the meaning of this is that there is no God, butwe ourselves are God. Yet there are many sayings from [the Sufis] which do notaccord with this. Many of their sayings confirm that God exists and we (or our“SUFISM”74"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"spirits) are separate from him. This in itself is a criticism that their views arecontradictory.Abu Bakr Razi,38who is considered one of the eminent Sufis, in Mersadal-‘ebad39said on this topic that “the human spirit has been brought down fromthe proximity of the Lord of the creatures to the world of bodies, the darkness ofthe physical elements, the desert of this world,” and he says that occasionallypeople do not forget this fate but remember their old state of proximity to God,and he composed a story about this (or should we say a fable) which is presentedin the following. He said:In Nishapur Sheikh Mohammad Kufi (God have mercy on him) relatedthat he had found Sheikh ‘Ali Mo’ezzin who said, “I’m reminded thatI came from the realm of the Truth’s proximity to this world, and theypassed my spirit through the heavens. The inhabitants in each heaven atwhich I arrived wept over me and said, ‘They sent this wretch from thestation of proximity to the world, and they took him from the highest tothe lowest, making him journey from the spaciousness of Paradise to therestrictions of the world.’ They sighed in regret at this and pitied me.Then an address from the Almighty reached them, ‘Do you imagine thattaking him to that world was to abase him? By God’s glory, it is better forhim if, during his life in that world, on one occasion he pours a bucket ofwater from a well into an old woman’s jar, than your being busy in wor-ship in Paradise for a hundred thousand of your years. You buried yourheads under the cloak ofeach person rejoicing in what they had. (30:31) Leavethe divine affair to Us because We taught what they did not know[2:30].’ ”40But there have been many others who clearly took up the claim of divinity, indeedthey praised everything as God:We are the essence of the master of majesty, God, the greatest,We are the holy essence, above all impurities.It is we, our essence is manifest in each particle,Don’t you know we are yet more than the trace of our essence.I praise myself to myself in each attribute,Sometimes we are the wine and the beautiful witness, and sometimes the cup.O heart, don’t consider anything in existence without God’s presence.We are the essence of the master of majesty, God, the greatest.Mehr Baba is one of the famous Sufis in India, and one of his followers wrotea book about him in which appeared many discourses on this topic. He wrote thefollowing story using Mehr Baba’s own words:One day someone asked Mehr Baba about the understanding of reality.“O pivot of the universe, you have shaken and severely jolted the“SUFISM”75"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"creatures because of your claim to divinity, prophecy, messengership,and truth. Everyone is scared after hearing these words and sentences.What should we do?”Mehr Baba said, “Say to the pretenders and opponents of mine thatI have not said that I am God. But I exclaim that I am God, you areGod, he is God, we are God, all of you are God, they are God, myfriends are God, my enemies are God, and my opponents are God.Indeed, I too am frightened by their words and I am shocked and sur-prised to hear that they see themselves as and call themselves servantsand creatures, and regard themselves as this very trivial body. I don’tmerely call and see myself as God, but I regard all the others too, eachone individually as God, and God is also them. There is no differencebetween me and them.”If you read the Masnaviof Mowla-ye Rumi you will see that sometimes hesuddenly becomes a Sufi and opens himself up to that illusory world of the unityof existence:Listen to the reed, as it tells its taleAnd complains of separation.“When they cut me from the reed-bedMen and women have cried out through my flute.”41Sometimes too he forgets this and discusses and composes stories about God insuch a way that is believable for Muslims. Not only him but others too havesuffered this confusion.Anyway, the criticisms of “the unity of existence”, according to whatevermeaning they derive from it, are as follows:1These discourses of the Sufis are illusory, and they do not have any proof for theunity of existence. This is an example of the philosophers’ incoherence. Onegroup’s interpretation was that man reaches God, and another group tied himto the animals and wild beasts, not recognising any separation between them.2This view is not compatible with the true recognition of God (which we havediscussed earlier). Is it correct that human beings (who have come unwillinglyto this world and leave unwillingly) should be called God?3People of God or people through God, say whatever you want, why are theireyes covered from pleasures? Why do they trouble themselves so much? Whydo they regard this world as contemptible? What is the conclusion of all this?If it is true as you say that man is from God, then sooner or later he willreturn to Him, then what is the need of all this effort?If their purpose is to purify man from the pollutants of the soul (such as desire,anger, hatred and others), then this is not the path. The path is recognising the“SUFISM”76"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"right meaning of humanity and understanding the truths of life which we havemade clear in other places.Second, idleness and staying in the khanaqah, practices that the Sufis havechosen, are among their great sins. The result is sensual indulgence which hasbrought a curtain down upon the eyes of the wool-wearers, and they have notseen many obvious truths of life.Everyone knows that in this life one must make an effort in order to obtain asatisfactory amount of food, drink, clothing, bedding and other necessities. Eachperson in his turn must make an effort and busies himself in work or a skill andco-operates with other people. The person who does not make such an effort butsponges is dishonest with the people and is a sinner. This situation occurs whensomeone does not make an effort but acquires food, clothing and other necessitiesfrom some other means. If someone does not have such a means he must resortto begging and vagrancy, just like the Sufis, and it is clear that his sin will double.These are matters that everyone can comprehend, but the Sufis have notunderstood them, and they have adopted idleness and begging. Their boasting ofGod, their disgrace in begging, each one is worse than the other.Perhaps people know as much that begging and vagrancy (which are wellknown because of the Sufis) have been the occupation of worthless, ignobledervishes. But the truth is that their leaders and masters have also engaged in it.Sheikh Abu Sa‘id Abi ’l-Khayr, who is accounted as one of their famous leaders,says himself that in the beginning [of his Sufi life] he spent a while too in begging,as these sentences of his show:For the sake of the dervishes, we started begging because we saw nothingmore difficult for ourselves than this. At first, whoever saw us gave us adinar, after a while the charity grew less until it was no more than one-sixth of a dinar. Then it decreased further until it was virtually nothing.And the people offered no more than this until finally they didn’t giveanything.Abu Sa‘id had a student, he calls him Bu Sa‘d, and he went to Baghdad and builtakhanaqahand became famous.42This Abu Sa‘id related that once in Baghdad he[Bu Sa‘d] entertained pilgrims travelling in a caravan from Khorasan to Mecca,and he set out a meal for them from [the fruits of his] begging. In his own words:A group of Sufis were in a caravan, and some of the merchants and peo-ple of this crowd consented and agreed [to set up their tents]...I rose andpicked up a basket, and set out to beg. Every day, morning and evening, Iprovided meals, and five times a day I gave the call to prayer and acted asthe prayer leader...in that way I begged and provided a meal.43When Abu Sa‘id became a sheikh and established a khanaqahin Nishapur, histask each day was merely sending dervishes to this and that wealthy person to ask“SUFISM”77"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"for money and other things. He made an enemy and spoke badly of the personwho gave nothing, and he made such people fearful. A large book entitledThe Secrets of Unity has been published which is full of these kind of stories. It iswritten in this book, “The Sheikh asked a woman to invite the dervishes todinner.” She said, “I don’t have anything.” He replied, “Go and beg.”While 20 or 30 fat, greedy, idle men spend their time in a khanaqah, this helpless[woman] was forced to go begging. This idleness had another harmful outcome.The Sufis sit [in the khanaqah] and weave useless thoughts and imaginings, they sit,sponge and talk rubbish.We are the essence of the master of majesty, God, the greatest.We are the holy essence, above all impurities.They sit, sponge and give long sermons to the people.May God curse the People of the World, the young and old, all of them.They sit, sponge and spin shameful balderdash.How long must I be the taught about my Beloved in the seminary?Send him to us to relax and play![Qur’an, 12:12].All of the verbal weavings of Mowla-ye Rumi in the Masnavior his numerousghazals, and all the spinning of Sheikh ‘Attar in The Conference of the Birds,44or inhis other books are all the result of sitting idle and sponging.In order for it to be understood with what tasks these Sufis spent their days andin what way they occupied the faculties of their minds, we will present a storyfrom The Secrets of Unity.Our Sheikh said, “When we were in Amol, one day I was sitting withSheikh Abu’l-‘Abbas when two people came and sat in front of him andsaid, ‘O Sheikh, we have a difference of opinion. One of us says that aneternity of sorrow is more fitting, and the other says that eternal joy isbetter. Now Sheikh, what is your opinion?’ Abu’l-‘Abbas drew his handdown over his own face45and said, ‘Praise belongs to God, for mystation is neither sorrow nor joy,There is neither morning or evening withyour Lord.’ ”46See with what futile and useless things they busied themselves. That questionof the inquirer and the answer of Abu’l-‘Abbas (or in his own words the son ofthe butcher), each one is more futile than the other.Third, that the Sufis did not marry is another of their great sins. God mademen for women, and women for men, and he made their numbers equal. So the“SUFISM”78"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"unmarried man is the source of misfortune for a woman. And procreation is eachperson’s duty. It is disobedience to God when a man does not marry.Aside from the Sufis who did not marry, many of them engaged in obscenities.In other words, they engaged in sodomy (or in their words,shahed-bazi47), which isamong the ugliest of sins. It was widespread in the khanaqah, and this [was] moreabominable since they [tried] to conceal such impurity, and they related it to “loveof God”, to which they made a claim. They cited the following: “allegory is abridge to truth”.This was the method of the Sufis. They coined a good name for each evil actof theirs. For example, they called idleness “not lowering the mind into the abjectworld”. They spoke of begging as “asceticism” for crushing the “ego” and sel-fishness. They called not marrying “covering the eyes from pleasure”, and theyinvented such terms too for sodomy.Those imaginings that are the trap of God’s FriendsAre the images of beautiful faces in God’s garden.InNafahat al-Ons, the name of one of the great Sufis, Sheikh Owhad al-DinKermani (may God Most High bless him) is mentioned. It states, “In witnessingthe Truth he used to turn to manifestations of the upper body,48and he witnessedAbsolute Beauty in fixed forms.”The author wants to say Sheikh Kermani was a homosexual, but he clothes hisugly acts in other garments. He says, “He contemplated the beauty of God in thefaces of youths.” See the extent of their rudeness and shamelessness.In the same book is the following story about Sheikh Hamed:When he became excited during the sama‘, he would tear open the shirtsof the beardless youths, and dance with his breast upon theirs. When hecame to Baghdad, the Caliph who had a handsome son heard this andsaid, “He is an innovator, and if the unbeliever performs this kind ofaction while associating with me, I will kill him once the sama‘is in fullswing.” The Sheikh understood [the Caliph’s thoughts] through hischarismatic power, and said:It is easy for me to feel the point of a sword[It is easy]to lose one’s head for the sake of the Friend.You have come to kill the unbeliever,Since you are the lord I must be an unbeliever.The Caliph and his son placed their heads at the Sheikh’s feet, andbecame his followers.49Fourth, rejection of the world and despising life (which has been a custom ofthe Sufis, indeed, has been the foundation of their life) is another of their sins.“SUFISM”79"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Why have they poured scorn upon the world? Wasn’t it God who created it?Isn’t the world the place where we live? I admit that there is evil in the world butit is necessary to make an effort, and as far as possible eradicate that evil, not pourscorn and bad-mouth the world.The result of the scorn for life that the Sufis (and for that matter, those whofrequent the kharabat) have is that the Iranian people and neighbouring countriesare nonchalant about life, and spend their time in languor and laziness, and theyjust stare into the future. This nonchalance and weakness has resulted in thembecoming captive and controlled by others.It is surprising to me that from one perspective the Sufis regard existence asone, and the world, whatever is in it, has been separated from God (or rather, Godhimself), and they have incessantly stated this in their writings:The friend discloses himself, un-veiled from behind gates and walls,Most worthy of being seen.Was it not Moses who heard “I am God!”50And if not, this murmuring under a tree51is nothing at all.And from another perspective they pour scorn and reproach on the world. Is itthis or that? On the basis of Plotinus’ statement, “the human spirit descendedfrom an exalted world and was trapped in matter within this world,” there is somejustification in viewing this world with disgust. But with regard to the unity ofexistence (which is the foundation of eastern Sufism), where is the justification fordisgust for this world? Without doubt, their reproaching of the world is the resultof the Sufis’ idleness and poverty. Since they had nothing, they busied themselveswith reproaching and saying evil things. Another aim was to encourage thewealthy and rich to give charity and donations.Fifth, the accounts of dancing, singing and love with God is another of the evilacts of the Sufis. In this regard, it is said that Plotinus – the founder of Sufism –explained in one of his discourses, “when the human spirit separates from God,it must always desire and like good and beautiful things. It must desire God whois the source of all good and beauty, and it must have love for God in its heart.”His writings contained sayings like this.This word “love” (‘eshq) – it is not known whether or not it is correctly translated –became an excuse in the hands of the Sufis for their amourous talk with God. Andin remembrance of him during the sama‘, they played the lute and flute, stampedtheir feet, clapped their hands, spun and jumped around in such a way that theyfoamed at the mouth, became dizzy and fell over. Everywhere, their writings arefull of the word “love”:Whatever you have, devote it all to love.I would be an unbeliever if you are hurt in the slightest.From the dew of love, the earthly body of man became clayAnd a hundred afflictions and troubles arose in the world.“SUFISM”80"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The tip of the lancet of love cut the vein of the spirit,A drop fell, and its name was the heart.52It is clear that this section cited above was taken from the writings of Plotinus.Although he used the word “love”, his intention was “thinking about God, rever-ing and recalling his name, and performing works at his will.” It is not these kindof futile, sensual practices. For what are these sort of words of love with Godworthy? In the words of Plotinus, first it is necessary that one wishes good things,attempts to carry out good deeds and then attains love. The thing that we hearless frequently from the Sufis concerns good deeds. The deeds of the Sufis werethose that we have mentioned: idleness, sponging, sodomy, begging, weavingillusions and the like of these.Anyway, this was an example of the Sufis’ blindness to God. The behaviour ofthose who have called themselves “gnostics” and “friends of God” towardsGod has been this rudeness. The truth is that most of them witnessed either abeautiful youth or woman and danced in memory of him or her.Through ignorance some of them have called God shahed53; indeed, they haveadded the ugly word harja’i54to that.To whom can this thing be told?My beloved is the beauty seen everywhere55and the one in seclusion.56This sin would be enough to blacken the Sufis’ faces, even if they hadcommitted no other sin.In this regard there are disgraceful stories in the books of the Sufis themselves,and we shall present one of them. In Nafahat al-Ons, the name “Sheikh Fakhr al-Din Ibrahim, famous as ‘Eraqi, God bless his spirit” is mentioned, and itincludes shameful stories about him. As an example, it states:At the age of seventeen, in the famous theological seminaries ofHamadan, teaching was in progress when one day a group ofQalandararrived. Among them was a handsome boy and the wine of love over-came ‘Eraqi and he was captivated by that boy. As long as the Qalandarwere in Hamadan, ‘Eraqi was with them. When they departed andseveral days passed, ‘Eraqi could endure no more, and so he left insearch of them. When he caught up with them, he adopted their man-ners, went with them to India, and enjoyed the association of SheikhBaha’ al-Din Zakariya. And they say that when the Sheikh prescribedisolation for ‘Eraqi, he recited this ghazalafter ten days of his chelleh,having experienced ecstasy (vajdi) and a [when a mystical] state hadovercome him:First wine that filled the cupthey borrowed from the saqi’s drunken eyes.“SUFISM”81"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"“SUFISM”82He sang this loudly, and wept. When the People of the Khanaqahsaw thisand regarded it as contrary to the way of the Sheikh (because theirmethod of isolation was nothing other than reciting the zekror control-ling the self), they objected about it to the Sheikh. He said, “You are for-bidden from this but he is not.” After several days, one of the deputiesof the Sheikh passed the kharabatand heard the people singing thatghazal, accompanied with the lute and the clicking of fingers. He wentback to the sheikh and explained the circumstances. The Sheikh asked,“What did you hear, tell me.” When he reached the part in his storywhen he heard the couplet, “They are so free with their secret – why then shouldthey blame ‘Eraqi?” the Sheikh said, “His task is complete!” He got up andwent to the door of the cell where ‘Eraqi was in isolation. ‘Eraqi laid hishead at the Sheikh’s feet, and with his own hands the Sheikh raised‘Eraqi’s head from the earth and no longer allowed him to practiceisolation, but took off his own kherqeh, and put it on him.57Meditate well on this story so that you can understand what meaning the “love”of the Sufis has and from what path it comes.Sixth, another sin of the Sufis is the hostility that they have shown to reason(kherad). Reason is the most precious thing given by God, and each person mustrecognise it, and it must be the guide in their activities. Those whose actions areirrational have shown their hostility to reason and have busied themselves invoicing their scorn to it:Love arrived and his intellect became a vagrant.Morning came and intellect’s candle became useless.58The legs of the reasoners are woodenAnd wooden legs are too unstable.59Love arrived and plundered the intellect.O heart this is the good news.60“When a dervish once asked our Sheikh, ‘O Sheikh, what is intellect?’ he said,‘Intellect is the god of servitude. With intellect one cannot discover the secrets oflordship because [the intellect] is created, and there is no access for created thingsto the eternal.’ ”In Sufi books, there are many of these kind of sentences: “Since the intellectgets nowhere, commence the [Sufi] travelling and journeying (sayr va soluk) andseek [mystical] unveiling and witnessing,” and “since the nail of reason does notuntie the knot of the task, turn to love,” and “as love settled in the heart,intelligence was busy with the house.”With these sentences they wanted to make others understand that they existedin a world greater than reason and its dominion. They existed in a world where thebasis of reason had no place. But the truth is that since their business was clearlyirrational, inevitably they put reason to one side and made efforts to belittle it."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Sitting idle in the khanaqah, eating bread derived from the toil of others, beggingin the bazaar, not taking a wife and having children, growing a beard, dancing,clapping hands and spinning themselves around have the least [degree of]compatibility with reason, let alone all the other irrational stories about them.Now I will relate one of them to serve as an example.It was that very Mowlana who said, “Love arrived and human intellect becamea vagrant.” InNafahat al-Onsthere is the following story about him and his master,Shams-e Tabrizi.For a period of three months they were sitting for uninterrupted fasting,night and day, and they had not come out of isolation at all. No one hadthe gall to interrupt their isolation. One day Shams al-Din askedMowlana for a shahed. Mowlana took his wife’s hand, and led her to[Shams. Mowlana] said, “She is the sister of my soul.” [Shams said],“I want a beautiful boy.” In a second he brought his son, Soltan Valad.He said, “He is the son of my soul.” [Shams said] “Now we shall enjoyourselves if he will give a little wine.” Mowlana went out and filled upand brought back a jar from the Jewish quarter. Shams al-Din said,“I have tested the strength of Mowlana’s obedience. It is greater thanwhatever they say.”61Contemplate well on this story. Two people for three months in isolation, whatdid they do? The author says “uninterrupted fasting”. Can one spend threemonths in uninterrupted fasting? How can one reconcile uninterrupted fastingwith desiring a woman or a boy and wishing for wine? On this point they say, “theliar is forgetful”.Is it not dishonourable to give one’s own wife or son to another person? Isdishonour also appropriate in Sufism? What dishonour there is for Mowlanain this story, if it is the truth. If it is not the truth then what ignorance thosepeople had who concocted these things in the name of their leaders andrecorded them in books. This Mowlana is that very person whose Masnavihas been published time after time and upon which much foolish praise has beenlavished. He is that person whose book is considered equal in rank to theQur’an.62The people who want to know about this type of Sufi disgrace shouldread Jami’s “Breath of Familiarity” (Nafahat al-Ons) or ‘Attar’s “Memoirs of theSaints”.The thing that I must state at the end of this chapter is that idleness and nottaking a wife – which we regard as Sufi sins – have not existed among all [Sufi]orders. First, for a long time a Sufi was not able to engage in work or profession,but he could take a wife. Some of them took wives because it was clear [a Sufi]needs his food and household things, and his children too started begging. ThenSheikh Safi Ardabili and Shah Ne‘matollah Kermani63recommended theirdisciples to get a job or profession. Shah Ne‘matollah said, “The friends of Godcan wear the clothes of workers and professionals too.”“SUFISM”83"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"“SUFISM”84Sufism’s evil conduct with IslamA great evil of the Sufis that we must present separately is its treatment of Islam.Whether originating in the writings of Plotinus or elsewhere, Sufism is alien toIslam. Not only has it no connection or association with that religion, it is totallycontrary to it.Islam recognises that God exists outside this world, and that there is no andcannot be a connection between him and humans and other creatures. Sufismrecognises that very “absolute existence”, and if we investigate their understand-ing of it we find that humans are all God and there is no other God. There canbe no compatibility between these two Gods.According to the customs of Islam sitting idle, not having a wife or children,begging, dancing in remembrance of God and these kind of activities (which havebeen the foundation of Sufism) are all inappropriate. Islam aimed to persuadepeople to adopt a life based on reason and moderation that linked effort andendeavour with well-wishing and purity of heart. Despising the world andabstaining from pleasures (which were a Sufi excuse) are completely alien to theaims of Islam.Islam promotes the establishment of better living standards, well-being ofpeople and the power of reason. This is why in the Qur’an there is a constant callfor people to think, understand and use their reason, and nowhere in the Qur’ancan one find the word “love” (‘eshq) which is a Sufi idiom.There is no space here to dispute that Sufism was alien to Islam. But as it willbe seen, the Sufis have continually desired to show their compatibility with Islam,and there were two reasons for this. One was to gain security from the molesta-tion by Muslims so that they could live among them. The other was to attractMuslims to them and increase the number of Sufis.They Islamicised their origin, and each of their orders was traced back to oneof the companions of the prophet (from Abu Bakr and Imam ‘Ali Bin Abi Talebamong others), and they pretended that the prophet had two kinds of teachings.One of them which was called the Holy Law (shari‘at) was for all people, the otherwas the Way (tariqat) and was only for chosen and select people. This is why thatgreat man established a religion for the people and called it a Holy Law andestablished the Way for the select and taught it to people like Abu Bakr, ‘Ali andothers, and [the Way] reached the Sufis through them.One day in Tabriz one of the Sufis told me the above account, and he wasproud of it. I replied, “Regarding the Sufi, it is enough that they have inventedthis lie. If I accepted that the prophet of Islam had done such a thing and hadtwo teachings, then why are those two teachings incompatible with each other?When did Abu Bakr and ‘Ali do those things that the Sufis do? When was ‘Ali idle?When did he perform the chelleh? When did he boast about “love” with God andengage in dancing to the sounds of a tambourine and flute? When did he refrainfrom taking a wife? When did he send his followers into the bazaar to beg?” ThatSufi had no answer for any of these questions, but fell silent."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"“SUFISM”85What increased this evil of the Sufis was that the deviations they caused inIslam were carried out in the intention of giving Islam a Sufi colouring. Ratherthan the Sufis being followers of Islam, they made Islam their disciple. If some-one wants to write about the activities of the Sufis in this field, it would becomea large book. Since I am trying to be brief I will suffice with a few examples.1 They turned the Qur’an into a tool or a toy, and they gave each of its versesany meaning that they wanted. For example, they made the verse “he is with youwherever you are”64the proof of the unity of existence, whereas the whole of theQur’an is not compatible with the unity of existence. The God that revealed theQur’an is very different from the God that the Sufis recognised. That verse states“wherever you may be, God is with you”; it does not say “God is in you,” nor doesit say “you are God.”Sheikh Abu Sa‘id understood the verse “the foremost among you with God arethe most abstinent” to mean “abstinence is abstinence from the selfishness of theego”. Then he drew a conclusion saying, “On the basis of this meaning, whenyou abstain from the selfishness of the ego you reach him.” Abstinence in the Qur’anis abstinence from evil, but this sheikh, at his own pleasure, gave it a Sufi meaning.Sometimes their attitude to the Qur’an was such that one cannot call itanything but a joke or a game. In The Secrets of Unity, [the author] writes:Bashr Hafi never wore shoes or sandals, and he said that, “The gloriousTruth most high said,God is he who makes for you the earth as a carpet.[71:19]65The earth is the carpet of the Truth, glorious and most high,and I am not allowed to me to walk on the carpet of God most high inshoes or sandals.” So he walked for the whole of his life with bare feet.Therefore he was called Bashr Hafi [which in Arabic means “thebarefoot man”].66The Qur’an says, “God made the earth flat for you.” It says this so it isnecessary for me to walk with bare feet. Can this have been anything but a jokeor a game? Was the meaning of the Qur’an (which advises people to cleanliness)that people should walk barefoot?InMemoirs of the Saints‘Attar wrote about Bayazid Bastami. It is related thatwhen his mother sent him to school, when he reached the verse in the chapter ofLuqman, the teacher interpreted the verse,Show me gratitude and to your parents,(31:15) in the following way: “God says, ‘Serve me and state your gratitude to me,and serve your mother and father and state your gratitude to them.’ ” WhenBayazid heard this, it had an effect on his heart and he put down his slate andsaid, “Oh teacher! Please let me go home so I can say speak to my mother.” Theteacher told Bayazid to go home. His mother said, “Oh Tayfur! Why have youcome here. Have they given you a gift or do you have some other reason?”He said, “No, when I reached the ayain the Qur’an when the Truth says there isservice to us and service to yours I realised that I cannot do that in two houses."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The meaning of the verse has been revealed to me. Ask my God that I becomeall yours, or work for my God so that I am all God’s.” His mother said, “Go andbe God’s.” So Bayazid left Bastam and spent thirty years wandering Syria andengaged in ascetic discipline.Is the meaning of that Qur’anic verse that one should refrain from his work orprofession and give up on life? It says, “Serve me and also your mother andfather.” Can’t someone serve both God and also his parents and also not give uphis job or profession? There are many of these stories.2 Sometimes there are stories in their books in which it is clear with what eyesthey have viewed Islam and its founder and how they have considered their stand-point superior. In one of their books is the story of how Jalal al-Din Rumi becamea Sufi. It states that one day Jalal al-Din departed from the theological seminaryin Konya, mounted a donkey and set off with some students. Shams-e Tabrizicame across him and asked, “Who was greater, Mohammad son of ‘Abdullah orBayazid Bastami?” Jalal al-Din replied, “What kind of question is that?Mohammad was a prophet, so how can one compare him with Bayazid?” Shamssaid, “So why did the prophet say,We did not recognise you as we should have?AndBayazid Bastami used to say,Glory be to me how great is my majesty(“I am God andMy affairs are exceedingly great”).67Mowlana was so bewildered that he fell offthe donkey and became unconscious. When he regained consciousness he wentwith Shams to the seminary and stayed in a cell with him for forty days inisolation.There are many of these kind of stories. They ridiculed the pilgrimage toMecca, which is one of the commandments of Islam. For example, in The Memoirsof the Saintsit is written: Rabi‘a went to Mecca and she saw the Ka‘bahad cometo meet her in welcome. Rabi‘a said, “I want to see the Master of the house. Whatneed do I have of the house?”In the words of Bayazid, it states that he said: “For a time I circumambulatedthe house. When I reached the Truth I saw the house was circumambulting me.”In their books of amazingly foolish sayings they have written about Sheikh ‘Abdal-Qadir Gilani68who was one of their poles. For example, when someone askedhim, “Why don’t you go to Mecca?” the Sheikh raised his hand and said, “Lookbetween these two fingers.” His questioner saw the Ka‘bain the air, spinningaround the Sheikh’s head.3 One of the Sufi acts that we have uncovered in our investigation is that theythemselves invent sayings attributed to God and propagated them as “sacredsayings” (hadith-e qodsi). For example,I was a hidden treasure and I loved to be known, andso I created the creatures to know me. I wet the clay of Adam with my own hands for fortymornings. My servant! Obey me and I will make you like me.69There are many of these kind of sentences in the books of the Muslims. Butwhere is their origin? Who heard them from God? If you search for the answeryou will get nowhere. What we know is that the Sufis made them up. Because itwas those Sufis who believed they were continually with God in secret, insupplication and conversation. Therefore, the meaning of most of these sentences“SUFISM”86"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"are Sufi. Apart from this, it can be seen that the Sufis, more than other people,have turned them around in their own fabrications.“I was a hidden treasure...”which is cited by Mowlana and many Sufis in theirpoetry and books was an excuse for their long winded fabrications.Abu Bakr Razi in Mersad al-‘ebadreflected on I wet the clay of Adamand fabri-cated more than eight pages about it.70Amir Pazwari who composed poetry in Mazandarani, and was not unaware ofSufism, included these two hadithin his own poems. He says:I am the necessary existent, the knowledge of the names.I was mixed from earth for forty days.I opened up the knot of “I was a hidden treasure.”Don’t tell everyone because I am so precious.It is surprising that the word “hidden” (makhfi) in “I was a hidden treasure” is amistake [Makhfi-an]. In Arabic one should say “khaf i”. So it is clear that someonewho was not an Arab or did not known Arabic has made up this hadith.These are examples of the Sufis’ treatment of Islam. It is interesting that evenwith all the distortions which they made in that religion, they were not able tomake Sufism conform to Islam, and so a duality came to exist. The duality con-tinued and confusion has remained between Islam and Sufism. When you readtheir books you will see that sometimes they are absorbed in Sufi imaginings,falling remote from Islam, and sometimes they return, becoming a Muslim “whofollows the external form of religion”.71A short biography of Abu Sa‘id Abi’l-Khayr was written. When you read thisyou will see that in one place the Sheikh became a real Sufi.Our Sheikh said, “On several occasions when we were seeking theTruth, sometimes we would discover him, and sometimes we didn’t findhim. Now, however much we seek ourselves, we no longer find anything.We have become ‘everything is he’ because everything is he.”In another place you will see Sufism is forgotten and the Sheikh was a Muslimwho followed the external form and discussed the resurrection, heaven and hell.Our Sheikh said, “If a ransom was sent from heaven for the sake ofIsma‘il, on the day of resurrection a ransom will be sent of behalf of theriffraff of Mohammad’s community.”The infidel is brought forth and the Muslim is told: this is your ransom from Hell-fire.72The question to be asked is that, on the basis of the understanding that the Sufishave derived, what spiritual meaning can be yielded from the above discussion ofheaven and hell? If God is that “simple existence” which exists in everyone andin all things, then does he exist in the Muslim and unbeliever? For what reason“SUFISM”87"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"“SUFISM”88will anyone go to heaven or hell? The person who has been saved from the prisonof “multiplicity” will connect to the sea of “unity”, so what is the need to speakof heaven and hell?It has been repeated in the Sufi books that the Sufi’s station is above “unbelief ”and “faith”:For the person for whom love is a guide,Both unbelief and religion are unveilers for him.Night is like unbelief, and the candle is like faithWhen the sun is shining.Faith said to unbelief:“Let’s go, because the game is over for us.”Sheikh Shabestari73said:If the unbeliever knew what an idol wasHe would know that religion is in idol-worshipping.In the eyes of Sufism what has been said above is true. That idol too is a fortunefrom God, and worshipping it is worshipping God. How can such a thing bepermissible in Islam which is a religon that shatters idols?It needs to be said that Sufis were caught between Islam and Sufism. They livedtheir whole lives in hypocrisy. But they were divided into two groups in thisregard. One group did not believe in Islam and it was only for fear of the peoplethat they occasionally pretended to be Muslims. The other group that believed inboth Islam and Sufism lived in confusion between these two.Most of their leaders were in the first group and they considered themselvessuperior to the founder of Islam. For example, Sheikh ‘Abd al-Qadir Gilani wasknown as the “pole” of his time. It is written that space and time were at his com-mand, and the sun asked him permission to appear, and the full moon asked per-mission to come out. It is clear that someone with such self-boasting and vain talkconsiders his own rank as far superior to that of the prophet of Islam and others.The orders that emerged after the Safavid era in Iran have exhibited someform of Shi‘ism, and it must be stated that they too are divided into two groups.One group did not believe in Shi‘ism but showed an accommodating face to thepeople. The other group grew strong with Shi‘ism, and the illusions of that sectsettled in their hearts. Moreover, they were inclined to Sufism too, and so anotherset of illusions was added upon them, and they lived with this giddiness. Theconduct of Abu Sa‘id and others with Islam caused some accommodationbetween Sufism and that religion. They became Shi‘ites and have made someadaptations.The story of Safi ‘Ali Shah74is truly amazing. This man who was consideredthe “pole” twinned Sufism with ‘Ali Allahi-ism.75Everywhere in his poetry he"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"praises ‘Ali as God in Sufi terminology. In one place he says:How is it that there is unity in a raging ocean?Waves rise continually from the ocean.A hidden treasure which was completely unseenIs revealed from the veil of absence.Since there is nothing there except himThe essence of things appears from the force of jealousy.Sometimes the sword strikes in the battlefieldSometimes it is ready for martyrdomSometimes it sleeps on Ahmad’s bed.Sometimes it rests upon the throne of Imamate.76There is no truth in the kingdom of the Shah’s existence77Except for ‘Ali, the Friend of God.This last line of this verse is brought repeatedly. The expression “Friend of God”is suitable in rhetoric, for the poet states God is no other than ‘Ali, and in thetradition of the Shi‘ites he is also called “Friend of God.” This is an example ofhis confusion.In that tarji‘band, in another place, the poet glorified the story of the ascent:In that assembly, in a word,When the Truth invited Mohammad to that assemblyFrom the unseen a call cameFrom the blessing of the court of “Subhani.”78A hand came from the sleeve of the unseenTo lead him there.He saw a hand take his ownFor a pledge to perform God’s will.He saw a hand thatWith two fingers could pull off the door.79Before the creation of world and manThere has been a creator of this palace of existenceSee the degree of this man’s understanding! The ‘Ali-Allahis add anotherlegend to the ascent of the prophet, which is a legend itself.80An invitation issent to the prophet to feast with God in heaven, and when God reveals his handfrom behind a curtain, the prophet witnesses ‘Ali’s hand. That pole of the agebelieved these groundless legends, and he turned them into poetry with all theSufi skills.Why has nobody claimed that from the Sufi viewpoint God is nothing but thatsimple existence which cannot be a thing that is in the sky or on the earth.Therefore how can witnessing God in heaven be compatible with Sufism?“SUFISM”89"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"And from the Sufi viewpoint we are all God, not separate from Him. So how is itthat you can only see ‘Ali?What follows in the poem is more surprising than this:‘Ali, most high, said to the prophetYour prosperity is in praising ‘Ali,Since there is no Truth in the Shah’s kingdomExcept ‘Ali the Friend of God.He says, “God said to the prophet that God is ‘Ali, and there is nothing in theworld except him.” It is unknown where the other God was who said this to theProphet about ‘Ali.On the one hand these are examples of the confused state of that man’s mind,and on the other hand they are examples of the extent of the lack of under-standing of the pole of the age. These were people who said that for years theyhad endured difficulty and had embellished themselves with certain attributes andtrimmed themselves of others and had finally reached an exalted station. Theywere people whom others had called “unfortunate” and who considered them-selves superior to all of them, indeed to the prophets too. That was their boastingand this was an example of their understanding and reason!Sufism is the source of the spirits’ weaknessPeople sometimes say, “Sufism should also be discussed from the perspective of itsbenefit and detriment to the individual, and you are correct in so doing. However,Sufism has provided a path to purify the spirit.” And they continue, “The onlycriticism that one can make is that the Sufis have been excessive in concentratingupon the spirit.”But these views are incorrect. This is the good opinion that people have hadconcerning the Sufis. I cannot say that all Sufis have been bad people, but what Ican say is that since Sufism is a crooked path, not only have the Sufis been unableto purify their spirits, they have made them even more polluted.Even if we close our eyes to all this, and focus upon the Sufis with regard to thepurification of the spirit, we will see that when all is said and done, in this fieldtoo, they are worse than others. Those who have a good opinion of them and talkabout them in this fashion have not read their books and are unaware about theiractivities and lives.If I want to discuss the uncleanness and impurity of the Sufis, I would have towrite a hundred pages or more. But I will suffice with several examples.One of the efforts made by the Sufis was a battle with egotism, whichthey themselves called “the greater jihad”. Egotism is one of the worst humancharacteristics, and since the Sufis have recognised it as the source of all evil, theywere not too far away from the truth. Nevertheless, the result of following the Sufipath was that they did not kill the egotism in themselves, rather, they animated it“SUFISM”90"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"further. If you read the stories that the Sufis themselves have written, you will seehow their egotism is sometimes revealed through their behaviour and sayings.For example, one of the ways of the great Sufis was that anytime they heardsome [great Sufi] say something they exaggerated this very much and boastedabout the speaker even if it was nonsense.For example, in the Secrets of Unity, it is written: “They told our Sheikh,‘Someone repented and broke the vow of repentance.’ Our Sheikh said, ‘If hehad not broken his vow of repentance, he would never be able to repent again.’ ”There are many examples of this kind in that book.In the Memoirs of the Saints, there is a conversation between Shaqiq Balkhi81andIbrahim Adham:Shaqiq said, “O Ibrahim! What do you do to get your worldlyprovisions?” He replied, “If something comes along, I give thanks, andif it doesn’t I wait.” Shaqiq said, “The dogs of Balkh do the same thing!”Ibrahim said, “So what do you do?” He replied, “If something comes tous we give it away, and if it doesn’t we give thanks.”Concerning Bayazid it is written:They said to Bayazid that so and so had gone to Mecca in one night. Hesaid, “Satan too goes from the east to the west in a moment.” They saidto him, “So and so walks on water.” He said, “More amazing than thatis to realise that fish swim in water and birds fly in the air.”82Another of their ways has been to reveal to people their amazing acts and toshow themselves off. For exampe, in the Remembrance of the Saints, it is written:A thief had been hung in Baghdad and Jonayd83went and kissed his feet.They asked him about this and he replied, “May there be a thousandmercies upon him because he was a hero in his task, and so achieved suchperfection in his work that he exceeded the bounds in that task.”It continues:It is related that one night he was walking along a path with a disciple,and a dog was barking. Jonayd84exclaimed, “Here I am for you, hereI am for you!”85The disciple asked, “What do you mean by this?” Hereplied, “I considered the dog’s noise as the wrath of the Truth mosthigh, and as a reflection of his power. I did not consider the dog. SoI answered, ‘Here I am for you.’ ”Concerning Sheikh ‘Attar himself, they have written that when the Mongolarmies captured Nishapur and he fell prisoner to a Mongol, someone recognised“SUFISM”91"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"him and offered a hundred dinarsif they would set him free. ‘Attar himself did notallow this and said, “Don’t sell me, as I am worth more than this.” Another pur-chaser was found and offered to buy him for a palace. The Sheikh said, “Acceptthis, since I am not worth this much.” The Mongol became angry with thesewords of his and killed him.There is another group of stories the meaning of which can be nothing otherthan that which has already been mentioned. Their aim has been to show Sufism asa difficult but very worthwhile endeavour and to show the Sufis themselves in a goodlight. The story below that serves as an example is from the Memoirs of the Saints.Shebli went to a gathering of Khayr Nassaj.86Khayr sent him to Jonayd.So Shebli went to see Jonayd and said, “They have shown you the jewelof divine knowledge. Either give it to me or sell it to me.” Jonayd replied,“You are not worth the price that I can sell it to you. You will havereceived it too easily if I give it to you, for you don’t appreciate its value.You must plunge yourself headfirst, like me, into this ocean and you willacquire this jewel through patience and expectancy.” Shebli asked,“What should I do?” Jonayd replied, “Go and sell sulphur for a year.”Shebli did this and when the year had passed Jonayd said to him, “Thiswork gives you a good name, so go and spend a year begging and don’toccupy yourself in anything else.” Shebli did this too, and wandered thewhole of Baghdad for a year so that after a while no one gave him any-thing. Then he returned to Jonayd who said, “Now appreciate your ownvalue: you are worthless in the eyes of the people. So don’t rely on themor pay them any attention.” He continued, “You were a courtier for awhile, and you were a governor for a while. Go to that province and askthem to release [you from that office?].” Off he went, and he arrived ateach and every door, until he had searched everywhere. But one injus-tice remained for him. But God did not forgive until he said, “I have the[willing] intention to return that one hundred thousand diram.” But stillhis heart was vexed, and he spent four years in this condition. So hereturned to Jonayd who said, “There still remains some regard for repu-tation in you. Go and beg for another year.” Every day he would beg,and gave everything he acquired to Jonayd, who gave it all to thedervishes and left Shebli hungry in the evening. When the year was com-pleted Jonayd said, “Now I permit you into the companionship of the[Sufi] path on the condition that you become the servant of the com-panions.” So Shebli served the companions for a year, and then Jonaydsaid, “O Abu Bakr, now what do you think of yourself ?” Shibli replied,“I regard myself as the most wretched of God’s creatures.” Jonayd said,“Now your faith is correct.”The careful reader considers what abject and meaningless activities the Sufishave stooped to in order to show that Sufism in a very difficult but worthwhile“SUFISM”92"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"endeavour and that they have poured water on the fire of selfishness withinthemselves. In this story there is a clear lie: Shebli, having more than a hundredthousanddirams, became a dervish and started begging, in any case whether a lieor true, it is an example of the Sufis’ activities or lies, the cause of which can benothing but selfishness and showing off.Those who have considered themselves superior to others spent their time in astate of poverty, idleness and meanness, and they were selfishly pleased and con-tent with that. Moreover, they busied themselves in this kind of showing off inorder to reveal their superiority to the people.Another method of the Sufis which can also be considered as nothing but sel-fishness has been to show an evil or unsightly act that one of them has perpetratedas an act of humility. They have taken responsibility for that evil but have givenit another meaning, and they have praised themselves for it. There is a ludicrousepisode of this in Safat al-safa87which is presented below:May God prolong his blessing upon the worlds. Sheikh Sadr al-Din (sonof Safi al-Din) said that once Sheikh Safi [al-Din Ardabili]88(may hisgrave be hallowed) set out from Siyavarud to Ardabil, and it was hishabit that unlike others, he never took provisions from the zawiya89ofSheikh Zahed90(may his grave be hallowed). As chance would have it, atthat time Sheikh Zahed knew of these circumstances through the lightof friendship of God. He told his followers to prepare generous provi-sions of bread for Sheikh Safi. They put a huge pile of loaves into theboat even though the distance that would be spent travelling was short,for one loaf would have been sufficient from Siyarvarud to Kalas wherehe would disembark. When Sheikh Safi al-Din sat in the boat, he wasin the kind of mystical state that when experienced by the masters ofspiritual travelling, the fire of love overcomes them. And his stomachburnt so much that if he had been given all the food on earth to eat, notone particle of food would have reached his stomach, because it wouldhave been burnt on the way (and there are some whose existence is burntby this fire) and so his stomach received no food.When a particle of the fire of your love sets a heart ablazeAll parts of existence and its non-existence are completely burnt.That state was apparent in the Sheikh, and he ate all the provisions andloaves of bread that were in the boat. When they disembarked from theboat, the followers who had accompanied him realised that that verystate had overcome the Sheikh. And before he had disembarked theywent ahead to a village and house in front of them and arranged forfood. In each village they prepared a large quantity of food that wassufficient for a big party. When the Sheikh arrived, they brought himforward to receive all the goods, and they carried on in this way untilthey reached Ardabil.“SUFISM”93"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"So in each place they cooked five or six sheep, and the Sheikh arrived ateach place behind the followers and ate everything they prepared untilhe reached the village of Kalkhoran. When he entered the house therehe saw that they had been cooking some bread, so he sat in front of theoven and ate whatever had been cooked until he had completely finishedeverything. They baked all the dough that had been prepared for thosewho lived in the house, including the guests and the workers. But theSheikh ate it all. When his mother (God’s blessing upon her) saw whathad happened, she understood the Sheikh’s state. She killed her big,strong ram, and cut it up into pieces and prepared a large pot of food.The Sheikh ate all of that too. Then the relations of that household whowere passing by brought different kinds of food, and he ate all of that.And the neighbours of that house brought food likewise and it too wasfinished up. Then the news spread around the village and everybodybrought some kind of food, and the Sheikh ate so much that he causedhimself an injury, yet he was not full even with all this food.When in that station the bird of aspiration discovers the nest,It cares less than a grain about the universe before it.When this state appears for the traveller the spiritual guide (morshed) mustbring him out of it and instruct him with a special zekrso that he canleave this state behind and return [to normality]. So when Sheikh Safial-Din reached that state where he was in danger of dying, he saw theoutward appearance of Sheikh Zahed who had come to instruct him inthat zekrand bring him out of that state and make him stable:I am in the tavern. There is a sober wine-bearerWho can break my state of complete drunkenness with a mouthful.And these kind of states appeared for one of the disciples of Sheikh Safi(may his grave be hallowed) in Kalkhoran, and he came out of isolationduring the night and entered a large garden in which there were manykinds of herbs. That night he ate all of those herbs, and not a single leafwas left. At dawn the gardener was astonished when he arrived at thegarden. Everything in the garden had gone; it had not been burnt away,so where had it gone? The Sheikh heard about this and so he instructedthat disciple in that special zekrand brought him out of that state. A sim-ilar state befell another of the disciples of Sheikh Safi in Ardabil. TheSheikh ordered Selah, his servant, to follow the disciple and arrangebread and food for him. Selah prepared much food, and placed it allbefore that disciple in the privacy of the courtyard. It was Friday, and sohe went to the mosque, and that seeker ate all the food. When herequested more, and found there was nothing left, he went into a gardenthat was situated before the southern window of a zawiya, and in which“SUFISM”94"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"there were herbs. He ate all the herbs, and when he noticed the leaveson the tree, he ate all that was edible. Then he returned to his place ofisolation, and since there was no possibility of a remedy for him, hecould endure no more and he passed away in isolation. In the mosquethe Sheikh (may his grave be hallowed) understood through the light offriendship that he had died, and when he returned from the mosque anddismounted his donkey, he said to his servant Selah, “Didn’t I tell you tokeep preparing food for that person? Lets go and check his place of iso-lation.” He took Selah’s hand and led him there. They saw the disciplesitting in a corner and who had hung a document on the wall and greenfoam was trickling out of his mouth.The death of the lovers is beautifulThe lover’s soul is a seeker of an excuse.Up to this point we have copied from Safat al-Safa. Undoubtedly the story wasthat Sheikh Safi revealed such greed on his journey, stopping in several places onhis return from Gilan. The Sheikh committed such deeds that were so unbecom-ing instead of performing humble acts. He said, “Anyone can commit these evils,so there is no cause for reproach.” He presented this selfishness in another way,namely, as one of the Sufi states or even as one of Sufism’s secrets. He made upand told this lie, and some of his followers supported and verified other lies too.Some of them have been so engrossed in these things that we see in The Secretsof Unitytwo of Abu Sa‘id’s children died.91The selfish Sheikh did not considerthat [fate] was just, as it was not fitting for the elevated status which he hadbestowed upon himself. Therefore he explained the reason for his children’s deathin a different way. “People of heaven asked us for a reminder, and we sent themtwo aromatic delicacies until their father arrives.” There are so many of thesekind of stories that we cannot count them.Another example of the weakness of the Sufis’ spirits is their practice of beg-ging and asking for charity. We see from their stories that they did not considerbegging an evil, indeed, they regarded the bread (which they had acquiredthrough begging) as beneficial (for begging was one form of asceticism). Theirexcuse was that the most dangerous of things is the “soul” (nafs), and they despisedit totally and tried to kill it.This resulted in the Sufi pirsconfusing the soul and spirit (or in their own words:nafsandruh). They have not made any distinction between the demands of thetwo. This is because in the human body whatever begs is considered evil andwhatever opposes this is called the spirit. It is the spirit that is displeased whensomeone puts himself before others, makes himself contemptible and desiresthings. However, the soul or nafshas no fear of begging, and they do not considerit as evil.The Sufis have likened the soul to a dog and have even called it a dog in manyplaces. But it would have been better if they had remembered that dogs are not“SUFISM”95"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"shy about begging; indeed, begging is their skill. It is a human, a pure-souledhuman that cannot live in peace with begging.Sufis have begged in order to kill their nafs(to use their term), so why have theysat doing nothing?! Has it been to kill their nafs? Or could living in idleness andlooking expectantly at others and engaging in begging and asking for charity havebeen a source of nothing except an impure and weak soul?A summary of the hagiography of Abu Sa‘id which they composed is asfollows: On the pretext of Sufism, he abstained from engaging in work and atrade and assembled a group of thick-necked dervishes about him. They spenttheir time in idleness and fabricating foolish stories, and taking edibles from themerchants from the market, they became debtors. And then they went beggingfrom this wealthy person to that wealthy person, and they requested money claim-ing, “We have taken out a loan.” If someone refused to give them anything theycursed that person to death and spread insults about him. The following story isan example of the works of Abu Sa‘id.In that time when our Sheikh, Abu Sa‘id, was in Nishapur, HasanMo’addab (who was the Sheikh’s servant) had borrowed something fromeveryone to spend on the dervishes. When the lenders asked for theirmoney back he said something would be given to them later. One daythey all came to the khanaqahand the Sheikh told Hasan Mo’addab to letthem in. Hasan lead them into the khanaqahand they sat before theSheikh. A young peddler passed the door of the khanaqahand called out“Sweets for sale!” The Sheikh said, “Weigh everything he has.” So all hissweets were weighed and placed in front of the Sheikh for the Sufis toeat. The young peddler asked for money for the sweets. The Sheikhreplied, “It will come soon.” The peddler once more asked for hismoney, but the Sheikh said, “It will come.” A third time he asked for hismoney, and the Sheikh gave the same reply. The young peddler said,“My master will beat me.” He said this and stood crying. Suddenlysomeone came to the door of the khanaqah, and placed a purse full ofgold before the Sheikh and said, “So and so sent me and asked to beremembered in your prayers.” The Sheikh told Hasan Mo’addab to takethe purse and divide the money among the creditors. So Hasan took thegold and divided it between them, and he also gave gold to that youngpeddler, so that no gold remained. Nothing was left, rather, all thingswere paid in full. The Sheikh said, “This gold was on account of thisyoung boy’s tears.”92Readers of this story should contemplate well. They had taken numerous loansfrom many people and as a result they had eaten well. And instead of meeting thedemands of those who came to see him, desiring a return of their loan, Abu Sa‘idwas busy with his voracious appetite. He called out to a peddler boy who sold food(sweetmeats) and took everything he had despite having no money. He ate those“SUFISM”96"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"goods with the dervishes, and when the boy asked for money he said, “It willcome.” Out of fear of a beating from his master, the boy stood crying until some-one came and gave the money to the Sheikh. You see that they have produced a“miracle” from this vile conduct which cannot be interpreted as anything butstomach-worship and shamefulness. “Nothing was left, rather, all things were paidin full.” The Sheikh said, “This gold was on account of this young boy’s tears.”He wants to make it known that God had guided the actions of the Sheikh andhis followers, and God wanted that money to reach them. But was it necessary tomake that young boy cry? See with what clothing they disguise their mean andavaricious appetites! See their rudeness towards God! Were their spirits pure? Ifthey were not pure what things would they have done?I will give another example of the impurity of the Sufis’ spirits. There is a mancalled “Mowlana”93in our times who was a student of Safi ‘Ali Shah (and it is saidhe is his successor). This man composed a masnaviin history called “The Worldand Adam” which has been published. I will cite a few lines of this poem whichis in praise of Timurlang94:When the flag of Timur, Shah of GorganBecame the most famous in the world,His power extended from the veranda of the universeAnd his justice encompassed man and beastSomeone who has engaged in chellehand traversed “stations” flatters Timur thebloodthirsty 600 years after his death in this example, which has come from thedarkness of his soul. He discusses the “justice” of this Timur who ordered theexecution of people for disobedience and killed 70,000 in Isfahan and built aminaret from the skulls of those executed in Baghdad. And that justice encom-passed man and the beasts!A person whose spirit is pure must have no trace or flaw of tyranny within him.Here there is a distinction between the spirit and the soul because the spirit cravesjustice, progress and compassion and is has no trace of tyranny and destruction.So, what an impure spirit that person has who has no fear of Timur’s bloodlettingbut instead has busied himself in such flattery.The Sufis have not had the least fear in lyingOne of the ugly acts of the Sufis that has polluted their spirits (which we mustpresent as a separate discussion) has been their fearlessness in lying and spinningtales. They did not consider lying wrong because they did not have the slightestfear. It is true that the Sufis have been a store of lies. If I busy myself with thestories and untrue tales, and the innumerable speeches, or their evil boasting,I would be obliged to write hundreds of pages. Instead, I will busy myself withonly a single thread of their lies.“SUFISM”97"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"“SUFISM”98If you read Sufi books, you will see that they continuously recount impossibleacts (or in their words, “charismatic powers” (karamat)) [performed] by their mas-ters and eminent ones. They go so far as to say that the Sufi masters prevailed overthe laws of nature and they were even able to subvert them. They were able toengage in acts outside of these laws such as walking on water, talking to animalsand plants, being aware of the unseen, transforming earth into gold and rocksinto jewels, curing the sick, raising the dead and others like these.This was something ineffable according to them, and they have writtenhundreds of these kind of stories. They are unbelievable tales: stories that mustbe called “outlandish lies” in the words of the common people. I will recount anumber of stories as an example.It has been related that once the company of Sufis in Meyhaneh hadgone several days without meat. For more than a week Hasan did notprocure any meat. Meanwhile, the group went on desiring meat, thoughthey did not show it openly. One day our Sheikh rose to his feet and wentforth with the company of Sufis through the gate that leads to theMarv road. Then they ascended the hill called Za‘qal. This hill stands atthe edge of the desert of Marv. Mention of it was made earlier on.Whenever a state of contraction came over the Sheikh, this is where hewould go. When the Sheikh had ascended the hill, he came to a halt andwaited a moment. A gazelle appeared out of the countryside and headedin the direction of the Sheikh and his followers. Coming before theSheikh, she fell on the ground and rolled over. Tears flowed fromthe Sheikh’s eyes and he said, “No, not this! Not this!” Meanwhile thegazelle continued to roll on the ground in front of the Sheikh. Then theSheikh turned to the group and said, “Do you know what this gazelle issaying? She says, ‘I have come to sacrifice myself for the companions, sothat you may have peace of mind.’ And I say, ‘No, not this, because youhave young ones to tend.’ But she insists.” Then the Sheikh and ourcompanions wept profusely. They let out shouts and ecstatic states wereexperienced. All the while the gazelle rolled about on the ground. Thenthe Sheikh gave instructions to Hasan, saying, “Take her to the shop ofSa‘id, the butcher, and tell him to slaughter her with a sharp knife inaccordance with the sacred custom, and to prepare a meal for the Sufistonight.” Hasan did as the Sheikh had instructed him and that night thegroup of Sufis enjoyed the meat of that gazelle.95It is related that one day someone came [to see Bayazid] and asked himabout modesty. The Sheikh answered him, and that person becameembarrassed. Another person passed by and saw a yellow puddle. Hestood still and asked, “O Sheikh! What happened?” He replied, “Someonecame to see me and asked a question about modesty. I answered him, buthe could not bear my answer, and he became embarrassed.”96"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Once Rabi‘a ‘Adwiya decided to perform the hajj, and so she went intothe desert, but in the middle of the desert [her] donkey died. People said,“We will carry your baggage.” She replied, “You go ahead because Ihave not come here to be reliant upon you.” So they went ahead andRabi‘a remained alone. And so she prayed, “Oh God! Kings do suchthings to a helpless, needy woman. You called me your house, but thenyou killed my donkey halfway there, and left metol all alone in thedesert.” She had not completed her prayer when the donkey began totwitch and it got up. Rabi‘a put her baggage on the donkey and pro-ceeded [on her hajj].97It is related that on another occasion Rabi‘a went to Mecca, andhalfway there she saw the Ka’ba which had come to greet her. Rabi‘a said,“I want the Lord of the house! What do I want with the house itself ?”98It is related that Ibrahim Adham once sat on the banks of the RiverTigris and was sewing a patch on his worn out cloak when his needle fellinto the river. Someone asked him, “What has a king found who has lostso much?”99He pointed to the river and said, “Give me my needle.” Athousand fish appeared on the surface of the river and each one had agold needle in its mouth. Ibrahim said, “I want my needle.” A weak fishappeared with his needle in its mouth and said, “This is the most abjectthing that I found left for the King of Balkh. You do not know100of theother things.”101In the Masnavi, Rumi tells a story of Bayazid Bastami who sometimes declaredin a drunken state Glory be to me! How great is my majesty!Once [his] followers tookhim to task for this. Bayazid said, “If after this I make such a declaration, attackme with knives and kill me.” Once more he made such a declaration and hisfollowers took up their knives and fell upon him madly, but,Whoever slashed at the sheikhRipped at his own body instead.Not a mark was found on the body of that master of artsAnd those disciples were exhausted, drowning in blood.102These stories are so disreputable. [But] we don’t want to search and find theirnotorious stories. There are writings that astound anyone who reads them.Several years ago I read a book in Arabic about Sheikh ‘Abd al-Qadir Gilani, sev-eral sections of which have remained in my mind. The Ka‘baalways rotatedaround the Sheikh’s head, the sun came out seeking the smallest things from theSheikh and the moon arrived to take orders from him. His grandson said, “I sawthe moon many times when it was new or full, come before the Sheikh andrequest something.”One day the Sheikh was informed that such and such a disciple had died.The Sheikh became angry that ‘Azra‘il had taken the soul of one of his followers“SUFISM”99"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"without asking his permission. In a second he flew up to heaven and stood in frontof ‘Azra‘il and in anger he kicked out at that glass container full of spirits whichwas in the hands of ‘Azra‘il.103He smashed that glass container, and all the spiritswere freed, so that the people who had died on that day came to life again.Another series of their lies on this topic is that they invented a story for theperson who became a king or reached an eminent position. “When he becamethe disciple of such and such a sheikh, the latter gave the former the kingdom.”In this way they gained unworthy benefit from any opportunity.Toghral and his brothers (who on several occasions waged war against SoltanMas‘ud Ghaznavi and others) established a great dynasty. In the books of theSufis we see that one day they went to Abu Sa‘id, and the sheikh raised his headand said, “We have given Khorasan to Chagri, and Iraq to Toghral”104and in wasowing to this that they established that dynasty.This boasting about bestowing the country and coronation by the Sufis hasmany roots and has become so unparalleled that Hafez-e Shirazi (who wanted topresent the kharabatisas a group of God seekers among the Sufis, and whateverthey said about themselves he also attributed to the kharabatis– or in their ownwords rendan105) also coined a phrase for such a coronation. He says:The Qalandar rendanare at the tavern doorTo take and to give kingship’s crown.This boasting reached an extent that in our own time we see it has been takenadvantage of by Shat Mehr Baba. We read in his book that the kingship of RezaShah Pahlavi and the things he did in Iran were all the result of the Shat MehrBaba’s concern for Iran when he was in India and the journey that he made toBushehr. We can cite a few sentences from his book. [The book] is verbose on the“reality and miracles of Shat Mehr Baba”, for example it states:One of his greatest miracles that is evident, clear, manifest and apparentfor everyone (and all the world is reflecting and wondering about itsoccurrence, but no one is informed about its origin) is the current stateand progress of Iran, the disappearance of the Qajars and the estab-lishment of the Pahlavi dynasty, and the elevation of his excellency RezaShah to the Iranian throne. This was the first service that Shat MehrBaba carried out in this world after [his] connection to God. It was forthis purpose that he travelled to the Iranian border (to the port ofBushehr) and then returned [to India]. In 1924 after a whole tour ofIndia, he set off with several of his followers and disciples with the inten-tion of visiting Iran. After arriving in Bushehr, they stayed there severaldays, they cancelled the rest of their voyage and returned [to India]. Thereason and cause of this journey and return are not completely clear, itcan only be concluded that the intention was not for journeying andtouring, rather, it became clear from an allusion that it was to carry out“SUFISM”100"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"a great commission and to effect a complete change and alteration ofwhich he spoke ambiguously. A seed had been planted, the sign andeffect of which would soon become clear and apparent. In other words,from that time on in a troubled Iran there occurred dramatic changes inthe political, economic and legal conditions. And day by day the state ofaffairs improved to the extent that we have reached today.The point to make with regard to these stories is that they are all lies. Of any paththat we accept, these have not been among them and could not have been. Theevents in these stories are all impossibilities.If we take the path of religion God has created laws for worldly affairs, andthere can be nothing outside worldly laws. It is impossible for a dead donkey to beresurrected at the command of another person. It is impossible for the Ka‘batorise from its place and go to meet someone or rotate around someone’s head. It isimpossible for fish beneath the water to rise to the surface at someone’s command,each with a golden needle in its mouth. It is impossible that at the wish of a Sufia person becomes a king.God’s laws are not a toy that someone can overcome and change to demon-strate his own skill. Whatever they have said about Moses and Jesus and otherprophets is also just a lie. Greater than Moses and Jesus was the prophet of Islam,for whenever they asked him for a “miracle” [literally, an impossibility], heshowed [them] powerlessness: it is this Qur’an of his that is in our hands.If we follow the path of history, then we find that these stories exist only in theSufi books and there is no trace or mention of them in history books. If Rabi‘ahad resurrected her dead donkey then the fame of her act would have spreadeverywhere and thousands of people would have hurried to see her and herdonkey. Everyone would have been made aware of this and it would have beenrecorded in history. The same applies to the other stories.If we look with the eye of wisdom, nothing can occur in the world withouta cause, and all events are connected to one another. Reza Shah was a militaryofficer who became Shah as a result of his own efforts and events in Iran andEurope. It is the wish of Shat Mehr Baba that has no existence.If we follow the path of proof why don’t these Sufis reveal those same skills(or charismatic powers) so that there can be no room left for discussion? In ourtime there are Sufis. One of them should come and resurrect a dead person sothat everyone can see. If that dead person should remain alive and walk, everyonewould be stupefied. So why doesn’t one of them do such a thing? Why doesn’tShat Mehr Baba perform such a “miracle”? But let’s leave this to one side. Whydoesn’t Shat Mehr Baba want India (which is his homeland) to advance? Whydoesn’t he want it to improve? So why is it always the case that the Sufi mastersattribute to themselves the tasks that someone else has performed?Why did the Sufi masters who knew the “greatest name” and were able to turnmud into gold and stone into jewels resort to begging? Why did they becomedebtors, and why did they seek loans from this person and that person? We read“SUFISM”101"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"in the Secrets of Unitythat Abu Sa‘id asked a rich person to pay his debts and thatrich person promised to do so, but he did not fulfil his pledge, and Abu Sa’idbecame angry and cursed him so that one night his dogs ripped that rich man topieces. On reading this story I was reminded of another story that I had once readin a book. A servant of God carried wheat to a mill. The owner of the mill hadmuch work and paid the servant of God no attention. The latter became angryand said, “If you don’t grind my wheat before that of the others I will make a curseso that your donkey will be turned into stone.” The mill owner said, “If your placeis so near to God why would you turn my donkey to stone? Why didn’t you prayfor your wheat to be ground so that there would be no need to come to the mill?”There is no doubt that those “charismatic powers” are all lies. If we search forthe motive of this [we see that] its history is that the Sufis (who ventured downthis crooked path and spent years there manifesting a darkness in the soul andmind) claimed a “connection to God” and they pretended that they had reachedanother world and reached a more exalted station. Since they called this lie[i.e. the place they claimed to have reached] the footstool (kursi) they were obligedto claim that they had the power to perform “charismatic powers” and to busythemselves in telling yet another string of lies. They were obliged to invent stories.Each follower considered it proper to recognise his own master’s possession ofsuch an exalted station and the ability to perform “charismatic powers”. And heconsidered it proper to invent and spread those fabricated stories. The Sufitradition which was based on lies was guarded by other lies.From this perspective, these false charismatic powers were tools in the hands ofthe Sufis who sat idle and continually turned to the wealthy people and they madethem fearful or hopeful by saying things like “so and so became king because hegave money to a dervish,” or “the son of so and so died young because he did notgive money to a dervish.” These were sharp tools because they made wealthy,superstitious people give money.These were the motives behind the Sufis inventing those false stories. But morestartling than this is that some of the Sufis took a greater step and pretended thatdisplaying “miracles” and “charismatic powers” could occur at the beginning ofthe Sufi path and at the time when the Sufi traveller was still inexperienced. Whenhe became more advanced and more experienced he did not respect “charismaticpowers” and did not consider them worthy for himself. It has been related ofBayazid Bastami that he said, “In the beginning of [my] states God used to showme charismatic powers and signs, but I did not pay attention to them. When Godrealised this he showed me the path of his gnosis.”This is another example of the extent to which the Sufi followers busiedthemselves in showing off. Whenever there is talk of charismatic powers these Sufipeople have said they are superior and they gave this excuse. From this perspec-tive, it was a veil with which they covered their own inability, and they offer thisexcuse if people demanded a “charismatic power”.We do not want to go on about this. The conclusion to be drawn from thisdiscussion is that the Sufis were men of impure spirits, and this is an example of“SUFISM”102"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"their impurity which reached the extent of insolent lying and being rude aboutGod and his laws. People who have a good opinion about the Sufis are unawareof all this.An amazing thing in the book The Secrets of Unity(which is full of the “miracles”of Abu Sa‘id and many amazing deeds that have been attributed to him) is thatthe sheikh understood the secrets in the heart of each person, he flew in the airwhen he went to Sarkhas106, he spoke with animals107and informed Toghral andhis brothers they would become kings. In that book, despite all of this, there isa story of a person who went to see the sheikh and asked for a “charismaticpower” which he could see with his eyes. The sheikh was stuck and made anexcuse. Since this story is another testimony to the lies of the Sufis, we will presentit below:Master ‘Abd al-Rahman (who taught our Sheikh Abu Sa‘id to read) saidthat when our Sheikh was in Nishapur someone came to see him andsaid, “I am a stranger in this city. The whole city speaks about you. Thepeople say that there is a man here who performs charismatic powers.Now, show one to me!”Our Sheikh said, “I was in Amol with Abu ’l-‘Abbas Qassab whensomeone – just as is the case with you – came to see him and made thissame request and asked him to perform a charismatic power. SheikhAbu ’l-‘Abbas replied, ‘But don’t you see what it is that is not a charis-matic power? What you see here is the son of a butcher who learned thebutcher’s trade from his father. Something was shown to this person [i.eAbu ’l-‘Abbas] and he was taken to Baghdad to the spiritual masterShebli, and he went from Baghdad to Mecca, and from Mecca toMedina, and from Medina to Jerusalem. Then they showed him Khezr,and persuaded the latter to accept him. Then he returned here and thepeople turned to him and they abandoned the taverns, become absolvedfrom evil and repented, and gave away their wealth. From all parts of theworld those who had been burnt [by love] come and seek Him throughme. What greater charismatic power is there than this?’ Then that mansaid, ‘O Sheikh! I want to see a charismatic power for myself right now.’He replied, ‘Look well! Is it not a divine gift that the son of a goatbutcher sits in the place of honour among the great and he does not fallto the ground, nor do these walls collapse on him, nor does this housecrash down on his head? He has dominion without property or wealth.He eats his daily food and feeds others despite having no means and nowork. Is this not a charismatic power?’ Then the Sheikh said, “Ohgenerous fellow! I’m having the same problem with you as Abu ’l-‘Abbashad with the person who posed the question.” The man replied,“O Sheikh, I’m asking you to show me a charismatic power, and youkeep talking about Sheikh Abu ’l-‘Abbas.” The Sheikh said, “Whoeverbelongs entirely to the Bountiful (Karim), all his acts are charismatic“SUFISM”103"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"powers (karamat).” Then he smiled and recited:Each wind that blows from Bokhara bears musk,A jasmine’s scent, or perfume of the rose.But every man or woman on whom it blowsSays, “This wind must be arriving from Khotan!”But no! No wind so sweet blows from KhotanThis wind arrives from my beloved’s breast.To catch sight of you each night I turn towards Yemen.For you are Canopus, rising over Yemen.My idol, I strive to conceal your name from men,To keep your name from the lips of the multitude,But though I would, or not, with whomever I speak,Your name is the first word to come from my tongue.Then our Sheikh said, “When the Truth purifies the servant and dis-tances him from his lower self, all the doings and sayings of that servantare charismatic powers.”The blessings of Allah be upon Mohammad and hisfamily, one and all.108Readers of these episodes think well! That man asked for a “charismaticpower” and Abu Sa‘id told a story and recited poetry in reply. In doing so, justlike his own sheikh he made himself appear not lacking. And so he did notrespond to the claim of a “charismatic power” and said, “The Truth hasmade this servant pure...All the actions of this servant have been turned intocharismatic powers.”How the Iranians were vanquished by the MongolsThere is a puzzle in Iranian history that has not been solved until now. We knowof the terrible events associated with the Mongols, but the puzzle is how theIranians were so easily vanquished by them.To understand the answer it is necessary to remember that Iranians themselveshad been war-like and bold people. From ancient times Iran had always main-tained an army and fought in wars, and the Iranians were belligerent once theyembraced Islam because it prescribed war and effort on each person.If we focus on Iranians in the final stages of the tenth century and the begin-ning of the eleventh century, we see that during this period Iranians became verybold and belligerent. It was during this period that the Samanids109inTransoxania opposed a large group of Turks and they resisted their attacks andinvasions. As Estakhri110and others have recorded they kept 300,000 horsemenready and armed at the border. In this period too, Soltan Mahmud Ghaznaviattacked the vast territories of India with his soldiers, and he captured and plun-dered its cities. Also during this period, the Daylamis and Gilanis poured out of“SUFISM”104"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"their mountainous homes and established dynasties, and the Buyids111advancedas far as Baghdad and had the Caliph under their control. With these wars andmilitary struggles these states manifested no friendship or cordiality with oneanother; indeed, wars broke out among them.With all these wars and military attention in the country, it is clear that 10,000men assembled in battle lines in Asia Minor each year. In the wars that occurredannually in spring and summer the Muslims united against the Turks. One yearwe find that 80,000 men came from Khorasan to Asia Minor for these battles.One should say that Iran was intoxicated and brimming with acts of plunder andbravery.Estakhri says, “I went to the house of each village chief when I was inTransoxania, and I would see a horse in the stable and a sword hanging fromthe wall.”These circumstances prevailed among the Iranians from the beginning of theeleventh century, and when that century passed it continued into the next century.But Iran suffered in the thirteenth century when the Mongols invaded. It is at thispoint that we are faced with a historical puzzle. We see Chingiz Khan came andspent four years in Transoxania, Khwarazm and Bokhara, plundered the cities,killed the men and carried off the women and did not hold back from commit-ting any oppression against the peoples of those areas. Despite this, the people ofKhorasan, Azarbayjan, Iraq, Fars and other places did not budge an inch. It didnot occur to a single person to assemble a force and hurry to assist those who hadbeen oppressed or prepare themselves for war with the Mongols, should theycome in their direction. Not one out of millions of people displayed such bravery.Worse than all of this was that Chingiz Khan sent two of his generals by thename of Yama112and Sutay113with 30,000 soldiers after Khwarazm Shah.114They passed the Jayhan River, and the murderers reached Khorasan. One groupwent through Mazandaran and the other group went through Khavar andVaramin and reached Rayy and Hamadan. At these places they continued thekilling and other outrages. Then they went to Azarbayjan to rest for the winter,and then once more they split up to continue the killing and plunder.The Iranians had neither the courage to wage war and drive the enemy away,nor did they have the wisdom to come out and protect themselves and remainsecure and preserve their families from catastrophe. Weak-minded people didfoolish things in front of the enemy but were defeated all too quickly and werevanquished.In all of this only Tabriz among the great Iranian cities remained at peaceunder the sagacious and brave shadow of Shams al-Din Toghra’i who on the onehand assembled a force and made the city’s fortifications strong and on the otherhand was not foolish but sent messengers to the Mongols and knocked on thedoor of peace and friendship. This was the first time that the Mongols saw wiseand brave behaviour from the Iranians. As a result of this they accepted Shamsal-Din’s request and did not occupy Tabriz, and it was saved from the killing andplunder.“SUFISM”105"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Other cities including Marv, Balkh, Nishapur, Rayy and Hamadan sufferedgreatly. Yama and Sutay returned to their military base via the Caucasus, Georgiaand the north of the Caspian Sea after they had completed the task that they hadbeen given.In the words of Ibn Athir115inKemal al Tavarikh,116this was one great heart-wrenching tragedy.Yes it was a great heart-wrenching tragedy that 30,000 men came from one sideof the country, and murderers and plunderers left from the other side. TheIranian people were so weak and helpless that they could not stop them. If theyhad not been so weak and helpless then not one of those 30,000 would have leftIran alive. It is true that they did not have soldiers experienced in war and theywould not have been able to come out in war. But they would have been able toresist them in this neck of land or in that valley and ambush them, attacking andthen fleeing. If the people had been motivated and ready for war, then a braveperson would have arisen from their ranks and a leader would have appearedfrom the princes. The point is that the Iranians were not motivated at all: they sawsuch a bloodthirsty enemy in this country of ours and no one budged an inch toresist him.We ask from where did this lack of effort and weakness originate? What wasthe cause of this heartlessness and abjectness? Were not the Iranians those peoplewho had shown their bravery and war mongering in the tenth and eleventh cen-turies? So how was it that in the thirteenth century we witnessed this helplessnessand weakness? What had happened in the course of those 200 years?Until the present age no one has engaged in a discussion or an investigation ofthis topic, let alone give an answer to these questions. But we know the answerto them.During these 200 years some evil and polluted teachings had becomewidespread in Iran and were spread among the people. They caused them all tobanish thoughts of war and manliness from their minds and prevented their innerfeelings from functioning. One of those evil teachings was Sufism, another wasBatenism117and yet another was Kharabatism.118(We have been dealing with Sufismin this small book, and we have explained BatenismandKharabatismtoo in anotherplace.) It was this ignorance and these evil teachings that made the people of Iranweak and heartless and made the Mongol victory so easy.It is true, just as the history books say, that the unwise disobedience of SoltanMohammad Khwarazm Shah brought the Mongols to Iran. His fear andignorance caused the loss of several hundred thousand experienced soldiers (whowould have been able to oppose the Mongols). Al-Nasir li-Din Allah (the AbbasidCaliph) and other eminent people manifested nothing but weakness. They did notget involved, just as it is recorded in the history books. After all this, we ask whythe Iranians and the Muslims in other places did not act after the Mongols hadcommitted that butchery in Transoxania? Why didn’t they hurry to help theirfellow country men? Why didn’t they think about their future? Even if youput this aside, what can we say of the story of those 30,000 men? Why didn’t“SUFISM”106"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"[the Iranians] resist the attacks and killing committed by Yama and Sutay?A people who witnessed the bloodthirsty enemy at close hand should have stoodup and rebelled and thought of a solution to the problem. If they were not ableto wage war face to face, then they should have taken control of mountain passesor defended the cities behind the defensive walls.In that age Iran was a bigger country, and there were more people in cities andvillages, and so the Iranians warmly supported the Muslims of Iraq, Syria, Egyptand other places. What happened to such a great mass of people that theybecame vanquished and impotent?The answer is the same as that we have given previously. When the Mongolscame to Iran ideas about the country, war, bravery and these kind of things haddisappeared and been forgotten for a long time. Another set of ideas – rangingfrom the worthlessness of the world, the evils of war, the futility of effort andothers like these – had taken their place. Not everyone was a Sufi or a KharabatioraBateni, but their evil teachings had found a way into everyone’s heart.We have a good book from those times that can serve as a useful testimony toour views. It is the travelogue of Ibn Jubayr119who left Andalus in 578(1199–1200) and travelled to Mecca via Egypt and by sea, and on his return hesaw Iraq, Syria and other places. In his book he gives us good information on thecircumstances of the Muslims. In his writings he says there were many Sufiseverywhere who spent their time at ease and in comfort. The Sufi evil teachingshad become prevalent everywhere and they had turned dervish-hood, abstinenceand disregard for the world into a good excuse for showing off. Everywherepreachers persuaded the people to cry. Everywhere there was talk of “love forGod” and “ecstasy” and the like. In Baghdad, Ibn Jawzi120who was considered themost eminent preacher there ascended the minbarand recited Sufi-like poems andmoved the people to tears. Each time he persuaded many people to shave theirheads, become dervishes and to choose abstinence. You will not find one passageamong all the stories that he wrote in his book where he discusses the protection ofthe country, war and bravery. Everywhere the Muslims were far from these kindsof thoughts, and the protection of the country, opposition to the enemy and wag-ing war with them are considered the duties of kings and princes and their soldiers.They regarded them as “people of the world” and as contemptible.To comprehend fully the extent to which these evil teachings of the Sufisand others were influential, and to what extent they distanced thoughts ofwar and bravery from the minds of the Muslims and even turned awayunderstanding and wisdom, we have another historical story that we will mention.Yama and Sutay came to one part of the country along with 30,000 men andleft from the other side, shedding so much blood and causing ruin. Chingiz Khandid not relent during four years in Transoxania, Khwarazm and Bokhara fromkilling and plundering, and then he reached Khorasan and advanced to Ghaznahand from there returned to Mongolia with hundreds of thousands of girls andwomen that he had captured. His sons Aktai and Tulai had committed muchmurder and plunder in Khorasan, and they destroyed a number of large cities.“SUFISM”107"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"In the light of this episode, what should the Iranians and Muslims have done?Shouldn’t they have sat down and considered the lessons of the past? What wasthe cause of these calamities, and what should be done in the future? Shouldn’tthey have understood that the Mongols would come again, and shouldn’t theyhave thought of a way to prevent this?But history shows well that they were careless people and they forgot thosebloody episodes, and each group was concerned with its own problems. We readof episodes in those times, each one of which is the cause of amazement andsorrow. One of these episodes is the story of the religious seminary (madrasa) ofal-Mustansir Billah [caliph from 1226–42],121and just as we have stated, this isconsidered an historical story.As the grandson of al-Nasir li Din Allah, al-Mustansir Billah succeeded him asCaliph, and he began this seminary in Baghdad in the year 1227 (seven years afterthe retreat of Chingiz Khan). He donated much wealth for the establishment ofthat seminary. When it was completed in 1234, he opened it with muchpomp, and he appointed several hundred jurists and several hundred Sufisthere, who could provide the food, drink, clothing and other necessities forlivelihood.122The name of this seminary has been mentioned in many books, and manypeople consider it as an example of “Islamic civilisation”.123But if we tell thetruth it is an example of the weak-mindedness of the Muslims and the impotenceand lack of correct initiative of the Caliph and his men.124If the Muslims hadnot been blind and weak-minded, then they would not have forgotten the evilintentions of the Mongols or the hundred thousand women and girls who had amiserable existence in Mongolia, and they would have prepared themselves andthought of a plan. Whether jurist or Sufi or whether someone else, instead ofdoing anything else, they would have been mind-full of the art of war, and theCaliph would have emptied his treasuries to the soldiers and bought arma-ments and built defences. Seven years had not yet passed since all of that blood-shedding, yet they had already forgotten it. Instead they busied themselves inbuilding a school (or we should say more correctly a nest for making jurists andSufis), and they inaugurated it with great pomp. It is the best proof that there wasno zeal or bravery left, not to mention wisdom and reason (whether in the Caliphor the people), and it served these people right that the Mongols returned, com-mitted murder, set [cities] alight and took prisoners and in the end capturedBaghdad and spent forty days in killing.In Iran we have another historical testimony of the people’s weak-mindednessand their bloated minds. This is the Golestan(“Rose Garden”) and the poetry ofSa‘di. This poet, who lived in the Mongol period and saw all of the sickeningtyranny and heard the cries of the oppressed, had such a bloated mind that onecan find neither any mention of it, nor can one find the slightest sympathy in him.He does not mention that tyranny in any of his poetry and prose works, and hedoes not manifest any sympathy. He composed ghazals,qasideh, told the stories ofhis friends, flattered the rich and gave stupid advice. In one place he even calls the“SUFISM”108"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"year 656/1258 (which was the year of the sacking of Baghdad) his year ofpleasure:At that period when we had such a good time656 years had passed since the hegira.In all the poetry of this great poet he mentions the Mongols twice. One of themoccurs because of the flattery and weakness, and he laments the killing ofMusta’sim and the sky sheds tears of blood:The sky had the right to shed tears of blood upon the earthAt the death of King Musta’sim, Commander of the Believers.It was only Musta’sim’s murder that Sa‘di regreted.The other occasion where he mentions the Mongols is when he puts his jests ofa terrible episode into poetry, and in the middle of his insensitivity he comments:Put the copper trumpets in that tribeJust like the killing sword of Baghdad.This is from a poet who says elsewhere:You who are unconcerned about others’ miseryAre not worthy to be called a human being.He says this since his mind was bloated with these things and did not rememberthat he himself was unconcerned and unaware of the pain and sorrow of hisfellow men.Just as I said, the stories and writings of this poet are yet another historicalwitness to the circumstances of the Iranians and Muslims of that age.At this point, the scope of the discussion is widening and we can draw anotherconclusion from it. Since it was said that human beings need religion, they need apath that leads them forward in life and prevents the kind of suffering [experiencedby Iranians under the Mongols]. These Sufis (and likewise, the Kharabatis) consid-ered themselves higher than that they should follow religion. You see how theyhave been the cause for the ruin of hundreds of millions of people, how they havebeen responsible for the bloodshed of hundreds of thousands of men and women.Vile men have enjoyed sitting [idle] scorning life, and they have made peoplecold-hearted and attracted them to a lazy and abject life. They have enjoyedbelittling war and manliness, and they have called sitting in the khanaqah, perform-ing ascetic tasks and other acts like these “the greater jihad” (and they consider[these acts] “disputes with the lower self ”). They have enjoyed filling their heartswith their own fabrications, while casting aside any worthy knowledge or belief.Even in Sufi books, there are stories of the arrival of the Mongols. Eachone of the stories is another good witness to these words of ours. For example,“SUFISM”109"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"“SUFISM”110Najm al-Din Razi (who is considered one of the Sufi greats) lived when theMongols came [to Iran] and fled when he heard the Mongols approaching Rayy.He himself in Mersad al-’ebadcomments:When the ferocious conquests of those accursed and godforsaken onesbegan, this feeble one stayed patiently for almost a year in the lands ofIraq, and in the hope that the morning of salvation might dawn after thesombre night of catastrophe and disaster and that the sun of goodfortune might rise again, endured all kinds of severe hardship and tribu-lation. For I was loath to abandon my children and womenfolk, to partfrom my friends and dear ones and to leave house and home behind; andneither was it possible to bring forth from those lands all my dependantsand following, nor did my heart permit me to expose them to destruc-tion and perdition. Finally, when the catastrophe passed all bounds andthe disaster exceeded all limits, when life itself was endangered and theknife cut through to the bone, it became necessary to declare that “neces-sity renders permissible the forbidden”. Obeying the command ofO ye whobelieve, guard your own souls; he who is astray cannot harm you, if you are rightlyguarded, (5:104) I was compelled to abandon all of my kith and kin; prof-iting from the adage that “he who has saved his head has truly profited”,and conforming to the principle that “flight from the unendurable is a customof the prophets”, I had to depart and entrust my dear ones to calamity.When no disaster threatened, dearly did he cherish him;But when he saw disaster coming, he left him to his fate.Know then that in times of troubleThere is none who will stand by you, none!One night in the year 618 (1221), this feeble one left his abode inHamadan with a group of cherished dervishes, and confronting extremeperil set out on the road to Ibril. Soon the news caught up with us thatthe accursed infidels – may God destroy and abase them! – had reachedHamadan and beleaguered it. The people of the city strove to defend itas best they could, but when their power to resist was exhausted, the infi-dels triumphed and captured the city. They martyred many men, tookcaptive numerous women and children, and wrought utter destruction.Most of my kinfolk who had been in the city of Rayy were martyred.Hail rained down upon my garden;Not a leaf remained on the rosebush.125Read this passage well in order to comprehend what the Sufis were like andhow they influenced people. This man says that he was patient for one year forthe calamity to come to an end. This ignoramus hoped that the Mongols wouldretreat of their own accord. He saw that in Transoxania, Bokhara, Khwarazm"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"“SUFISM”111and Khorasan they did whatever they wanted, killed as many people as theycould and then retreated. And the people of Iraq (Rayy and Hamadan) andother places were relieved and released from their fear and terror. He was patientfor a year and had this hope, and as a result of his ignorance he did not realisethat Iranians had to struggle to remove this calamity. He did not realise that heand others in authority had to come forward and agitate the people and stopthem from merely looking after their own families. His thinking did not extendthis far.So you see what abjectness in that he left his own women and children withoutprotection and he fled from Hamadan with several “dervishes” who were hisdeputies. This little man did not go to Rayy to be with his family whether theywere killed or whether they fled.Worse than this is the excuses they make: “necessity renders permissible theforbidden”. Is this sentence which has been taken from the books of jurispru-dence appropriate here? Why couldn’t you take your women and children withyou? That verse which comes from the Qur’an [O you who believe. . .] was revealedin an early period of Islam when on becoming a Muslim a person had no con-cern for his family if they remained idol-worshippers. Where does this verse sayanything about entrusting one’s women and children to the enemy, and wheredoes it say anything about escaping?It was their habit that when they fabricated [their] conceits they quoted sen-tences from the Qur’an,hadith, poetry and other [literary] sources out of context.The following is a good example:When no disaster threatened, dearly did he cherish him;But when he saw disaster coming, he left him to his fate.Does this piece of poetry speak in praise or in reproach?As I have said, this man was one of the eminent Sufis, and this episode is anexample of [the behaviour] of one of them. It is a good example because they didnot want anything more in life than being freed from the cares of labour andeffort, and they would eat food from any source (even [if it came] throughbegging), and in times of trouble they refused to look at the path ahead and hoped[the troubles] would go away. If they did not then they fled for their lives.This was their way and it is the lowest form of life.The benefits gained by the Sufis from Mongol ruleIf we want to summarise the history of Islam since the Mongol era in just a fewsentences we should say [the following]:Islam stimulated people’s minds, aroused their excitement and united variousgroups. As a result it attracted a large number of people, and a very powerful"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"country appeared. But Shi‘ism, Batenism, Sufism and Kharabatism were leechesthat stuck to the body of that mass of people and country, and they sucked itsblood and sapped its strength, transforming it into something useless. It neededtesting to know just what it had become. That test was the Mongol episode.It is to be regretted that the Mongol victory occurred as a result of the spread ofthese evil teachings, and yet once again these evil teachings (aside from Batenism)increased in circulation and caused even more harm and damage. But [our] subjectis Sufism, and as we said, it was in the Mongol era that the largest orders appearedin Iran and other places and the numbers of Sufis increased even more.It is the misfortune of Iranians that the Mongol era was so long that severalvolumes must be written to cover it. The weak-mindedness was so common thatpeople praised Chingiz Khan as someone brought by God and caused by God’sanger. They had no rancour against the Mongols. Hamdallah Mostawfi126whowas one of the wisest men of his time recognised Chingiz as “a master of thecommand”, and he composed the following about him:There is no fleeing the royal fortune;The king is like the shadow of the Creator.But it is appropriate for the people and the timesNo doubt, that God should send kings.Sometimes out of the shade of kindness and sometimes out of wrathGod bestows a great king.If the servants perform good actsThey do so to be saved.The king gives to them as they deserve,Because a stranger gives more generously than themselves.And if the servants change their viewGod becomes angry with them.Through his anger a ruthless kingHe sends to that community.You would think that he had no other task;A single soul he wishes not to remain.He remembers nothing but tormenting the people,There is no enjoyment other than fighting.Neither country nor village remains[safe]from him,Because of his activities destruction appears in the world.From that period too, we have the travelogue of Ibn Batutta.127He undertooka long journey in the Hejaz, Iraq, Iran, India and other places in the last years ofthe Mongol era. He saw many Sufis everywhere and had meetings with their pirs.From his book it is clear that in the 100 years and more of Mongol rule, Sufismhad spread very much.The truth is that in those circumstances which had befallen the Iranians andthe Muslims (when the bloodthirsty enemy was attacking them, killing millions of“SUFISM”112"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"men, carrying off hundreds or thousands of women and girls and when a seriesof kings ruled the country) they should have chosen one of two options. Eitherthey should have agreed with one another and united in a great, historical, self-sacrificing movement, seeking revenge against the Mongols and driving them outof the country. Or they should have rejected thoughts of revenge and bravery butspent their time in soothing their hearts and relieving their grief at the skirts ofSufism and Kharabatism. They should have chosen either this or that. The miser-able people of Iran were so defiled and did not have worthy leaders or chiefs thatthey chose the second option, and this was the reason that Sufism and Kharabatismspread day by day and the evil teachings increased even more.Another thing was that the Sufis also sought to benefit from the Mongoladvance. They took the opportunity of the people’s misfortune and misery togain advantages. Since this is one of the Sufis’ really disgraceful acts I willelaborate on this.Previously I said that one of the evil Sufi methods was that they sought toderive benefit from various circumstances and events. In other words, when acommander was victorious in war and became king they would attribute thatevent to themselves and say something like, “When so and so came to kiss thehand of our Sheikh, the Sheikh said, ‘I have given the kingship of such and sucha place to you.’ ” When a king was killed or deposed from the throne they claimedsomething like, “He was an enemy of the Friends of God, and he did not give anymoney when our Sheikh asked it of him.” If someone’s young son died, or a greatharm befell their trade, the Sufis would criticise them and say something like, “Hegot his punishment because he did not help the dervishes.”Just as we said, this behaviour was the result of sponging and begging whichthey thought was acceptable for themselves. In order to acquire more money fromthe people they had to engage in such repulsive acts.This behaviour, aside from revealing the Sufis’ lies and their arrogance withGod, is an example of their despicable habits. The way of manliness when some-one’s son dies or suffers some other calamity is that acquaintances and friendsoffer comfort and lighten that person’s grief. They don’t take the opportunity tocriticise that person. Such an act can be nothing other than the way of abject,envious beggars.Anyway, during the Mongol era too the Sufis acted just like this. Several yearsbefore the arrival of the Mongols, Soltan Mohammad Khwarazm Shah drownedSheikh Majd al-Din Baghdadi128(who was one of the eminent Sufis) in the watersof Khwarazm for the sin of having sexual relations with his mother, TorkanKhatun. When the terrible episode of the Mongols began the Sufis said this wasthe reason. They claimed, “God sent Chingiz Khan in revenge for the blood ofMajd-al-Din.” They added, “When Majd al-Din was killed the waters of God’sanger boiled and He sent the Mongols to exact His revenge.”They also fabricated a myth that they included in their books. Khwarazm Shahwas afraid of the consequences of killing Majd al-Din, and so he filled a pot withgold and placed a sword and a shroud on top of it and brought it to Sheikh Najm“SUFISM”113"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"al-Din Kobra129who had been Majd al-Din’s master. Khwarazm Shah took offhis turban and stood at the entrance of the room and asked for forgiveness. Hesaid, “Take this gold if you want the blood price of Majd al-Din, and use thissword to cut off my head if you desire recompense.” The Sheikh replied, “Thereis no adequate money to cover the blood-price of my child Majd al-Din. Go onyour path of kingship and kill me and others too.”You see the perversity reached a degree that they told the people the Mongolvictory was not the result of their weakness, negligence and disunity. The Sufisoffered them an alternative way, and they led the people even further astray withthese lies.This is another example of the Sufis’ arrogance before God. From whom didGod exact the blood price of Majd al-Din through the Mongols? From thewomen who knew nothing of this and the innocent children of Bokhara,Samarqand, Khwarazm, Marv, Nishabur, Rayy and Hamadan? He ruinedseveral countries for the murder of a single Sufi? This is the meaning of theirwritings!We see that in the same Mongol episode the Sufis themselves were killed. Najmal-Din Khwarazmi and Sheikh ‘Attar were killed along with others. If the Sufiswere so precious before God then how was it that God did not save them? Andhow was it that God killed all those innocent people because of the murder of asingle Sufi, yet did not stop the killing in a single city – either Nishabur orKhwarazm, to defend the Sufis who were alive? How was it that the “charismaticpowers” of the Sufis all brought such ruin?They have also fabricated such lies about Sheikh ‘Attar. “When the Mongolsoldier cut off ‘Attar’s head with a sword, the sheikh’s body ran about with hishead screaming out loud. He ran for a while and then fell to the ground.” It is notknown why a person who could perform “miracles” did not demonstrate theiruse in another way. It is not known what outcome he was aiming for with thismiracle.There is another fable about Majd al-Din in the books of the Sufis. One dayMajd al-Din was sitting with the dervishes. When a state of “attraction” overcamehim he exclaimed, “We were goose eggs, left at the edge of the river.” When hereturned to his master Najm al-Din, he related this, and his master said, “Maythey be in the river.”130Majd al-Din was afraid when he heard this. One daywhen the Sheikh arose for the sama‘, Majd al-Din was cheerful and hurried bare-foot to him and put a pot of full of coals on his head [in repentance] and stoodat the doorway. Najm al-Din said, “Since you came this way your religion andfaith are sound, but you have disclosed your secret and [the people have] heard.You have also disclosed our secret, and the world will be ruined.” Not much timeelapsed before all of these words came true.In the books of the Sufis there are many of these kind of stories which shouldbe called enigmas. They wanted to make it known that there was a way for themto another world, that they had another language and that they shared secrecywith God. This group of beggars did not refrain from making any boast, nor did“SUFISM”114"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"they refrain from their arrogance before God. Anyway, if these stories were truth,then in the words of Najm al-Din, Majd al-Din should be killed because he couldnot hold his tongue. This was God’s wish. So what crime did Khwarazm Shahcommit in killing Majd al-Din? In addition, why would God have been angry andsent the Mongols seeking his revenge?Aside from this didn’t you say that everything is God? So Khwarazm Shah wasalso God and carried out an action. God killed God. So where was the room foranger and seeking revenge? I do not know why you do not stick to the result ofwhat you said?If you meditate on those thoughts of Sufism you reach a point where youconsider good and bad, truth and falsity, tyranny and justice and darkness andlight as the same. There is no difference between Pharaoh and Moses. You claim:When colourlessness became the slave to colour,Moses waged war with Moses.131In another place, it is related that the really stupid people returned withoutunderstanding. “You say: God sent Chingiz Khan to take revenge for the blood ofMajd al-Din. What was that for? And what sense does it make?”There is another story concerning the Sufis’ profit seeking in the times of theMongols. In 628/1249–50 Jalal al-Din Khwarazm Shah fled from the Mongols inAzarbayjan and left for Kurdistan. They suddenly stormed into his camp so thathe was not even able to mount his horse. He could only flee to save his life, but hewas killed in the mountains by a Kurd. This was the story’s end of this brave man.But for many years people did not believe in his murder, and they looked out forhis return. The Sufis too hoped to profit from this, and so they wrote in their books,“The Sheikh of Sheikhs – Rokn al-Dowleh ‘Ala al-Dowleh Semnani132– said thatone day his master disappeared from the place where he had been sitting. His stu-dents were amazed. Suddenly the master re-appeared in the same place and said,Ever since Soltan Jalal al-Din fled he wore dervish clothing and acceptedthe apostasy of the “men of God”. He always selected some remote cornerof the world, awaiting death and in such and such a cave he bade farewellto life. I went to perform the prayers over him and bury him.”The truths that can be found in Plotinus’s discoursesThe evils of the Sufis are greater in number than those we have discussed in thisbook. The topics that we find in their books include trust in God, surrender,satisfaction, fear of God, self-sacrifice, patience, annihilation in God and otherslike these. There is equivocation and much senselessness in each one. Since we donot have the opportunity and we do not see even the need to mention all theirevils and senselessness, we will not bother to discuss them.“SUFISM”115"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"And the discourses of Plotinus [who was] the founder of Sufism, as we havementioned, do not have a reliable foundation. However, in his discourses there isa hidden and valuable truth. Man is not composed of this material body and soulalone, and his desires are not merely eating, sleeping, gratifying his desires andcontesting with others. Rather, in the human body there is something else thedesires of which are compassion for others, doing right to them, supporting justiceand truth, desiring the improvement of the world and the comfort of the people.This thing recognises a spirit within itself and always tries to strengthen it.Plotinus discovered this truth and valued the eminence of humans over allother creatures. But when he attempted to discuss its significance he mixed itwith fabricated fancies in the manner of other Greek philosophers and pollutedit with the unity of being (vahdat al-vojud) and other theories all of which aregroundless.From this perspective, the path that Plotinus revealed for strengthening thespirit was really crooked, and wisdom is disgusted with that path. Why must oneclose one’s eyes to the pleasures of the world? Why must one give oneself futileascetic disciplines? For whom are the pleasures of the world? Didn’t God createthis world? Is “passionate love” (‘eshq) for God appropriate? What meanings canone give to it?Also, selflessness or going out of the self, Plotinus understood, as the result ofascetic discipline and labour. Is his claim that this state occurred for him fourtimes and that he connected to God nothing but imagination? One must say thatPlotinus was deceived by his own fancies. A person cannot leave himself nor canhe connect to God.I repeat, it is true that humans are not merely composed of this material bodyand soul. It is true that there is something else in humans that has other desires.We have termed this truth – which is really valuable – in the easiest and mostbasic language “soul and spirit”. Plotinus who could not explain this in academiclanguage added a series of groundless fancies to it.It is also true that each person should be busy in strengthening the spirit. Ifsomeone remains in the state of the self the soul has triumphed and will make thespirit weak and idle. It is true that a person should not be self-willed and theremay be much need for him to strive in making trimmings and embellishments.The fact is that this task cannot be [achieved] through covering the eyes from theworld or giving oneself hardship. Just as we have shown, nothing appears fromthese things except an adverse conclusion.The first step in strengthening the spirit is understanding the world and life asit is, recognising God and his greatness and power, and discovering humaninsignificance and weakness in comparison to him, and keeping in mind andhaving in one’s sights the good results that can come from following the desires ofthe spirit. The ascetic discipline in which each person should engage includeseizing the reigns of lust, anger, revenge, selfishness and others like these whichare the dispositions of the soul. And in everything that one does, one should notbe tied to deriving one’s own pleasure but the pleasure of all.“SUFISM”116"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"These are the discourses that we have made with Plotinus, or should I say, withthe founder of Sufism. But the Sufis have not even been content with this amount,and as far as possible they have proceeded on their erroneous paths, and we donot find any truth in their discourses. However not all the famous and well-knownSufis have been evil, and sometimes some of them were merely content in sincerepurity, and the prevention of lust and selfishness, and so we have no problem withthem. But these kind of things have been few, and Sufism, taken all together, hasbeen the source of many great erroneous paths, many poisonous evil teachingsand real historical misfortunes.We did not want to discuss everything in this book (which as far as possible hasbeen written in a simple language for everyone). We did not want to mention the“ravings” and “ecstatic sayings”. We did not want to discuss the Qalandarand theirbehaviour.Another point that we must make is that Sufism today is not a simple deviation,but it is a tool for seeking profit. In this meaning, the Sufis not only do not under-stand the truths (and because they do not understand the path they have acceptedSufism and shown their firm support for it), but they also seek profit from thisdeviation, and this has been the cause that even after understanding [the truths]they have not withheld [their support of Sufism].You ask, “what profit do they seek?” The answer is that their leaders and theirfollowers live without any trouble or effort. In the words of Abu ’l-‘Abbas Qassab,“They have power (velayat) without having dominion and wealth, and they eat with-out having tools or work, and they cause the spreading of dawn’s light.” Now inIran and India, and in other places, there are several groups of this kind who rulewithout having a crown or throne, and they take the property [of the people]without giving them any answer, and in each group aside from the “pir” they givebread to a number of those around them and they spend their lives in comfort.But “Sufism” for many of the followers is a refuge. In order to illustrate ourpurpose it is necessary to sidetrack a little and start a new discussion.There is no dispute on this point, whether from a psychological perspective orfrom historical experience, that the spirit will not leave in peace the person whois weak and cannot help his evil act, and his conscience will always criticise him.As a result, this kind of person is always seeking a path that will rescue him fromhis restlessness. From this perspective, Timur was an oppressor of Sufis with thattyranny and blood thirstiness of his. Samad Khan Maragheh‘i was considered aviolent Shi‘ite because of his shameful, dirty, evil deeds. Timur who shed so muchblood of innocent people without a doubt was sometimes introspective and hisconscience severely reproached him. He was so pleased when a group of Sufi pirs,without questioning him about all of that blood-shedding, recognised him as goodand pure when he paid them a visit and offered them donations. And a group ofstomach-worshippers sat at his table and called him the propagator of religion.These people poured water on the fire for him. Samad Khan (who killed menwho struggled for the independence of their country, cut off tongues and threwin front of dogs, independence seekers with their hands tied and after all of this“SUFISM”117"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"served the foreigners in hundreds of despicable ways) was the kind of person thatwhatever darkness there was within him, without a doubt he sometimes heard thecry of [his] conscience within himself, and it is quite appropriate that a Shi‘itecleric said, “If you had fled to Imam Hosayn, or had gone to perform thepilgrimage (ziyarat) all your sins would have been forgiven.”This is the meaning of “refuge”, and our understanding of it is that profit wassought from Sufism or other deviations that either the elders or the followersenjoyed. For example, we see many of the heads of the embassies that we havestudied have dedicated themselves to such and such Shams al-‘Orafa andBahman ‘Asheq-‘Ali Shah. This is something not without a cause. These men whohave control of some of the country’s affairs, pursue nothing but their own ben-efit, and they exert themselves in a hundred evil acts, in secret and out in the open,just as we have shown. They have great need for Sufism or something similar toit, and it is this that we have witnessed during the past few years. For the sake ofone of the deviations that we have criticised, their supporters (as far as they can)first display their solidarity and make a clamour. Then, when they see that theycan do nothing and people criticise them, they deny the criticism or else put toone side those parts [that are criticised]. In any case, they are not content for thatdeviation to vanish and that institution to die.There is a good example on this point. When the Constitutional Movementstarted in Iran, and Iranians considered their misfortunes and their origins, thename of the Sufis was mentioned as a reason that had prevented the people fromengaging in work and life, holding the world in contempt and writing criticisms ofit, and as a result, once again, the Sufi leaders changed their argument and said,“One must be busy with worldly affairs”, and they have pointed to a few sentencesthey have written in some Arabic books in the name of Imam ‘Ali Ibn Abi Taleb,and they say: “Did not our Master say, ‘Pay attention to your world as though youare going to live forever, and go after your next world as if you are going to dietomorrow.’ ” They used this excuse that Sufism is not opposed getting involved inworldly affairs, whereas:First, the foundation of Sufism has been covering one’s eyes from worldly affairs,and enmity with it, and therefore the Sufis have mourned for themselves in thisworld, and they wore dark blue cloaks and shaved their heads. In those times thedonning of dark blue cloaks and the shaving of the head was a sign of deepmourning that mothers performed for dead sons and that sisters performed forkilled brothers. The books of the Sufis are full of criticisms of worldly affairs andthey always called it a corpse, and they have believed that withdrawing from it isproper for every man of God. On this account they have caused much oppressionwhen they have written that their pirswould [promise] to look after the money orthe goods that they have taken from others through begging until the next day, andthe very same day they would give it to the dervishes and others, and they wouldlet them eat it. This was the extent of their enmity with the world and life.Second, the basis of Sufism has been the writings of Plotinus, which cannotbe linked to Imam ‘Ali Ibn Abi Taleb. These [writings of Plotinus?] are the rule“SUFISM”118"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"“SUFISM”119of the things by which the Sufis have severed the peoples’ tongues. The Sufisthemselves did not have a religion. But just as I said, they have gone along withthe faith of the people wherever they have been. In Iran they became Shi‘ite andlinked themselves to Imam ‘Ali Ibn Abi Taleb, and in the Ottoman Empire theywere Sunni and they traced their selselehback to the Caliph Abu Bakr.In any case, this is the effort that they have made in these twenty or thirty years,and I know that first they will protest about our criticisms, and they will go to thegovernment and beg it to stop the propagation of such criticisms. Then they willhide behind a veil and as far as possible make denials or say, “That was not ourselseleh.” And after all of this they will turn aside from those elements [of Sufism]that have been criticised.But this is changing one’s position. This is the reason that they do not want toabandon their deviations. This is the reason that these deviations are a shop, andtherefore they do not want to leave them, but they want to change colour inaccordance with the times.I have not forgotten that at the start of the Constitutional Movement in Tabriza preacher approached one of its leaders and said,Yesterday I went to a party and they did not let me ascend the minbar.They said that those admonitions are worthless, one should talk about theConstitution. But preaching is my profession, and if I don’t preach I willgo hungry. Therefore I have come so that you can teach me so that I canspeak about the Constitution. Then I will be able to ascend the minbar.He said this with complete sincerity.These Sufis too will say the same thing in those [kind of ] circumstances,“Sufism is our profession, it is our sustenance, it is our refuge. Why should weabandon it? Everywhere there is decay, you can say that we should change thatover there.”"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Figure 4.1E.G.

BrowneThe year 2006 will witness the centenary of the Constitutional Revolution inIran, an event that remains a topic of great interest to scholars who are assistedin their research by an abundance of printed material. Two sources that appearregularly as references in most histories are those of Edward Granville Browneand Ahmad Kasravi. In 1888 Edward Browne became lecturer of Persian at theUniversity of Cambridge and subsequently became Thomas Adams Professor ofArabic. He was the author of many works including The Persian Revolution1905–1909, which was published in 1910 and has been reprinted on several occa-sions, the latest being in 1995.1This book has been an important source of infor-mation, both for Western scholars and also for Iranians,2including AhmadKasravi himself in his History of the Iranian Constitution(Tarikh-e Mashruteh-ye Iran).The histories of Browne and Kasravi share much in common; in particular,both are sympathetic to the Constitutionalists who attempted to end the autocratictradition of Qajar rule, and both were critical of the attempts by Russia to supportthe anti-constitutionalist monarch, Mohammad ‘Ali Shah. Both were also greatchampions of Iranian nationalism; indeed, their lives coincide with a period ofintense nationalistic fervour. Despite these similarities, Kasravi developed anintense dislike for Browne’s other academic works, and this chapter seeks to assessKasravi’s criticisms, offering an opportunity to reflect on the inspiration andmotivation of both scholars, which will help to explain the enigma that surroundsone of Iran’s most controversial, “iconoclastic” and “outstanding” intellectuals.Kasravi’s appreciation of BrowneThe writings of E.G. Browne are not considered in great detail within Kasravi’spublications, and although there are scattered references to him in various works,the most comprehensive treatment of Browne appears in a few pages of “OnLiterature” (Dar Piramun-e Adabiyyat).3Initially, Kasravi was a great admirer ofBrowne, especially as he appeared to be a proponent of Iranian independence inthe context of the threats posed to its territorial integrity from Russia and theseeming willingness of the British government to leave a weak Iran to fend foritself against its powerful northern neighbour.4Indeed, Kasravi acknowledges121"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"that Browne condemned the policies of the British government in its relationswith Iran,5although it is not clear whether he appreciated the full extent ofBrowne’s activities in promoting the cause of Iranian independence. Kasravi alsoexpressed his gratitude to Browne’s scholarly activities, in particular, his work ThePersian Revolution of 1905–1909,6which was sympathetic to the cause of theConstitutionalists. Moreover, Kasravi notes that Browne manifested support forthe continuation of the general aims of the Constitutionalists in his publicationsabout the Russian ultimatum (The Reign of Terror at Tabriz7), and he also confesseshis debt to Browne by mentioning that he had expressed gratitude to him in theintroduction to his Eighteen Year History of Azarbayjan.8Kasravi also praisedBrowne’s book on Babism and the events related to that movement.9At one pointKasravi attempted to engage with Browne in an academic exchange, as he notedthat Browne had made some 140 errors in an English translation of IbnIsfandiyar’sTarikh-e Tabaristan.10Kasravi sent his comments to Browne’s colleagueQazvini (on whom see below) hoping that the corrections would be passed on.11Kasravi’s criticisms of BrowneHaving lauded Browne’s contribution to both scholarship and general concern forthe contemporary plight of Iran, Kasravi stated that he suffered much shockwhen he then saw Browne’sHistory of Persian Literature, which he claimed was sentto Iran in 1912.12Kasravi must be referring to the first volume of the book whichlater became a monumental four-volume study. During those days, Kasraviadmitted, he did not link such works with the political agenda that he came toassociate with them at a later date. He thought that Browne had composed thiswork simply because of his inclination to Persian poetry and that he had engagedon a futile project. It was only later that Kasravi realised the full extent of the dan-gers of the propagation of traditional Persian poetry (in particular, the poetry ofthe Sufis and the Kharabatis).13There were three reasons for Kasravi’s dislike ofsuch poetry; the first was the spread of religious innovation and the second wasthe propagation of immorality, and both of these reasons, claimed Kasravi, wereutilised by the Europeans in their attempts to weaken Iran. The third reason wasthe interiorisation of the Orientalist discourse.Religious diversityReligious innovation was detrimental to Iran because it contributed to religiousdiversity, a general weakness that had plagued the region for many years. (In“Europeanism, Materialism and Religiosity” Kasravi lists the following religiousgroups to illustrate this diversity: Zoroastrians, Jews, Christians, Sunnis, Shi‘ites,‘Ali-ullahis, Isma‘ilis, Baha’is, Shaykhis, Karimkhanis and Sufis.)14The unity ofIran was the subtext underpinning the vast majority of Kasravi’s works, and hisideal vision of a united Iran was perhaps a result of the conflicts that he witnessedin his formative years.15In particular, Kasravi was a first-hand witness to theOPPOSITION TO THE ORIENTALISTS122"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"communal violence between the Ne‘matis and Haydaris16and also to thesectarianism that existed between the Sunnis and Shi‘ites of Azarbayjan.17Although Browne is not mentioned explicitly by name in the spread of religiousinnovations, Kasravi’s following comments might have been written withBrowne’s “promotion” of Sufism and even perhaps with Babism in mind:Most orientalists...have been the political servants of Europe[angovernments], and they have continually made efforts to cause mischiefamong the Eastern peoples and to spread repugnant acts over the wholeof the East, and therefore they have always promoted those subjectsthe result of which has been the spread of religious innovation and theincrease in disunity among Eastern peoples...We do not insist that all ofthese orientalists have been the political servants of Europe, but we aresure that there has been no other purpose in following these subjects thanill-will towards the Eastern peoples and in particular towards Muslims.18Immorality in mystical literatureA second reason explaining Kasravi’s hostility to Browne’s work on Persianliterature is that the meaning and morality of so much Sufi and Kharabatiliterature contradicted what he believed to be rational discourse.19For example,the Sufi idea of “everything is He”, for Kasravi, implied that evil could not exist,which then renders redundant God’s judgement of mankind. Moreover, Kasravibelieved that Sufism encouraged debauchery, which became widespread due tothe Sufi belief that mystics could see a reflection of God’s beauty in young males.European orientalists such as Browne made deliberate attempts, according toKasravi, to advance European interests at the expense of those of the Easternnations by promoting such mystical and immoral literature and by editing andpublishing Sufi works. For example, Browne is censured for the publication of‘Attar’sTadhkirat al-awliya’in the Gibb Memorial Series20(and Kasravi asks whythe capital for the Gibb Memorial Trust was not used in a more beneficial man-ner, such as building hospitals or spreading knowledge among eastern peoples.)21Interiorisation of the orientalist discourseThe European orientalists’ works, according to Kasravi, were instrumental inconvincing Iranians that the writings of Sufis and Kharabatis representedwhat was best in Iranian culture, and the internalisation of such ideas affectedinfluential Iranian politicians. Kasravi argues that in the 1920s he heard fromMohammad ‘Ali Forughi22the same kind of argument offered by ProfessorSadiq23(ironically enough, an associate of Browne):We will not be able to manifest [any] strength or force against others.There is one path open for us which is to make the world listen to ourOPPOSITION TO THE ORIENTALISTS123’"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"ancient literature and civilisation and attract respect for ourselves. InEurope they recognise us for Sa‘di, Hafez, Khayyam and Firdawsi. Wetoo must give this as much importance as possible.24This debate concerning the promotion or rejection of certain types of Persianliterature predates the influence that European orientalists had on Iranian schol-ars and politicians (e.g. the debate over the content and merit of Hafez’sghazalsbegan even during Hafez’s own lifetime in the fourteenth century). It is difficult toascertain whether the debate concerning Persian poetry and literature and itsrelation with national identity (a debate which became pronounced after the FirstWorld War) was independent of Browne’s pioneering work on Persian literature.Certainly Kasravi witnessed a connection, since he commented that after Brownehad sent his work to Iran in 1912, a number of literary societies in Iranmushroomed, literary journals were published, books on poetry and biographiesof poets were written, youths started to compose their own poetry and in theprovinces the graves of poets were covered with domes.25That there was anational debate about what kind of Persian literature to promote in the nation isclear. Sa‘id Nafisi mentions a controversy that erupted within the Democrat Partyin the wake of the First World War, in particular between Malik al-Sho‘araBahar26and Mirza ‘Ali Asghar Khan Taleqani. Taleqani published a series ofarticles in his newspaper Zaban-e azad(“Free Speech”) under the title, the “Schoolof Sa‘di”. In these articles Taleqani argued that traditional Persian poetry hadinculcated a “dervish spirit” among Iranians which was the cause of their weak-ness and backwardness.27Kasravi believed that Browne had instigated all of this,promoting the interiorisation of such ideas within Iran. Browne was able to dothis because of his close connections with men of literature and politics. As men-tioned earlier, Kasravi recognised that there was contact between Browne andForughi,28and the latter was admonished for promoting Sufism since he wasreported to have said that materialism had engulfed Europe and only Sufismcould save it. When Forughi made this comment, Kasravi responded by askingwhether it was really possible that Europeans would become Sufis and thereforesave themselves.29Kasravi’s animosity to Forughi is also attributable to the latter’sparticular promotion of Sa‘di’sGolestan, Book Five of which discusses lovebetween males. Forughi not only edited a version of the Golestanbut he also wrotean introduction and was instrumental in having the book published throughthe Ministry of Culture.30Kasravi believed that Browne was conscious of the political implications of hisactions, and by way of an illustration to show the devious nature of the Europeanorientalists, he offered an analogy of how a poor Jewish merchant, shunned by hisfellow merchants, eventually became a millionaire. According to Kasravi’s story,one day the poor Jewish merchant came to see the Jewish millionaire, Rothschild,who offered to write him a cheque. However, the poor merchant refused thecheque but said that he spent his days with the other merchants in the customs,and so when Rothschild passed through the customs houses he should greet himOPPOSITION TO THE ORIENTALISTS124"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"warmly. If Rothschild would do this three times, said the poor Jewish merchant,his troubles would cease. Rothschild acted accordingly, and of course when therich merchants saw this they all desired the friendship of the poor merchant, andso they started to trade with him. After a few years, the poor Jewish merchant hadbecome a millionaire.31More specific “evidence” of Browne’s duplicity was wit-nessed by Kasravi in his claim that Browne wore Persian-style clothes for a yearwhile he travelled there between 1887 and 1888.32Assessment of Kasravi’s scholarshipThe danger posed to Iran by the European powers is a theme that pre-occupiedthe minds of many Iranian intellectuals (and for that matter, many individuals inMiddle Eastern and Asian territories) from the nineteenth century onwards.Kasravi’s warnings are not therefore unique but important if only for the reasonthat they perpetuated the resistance against the excesses of Europeanisation andWesternisation. This resistance was continued in Iran after Kasravi’s death, mostnotably by Jalal Al-e Ahmad, the author ofWestoxification33and ‘Ali Shari‘ati.34Echoes of Kasravi’s thought are easily discernible in the writings of Shari‘ati whois known to have been impressed with some of the former’s arguments concern-ing the need to reform Iran.35Yet the writings on the topic of orientalism by Al-e Ahmad and Shari‘ati are more sophisticated than those of Kasravi because theyare not obsessed with the detrimental effects of both Sufism and most mediaevalPersian literature.It would be wrong, however, to belittle all of Kasravi’s writings, for his historyof the Constitutional Revolution and his study of the emergence of the Safavidshave been widely acclaimed. Moreover, he should be praised for not advancingthe cause of racist nationalism, even though such sentiments were strong in manyparts of Europe. The racist ideology was in part attributable to the developmentin philology during the nineteenth century, in particular the studies associatedwith Hinduism and Sanskrit. Much of the orientalist discourse of the nineteenthcentury contrasted the advanced societies of the West and the Aryans with thebackward state of the Semites (Arabs and therefore Islam).36It was accepted thatSanskrit and Persian were linked with European languages, which suggested tosome that the original Aryans came from somewhere between India and WesternEurope. This provided those scholars who wished to be free from the confines oftraditional thought with the opportunity to construct a polarity between the worldordering higher religions, rationalism and modernism with the backwardness andsuperstitions of less advanced religions.37Given this perspective it is interesting tonote that there were some scholars of Islam and Sufism who have been temptedto link Sufism with the Aryans. For example, in 1867 E.H. Palmer publishedan abridged version ofMaqsad al-aqsa, by the thirteenth-century Persian writer‘Aziz Nasafi, generally regarded as a Sufi, and in his introduction to the textPalmer states that in a future work he hopes to prove that “Sufiism is really thedevelopment of the Primaeval Religion of the Aryan race”.38OPPOSITION TO THE ORIENTALISTS125"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"It is to Kasravi’s credit that in his writings on Sufism, Hafez, literature andIslam he never advocated Indo-Aryan supremacy over the Semites and Islam.39Whether he was informed of the debate occupying the minds of Europeanphilologists is unclear, but certainly the seeds of Iranian nationalism and anti-Arab sentiment had gestated among those familiar with Western thought in thenineteenth century.40It is possible that Kasravi did not endorse anti-Arab andpro-Aryan sentiment because if his aim was the promotion of the nation-state ofIran, then advocating ideas that were derogatory of the Arabs would only assistin shattering the fragile mosaic-society that composed Iran. Kasravi would havebeen well aware of the rumours that the British had intended to detach the Arabspeaking, oil-rich province of Khuzestan from Iran and to invest sovereign pow-ers in the local leader, Shaykh Khaz‘al of Mohammerah.41Moreover, Kasraviseemed to have a genuine regard for Islam and Mohammad (whom he calls thenoble Arab)42and believed that his views of a reformed religion, which he termedpakdini, was a purified version of Islam.43Thus for political and religious reasons,criticism of the Arabs was not a feature of Kasravi’s world-view. Even if he wasnot aware of the racist theories underpinning the orientalist discourse outlinedearlier, Kasravi was certainly worried about the explicit policies of Britain andother European powers in relation to Iran. His concern was also focused upon theimplicit ways of imperialism, namely the activities of those academics who hadedited works of Persian mystical literature or else had written biographies of Sufisand commentaries on their writings.However, despite providing useful historical insights and not being seduced byracist theories that lay embedded within some European scholarship, Kasravi wasblinded by his obsession with Sufism to the extent that it influenced his percep-tion of the motives of European orientalists. He was even critical of Europeanorientalists who translated or edited Persian texts of which he approved. Forexample, he believed that Ferdowsi’sShah-nameh(“Book of Kings”) was beneficialto the course of Iranian history because it promoted Iranian nationalist senti-ment, partly through its use of Persian rather than Arabic words. Yet Kasravi hadnothing positive to say when he learned that a German orientalist had produceda concordance of the Shah-nameh.44His comments are worth repeating here ifonly to illustrate his utter bemusement at such orientalist work:During the Ferdowsi [millenial] festival45the Germans brought a bookthat astounded me. An orientalist had written a concordance ofFerdowsi’sShah-nameh. (For example, it records how many times the word“from” (az) appears throughout the Shah-nameh.) The Germans com-mented: “He laboured for twenty years to finish the book.” Why did heengage on such a futile and irrational task? Such a German must beeither mad or simple-minded to do such a thing, or else his purpose wasto deceive Iranians and cause them to engage in such futile projects. TheGerman government sent such a book to us as a gift!

They engage inincredible tasks. Look what they have done! He laboured twenty yearsfor the sake of one book. It is not without reason that they are alwaysahead and we are behind.” I saw in a moment that the seed of thepolitics [of European imperialism] had grown in their hearts.46Moreover, the gross generalisations that appear in his works such as Dar Piramun-e Adabiyyat(in which Browne is castigated) and his refusal to find benefit in thepublication of Sufi or non-mystical classical Persian works invalidate the principleof scholarly research. Indeed, the numerous pamphlets that Kasravi published onSufism, Hafez and literature and his book-burning festivals present him more asa jingoistic populist and a puritanical bigot than as a serious academic.E.G. Browne, champion of Iranian nationalism?Kasravi’s harsh opinion of E.G. Browne runs against the general Iranian viewwhich is summarised well in an article on Browne in the Encyclopaedia IranicabyKamran Ekbal:Browne was held in the highest esteem by Persians. Although he had firstbeen disliked in Iran because of his sympathies for the persecuted Babis,he soon evoked gratitude for having taken Persia and its literature ashis own and for supporting the Persian people as few others had done...Persians today still remember Browne as one of the great mendevoted to their country and its people.47Indeed, there is no indication that Browne ever harboured any ill-will towardsIran; his books, articles, letters and activities indicate a consistent desire for Iranto be free from the imperialist aims of Russia and Britain, and he ardently wishedthat Iranians should be allowed to establish the kind of political institutions thatthey themselves desired. This last point was enshrined in the objectives of thePersia Committee which was set up in 1908 (with Browne as vice-chairman) tosupport the Constitutionalists in Iran and to reject the 1907 agreement betweenRussia and Britain that divided Iran into spheres of influence. The second para-graph of article I of the objectives reads as follows:Assured of foreign neutrality in the political struggle that is taking placein Persia, and free from the haunting fear of foreign intervention on thepretext of maintaining order, the Persians will, it is felt, be able to workout their own salvation and to endow their country with stable institu-tions within a reasonable space of time.48Browne’s involvement with the promotion of Iranian independence includedparticipating in the Persia Committee, writing letters to Sir Edward GreyOPPOSITION TO THE ORIENTALISTS127"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"(the British Foreign Minister who endorsed the Anglo-Russian agreement),arranging meetings for Constitutionalist leaders such as Taqizadeh with leadingBritish politicians and, perhaps most significantly, allowing Persians to speak forthemselves through his publications, such as The Persian RevolutionandThe Press andPoetry of Modern Persia.49On the basis of these activities and his many publications on Persian literature,one would assume that Browne could have been nothing but a true friend of Iranor else, as Kasravi implies, he deliberately aimed to destabilise Iran by promotinga certain mentality among Iranians through the glorification of certain forms ofliterature. The following will highlight reasons for Browne’s interest in Iran toassess whether Kasravi’s criticisms are valid.Browne and Iranian religionsThe reasons for Browne’s sympathy for Iran are complex, but seem to have theirroots in the period before he was even acquainted with Iran, and perhaps havemore to do with his idealism of fighting for a just cause. It is worth noting thatwhen Browne was a youth of 15–16 he became aware of the vulgarities of ele-ments of British opinion in the aftermath of Turkey’s defeat in its war with Russia:the losing side [Turkey] more especially when it continues to strugglegallantly against defeat, always has a claim on our sympathy, and more-over the cant of the anti-Turkish party in England, and the wretchedattempts to confound questions of abstract justice with party-politics,disgusted me beyond measure. Ere the close of the war I would havedied to save Turkey.50Drawn to the Middle East and Islam, Browne was fascinated further by whathe considered to be the “pantheistic” doctrines of the Sufis.51While atCambridge he started to study Persian, and he prepared for examinations whichwere to include sections from Rumi’sMasnaviand the Divanof Hafez. Brownerecalled his attraction to such Persian poetry in the following manner:As a young doctor at St. Bartholomew’s hospital in London, I witnessedmuch that made me wonder at man’s clinging to life...Never before orsince have I realised so clearly the immortality, greatness, and virtue ofthe spirit of man, or the misery of its earthly environment: it seemed tome like a prince in rags, ignorant alike of his birth and his rights, but towhom is reserved a glorious heritage. No wonder, then, that thePantheistic idealism of the Masnavi took hold of me, or that suchwords...ofHafiz thrilled me to the very soul.52Browne worked as a medic at St Bartholomew’s in London before he went toIran, and it was during this period that he met Hajji Pirzadeh (d. 1904), anOPPOSITION TO THE ORIENTALISTS128"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Iranian who was well-versed in the mystical tradition.53It has been claimed thatBrowne became a disciple (murid) of Pirzadeh,54although the evidence for this isnot conclusive.55It is clear, however, that Pirzadeh did help Browne to studyPersian mystical texts, and such literature had a profound impact on him. He wasto claim that he was an “ardent admirer of these eloquent mystics, whose spirithas inspired so much of what is best and finest in Persian literature”.56Kasraviwas astonished at Browne’s appreciation of Persian literature, in particular Sufipoetry, and realising that the Englishman was a highly intelligent individual, hecould not comprehend why he could possibly find any value in Sufi writings.It seems likely, therefore, that Kasravi sought an ulterior motive in Browne’spromotion of Persian literature which, of course, was of a political nature. Butfor many subsequent, outstanding British orientalists including Browne’s student,R.A. Nicholson, and Nicholson’s student, A.J. Arberry, the moral teachingsand universalism of Sufism probably offered an ideal that transcended politi-cal motives.57Moreover, the humility advocated by so many of the mystics ofIslam perhaps reminded Browne of his own Christian ethical perspective, whichis made manifest in his A Year Amongst the Persians, when he remarked: “knowthat I regard myself as the least of God’s servants and the most inconsistentand unworthy of those who profess to take the Lord Jesus as their pattern andexemplar!”58Having become interested in Iran through the study of Persian mystical poetry,Browne then became increasingly fascinated by this country when he leant aboutthe Babis from Comte de Gobineau’sReligions and Philosophies in Central Asia.Moreover, the closer similarity that some Babis saw with Christianity over Islammay also have drawn Browne to this new religion.59In any case, Browne viewedthe Babi movement as “one of the most interesting and important events that hasoccurred since the rise of Christianity and Muhammadanism”60, and Gobineau’sview of the parallels between the rise of early Christianity and its persecution withthat of Babism may have been one of the reasons for Browne’s investigation of it.61Browne’s interest in the Babi movement can be summarised in the following:the Babi and Baha’i movements have at least proved two things, first,that the Persians, when deeply stirred by spiritual forces, are capable ofthe utmost heroism and self-devotion; and secondly that Persia is stillcapable of influencing the world by her thought to a degree equalled byfew other countries.62Kasravi’s claim that orientalists have promoted religious discord among thenations of the east to further imperialist aims seem difficult to substantiate in thecontext of Browne’s interest in Babism and Baha’i-ism. While it is true that as ayoung man Browne appeared a committed Christian63and never attempted toconceal his faith whilst in Iran64, it appears that he never pursued any form ofmissionary activity. Indeed, he offers reasons why these religions should be ofinterest to academics in the West. First, these religions offer students of religionOPPOSITION TO THE ORIENTALISTS129"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"a chance to witness the birth of a faith with all of its devotion and heroism.Second, the ethnologist can meditate on thecharacter of a people [Iranians], who, stigmatized as they often havebeen seen as selfish, mercenary, avaricious, egotistical, sordid, andcowardly, are yet capable of exhibiting under the influence of a strongreligious impulse a degree of devotion, disinterestedness, generosity,unselfishness, nobility, and courage which may be paralleled in history,but can scarcely be surpassed.65Third, Browne admits that knowledge of the Babi movement would be of use tothe politician and warns that what Mohammad made of the Arabs, the Bab mayyet make of the Persians. Yet Browne’s personal interest in Babism transcendedthe three categories mentioned, and if he was not disingenuous about hisfascination with Babism, his interests cannot be associated with a negative formof orientalism.But to myself...the paramount interest thereof lies in this, that here issomething, whether wise or unwise, whether tending towards the ame-lioration of mankind or the reverse, which seemed to many hundreds, ifnot thousands, of our fellow-creatures worth suffering and dying for, andwhich, on this ground alone, must be accounted worthy of our mostattentive study.66And as mentioned earlier Browne may also have seen parallels in the strugglesand self-sacrifice of the Babis with those of the supporters of the ConstitutionalMovement in the first decade of the twentieth century. His passionate advocacyof the Constitutional Movement and his appreciation of the literature thatConstitutionalist supporters produced lend weight to the argument that he can-not be considered as the kind of orientalist who viewed the East or Iran as pos-sessing nothing but an ancient civilisation, although there are some passages in hiswritings that come dangerously close to essentialising a great Iranian spirit thattranscends time and the various “national disasters” (such as the Arabs, Mongolsand Turks67). One also finds passages in his works which suggest that he could bea little too keen to promote all things Persian. The following is quoted to illustratethis possibility, although it should be taken into consideration that Browne’s obser-vation might well contain an element of truth:I once heard Mr G. Bernard Shaw deliver an address to a branch of theFabian Society on “The Religion of the Future”. In this lecture he saidthat he was unwilling that the West should any longer be content toclothe itself in what he called “the rags of Oriental systems of religion”;that he wanted a good, healthy Western religion, recognizing the high-est type of humanity as the Superman, or, if the term was preferred, asOPPOSITION TO THE ORIENTALISTS130"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"God; and that, according to this conception, man was ever engaged in“creating God”. As I listened I was greatly struck by the similarity of hislanguage to that employed by the Bahais, and was diverted by the reflec-tion that, strive as he would, this brilliant modern thinker of the Westcould not evolve a religion which the East had not already formulated.68Browne and the exotic “other”There are several strands that help to explain Browne’s interest in Iran. First,there is the pantheistic idealism that has been discussed. Second, his occasionalidealisation of Iran may be attributable to the rhetoric of a nationalist aiming todrum up support against a foreign policy which he believed was wrong. These twopoints may well be related, if Amanat’s view that Browne was deeply influencedby the romanticism of the Victorian era is correct.69This legacy of romanticismmay have contributed to Browne seeking out the downtrodden, the dissenters, theoutcasts and undesirables in Iran, and it may have been the spark in his imagina-tion which then ignited when he became familiar with the non-conformism ofHafez’s poetry, the struggle for self-expression among the Babis and then theIranian endeavour for freedom from internal tyranny and European imperialism.Whatever the reasons may be, it is difficult to deny that Browne’s study ofIranian society and literature had never been attempted on such a scale before.His academic works certainly do not reveal a consistently essentialised Islam orIran, and he was also able to offer some criticisms of the nation that he loved nextbest to Britain. For example, in his discussion of Naser al-Din Shah, Browneremarked, “his rule has been, on the whole, mild, and comparatively free from thecruelties which mar nearly every page of Persian history”.70Browne also offeredsome caution, if not criticism of the teachings of the Baha’is:These [ethical] teachings [of Baha’i-ism] are in themselves admirable,though inferior, in my opinion, both in beauty and simplicity to theteachings of Christ. Moreover, as it seems to me, ethics is only the appli-cation to everyday life of religion and metaphysics, and to be effectivemust be supported by some spiritual sanction; and in the case ofBahaism, with its rather vague doctrines as to the nature and destiny ofthe soul of man, it is a little difficult to see whence the driving-power toenforce the ethical maxims can be derived.71Browne was clearly shocked by some of the Baha’i doctrines with which hebecame familiar in his encounter with them during his year in Iran. In particularhe was disturbed by their understanding of the divine, which he recorded as hav-ing its basis in the human imagination. He protested and asserted the “orthodox”Islamic doctrine which balances God’s similarity with utter transcendence andcould not refrain from noting; “I listened in consternation, half-frightened at theirvehemence, half-disgusted at their doctrines yet withal held spell-bound by theirOPPOSITION TO THE ORIENTALISTS131"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"eloquence.”72If any more evidence is needed of Browne’s recognition that Iranwas not an exotic “other”, the fact that he spoke of “Asiatic indifference and apa-thy” which combined with “European ‘earth-hunger’ and lust of conquest hastentheir [the independent Muslim States’] disintegration”73suggests that he was notprepared to accept all things Iranian indiscriminately.Browne did not view Iran as an “exotic other”, nor did he romanticise it out ofall proportion, nor did he essentialise Iran into a society of peace-loving mystics,reciting poetry from the mediaeval period. This can be witnessed in his interest inthe political struggles of the Constitutionalists and, in particular, his attraction tomodern Persian literature. He made this clear in 1912 during a lecture to thePersia Society on “The Literature of Persia”, in which he spoke of modernPersian poetry, but was surprised at the reaction among some of the audiencewho thought there was no modern Persian poetry that was worthy of mention. Asa result, Browne was determined to refute this “pernicious error” and the resultwas a book entitled The Press and Poetry of Modern Persia,74which was composed oftwo parts: the first listed Persian newspapers and the second offered “specimensof the political and patriotic poetry of modern Persia”. Browne had a favourableopinion of much of this poetry and he used adjectives such as “excellent” todescribe it, remarking that it held great interest “from the historical and the liter-ary points of view, and is often equally remarkable for its merit and its original-ity”.75It is interesting to note that Browne links the “pernicious error” thatPersian poetry stopped with the fifteenth-century poet Jami with those who forpolitical reasons desired to represent Asians and Persians as decadent anddegenerate.76These twin features, the attacks on British imperialism and theinclusion and praise of radical and socially aware verse in The Press and Poetry ofModern Persia, make criticisms of orientalism difficult to accept.Yet even if Browne is guilty of idealising Iran, he is surely innocent of the accu-sations levelled against him by Kasravi. These accusations were made on the basisof Kasravi’s acquaintance with Browne’s publications, yet since the defence ofIran is upheld in many of these works, one can only conclude that Kasravi hadonly a superficial knowledge of these writings,77or else his obsession with the lackof morality in Sufi and mediaeval Persian literature blinded him to all other con-siderations. The criticisms that he makes are undermined by contradictions. Onthe one hand, Kasravi claims that he cannot know the motives of the orientalists:“I cannot be aware about [what is in] the Orientalists’ hearts, and I cannot saythat so and so has been well-disposed, or has been ill-disposed on that topic.I know [it is] better to speak about their actions.”78Four pages later in DarPiramun-e Adabiyyathe attacks the motives of the orientalists (and mentionsBrowne) in the Rothschild story.Kasravi castigated Browne for serving the interests of the British governmentbecause he was not prepared to accept any interpretation of the moralityprovided in Sufi texts or mediaeval Persian literature other than his own rathernarrow understanding. In Kasravi’s defence the context in which he was writ-ing surely contributed to his rather polemical works, that is to say, the ratherOPPOSITION TO THE ORIENTALISTS132"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"ignominious role that Britain played in Iran during the nineteenth and then earlytwentieth centuries which virtually guaranteed the prevention of real political andeconomic independence. It is this role that has led many Iranians to endorse aconspiracy theory that sees a British hand in all catastrophes that occur in Iran,79and although Kasravi does not completely endorse this theory, his writings onBrowne certainly play on this fear.80It is important to note, however, that he wasnot prepared to blame Browne or Britain for all of the misfortunes that he sawwithin Iran, for some of them (such as Sufism and other “religious innovations”)predated the emergence of the European powers in the region.ConclusionKasravi criticised Browne and the orientalists on the basis of his “rationalist” per-spective, and although he admitted that not all orientalists wished ill on Iran,81Browne is specifically condemned for promoting Persian poetry because of itsirrational and immoral content.82Reading between the lines and considering themajor intellectual arguments of the day it is clear that Kasravi was concernedwith the identity of Iran and the detrimental effects that Europeans had on Iran.His writings foreshadow those of Edward Said, who offers a theory of culturaldomination that is linked to identity formation. For Kasravi, this cultural domi-nation was established through expliciteconomic control83andimplicitculturalhegemony through the promotion of certain forms of literature. The result was,for Kasravi, blind imitation of Europe and support for adopting Europeanlifestyles that contrasted with “traditional” standards. Kasravi quotes in astonish-ment the famous lines of Taqizadeh, who claimed in the newspaper Kaveh,“Iranians must become European in [their] external form and in [their] behav-iour, and materially and spiritually.”84Taqizadeh’s advice struck a chord in manyIranians, and Kasravi despaired of the extent of the blind imitation by Iraniansof the West:Today all women and men, young and old have focused on Europe, andin all customs and morals they follow Europeans, from the choice of[their] clothing to eating food, and they boast of socialising withEuropeans. Whoever is more aware of [European] customs is consid-ered better and superior to others, and whenever they find a speech by aEuropean they praise it...some shameless individuals have made theadvancement in knowledge in the West an excuse for ridiculingEasterners and they have not refrained from taunting [Easterners]. Thisis an example of the disease of Europeanism.85Such Iranians, according to Kasravi, were more concerned about the opinion ofEuropean scholars on mystical and Persian literature than they were in investi-gating and evaluating the worth of the texts themselves:A little man approached me and engaged in dispute: “The German[scholar] Goethe has praised Hafez.” I replied, “What have you got toOPPOSITION TO THE ORIENTALISTS133"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"do with Goethe? Don’t you have your own understanding and wisdom?Do you have Hafez’s book? Why don’t you open it, read it and see whatit says? Why don’t you think and see whether our criticisms of that poet[i.e. Hafez] are correct or not?” He replied, “Then why did Goethebestow all that praise [on Hafez]?” I said, “How should I know? Goetheis like all the others. He made stupid speeches. Just like Hafez he was ababbler of nonsense.”86Indeed, European views on Iranian literature should not be considered as worthlistening to because they are all highly political:One day I...spoke [with Forughi] at length. He said: “In Europe [people]associate Iran with Sa‘di, Hafez, Mawlavi and Khayyam.” I replied,“That’s not true.87Why don’t they associate Iran with its ancient history?Why don’t they associate Iran with Shah ‘Abbas or Nader Shah?” Isn’t itbecause [of European praise] that we [Iranians] teach all the evil andharmful teachings of Sa‘di and others to our children?”88The preservation or (re)-creation of Iranian identity for Kasravi included a rejec-tion of Western imperialism and the promotion of a pure moral order.What is certain and we have witnessed with our own eyes is that religion,piety, generosity, sympathy for the poor, assistance for the downfallen,contentment and these kind of praiseworthy Eastern morals havedeclined in currency. In their place irreligiosity, impiety, selfishness,hedonism, greed, narrow-sightedness and quarrelsomeness have becomeprevalent among youths.89Although for a modern observer Kasravi’s tirades against Browne and his ser-monising about the appropriate forms of literature appear incredibly dated, it isworthwhile considering that the creation of national identity and the significanceof literature were recognised in Europe at the same time.90Indeed, one wonderswhether his remarks about burning the books of Hafez and Sa‘di were influencedby similar book-burning events in Europe.91Kasravi’s criticisms of Browne wereshaped in this context in conjunction with his own moral predilections concern-ing the evils of Sufism and its irrational basis. His rationalism and nationalismwere so strident that he could not see how Sufi literature could be understood notas historical fact but as mythic and ethical and/or entertaining literature.From now on we should revert to the correct meaning of literature andremove the root of futile talk from Iran. From now on we should estab-lish love for Iran as [literature’s] perfection, and we should regard theenemies of Iran with nothing but hatred and derision...From now onwe should never praise Alexander [the Great], Chingiz [Khan] orOPPOSITION TO THE ORIENTALISTS134"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Timur, and never contaminate the language in remembrance ofMahmud and Ayaz, and Layla and Majnun...From now on the poetstoo should compose poetry on nothing except the subject [of Iran’sglory] and they should hope for nothing except for the dignity of Iran.O God! Make Iran victorious in this path!92His commitment to telling the truth (as he saw it) resulted in his rejection of fic-tion in general, which he categorised as a form of telling lies. This, however, wasnot unique to Kasravi, as the imperative to tell the truth was an ideological neces-sity that can be witnessed in other writers during the first half of the twentiethcentury in Iran, in which to be an intellectual it was essential to be sociallyengaged for the advancement of the nation.93If Kasravi can be applauded foranything it is that he asked brave and probing questions. Although he was not thefirst to raise issue with Europeanisation and orientalism, he certainly contributedto the self-reflexive attitude of Iranians concerning the West and Iranian culturein the first half of the twentieth century. Moreover, although his thoughts on thesequestions have been rejected and sometimes ridiculed, his pamphlets and writingsat least provided some kind of ground from which subsequent intellectuals wereable to build their critiques of the West and the reconstruction of Iranian iden-tity. It is fortunate that, in spite of Kasravi’s rebukes of E.G.

A more powerfulcatalyst of change was the abundance of ideas that was contained in printedbooks, ranging from biographies of important monarchs and rulers, history, med-icine, technology and literature that was designed to entertain the reader. TheIranian students who had been sent to Europe were among the first to acquaintthemselves with such writings, and in the course of the nineteenth centuryincreasing numbers within Iran had access to Western literature and social sci-ences through Persian translations.1Increasing knowledge of Europe and its publicinstitutions contributed to the movement for socio-political reform which wasexpressed in diverse literary forms. In the years running up to the granting of theConstitution a new form of poetry became widespread in Iran, namely politicalpoetry (much of which was patriotic) that had no real precedent in Iran.2Suchpoems appeared in the plethora of newspapers that were printed during thisperiod, and many were composed in the traditional form of the ghazal(the usualtheme of which had been love) yet contained many new political terms and wordsthat were borrowed from European languages. Some critics, including Sa‘id Nafisi,complained of the lack of style and good taste in such poems by none other thanBahar.3Although Nafisi does not elaborate on his criticism, most likely it seemedbizarre to him that within a single distich Bahar could combine traditional idiomssuch as serr-e zolf(the mystery of the ringlet) with the modern idea ofmajles-e shura(consultative assembly).4Yet the poets had no choice but to adopt the new vocab-ulary in an attempt to appeal to a newly educated class and at the same time utilisea literary form that was familiar for the masses if they were to attract followers totheir cause. Thus, the poets were forced to reject much of the poetic tradition ofIran, as “neither the phlegmatic Qajar court poetry nor the aloof mystic poems ofthe period could provide the proper response”, for the poet now had toexcite a large audience that was mostly illiterate or semi-literate,which listened to his poetry read by others or sung by folk-singers and137"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"revolutionary bards. He had, therefore, to speak to them with simplicityand clarity in order to touch the chords of their heart.5The “phlegmatic Qajar court poetry” referred to was characterised byextremely elaborate sentences that contained several sub-clauses, a mixture ofPersian and Arabic grammar and a penchant for infrequently used Arabicwords.6In the domain of prose writing too, the habit of writing in an obscurefashion had been considered an artistic merit, and as Meskoob has observed, thiswas particularly the case for religious scholars, and even those in the early twen-tieth century who had abandoned the seminary and had become respected menof letters, such as Taqizadeh and Mohammad Qazvini, could not free themselvesfrom the “tyranny of Arabic language and vocabulary”.7The newspapers and“night letters” (shahb-nameh) of the Constitutional period (which contained bothpoetry and prose) would not have permitted such verbosity, for the limited spaceof the press necessitated a clear and concise prose that was free from the flatteryand obscure words and phrases beloved by the men of letters who were attachedto the court.The new poetry of the Constitutional period caused a convergence amongreformists that Persian literature had to be changed, to make it more politicallyand socially appropriate and meaningful, yet it also resulted in a divergence ofopinion about the means to achieve this end. The conservative group (kohnehparast) “sought salvation in a return to the simpler pre-Mongolian styles whichthey tried to link up with, taking Firdausi, Nizami and Sa‘di as their examples”.8For the modernists (motajaddidun) the solution was in “a complete departure fromall classical tradition, whose rhetorical prescriptions and laws they considered tobe so much dead weight preventing the poet from letting his thoughts soaruntrammelled”.9As we have seen, in the period after the First World War theconflict erupted over “the hitherto untouchable and invincible hero of classicalPersian literature”,10namely, Sa‘di: this was the episode mentioned in chapter fiveinvolving Bahar and Mirza ‘Ali Asghar Khan Taleqani who published hiscriticisms of the traditionalists under his articles entitled “The School of Sa‘di”.Yet as we shall see, the classification of “reformists” into two groups is a littlesimplistic, especially when the opinions of Ahmad Kasravi are taken intoaccount, since he held a favourable opinion of Ferdowsi but rejected the verses ofSa‘di as immoral.What united the reforming poets and writers was the rejection of “art for art’ssake”, which had been the single most important distinction for Iranian poets ofthe sixteenth century.11In contrast to the idea of art for art’s sake is the opinionthat art has to be for the benefit of society (writers in Iran during the first halfof the twentieth century as diverse as Kasravi, Hedayat, Arani and Forughi allbelieved that their writings were for the benefit of society).Poetry was not the only form of literature that was affected by Westernliterature, as the short story, or novella, became a popular means for sociallycommitted writers to convey their message. In 1921 Jamalzadeh published hisHOSTILITY TO HAFEZ138"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"short story,Farsi Shekar Ast(“Persian is Sugar”), which was revolutionary in itsform, and which continued the trend of Persianism, as the story criticises theArabic-Persian spoken by the mollas and the Franco-Persian of the Europeanisedyouths. The story is important for popularising fiction as a means to convey amessage; yet despite the potential benefits of this medium, Kasravi was to criticisefiction as little more than a “lie”.By the time that Kasravi commenced his movement to reform Iran, especiallythrough his writings on literature and in particular on poetry, the acrimoniousdebate about the desired forms of Persian literature had been simmering for sev-eral generations. This debate assumed national proportions, as Kasravi claimed,literary associations sprang up all over the country at the same time that Brownesent his Literary History of Persiato Iran. All kinds of books related to poetry andcomposers were published, and domes were erected over the tombs of poets.12Itis difficult to substantiate whether this activity was instigated (directly or indi-rectly) by Browne, but it is clear that literary associations began to appear “morefrequently” during the Constitutional period.13One circle in the post-Constitutional period was the Jargeh-ye Daneshkadeh14that was established in1916–17 by Rashid Yasami,15Sa‘id Nafisi and ‘Abbas Iqbal.16A year later it wastaken over by Bahar who changed its name to the Anjoman-e daneshkadeh, and “itspurposes were to discuss new and timely subjects using traditional forms of poetryand prose and to encourage respect for great literary works of the past”.17TheAnjoman-e daneshkadehwas succeeded by the Anjoman-e adabi-ye Iranin 1920, whichwas guided by H. Vahid Dastgerdi;18it received official recognition from theMinistry of Education; meetings were held once a week within the Ministry ofCulture in Tehran and branches were established in Hamadan, Isfahan andShiraz.19When foreign scholars came to Tehran they were invited to the gather-ings, and on several occasions Taymurtash, the Minister of Court, entertainedthem in his own house.20The aim of the society, according to Nafisi, was to pro-mote literature and to engage in research and analysis of the works and lives ofthe great poets. In this respect, the society’s aims resemble the perspective ofBahar, who was the champion of modernism, but also venerated the old masters,such as Ferdowsi and Sa‘di. Such a position also coincided with the Iranism thatwas promoted by the Iranian state, especially with the rise to power of RezaKhan. It is worth remembering Kasravi’s claim that Mohammad ‘Ali Forughi saidthat it was in the interests of Iran to promote its great poets, including Hafez,Sa‘di, Khayyam and Ferdowsi, in order to earn the respect of Europeans.21However, it is unlikely that the motives of the men of letters were the same asReza Shah in promoting Persianism (as distinct from Iranian nationalism); for theliterati, the message of the great poets was meritorious because it improved thehuman condition. As Nafisi says:There must be a noble purpose in art which gives people inspiration andthere must [also] be a lesson in it that moves the viewer, listener or readerto higher sentiments, and improves him from his present condition.HOSTILITY TO HAFEZ139"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"It [must] show good in a better light and bad in a worse light so thatpeople are inclined to good and flee from bad. The artist must raise thelevel of people’s thought with his art, and [he must] deliver [his] noble,sacred purpose in the simplest and clearest way.22Reza Shah’s promotion of Persianism which was linked with Ferdowsi, Hafez andSa‘di and which broke with the language employed by the Qajar court, on theother hand, may have had more to do with his desire to distance himself from“the old and decadent ‘Persia’ of the Qajars”.23This Persianism was a breakwith the recent past that had caused Iran to putrefy, and it was also a re-discoveryof the great Iran of ancient times which was a superpower of the known world.Reza Shah’s Persianism was a nationalism that was directed simultaneouslyoutwards and inwards; the former is shown in 1935 by the demand that foreignnations henceforth refer to the country as Iran rather than Persia, while the latterbecame clear in a number of measures, for example, in education within secondaryschools local dialects were avoided and geography emphasised the unity of thenation.24The Persian language itself became the focal point for Reza Shah’snationalism, and to this end the Persian Language Academy was created in 1935(upon Forughi’s recommendation) “to protect, promote and advance the Persianlanguage, to coin scientific words and expel foreign ones from this language”.25The creation of this institution is another example of the movement away fromthe Persian of the Qajar court, and indeed, the reform of Persian was supportedby many intellectuals including Kasravi and Hedayat. The “purification” ofPersian from Arabic, Turkish and other languages meant that words and termshad to be invented and re-discovered, that is to say, it re-enforced one of thetrends of modern Persian poetry that glorified Iran’s pre-Islamic past. Theromantic nationalism of the period expressed by the poetswas embarrassed by ordinary people and their ways, and self-consciousof what Europeans might think of “us” because of “them”, but it blewits trumps about Cyrus, Darius, Anushirvan, and the “Aryan race”. Itwas thus both Europeanist and anti-imperialist, both self-glorifying andself-denigrating.26Kasravi’s speech at the Anjoman-e AdabiThe Persianism that became so rampant during the reign of Reza Shah hadmany advocates, and Kasravi was one of its proponents to which his openingremarks at a public address before the anjoman-e adabiin 1935 testifies:We have stood up, ready to be counted and we have said, “God is withus.” What is our aim? The victory of Iran and the exaltation of Iranians.God is a witness that we have no other aim than this.27HOSTILITY TO HAFEZ140"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Kasravi had been invited to address the Anjoman-e adabi, because he had caused astir with some articles that he had written in Paymanduring 1934–5 in which hehad criticised traditional Persian poetry. These articles may have been a reactionto the events surrounding the celebrations of the Ferdowsi millennium. Kasravihimself states:I don’t know if you remember in 1934 when the Ferdowsi millenniumwas established...how many poems were printed in the newspapersand monthly journals, how many societies were set up in Tehran andother places under the name “literary society”, what speeches werewritten in the newspapers, and what books were published. Various trapshad been left beneath the feet of youths.28In his articles on poetry Kasravi had enraged much of the educated establishmentwith his view that Hafez was a source of disgrace. Sa‘id Nafisi responded with anarticle entitled “Hafez is not a source of disgrace” in which he did not mentionKasravi by name but alluded to him as among the “nouveau-riches, fledglingJohnny-come-latelies”.29Jazayery has called Nafisi’s response “an emotionalreaction, rather than a critical discussion”,30however, what is clear in Nafisi’srejoinder to Kasravi is the view of Hafez as a man, who has hopes, desires, andneeds, who dances when he is happy but who does not have all the answers to life’sperennial problems; he does not know his origin or what will happen after death.But this, Nafisi argues, is no reason to call Hafez a source of disgrace, yet at thesame time, neither does it explain why Hafez should be considered a great poet.Nevertheless, Kasravi was given the opportunity to present his opinions onPersian poetry in general to the literary establishment at the anjoman-e adabi, andamong those who attended the lecture were prince Mohammad Hashem MirzaAfsar (who had been the parliamentary representative for Sabzevar and one ofthe leading Democrats)31and Sheikh al-Molk Owrang who was also aParliamentary deputy who had Sufi sympathies.32The first part of the speech is an attempt to define the meaning of literature.Kasravi states that literature is an argument (sokhan) that cannot be consideredindependent from its manner or nature (chegunagi).33Sometimes the argument issimple, but when it is adorned and when there is ingenuity in the writing, we callit “literature”.34For Kasravi, one of the requirements of literature is that it has tohave a meaning that depends upon events in the real world.35Meanings andtherefore literature cannot be imaginary, as Kasravi complains of poets who sup-pose that composing poetry and literature is a profession and they busy themselveswith something that has not yet occurred in the world. Since they consideredpoetry a profession, the poets attached themselves to wealthy patrons and wereforced to write verses full of flattery, and in this way “they blackened the face ofbravery and freedom”.36He bemoans the present circumstances when manyIranian youths consider themselves attached to a certain poetic circle and theyreturn home at night, sit in a corner of a room and compose a poem withoutHOSTILITY TO HAFEZ141"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"there being any need for such work and without there being any meaning in thepoem. Such “poets” simply wear out their minds.At the end of his introduction, Kasravi adds the criterion by which literaturecan be judged as beneficial or not. He cites a ghazalby a Constitutional periodpoet (unknown to Kasravi but later identified as Sami‘i)37in which the authorbelittles the clichés beloved by Iranian poets and seeks a refuge in the topic ofnationalism.The stall has opened, sometimes on the mountain and the desert,Joy has increased in the tree garden and in the flower garden.Ghazalshave been recited, sometimes about the tulip and rose,Puns have been made, sometimes about the cypress and the lily.Comparisons have been made, sometimes between a face and the sun,A hair has been considered, sometimes like a hedge-rose.We have been greedy in seeking pleasure and rebellious against the wheel [of fate]That has stones within a sling.How long will such a drunk remain intoxicated?One of them must open his eyes!Look at the rose garden (golestani),Which is a perfect birthplace and motherland.The real nation takes precedence in being lovedSince it is always our home.Which is this nation of Iran about whose monumentsSo many masterpieces (shahnameh) have been written?How miserable and unfortunate we are,We who have forgotten all about this beloved.We don’t even have as much love for this rose-garden (golshan)As a kiln keeper has for his kiln.From his introduction, Kasravi’s limitations as a literary critic are all tooapparent. Literature reaches beyond the regurgitation of real events, as thehuman imagination has the capacity to contemplate “unreal” situations, feelingsand possibilities in an attempt to derive meaning. Nafisi’s definition of art (citedabove) is more flexible, although it does not explain why some poetry is consid-ered timeless and why such poetry remains so for several hundred or thousands ofyears and may then fall from favour.Following his introduction, Kasravi proceeds to offer four examples of the“futile” verses that appear every day in the newspapers.38His analysis is limited,first, because this method takes the verse out of its context and, second, becausehe understands the words by their literal rather than their symbolic meaning. Inthe verse,If you sip from one or two glasses of wine/The beggar of the city becomes thefortunate king, he takes wine as an intoxicating drink which is bad (not because ofthe Islamic prohibition but because of the findings of modern medicine) ratherHOSTILITY TO HAFEZ142"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"than as a metaphor for love. He considers the verse,If you cut off my legs at theknees/Willingly I will return to you, begging, dangerous because it is possible to seduceIranian girls through such words, and also because he dislikes those who makethemselves subservient to others. Exaggeration and hyperbole was clearly not aliterary device that Kasravi favoured. The verse,Pass the tomb of Mahmud/See howthe name Ayaz is still on his lips, is criticised because it is “outdated” since it employsthe lovers Mahmud and Ayaz,39who were frequently used by Persian poets, yetfor Kasravi repetition is not worthy in literature. The verse,Oh Layla! Shame on you,you slept in the arms of the friend/Majnun is loyal, a vagrant in the mountains, fields and thewilderness,40is condemned by Kasravi because he imagines that the poet believedLayli and Majnun are still alive, and he claims that there are hundreds of braveindividuals and heroes from Iran who could have been used as the subject of suchpoetry. Kasravi then calls for the audience to obstruct the youths of Iran fromwriting such verses; indeed, he calls on the Iranian state to take action:People know that a thousand years ago poetry wasn’t widespread like thisin Iran. Today in Asia, Iran occupies the place that Italy has in Europe,and today the Iranian standard spreads its shadow across the whole ofAsia. Can you deny that world events effect each other? The reason whya people that has become weak and on whom misfortune has fallen is, infact, the futile and irrational acts which appear among them. I do notdeny that the present state (dowlat) has made Iran powerful and I hopethat this power will increase from day to day. But one must not forget thestate too will not obtain a positive result from its efforts when there is agreat number of people who are decrepit (farsudeh) and good for nothing(bi-kareh).41Having completed what he calls his discussion of literature from a “literaryperspective”, Kasravi then proceeds to analyse poetry by applying it to what heterms the rules for life (a‘yin-e zendegani) and what his audience describe as a socialperspective.42In fact, this section is Kasravi’s main concern, for the rest of hispresentation is composed of a brief description of beneficial poetry, followed bya very selective, whistle-stop tour of the history of Persian poetry.Kasravi’s first attempt to define what is good poetry is too wide in its scope tooffer any meaning, for he argues that something is only good when it is consid-ered so on all accounts. However, the scope is then narrowed by his view thatgood poetry is that which promotes good habits (neku-khu’i), Iranism (Irangari) andIslam (Moslemani). This last point is somewhat intriguing, especially when previ-ously in his speech he opposed the consumption of wine, not because Islam hasforbidden it, but because contemporary medicine has discredited the value thatwine was thought to have.43He condemns the modern poets who write verseswith regard only to metre and rhyme and the subject matter of which is “trivial”,for they never pay attention to good habits, Iranism and Islam, rather theyconsider these three as restrictions in their poetry.HOSTILITY TO HAFEZ143"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The argument then turns to a historical overview of Persian poets, commencingwith Ferdowsi, whom Kasravi applauds from a literary and social perspective.“From the perspective of good habits it is enough that I say that in all of his worksthis man has motivated Iranians to bravery, pride and heroism, in short, we haveno criticisms of this great poet.”44Kasravi then quickly passes to Naser Khosrowand Sana’i Ghazvini whom he describes as writers whose works should be lauded.However, from this point, Kasravi launches into an attack on a string of poets,including Anvari,45Mokhtari Qazvini,46Qatran,47Hatefi,48Shater Jalal (a poetwhom Kasravi claims was famous during the reign of Shah Tahmasb),49SadeqMolla Rajab from the Qajar period, and from his own era he condemns the verseof Iraj Mirza50and Adib al-Mamalek.51The reasons for his dislike of these poetsis their flattery, gnostic tendencies, praise of tyrants, bacchanalia and sodomy.(The only poet who is praised in this section of his speech is Nesim-e Shomal.52)In the course of his presentation, Kasravi asks his audience on several occasionswhether it is appropriate that such works should be cast into the fire.It is interesting that Kasravi refrained from attacking the major figures ofPersian poetry in his address; there is no mention of Sa‘di, Rumi or Hafez, whowould all feature predominantly in his later works (such as Dar Piramun-e Adabiyyat).Perhaps this omission was Kasravi’s attempt at placating the wrath that hadalready been kindled about his views of Hafez. However, his attempt at compro-mise (by attacking poets of a lesser stature) failed miserably because his criticismof the subject matter of Persian poetry as outlined in his speech (gnosticism, wine,sodomy, flattery etc.) was an implicit condemnation of the past masters.The ramifications of Kasravi’s speech before the Anjoman-e adabiwere notinsignificant, as Forughi, the prime minister, and Hekmat, the minister of culture,took steps that they must have thought would limit the harmful influence ofKasravi’s views. Forughi banned the publication of the second half of Kasravi’sspeech (the first half had been published in Payman). Kasravi then went to seeForughi, who claimed that Europeans recognise Iran for its poets. In reply,Kasravi countered by referring to book five of Sa‘di’sGolestan(which discusseslove) and said that such evil teachings that were taught in schools was the reasonthat Europeans did not associate Iran with figures like Shah ‘Abbas and NaderShah. Although Forughi claimed that several years previously it had been recom-mended that book five should not be taught in schools, Kasravi responded that noone was aware of such an order. But Forughi ended the discussion with his warn-ing, “He who wants to take up a fight with Sa‘di and Hafez must have greatstrength!.”53Kasravi also disputed with Hekmat who had asked why he had written derogatorythings about Hafez. Kasravi replied that the criticism had come from someoneelse. (Kasravi had published a letter in Paymanfrom a sympathiser who claimedthat he did not understand the meaning of Hafez’sghazals.) Kasravi went furtherand challenged Hekmat to explain the meaning behind Hafez’s praise of wineand the futility of effort and endeavour. Kasravi claims that Hekmat couldnot reply but merely said, “These were outstanding individuals, and we don’t haveHOSTILITY TO HAFEZ144"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"the intelligence to understand their arguments.” Kasravi’s response (recollectedseveral years later) reflects his lack of respect for such figures of authority, as hestated, “This answer is really nonsense,” as a good argument is formed in such amanner that it can be easily comprehended. Nevertheless, Hekmat was not intim-idated by Kasravi and replied that he would only accept Kasravi’s appointmentas a professor at Tehran University if he recanted on these views. (The Iranianparliament had just passed a law which would have enabled Kasravi to take upuniversity employment.) However, Kasravi was a man of principle, and he refusedto take back his opinion.54Kasravi and the controversy over HafezThe BackgroundHafez lingers like a spectre in Kasravi’s speech to the anjoman-e adabibecause ofhis absence. Yet, from the 1920s through to the early 1940s there was a dramaticsurge in academic studies associated with Hafez, with new critical editions ofHafez’s collected ghazalsbeing published in 1927 by Seyyed ‘Abd al-RahimKhalkhali (which was based on a manuscript written thirty-five years after thepoet’s death),55in 1936 by Pezhman56and in 1941 by Qazvini and Ghani whoproduced a widely enlarged version.57Moreover, there were a number of criticalessays about Hafez (mentioned in Chapter 2), the most important of whichincluded articles and contributions by ‘Abd al-Hosayn Hazhir (1921),58Forughi(1937), Mahmud Human (1938),59Mo‘in (1940), Hekmat (1941), Nafisi (1942)and Mas‘ud Farzad (1942).60In addition, the study of Hafez’sghazalswas carriedout within academic institutions; for example, Badi‘ al-Zaman Foruzanfar lec-tured on several ghazalsin the Department of Literature of Tehran University(fortunately the text of one of these lectures has been published, and this lecturereveals Foruzanfar’s view that Hafez was essentially a Sufi poet).61The interest in Hafez during this period is also reflected in the re-building andrenovation of the structures within Hafez’s tomb complex in Shiraz.62This wascommenced in 1931 by the governor of Fars, Dabir-e Azam, Mr Faraj-AllahBahrami (who was also the president of the Shiraz branch of the anjoman-eadabi).63However, the renovations of the complex gathered momentum in 1935once Hekmat assumed the position of Minister of Culture, for as a native of Fars,he wanted a complete renovation of Hafez’s tomb (aram-gah) and repairs to thegardens surrounding it.64(One wonders whether Kasravi’s statement aboutbuilding “domes over the tombs of the poets” was a reflection about this periodrather than that associated with Browne sending his book to Iran.)Although the scholarly works on the topic of Hafez (mentioned earlier) were allfavourably inclined to Hafez’s poetry (whether from a literary, mystical or nation-alistic perspective), there has always been a degree of suspicion and distaste forHafez’sghazalseven in the poet’s own lifetime. One of these criticisms concernsthe form of the ghazalitself, which had developed out of the qasidehwhich wasHOSTILITY TO HAFEZ145"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"a formal ode in which the topic of love serves as a preliminary to panegyric. Theghazalemerged as an independent poetic genre in the twelfth century, but itpreserved its topic of love intact.65Aside from this rule of having a single thematiccontent, the ghazalis also identifiable because it usually consists of between sevento nine distichs, has rhyme within the distichs of the opening verse and mentionsthe poet’s name (usually in the closing verse). While Hafez adhered to most ofthese rules, it seems that in his own lifetime he was accused by Shah Shoja‘ (whocame to power in 1357) of the innovation of composing ghazalsthat had “multi-sided aspects: no one motive, he complained, inspired it, it was on one momentmystical, at another erotic and bacchanalian, now serious and spiritual, and againflippant and worldly, or worse”.66(And such criticisms were echoed in the famousexpression of the eighteenth-century English populariser of Hafez, WilliamJones, who coined the phrase “oriental pearls at random strung”.67)Scholarship has recognised various meanings within Hafez’sghazals, andalthough it is not possible to analyse them all here, it is useful to remember thatthe traditional theme of the ghazalwas love, and Hafez manipulated this theme insuch a way that he was able to reflect on its different aspects, for example, thehypocrisy of some in professing devotion, the “truth” of others in their attemptsto win the attention of the beloved and the ways and manners of the “true” loversthat appeared unconventional and shocking. And it was probably the contents ofthe latter ghazalsthat resulted in the refusal of some of his contemporaries toaccept that Hafez was a true believer in Islam. Indeed, it seems that he wasaccused of heresy for the distich,If Muhammadanism be that which Hafiz holds/Alasif there should be a tomorrow after today.68The disquiet concerning Hafez’s versesreached the extent that his opponents objected to his burial “in the Muslimequivalent of consecrated ground”.69The criticisms that Hafez’sghazalsprovoked in his lifetime continued into theSafavid period, as a work entitled Latifeh-ye Ghaybiyeh(written by MohammadDarabi, contemporary with Shah ‘Abbas II (r. 1642–66)) enumerates some of thecriticisms levelled against Hafez and then attempts to refute them. The criticismsare that some verses are meaningless, others are secular and profane, and that onecan find support for Sunni doctrine.70This work was lithographed in Tehran in1886–7, which suggests that both the refutations of Hafez’sghazalsand the needto answer them remained an important concern.A stinging rejection of Hafez’sghazalsappeared in a Persian masnavi, somethirty years later in 1915, but from the Indian sub-continent, written byMohammad Iqbal. In the first edition of his Asrar-e Khodihe states:Beware of Hafizthe drinker/His cup is full of the poison of death.71Iqbal proceeds to castigate Hafezfor praising wine as a remedy for the horror of the resurrection and whoseIslam appears in the guise of an unbeliever. Interestingly the expression “thebeloved’s eyelashes make holes in his faith” suggests that Iqbal may have classifiedHafez as one of the pantheist Persian mystics (as discussed in Chapter 3). Hafezis also vilified for idle “chit-chat”, and he is also described as a sheep who gives“weakness the name of strength”, and his “musical instrument leads the nationHOSTILITY TO HAFEZ146"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"astray”, so “Go independent of the congregation of Hafez/Beware of sheep andbeware.”72Much of the validity of the criticism directed at Hafez depends of course onthe interpretation of his verses and the understanding of the words that heemployed: is the wine metaphorical or does it refer to the earthly Shiraz wine, andis it the divine beloved with whom Hafez is so enamoured, or is it the handsomewine-bearer, or is it his patron? It is this very ambiguity in Hafez’sghazalsthat per-haps explains their abiding popularity in Iran (and elsewhere for that matter).(In his consideration of why some literary works remain “classics” David Traceyhas argued that such texts help “found or form a particular culture. On moreexplicitly hermeneutic grounds, classics are those texts that bear an excess andpermanence of meaning, yet always resist definitive interpretation”.73Indicativeof this is the amount of ink that has been spilt on the topic of Hafez’sghazals.)The ambiguity that scholars have found within Hafez’sghazalsis partly attrib-utable to his reluctance to associate himself with any one group and his criticismof most of the power-brokers in his time. Thus one can find disparaging remarksabout Sufis,74jurists,75kings,76and law-enforcers77within Hafez’sghazals, while(most of the time) he is happy to transcend formal affiliations, hypocrisy and anyrestrictions on his life-style. This has led many scholars to recognise the signifi-cance of the term rendin Hafez’s work, which has been translated as “inspired lib-ertine”.78Because the rendattempts to transcend hypocrisy to lead an authenticlife, it is easy for most Persians to establish a private bond with Hafez. In the wordsof Shayegan, “Every Persian finds in him a part of himself, discovers in him anunexplored niche in his own memory, a fragrant recollection from the interiorgarden of which he is the unique guardian.”79While this is obviously anexaggeration (to which Kasravi and his like testify), there can be no doubting thepopularity of Hafez. It may well be the very ambiguity of these verses that con-tribute to the “excess and permanence of meaning”, and it may have somethingto do with Hafez’s freedom of spirit, and his refusal to submit to figures of author-ity that enable the Persians to realise that Hafez’s grievance is also theirs; Hafezarticulates the pains and sufferings of generations of Persians but also offers hope(as Nafisi indicates).Kasravi’s criticismsHafez, in fact, was a kharabati. We have always considered him a khara-bati. His kharabtiismwas not due to belief. Rather it was the result of hismind being full of several contrary sets of ideas, and he was left bereft offaith. It is for this reason that he was inclined towards kharabatism, for itconforms most to having no faith.80This is Kasravi’s most succinct attempt to define Hafez’s views, and to assess thevalidity of these comments it is necessary to appreciate what he understood bythe term kharabati. Kasravi admits that this is a term that he has invented,81andHOSTILITY TO HAFEZ147"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"he attributes this world-view to ‘Omar Khayyam and to Hafez. He elaborates on themeaning ofkharabatiin some depth in his work “What does Hafez Say?” andtypically, he makes rather bold claims concerning the emergence of the kharabatisin Iran, which as will be shown leave much scope for discussion and criticism.For Kasravi,kharabatiswere individuals who considered the world meaninglessand futile. It was impossible to understand the world’s purpose (if there was one),and therefore, the kharabatiseven criticised its creator. Since there was no meansto know any truth about the world, the kharabatisbelittled reason and intellect, andthey regarded those who attempted to improve their circumstances with pity orscorn. The only path to happiness was hedonism, especially in wine-drinking andsinging and dancing about the beloved, and this is the philosophy that Kasraviattributed to Hafez and Khayyam.82Kasravi argued that the kharabatisbecame widespread in Iran in the wake of theMongol invasions in the thirteenth century, when Mongol rule paid no particularrespect to Islamic tradition. This meant that the kharabatiswere free to indulge indrinking wine, whereas previously they had to be cautious not to offend theIslamic sentiments of the rulers and the religious authorities. In fact, Kasraviargues that the Mongols were content to give the kharabatisfree reign in propa-gating their fatalist philosophy that encouraged lethargy and hedonism. This wasbecause such a philosophy did not encourage Iranians to rise up against the cru-elty and terror that the Mongols perpetrated. However, the kharabatisdid haveopponents, including the Sufis, and the conflict between the two groups, accord-ing to Kasravi, is reflected in much of Hafez’s poetry.83The conflict between these two was initially the result of the Sufis’ respect forIslamic purity laws and their respect for the prohibition to refrain from drinkingwine. Therefore, they condemned the practices of the kharabatiswho responded inkind by castigating their critics and also by mimicking some of the Sufi institu-tions; the kharabatissubstituted the khanaqahwith their taverns, or kharabeh,84andthe Sufi pirwith their own Magian wine-bearers. Moreover, the similarity betweenthe Sufis’ love for God and the possibility of witnessing God through a shahedwasmatched by the kharabatis, who instead spoke of drinking wine in the name of loveand in remembrance of their own shahed. Kasravi claimed that in spite of thisconflict between the two groups, a degree of compatibility developed betweenthem, and for this reason some Sufis believed that kharabatismwas a station thatthey themselves had to traverse in their quest for perfection.The depiction that Kasravi offers of the kharabatisas a significant social groupthat adopted Sufi trappings and yet broke with the Sufis bears a vague resem-blance to certain individuals and the groups that appeared during the mediaevalperiod. For example, the Malamatis (People of Blame), who emerged largely inKhorasan, were ascetics who were concerned to conceal their piety and avoidostentatious pride in their spiritual achievements. There were some Malamatis,according to Hojwiri (d. 1071), who abandoned the shari‘aand committed irreli-gious acts to incur blame by which they could overcome their pride.85However,although the Malamatis might seem to have been an antinomian group ofHOSTILITY TO HAFEZ148"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"individuals that caused offence to some pious Muslims, they held a completelydifferent religious view to Kasravi’skharabatis; they believed in God and in a worldin which there was purpose. Another group of individuals that resembled themainstream dimension of Sufism were the javanmardan(often translated as chival-rous young men).Javanmardi(chivalry) was by the eleventh century one of thestations that a Sufi had to pass on his journey to God, and by the twelfth century,javanmardiorganisations had sprung up throughout Asia Minor, Iran and adjacentregions, and their rituals and beliefs were similar to those of the Sufi orders.86However, the javanmardancould not commit themselves completely to the Sufi-way,87and one wonders whether it is such groups of young men that aredescribed by Ibn Battuta on his travels in Turkey and Iran.88However, themediaeval literature indicates that the javanmardan, like the Malamatis, weredevout Muslims who had a deep belief in God and His purpose in creation, andthis conflicts with Kasravi’s view of the kharabatis.Despite this there may be a link between Kasravi’skharabatisandjavanmardibecause the latter have been associated with hoodlums called the ‘ayyar. In thetenth and eleventh centuries the ‘ayyarunwere gangs of self-appointed law-enforcers who sometimes engaged in acts of extortion and plunder.89By thetwelfth century, Ibn Jawzi links the ‘ayyarunwith the semi-Sufi javanmardiassocia-tions but portrays them as charlatans who take peoples’ property.90One wonderswhether javanmardigroups or ‘ayyarundegenerated from their more “lofty” idealsand engaged in such acts of extortion and frequented the kharabatwhere theoutcasts and marginalised might have congregated.Another type of individual that is associated with the kharabatis the rend(translated in English as rake, ruffian, pious rogue, brigand, libertine, lout anddebauchee).91Kasravi would have been aware of Hafez’s use of the word rend(especially as it featured predominantly in the interpretation of Hafez’sghazalsinMahmud Human’s 1938 study, see Note 92). For Human, Hafez understood a rendas the individual who did not accept any established belief or creed and who com-mitted acts that were contrary to the shari‘a.92In well-known mediaeval Persianhistories, the word was used to describe groups of thugs or mercenary gangsters,and in Hafez’s time in Shiraz there were urban militias ofrunud(the plural formofrend), who followed a “mafioso code and tended to ignore many of the rules oftheshari‘asuch as the prohibition on drinking.93This being the case, it is possiblethat Kasravi was referring to the rendby the term kharabati. This possibility isstrengthened by the similarity between such urban militias with groups of the‘ayyarun. However, to attribute to these groups the (irreligious) world-view thatKasravi bestows upon them (that this world is meaningless and futile) is problem-atic because so little is actually known about them. Moreover, Kasravi’s textsuggests that such groups were a major influence in Iranian society, perhaps asgreat as that of the Sufis themselves, when there is no evidence that this wasindeed the case.Kasravi’s claim concerning the significance of the kharabaticonflict with theSufis is reduced to nothing by those scholars who have claimed that the HafezianHOSTILITY TO HAFEZ149"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"rendwas a trope, the main function of which was to highlight hypocrisy in society(whether that of the ascetic, Sufi, jurisprudent or judge). In the words ofYarshater,Hafez’s attacks on the pretenders of virtues is not limited to witty orderisive barbs; he employs a stratagem far more effective than merelysatirizing them. To humiliate and embarrass self-righteous hypocrites, hetakes the dregs and derelicts of society and enthrones them as paragonsof virtue, even as pirsor saintly Sufi leaders. These are the rend“debauchee”, the qalandar“dissolute hoodlum” thepir-e meyforush“winesellingpir”.94While Kasravi portrays the kharabati(orrend) as a person who does not know thepurpose of the world and who enjoys wine and song, he failed to give adequateattention to the socio-political message in the Hafezian rend’scriticisms of theestablishment. It is ironic that the Hafezian rendis just as individualistic, antino-mian and iconoclastic as Kasravi was in his lifetime. The politically subversivenature of Hafez’sghazalswas lost on Kasravi who focused more on both the moralissues including the bacchanalia and gazing at young boys and theological ques-tions such as the criticisms of God. The contradiction between Kasravi’s Hafezwho enjoined the reader to lethargy, hedonism and resigning oneself to fate andthe Hafez who condemned the powerful but hypocritical figures in society is glar-ingly obvious. Hafez was a public figure and his tongue was, perhaps, felt to be assharp as any sword, and highlighting this dimension of Hafez’sghazals(despite itbeing a “hagiographic approach”95) could have provided early twentieth-centuryIranians with a national hero, indeed, one whose bravery paralleled that ofKasravi in his own criticisms of the avaricious classes among the ulema and éliteof Reza Shah’s Iran.96Kasravi’s classification of Hafez as fundamentally a kharabatiled him to rejectthe belief that has been held by many Iranians that Hafez’sghazalsshould beunderstood mystically,97as he claimed that Hafez’s poetry is “full of criticisms ofthe Sufis”98. He was aware that there were some who rejected his theories aboutthe conflict between the kharabatisand the Sufis and that Hafez was a Sufi whowrote ghazalsthat were critical of the hypocritical Sufis.99Indeed, Kasravi wasfamiliar with the argument that words such as wine, love,kharabatandshahedwereunderstood in a mystical manner, a feature to which he points in Dar Piramun-eAdabiyyat, with reference to the poetry of Shaykh Mahmud Shabestari. Referencehas been made above to the parallels between the kharabatisand the Sufis, and thesimilarities caused much confusion between the two. For this reason, in hisGolshan-e Raz, Shabestari explained the meaning of these technical terms, forexample:Wine, candle and theshahedhave the same meaning/for he is disclosed in eachform, and Thekharabat is the nest of the bird of the soul/thekharabat is the place of nostation.100Kasravi rejects the interpretation that Hafez was a Sufi and claims thatsometimes one can discover Sufi ideas in his ghazals, but he composed such versesHOSTILITY TO HAFEZ150"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"purely for his own benefit. He states curtly, “Hafez was not a Sufi, he was akharabati.”101To some extent Kasravi should be applauded for not limiting Hafezto the mystical interpretation; however, his refusal to see any other possibilityexcept for his being a kharabatiis a view that is just as blinkered as the opinion thatHafez wrote only mystical ghazals.Kasravi credits Hafez with having written Sufi verses, yet he does not limit thepoet to this, as he lists the various influences upon his thought, which all foundexpression in his ghazals: the Qur’an, Greek philosophy, Iranian history, astrology,fatalism and, of course,kharabatism. The refusal by Kasravi to limit Hafez to asingle interpretation is a line that has been followed by many scholars in recentyears (indeed, it is now recognised that Hafez was very much influenced by thesocial conditions of his times and that perhaps many of his ghazalscan be under-stood primarily as eulogies and as serving a political function – a point thatKasravi too makes, although he condemns those poets who engage in flattery toearn a living). However, for Kasravi the range in Hafez’sghazalssuggestedconfusion, as he was not prepared to permit a more “human” poet, whomight have certain Sufi sympathies at one point in his life, agnostic tendenciesat another time, and who might have written poetry to express his joys at life’spleasures.The methodology that Kasravi employed to promote his idea that Hafez was akharabatiand not a Sufi betrays his amateur approach towards literary studies. Asmentioned earlier, advances had been made in Iran between the 1920s and 40s inthe study of Hafez, as several critical editions and scholarly articles had beenpublished, which if Kasravi had been familiar with them could have helped himin his analysis of Hafez’sghazals. The limitations of “What does Hafez Say” areall too apparent when it is compared with the works of his contemporaries suchas Human’s contribution to Hafezology, which also bears the title “What doesHafez Say?”Human’s work is 163 pages in length, and it is divided into two parts: the firstof which deals with poetry in general, while the second focuses upon Hafez.Within the second section there is a sub-section entitled, “What does Hafez Say?”that succinctly expresses in two distichs what he believes to be Hafez’s mainteaching:Oh heart! Go and drink wine, live the life of a libertine(rend) and refrain fromhypocrisy/It will be a surprise for me if you teach a better way than thisandBe a lover(‘asheq),because one day the world will end/and you will not have understood the purpose ofexistence.102Human then proceeds to investigate the possible meanings of theimportant words, or the technical terms, in each of these two distichs. So, forexample, Human lists the various possibilities to explain the purpose (maqsud) ofthe phrase “Go and drink wine”: it could be the purification of the lower soul andcoming close to the Truth; a second possibility is that it is a means to becomeunaware (bikhabari); another understanding is that it results in becoming liberatedfrom doubt and confusion; it may also result in the scorning of intelligence,knowledge and asceticism; and finally, the purpose may be to distance oneselffrom sorrow. He cites verses from Hafez and Khayyam to illustrate theseHOSTILITY TO HAFEZ151"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"interpretations, before progressing on to an examination of the purpose of theexpression “lead the life of a libertine”, and he lists thirty-nine distichs in whichthe word libertine appears in Hafez’sghazals. Human proceeds in this fashion (tointerpret Hafez through Hafez) to establish the meanings behind the two distichs,although his method is not perfect (citing distichs in which the same technicalterms appear has the disadvantage of isolating the technical terms from theirimmediate contexts, thus potentially missing their significance and meaningwithin the ghazalas a whole). Despite being more thorough and scholarly in hispresentation of elements of Hafez’s work than Kasravi, Human should not beconsidered an uncritical admirer of Hafez. He concludes that “the meaning ofmost distichs of a single ghazalfrom Hafez apparently are not related to oneanother, moreover, finding the principle intention and purpose of each ghazalisnot an easy task”.103Kasravi would certainly have agreed with these views,although he would probably have added a few choice adjectives, such as “StupidHafez!”104or “Hafez the criminal!”105or “Hafez, speaker of balderdash!”106Moreover, Human was cautious enough to appreciate that the collection ofHafez’sghazals(divan-e Hafez) as it has been handed down through the years isincomplete (naqes) and unordered (bi-tarbiyati), and one cannot understand Hafez(shenasa’i-ye Hafez) through them.107That is to say, it is extremely difficult(although attempts have been made)108to classify the ghazalson a chronologicalbasis that may offer some insight into the possibility that Hafez’s world-view mayhave developed and changed (something that Kasravi does not even consider).Moreover, as an extension from Human’s conclusion, the ghazalsmay not neces-sarily reflect Hafez’s own personal world-views (especially when it is consideredthat some ghazalscould have been written to pander to a local magnate or thatsome may have been written as a mental exercise).Kasravi’s weakness as a literary critic manifests itself in his remarks about theonly whole ghazalthat he cites in “What does Hafez Say?” In fact, this ghazalmaynot even have been written by Hafez, as it does not appear in the critical editionsthat were published by Khalkhali and Qazvini and Ghani in the 1920s–40s. Theproblem of identifying whether a particular Hafez ghazalis genuine has beennoted by several scholars,109and Kasravi could have been expected to select aghazalfor analysis that had received a “seal of approval” from Khalkhali orQazvini. (Indeed, in 1962 Sa‘id Nafisi published the complete works of OwhadiIsfahani (famous as Maraghi)110(1274–1338) in which the same ghazalappearsunder his name rather than under Hafez’s.111Nafisi adds that some of the versesin Owhadi’sghazalswere so good that they were attributed to Hafez, and peoplejust accepted this.112)Even if Kasravi is forgiven on this point, it is still possible to assess his criticismof the ghazalin “What does Hafez Say?” His main argument is that poets were soconcerned with perfecting the rhyme of the ghazalthat the distichs as a wholewere incoherent. In other words, the subject changed from verse to verse, whereastheghazalby tradition was supposed to have been limited to a single or at bestjust a few related subjects.

There is no front or back for a candle.5 The person who turns away from you because [he is afraid] of the sword is negligent.Doesn’t the fly truly understand the pleasure of tasting sugar?6 I remember when I yearned to see many [different] things.But when I saw you I had no wish but to witness you.7 Even if the people are afraid of the night-patrolsI am in such a state that the night patrol cannot distinguish me from my shadow.8 Your alley was flooded with my tears [that were] like an ocean, and I am scared that once moreThese worthless rivals will float to the surface, like straw.9 Oh Hafez! This path is not for the legs of [this] lame carcass of yours.So take a rest that no dust will be churned up by this horse.Kasravi claimed that in order to construct a ghazal, the poet would make a listof the rhyming words (in the ghazalcited above he lists, for example,kas(no one),adas(lentil),nafas(breath)) which then leaves the train of thought in the ghazalatthe mercy of the rhyming scheme; in other words, the meaning of the distichshave no real relation to one another.113However, Kasravi’s argument is extremelyweak, and it is an easy task to construct links between the distichs and, indeed, toread the ghazalas a unified whole. In fact, the ghazalin question conforms to theviews of G.M. Wickens who, in his “focal theory”, argued that the distichs sharea focal point. “They come together in the same way that the spokes on a wheelconverge at the hub.”114(Although the unity of the ghazalappears to be quiteapparent, it would be hasty to assume that poet is actually referring to love (divineor earthly), for as Meisami has indicated, the allegory or imagery in Hafez’sghazals“serves as a background against which to treat a more specific aspect ofthe suppliant–goal relationship, that of poet and patron”115.)The topic of the cited ghazalfalls within the traditional subject matter oflove. The first three distichs describe the yearning of the subject for the beloved,which causes the former to transcend all worldly distractions. The fourth distichturns to the beauty of the beloved who is described as a candle, the light ofwhich attracts people from all directions. (This brings to mind the Sufi imagery ofthe moth diving into the flame of the candle; however, to read the poem only inHOSTILITY TO HAFEZ153"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"such a mystical fashion would be to deprive it of its “excess of meaning”.)Distichs five and six describe the pain and pleasure of love, which is a typicaltheme in love poetry (which has its Sufi parallel in the qabz o bast, that is, depres-sion and elation, the various moods that the lover experiences, which are influ-enced by the presence or absence of the beloved). It seems that Kasraviwas particularly perplexed by the fifth distich for he returns to it twice in HafezCheh Mi-guyad. The humble fly is such a persistent creature that it keeps returningto the sugar bowl despite the numerous attempts that may be made to get rid ofit. It stands in contrast to the weak efforts made by some humans to gain accessto their sweetheart, who may run away at the slightest hint of trouble or danger.The sixth distich also returns to the theme of the first, namely the attention anddevotion that is focused solely upon the beloved. The seventh continues in thesame vein, as the lover has no concerns for what others, such as the nightpatrol, may think about his love. The only concern that the lover has is withpotential rivals (distich eight) who might attract the attention of the beloved.Viewed with an understanding of the common theme of the beloved being areluctant male figure, the ghazal’smeaning becomes apparent. As Yarshater hasobserved,the love...[for the reluctant male lover] – even though acceptedin poetry – is not condoned by the Law, hence the indifference oracerbity of the beloved, the scandal of revealed love (rosva’i), theadvice of nay-sayers and dispensers of wisdom against such love,the oppressive hindrance of the beloved’s warden or chaperon (raqib),and the poet’s burning envy of the other admirers and lovers of thebeloved.116The flaws in Kasravi’s criticisms are all too apparent, as for example, he callsthe eighth distich “immeasurably weak and foolish, and it is clear that was onlyfor rhyming the word khas(straw)”. However, in the light of Yarshater’s commentsit is clear that the meaning been skillfully crafted; the lover has become so besot-ted and frustrated by those “worthless chaperones” (raqiban) that he cries floods oftears, thereby bringing attention to himself and causing the raqibanto re-appear.The word raqibhas been translated by Yarshater as “chaperon” but it also has themeaning of a rival, yet whatever way raqibis translated, the verse still makesperfect sense.The other distich that Kasravi mentions is the second, which he argues is weakbecause the poet was caused to use the word adas(lentil) in the rhyme. However,the second distich repeats the message of the first, but the poet re-enforces itsmeaning by utilising the Persian literary devise ofmura‘at al-nazir, combining thethree items of a similar kind (wheat, barley, lentil) within a single distich.Moreover, one wonders whether the poet is alluding to the actual identity of thebeloved in this fashion (if it is to be given an “earthly” reading), after all, thebeloved’s skin tone is described as wheaty (gandom-gun) and one wonders whetherHOSTILITY TO HAFEZ154"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"the name of the beloved is in some way associated with adasorjaw(barley). Thename of the beloved isfrequently...mentioned in the body of the poem...It also happens thatthe poet dispenses with naming the patron explicitly, designating himonly by his title...or by some epithet clear enough to contemporaryaudiences, but less easy for us to decipher.117Such cautious remarks about the problems that contemporary readers face incomprehending the “real” meaning of the poem stand in contrast to Kasravi’scurt comments that the verse is meaningless.In the final distich of the ghazal(themaqtal), the name of the poet is oftenrevealed, which not only provides the poem with a signature but also gives “anelegant conclusion for which a separate motif could be chosen, and whichneed not be particularly connected to the subject matter of the poem”.118In thecitedghazal, the poet is able to distance himself from the poem by referring tohimself and claiming that this path of love (whether gnostic or earthly) demandstoo much of his lame carcass. Such a conclusion in itself warns the reader thatthe main theme of the ghazaldoes not necessarily reflect the concern of theauthor; as some have indicated,ghazalswere written for a variety ofreasons (entertainment, panegyric, mystical devotion, earthly love and poeticcompetition).119In the final section of “What does Hafez say?” Kasravi offers another ghazalfor analysis, although his citation includes only seven distichs of the thirteencontained in Khalkhali’s edition (number 10) and in Qazvini’s edition (number 5).Kasravi’s purpose in inserting this ghazalis to reveal the loose connectionsbetween the verses. Remarkably, he does not even cite the matla‘, the openingdistich, in which, according to Kasravi, the poet decides the rhyme of the ghazal,neither does he give the final distich in which Hafez’s name is mentioned. Kasravicommences with the second distich:We are shipwrecked. Rise up and blow o favourable wind!Perhaps then I shall see once more the friend.Yesterday, the nightingale sang sweetly in a party of roses and wine,“Bring the morning wine! Wake up you intoxicated ones.”O miracle-maker! In gratitude for safety,One day seek out the begging dervish.The comfort of the worlds is in the explanation of these two phrases:Be generous with friends and be civil with enemies.They didn’t let us into the alley of good-reputationIf you don’t approve [of us], you [will have to] change fate.Look!

The main message in the ghazalis that the human condition is such thatthere is a lack about which man is aware (even though the actual identity of thislack remains a mystery) and therefore man is ever seeking a return to a golden agewhen everything was perfect. Despite this lack, man should be grateful for what isgiven to him (life, security and good wine), and he should lead a good life by beingkind and generous, for to be otherwise will bring its own form of chastisement. Forthose seeking a mystical interpretation, it is worth bearing in mind Schimmel’sobservation of how Jalal al-Din Rumi saw “how the fragile boat of human exis-tence is shattered when the wave Alast, the sudden reminiscence of the primordialcovenant, reaches the soul”.121This primordial covenant “is mentioned frequentlyunder the rubric of the ‘banquet ofalast’, the festive meal”,122and thereforeHafez’s mention of a party of wine and roses makes complete sense.The distich that discusses jam-e Jamis somewhat problematic, although a solu-tion may be found by comparing Kasravi’s version with that of the other criticaleditions. Khalkhali’s version reads jam-e mey(chalice of wine) (rather than jam-eJam) which in the context of the poem makes better sense, for by drinking wineone is able to experience the happiness of kings, perhaps filling the lack that onefeels. Moreover, the reading “chalice of wine” offers an explanation as to whyHafez has not been permitted into the “alley of good-reputation”, for withinHafez’s own lifetime the prohibition on wine-drinking was, at times, strictlyenforced. In effect, Hafez enjoins his readers to enjoy life as much as possible. Itis worthwhile to present the penultimate and final distichs of Khalkhali’s edition(which Kasravi omits) in order to reveal the message of the ghazal:The Persian speaking Turks are life givers,Saqi! Give the good news to the rendsof Fars.Hafez! Don’t put on this wine-stained kherqeh.O pure sheikh! Forgive us.The “Persian speaking Turks” were the saqis, the wine-bearers who were gen-erally slaves, for as Yarshater remarks,the best types [ofsaqis] were reputed to come from [Turkestan]. Theywere noted for both their good appearance and their bravery as soldiers...at their best, such slaves were excellent soldiers and finehorsemen, played a musical instrument, were refined in their mannersand proved delightful companions.123HOSTILITY TO HAFEZ156"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"It is not surprising, then, that Hafez describes these “Persian speaking Turks” aslife givers. His desire for the companionship of such saqisand his desire to eat,drink and be merry leads him to reject the kherqeh, which stained with wine,epitomises the hypocrisy of the Sufis (as opposed to the begging dervish).Moreover, realising that his life-style may be considered less than pious by some,Hafez begs to be excused by the “pure” Sufi sheikh.Aside from his consideration of these two ghazals in “What Does Hafez Say?”Kasravi “analyses” two complete ghazalsin his chapter on Hafez in Dar Piramun-eAdabiyyat. Both of these ghazalsare included within Khalkhali’s edition of theDivan-e Hafez, (numbers 19 and 103), so at least on this occasion his commentsapply to ghazalsthat were written by Hafez.1 That night of destiny124which the people of seclusion say is tonightO Lord! From which constellation comes the effect of this fortune?2 So that the hands of the unworthy do not touch your ringletsEach heart in the circle is busy with the recitation “O Lord, O Lord”.3 I am dead in your chin-dimple125(chah-e zanakhdan) and from all aroundHundreds of thousands of souls are beneath the collar of [your] double chin.4 See the radiance of the perspiration on his cheek, when the warm face ofthe sunIs jealous of that bead of sweat, each day of his is night.1265 Within the retinue that was saddled upon the zephyr wind.I spoke with Solomon: “I am mounted on an ant.”1276 My brave cavalier, the moon is the mirror reflecting his face,The crown of the exalted sun is the earth for the hooves of hismount.7 The water of life drops from the beak of eloquence,The crow of my pen, [caws] “In the name of God”, what an inspiration!.8 I don’t want to abandon the friend128and the chalice of wineAscetics forgive me, for this is my religion.9 He who fires an arrow at my heart with a wink of an eye,And with a smile beneath his lips, sustains Hafez’s soul.There is little in Kasravi’s analysis of the ghazalcited above except for his par-aphrasing of each distich and his comments that the poet was conditioned by therhyme. However, the ghazalmanifests unity through its working of the traditionaltheme of expressing love. The beloved is so beautiful that the poet declares thatin his/her creation there must have been some beneficial workings of the heavensto determine such beauty. Even the Sufis have to busy themselves with recitingtheir ritual zekrto avoid the temptation of devoting their attentions to the beloved.The poet claims that the beloved attracts so many admirers and even the sun isHOSTILITY TO HAFEZ157"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"jealous of his/her radiance. Everything else pales into insignificance before thebeloved, as the lover is like an ant compared with the Solomon of the beloved,and the sun and moon too serve the beloved in their own ways. The seventhdistich seems slightly strange, and it would function better had it been positionedat the very end of the ghazal, as a maqtal(indeed, in the editions of Khanlari andQazvini and Ghani, this distich does appear as the maqtal). The eighth and ninthdistich state that the poet will remain devoted to the beloved, for he is helpless toresist the charms of the beloved. He asks the ascetics (perhaps the Sufis of the firsttwo distichs?) to forgive him, for the beloved and wine are his religion. The ghazalcan be read in a mystical or a secular fashion, and it is even possible that Hafezmay have addressed it to a patron or someone at court. Moreover, the boast of theseventh distich(or Khalkhali’smaqtal) suggests that Hafez might have composedtheghazalpurely for his own enjoyment. What is clear, however, is that Hafez hasproduced a ghazalthe distichs of which lead effortlessly into the central hub.129Kasravi may have been correct that Hafez assembled a list of rhyming words, buteven if the poet did this, he was able to fashion them into a coherent messagewithout contradictions.Kasravi’s complaint with the second ghazalinDar Piramun-e Adabiyyatis that itoffers a melange of meanings, ranging from Kharabati (distichs 1, 2, 3,) to Sufi(distichs 5, 7, 8, 9, 10), to the praise of love (4) to meaningless nonsense due to adesire to use a certain word in the rhyme scheme (distich 6).1301 When you gaze at the mystery ofjam-e JamYou can see the earth of the tavern is collyrium for the eyes.2 Begging at the door of the tavern is a wonderful elixir,If you do this, the earth turns into gold.3 Beneath the azure sky don’t be without wine and musicBecause sadness is expelled from the heart with this melody.4 March resolutely in the station of loveBecause you will profit much if you make this journey.5 Come on!

See how the strength of the rhyme throws the poet out ofthe tavern and drags him to the khanaqah, and makes him turn to hisascetic discipline.134While it is true that it is easy to read a literal meaning into Hafez’sghazals(that isto say, he speaks non-metaphorically of wine from grapes and taverns), in thisghazalit makes more sense to read Kasravi’s “kharabati” distichs (numbers 1–3) andthe non-Sufi distichs (4, 6) in an ‘erfanifashion.HOSTILITY TO HAFEZ159"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"1607“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”1Ahmad KasraviIn the name of the pure CreatorFor years now European orientalists who are political tools have praised Hafez andhis poetry. This praise, which is nothing than a political device, has been the originof the mistaken path [taken] by a great many Iranians, who imagined it was rightto have recourse to Hafez’s book. Since Hafez’s works are confused, nonsensical,and a single meaning cannot be found in them, people troubled themselves toknow his intention, and this has been the origin of difficulty for many people, forthey themselves have been deceived and they have also deceived others.I am writing this as a remedy to that difficulty and to prevent those troubles.What do the poets understand of poetry?Just as readers know, we are not opposed to poetry, and we don’t say that thereshould be no poetry. Our argument is that [composing] poetry in itself is not thepurpose [of poetry]. Poetry is [a form of speech] and a speech is a follower ofneed. We say that if someone has something to say, he can say it in poetry or hecan say it in prose. We have no complaint with him.Our complaint is with someone who doesn’t have a topic in his speech, but inthe name of poetry he busies himself in making this speech. We say this is idletalk. We say that if someone has been a lover then he composes ghazals. But itis unwise for someone with a tranquil heart to lie and speak about love andcompose love ghazals.Poetry is like a house. A house is for living, and wherever there is a need [to livesomewhere] there is a house. It is unwise if someone builds a house in a desert oron top of a mountain where no one lives.This discourse is simple and easy [to understand]. Anyway, the poets have notunderstood this, and they fancied that poetry should have a single, separatepurpose, without them being tied to any requirement. They composed muchpoetry, including ghazals,qasideh,qat’eh, single verses and quatrains, they boasted tothemselves, imagining this was a profitable skill or profession. There is a person"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"in Tehran that I saw one day in a party, and he complained to the people and said,“I have composed 50,000 poems for the country.”This has been the method of the poets, and Hafez had this very same method.He too believed that poetry had a purpose, separate [from expressing a need],and so he spent his whole life reciting poetry and composing ghazals. Many times,people have searched to find Hafez’s intention from his ghazals. It is necessary tosay, “his intention was only composing the ghazals, and he imagined this to be askill and profession, and he had no other intention.”How did the poets compose ghazals?Just as the readers know, poets in Iran give more importance to the rhyme in com-posing the ghazalthan in anything else. Therefore when the poet wants to com-pose a ghazal, he decides on its rhyme (or it is better if I say the words that rhymewith the qafieh), and he writes them as a list under each other or next to eachother. For example,kas,bas,adas,nafas,pas,magas,havas,‘asas,khas,faras,sepasandhe thinks of a sentence for each one and produces a poem, and in this way con-structs a ghazal. In truth, the train of thought is in the hands of the rhymingscheme, and the poet has no choice but to follow it.Hafez too was a follower of such a method, and we will produce a poem of hisas proof of this.1 No-one has a place in our heart except for the friend.Give the two worlds to the enemy, for the friend is all we need.2 If our wheat-coloured friend desired half a barley-grain,In our eyes both worlds would be worth [ just] a single lentil.3 Do you remember when you were with others all the time?Oh, I could not breathe without recalling you.4 You are like a candle and the people follow in front of and behind you.No!

In the same way,many of the other verses especially the eighth is immeasurably weak and foolish,and it is clear that it was only for rhyming the word khas(straw).I wish readers would put aside that good opinion of Hafez and forget the name“tongue of the unseen” and other foolish praises that they have heard of this poet.They should weigh each one of these verses with a clear mind and try to see whatconfused meanings come from each one. In order to appreciate this point easily,it is better that each verse is turned into prose and then analysed.Most of Hafez’sghazals(although I don’t say each one of them) are of the kindwhere the poet’s intention has been to compose a ghazal. In this too he followedthe customary method of the poets, [namely] in first writing out the rhymes andconstructing sentences for each one and then constructing a couplet. For this rea-son most of that poetry has no meaning, and it is clear that [the poetry] has beencomposed merely with the consideration of the rhyming word.For example, consider this verse:With the resolution of repentance I cast a spell, and I look for a divine omen(estakhareh).Repentance-shattering Spring dawned, so what can I do?2Is a divination (estakhareh) required for repentance? What have repentance anddivination got to do with one another? Estakharehis when someone consults Godthrough the Qur’an,tasbihbeads or something else about whether he should orshould not do such and such an act, and this is the belief of the common Muslims.From the words “repentance” and “estakhareh” one must acknowledge that Hafezwas a Muslim and that he realised wine-drinking was a sin. But consider wellwhether a Muslim should engage in divination for repentance for drinking wine?Does it mean that a Muslim should consult God about whether he should be repen-tant for drinking wine? It can be argued that the poet’s intention was only in makingthe rhyme, and his aim was solely to use the word estakharehand put it into the ghazal.If one night I speak of repentanceRinse my mouth with wine from the impurity of such a thing.Previously the poet was a Muslim and spoke of repentance and estakhareh. Buthere he has spoken a terrible insult against Islam. If the word repentance comesto my tongue, my mouth will be unclean and so I will clean it by rinsing it withwine. Here too, he only wants to use the word gharareh(rinse) and make it rhyme,and it is for this purpose only that such contents are so base.“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”162"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"What did Hafez know?In Iran during Hafez’s lifetime several kinds of knowledge and awareness(both good and bad) were current and we can list them below:1the Qur’an, its interpretation and Islamic commands;2classical philosophy (falsafeh-ye yunan) and old and new weavings ofphilosophers;3Sufism and the endless evil teachings of the Sufis;4Kharabatismand the poisonous evil teachings of the polluted;5the struggle between the Kharabatisand the Sufis (we shall explain this);6the history of Iran and its legends (including the stories of Khosraw,Alexander, the jam-e Jamand others);7astrology and astronomy;8fatalism and the evil teachings of the fatalists.Hafez was aware of all of these and one must say that they blocked his under-standing and wisdom and confounded his mind. Just as we have said many times,generally in the adoption of contrary and inappropriate ideas one’s wisdom isobstructed and one’s mind is confused. The understanding of whoever accepts in hismind the sayings of the Kharabatis, the evil teachings of the Sufis and the Islamiccommands must either be so strong that he can rule over these three which conflictwith each other, or without a doubt, his understanding and wisdom will be confusedamong them, and slowly he will become useless. In particular, Hafez drank wine, andin this he was not careful enough, for this was another cause of his brainwashing.It is better for people who say Hafez did not drink wine, and that his meaningof wine and the tavern was something else, to read his poetry and understand hislying. In many places the poet declares that his meaning was that very wine whichis made from grapes and is red in colour:What would happen if you and I drink a few glasses of wine?Wine from the blood of grapes, not from your blood.3The light of our eyes is the beauty of the daughter of the grape.Although she is within a translucent veil and a grape skin4That bitter wine which the Sufi calls “the mother of impurities”Is more lawful and delicious to us than the kiss of a maiden.5Anyway, Hafez sought to use all of this knowledge in composing poetry, and hissole purpose was composing the ghazal, and in this task, just as we have described,he first wrote out the rhyming words and then by constructing sentences, he turnedit into poetry. Sometimes he used the Qur’an and its expressions in this task:Recite a verse (ayati) from the beloved’s cheek.It is the explanation of stations (maqamat) and the unveiling of the unveiler (kashf-e kashshaf)!6“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”163"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"And sometimes he used the classical philosophy:After this there is no doubt for me concerning the single substance (jawhar-e fard)Because your mouth is sweet proof(khush estedlal)of this point.7Sometimes he used the Sufis’ fabrications:My body’s dust is the veil of the soul’s faceOh how wonderful when the veil is torn aside from this face!8Sometimes he turned to Kharabatismand became very bold:Speak of the minstrel and wine, and seek less the secret of time (dahr)For no one has revealed or unties the wisdom of this architect!9Sometimes he got involved in the struggle with the Sufi lovers whom he scolded:It is not expedient that the secret should be divulged from behind the curtainBut in the gathering of the vagrants (majles-e rendan)there is no news that is not(spoken).10Sometimes he used Iranian legends:Take the cup with courtesy, because it is madeFrom the skull of Jamshid, Bahman and Qobad.11Sometimes he sought assistance from the astrologers and their myths:Seize the tress of the beautiful moon-faced one, but do not speak of it.Because felicity and misfortune are derived from Venus and Saturn.12Sometimes he engaged in fatalism and became quite extreme:Since God has determined my fate for the tavernIn the meantime tell me what is my sin that I should be punished.Aside from giving praise, [recounting] the story of the rose and the nightingale,wine and sodomy (badeh va sadeh) and others like these, sometimes too, all of asudden he would speak [unrelated] nonsense.In brief, the intention of Hafez was constructing rhyme and composing ghazals,it was not making a discourse and expressing meaning. Therefore you see acouplet on a different topic in his ghazals, and no connection can be seen in it[with the other couplets]. The person who wants to make a speech and deliver hismeaning must pay attention to the connections between the expressions and not“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”164"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"say unconnected things. But since Hafez’s intention was something else, he didnot pay too much attention, and he should not have done this. For example whydoes he say,Oh wind! If you pass the shore of the Aras RiverKiss the earth of that river-bed, and render your breath musky.13It is not the case that Hafez was attached to the Aras River or, in truth, evenremembered it. The Aras River is in Azarbayjan, and Hafez had only heard of itsname and had no affection for it. His purpose was merely to use the word “Aras”in a ghazalwhose rhyme was “as.”So, just as we have said, Hafez was aware of the commands of Islam,Kharabatism, Sufism and classical philosophy, and all four are contrary to oneanother. He did not have a firm attachment to any one of them, and so at anymoment he would pay attention to one of them and make sentences from them,and so his discourses are disjointed and contradictory.Hafez, in fact, was a Kharabati. We have always considered him a kharabati. Hiskharabatismwas not due to belief. Rather, it was the result of his mind being full ofseveral contrary sets of ideas; he was left bereft of faith. It is for this reason thathe was inclined towards kharabatism, for it conforms most to having no faith.Anyway, the purpose is that people who desire to search and know what Hafezsaid have given themselves a futile task that is full of difficulty. For just as we havesaid, first, Hafez was not concerned with making a [coherent] speech. Second,Hafez was not firmly attached to any belief, for if he had wanted to makesay something then there would be no result in his words.The story of Hafez is that of a man who practised writing like a machine, andit is for this reason that he wrote each sentence that came to his mind, oneafter the other, and so, for example, I have such a page, and I want to relateseveral of its sentences: “Your work has been very difficult. A friend is a per-son who takes the hand of a friend. Having no money is a terrible thing.Manuchehr is a good boy.” The person who writes like a machine writes such sen-tences on the page, and it is inappropriate that someone should want to discoverthe meanings in these sentences and say that the intention of this writer was suchand such.What did the Kharabatissay?The Kharabatiswere a group who considered this world as futile and worthless,and they made many criticisms of its creation and its creator:Oh foolish one!

He makes a pot and then smashesit to pieces.”The composition of the cup that is intermixed,The intoxicated allows not the smashing of it!So many beautiful faces, feet, palms and hands,Moulded with love and smashed in wrath.21They said that it is unknown whether there is a beginning or an end for this worldand we don’t know where we came from and where we will go:For a while is our coming and going in the world,Unknown for it is the beginning and end.No one can tell us the truth of this meaning:From whence is our coming to where is our going?22“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”166"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"It is unknown why in the pleasure-house of the earthThe painter of beginning without end decorated me so.23From these sayings of theirs, they drew the [following] conclusion.

It is better neither to be sorrowful about the past or futurenor take care of anything but to remain happy. If it was not possible to attainone’s own pleasure [through effort], it could be obtained through wine. Theysaid: “A life is no more than a single breath in which [we now] exist. We musttreasure it. Moreover, we should be happy and intoxicated, and spend our time[listening to the music] of the lute and tambourine in the kharabat(tavern).”They continued: “This world has existed in this way for countless centuriesand humans have come and gone continuously, and we will depart too aftera while”:Since no-one can guarantee tomorrow,At least make this melancholy heart happy.Drink wine under the moonlight. Oh moon!The moon will shine for many evenings, but will not find us [here].24Sit [and drink] wine, for this is Mahmud’s right.And listen to the lute, for this is David’s melody.Don’t think anymore of what has not come and what has gone.Be happy because this is the purpose of existence.25You can control the wind if you empty your heart.In a moment even Solomon’s empire will vanish.Yesterday the old wine-seller, may he be remembered well,Said: “Drink wine and forget the sadness of your heart.”This was how these people regarded wine. However, they went to extremes andpraised it too much. They made it their most precious thing, and they spokenonsense about it:When I am dead, wash me in wine,Recite prayers over me with the wine and the cup.If you want to find me on the Day of GatheringYou will find me in the earth of the tavern.26How fortunate the drunken vagrant (rend-e mast)who renounced this world and the nextAnd had no sorrow, great or small.O Spring rain-cloud!

At first glance these arguments appear authoritative and attractive.For this reason many people have been deceived by them.But it must be said [the arguments] are absurd. In truth, there are two strandsto these arguments. One is that this world is futile, and that we know nothing ofits beginning and end. The other is that we should not engage in any effort butspend our time in intoxication and pleasure.It must be said that first, this world is a well-adorned and up-right creation, andthis is clear with just one look or glance that a wise and able creator created it andthat an order operates in it (since we have discussed this topic in other places wewill not busy ourselves with it here). Second, if it is supposed that this world isfutile, its meaning will not be that we should not bother with any effort but merelyengage ourselves in pleasure and intoxication.People who do not think of the past and future will not find any peace of mindor pleasure in life, and their fate will be nothing other than falling into the handsof foreigners. People must think of the past and future of this world, futile or not,and adopt a path wisely for living in it.If a wise man is thrown into a dark prison he must think how to live there andhow to lighten the difficulties that he faces there.

The premise, which they have chosen, is a mistake, and the con-clusion that they have drawn from it is more mistaken. Another of their mistakesis fatalism, and they have composed all of those verses about it.Sufism in Mongol timesWe said that one of Hafez’s topics for discussion was the struggle between theSufis and the Kharabatis. In order to make this clear we need to present anintroduction to the history and to the behaviour of the Sufis.Once Islam triumphed over Iran, one of its effects on Iranians was the increasein feelings of bravery and militarism. Iranians themselves were a war-like people,and Islam too made war and manliness a duty for everyone. From this perspec-tive in the first centuries of Islam in Iran this feeling was very strong. [But] ifsomeone searches into Iranian history in the ninth and tenth centuries, he will seethat the Samanid dynasty was founded in Transoxania, and it was continually atwar and in conflict with the Turks, and in the words of Estakhri, there werealways 300,000 horsemen ready on the border. It was Estakhri who wrote: “Ineach of the houses of the farmers that I visited, a sword was hanging from thewall, and I saw a horse saddled in the stable. Everyone was ready for war.” Onthe other side of Iran, the brave men of Daylam descended from their mountainsand established the basis for rulership in each corner, and the Buyid dynastyadvanced as far as Baghdad and took the Caliphate under control. After every-thing, Soltan Mahmud Ghaznavi advanced to India, ambushed cities and tookthe spoils of war. Anyway, groups of Iranian warmongers who had remained idle“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”169"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"raised the standard and hurried to join the Muslim war with the Turks of AsiaMinor.In one year we find that 80,000 people joined the war from Khorasan alone.See the extent of this feeling for war. See how the zeal (of these people) increasedand how they were intoxicated.We see this until the beginning of the eleventh century. But when we reach thebeginning of the thirteenth century, suddenly we see it is turned upside-down.Suddenly we find that there is an absence of zeal and manliness in Iran, becauseduring this period Chingiz Khan came to Transoxania and spent four years inkilling, and during this time there was no resistance [against the Mongols] in Iran.In this period Yama and Sutay, two Mongol generals, with 30,000 horsemenpassed the Jayhun River, and the killers passed through Khorasan and came toMazandaran, Iraq, Azarbayjan and Qafqaz. They killed people, plundered citiesand they joined their military base in the north of the Caspian Sea. Alas! Whatwas the reason for this reluctance among the masses of people?This in itself is a puzzle. During those 200 years from the eleventh century tothe thirteenth century, why did the Iranians change in this way? What happenedto the Iranian people in those two centuries?No one has investigated this topic, and no one can give an answer to this question.But we know the answer. In those centuries in Iran, several evil teachings becamewidespread, and as a result, war mongering and manliness surrendered theirplace to carelessness and apathy. One of those evil teachings was Sufism, anotherwas Batenism, and another was Kharabatism.We know that a number of people have not believed [this] and will say: “Haveevil teachings persuaded the people to become apathetic?” We say: “Don’t youknow that the origin of all human tasks is the mind, and the mind, too, is the fol-lower of the thoughts that are in it.” Can a Kharabati(who considers this world asnothing and absurd and says that one should not be concerned with the past andfuture) hope to be zealous and make a sacrifice for the people and the country? Cana Sufi (who makes no distinction between justice and tyranny, darkness and light,straight and crooked and in that melancholic world imagines that the blood-thirstyMongols are “God”) hope to take up the sword and hurry off in warfare?In addition, not one of the Batenis, or the followers of Hasan Sabbah,34cameto kill Hulagu35or any other Mongol general or even put fear in them duringthe Mongol period, [even though] they killed thousands of Iranians with thedagger. That [ policy of ] assassination36too was nothing other than a kind of basemadness.Anyway, there is no doubt that the essence of the weakness and helplessness ofthe Iranians vis-à-visthe Mongols was these three evil teachings. This is one of thehidden secrets of Iranian history that must be discussed at length and in public,but here we do not have the opportunity for that, so we will be satisfied with thesefew sentences.In the period of the Mongol victory, Batenism lost its brightness and splendourbecause the Batenis had fought with the Mongols and the Mongols were not“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”170"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"content to leave them alone. But Sufism and Kharabatism, more than before, foundmore room to maneuver because the Mongols were not opposed to the existenceof different religious denominations. One can suppose that because the Mongolsdid not see their benefit in [such] opposition, they considered the circulation ofthese evil teachings as a basis of their own strength – whatever the case, in theMongol period, both Sufism and Kharabatismincreased and flourished and bothadvanced very much.The Sufis adopted a really unpleasant method, which was to seek benefit fromevents through lies. For example, if some brave general became a king, they madeup a lie and said that when that person had come to see our Shaykh, our Shaykhsaid, “We bestowed kingship on this person,” or if someone died or was injuredthey said, “Since he had caused our Shaykh to suffer, God has punished him.”This was a method of theirs. The truth is that they ate the bread from others, forthey frightened the people with these lies, and they made them give them abundantsupplies of food.This is one [example] of unchivalrous behaviour that all parasites and beggarsshare. I have not forgotten that one of my acquaintances, in years gone by, had ayoung son who suddenly passed away, and a Seyyed of his neighbourhood insteadof coming to see and comfort him and lessen his grief, unchivalrously sent amessage. “Since you have not looked after the Seyyeds, look what happens!” Onmany occasions my acquaintance told me this with a heart full of pain, showinghis misery.From this kind of behaviour of the Sufis you can discover their inner [charac-ter] and find out what evil consequence those unfounded teachings have had andhow they have blackened their hearts.Yes, in the Mongol period too, even though the Sufis knew that their path andmethod was the cause of the peoples’ misfortune, and they lamented silently dueto the heart-wrenching fate of the masses, they resorted to profit seeking, andwhen Soltan Mohammad Khwarazmshah killed Majd al-Din, one of theirshaykhs, they turned it into a story and said: “God sent the Mongols in revengefor the blood of Majd al-Din Baghdadi.” They raised this cry and cooled the peo-ples’ hearts [from anger towards the Mongols]. [This was] a misfortune for thepeople, and [the Sufis] invented such a lie to further their own cause. WhenKhwarazmshah killed Majd al-Din he felt sorry, and in order to beg forgivenesshe went to his master (ostad), Abu Bakr Khwarazmi, and took with him muchgold. Abu Bakr did not accept it and said: “There is no gold that can cover theblood-price of my son Majd al-Din. You too will lose your head for his blood-price, and my head and others’ too.” [In addition], they invented a miracle forShaykh ‘Attar who, weak and infirm, was killed in Nishapur, and they said:“When the Mongols killed the Shaykh, that headless body ran for 9000 feet, andthen fell down.”With these shameful lies [the Sufis] advanced their interests. It promoted boththe Mongol victory and Sufism. Because of the loss and injury which the Iranianshad suffered, they fell into enemy hands. So either they should have sacrificed“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”171"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"themselves and defeated [the Mongols] with bravery worthy of the enemy or elsethey should have taken themselves, eyes covered from the manly zeal to theretreats of Sufism or Kharabatism.How the KharabatisappearedThe entry of the Mongols into Iran had made the Kharabatiaim easy [to achieve].Because, until that time, making and selling wine was specific to the Zoroastrians,Jews and Christians. But they did not do this in the city, they chose somewhereoutside the city, in ruins where they both sold wine and played the lute and tam-bourine, and if a Kharabatiwanted (in their words, to wet the lips and listen to thelute and tambourine), he would have to go outside of the city. Anyway, he wasafraid of the Muslims, and if someone made [wine] in his own house sometimeshe would be caught by the Mohtasebwho would smash the wine jar, and sometimeshis head, and often there were other problems. But when the Mongols came toIran, they gave freedom to all religious denominations and to all acts, and thosepunishments were abolished, selling wine was allowed, taverns were opened in thecity and the loud sound of the lute, tambourine and flute was heard. TheZoroastrians, Jews and Christians who had spent many long years in harm andsuffering from the Muslims supported the Mongols who viewed the Muslims withcontempt. They were rude [to the Muslims] and started to criticise and belittle[them]. In fact, they no longer had any fear in insulting and criticising theMuslims. For it was very good that the out-spoken, fearless Kharabatisgathered intheir taverns and got drunk and listened to useless things which included criti-cisms for the creator and his creation, and they insulted the Muslims and emptiedtheir heart of spite. It was this that enabled them to increase the amount of pleasurefor the Kharabativagrants (rendan).Because of this, it was advantageous to the Mongols that the oppressed andafflicted Iranians busied themselves with wine, the lute and the tambourine, andforgot that oppression and affliction, and did not think of seeking revenge, in par-ticular, that wine-drinking and love was twinned with the zeal-numbing, evilteachings (such as the evil teachings of the Kharabatis), [it was like the situationwhen] blood pours from a wound and zeal and manliness become weak.It was very advantageous to the Mongols that one group advised the peopleand said, “Forget the past and don’t think about the future, and try to be happy.”They said, “Whatever comes into a man’s head is from God.” They added,“There is no profit in endeavour and effort.” This was the best assistance for theMongols who had gathered more than a million soldiers. The Mongols (who hadshed so much blood in Iran and had taken all those girls captive and thenconquered the country and placed the yoke of obedience around the necks of theunfortunate people) wanted Iranians to forget the past, not to recall the blood-shed, not to mention those girls, not to think of the future, not to wish for freedomand not to interfere in anything but entrust even trifling things to the Mongols,and they would spend their time in the tavern in pleasure. [The Mongols] wanted“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”172"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Iranians to see all events as coming from God, and the afflictions that they hadsuffered as part of their fate, and they wanted them to forget about taking revengeon Chingiz and Hulagu.How pleasant it was for the Mongols when they heard that there was anIranian poet who said:Know the enmity between the enemy and friend is from GodBecause he controls the hearts of them both.How pleasant it was when they heard one wise man, commenting on the killingof the people, say:Blood, impurity, and a handful of veins and skin,You would not think what an affliction it is.How pleasant when they heard this madness, namely, the Sufis who said, “Godsent Chingiz Khan in recompense for the blood of Shaykh Majd al-DinBaghdadi,” or when they heard that those mad people are “‘arefs” and have theeyes to see a king, for they recognise the king in any clothing. Therefore they con-sidered the murdering Mongols “God,” and when one of their pirssaw a Mongolhis melancholy disappeared, and he said: “Did you come here in these clothesthinking that I would not recognise you?”Whether Sufis,Kharabatis, poets,‘arefs, whatever they said was to theiradvantage. I do not know whether the Mongols understood this, and due to theirunderstanding and insight they gave ground to the Sufis and Kharabatis, andbecause of this they increased their rudeness and bravery, or whether becausethey had no partisanship, more opportunities fell to the Sufis and the Kharabatis.Whatever the truth, the heart-wrenching story is amazing because when theforeigners came to the country, and caused it ruin and suffering, the skillful andbrave people should have stood up and driven away the despair from the peopleand incited their bravery. But at that very same time the Sufis and Kharabatisfounda great opportunity for themselves and made efforts in the manner we havedescribed.So, the shaykh in the khanaqahgathered around himself parasitical and pitilessdervishes, and with those dirty beards and those tatty dervish cloaks, theystamped their feet and clapped their hands, and with a hundred arrogant criesthey recited:This ecstasy of our sama‘ is not metaphorical,This dance that we perform is not a game.Say to those unaware: “Oh, unaware one!Don’t talk so long about stupid things”“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”173"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"So the vagrant of the taverns (rend-e kharabat) got up and started a brawl, shouting:Saqi! Our cup has been lit up by the light of wine.Minstrel! Say that the affairs of the world are at our desire.We have seen the reflection of the friend’s cheek in the cup.Oh unaware one! We always have the pleasure of drinking.In this way they spent their time without any vexation, and they poured outtheir evil, poisonous teachings. It is amazing that they did not get on together butwere embroiled in a series of conflicts, which we want to describe here.The conflict between the Sufis and theKharabatisThis conflict between the Sufis and the Kharabatisis one of the episodes mostworthy to be told, and since it has not been written anywhere, we will present itthrough the poetry of the Kharabatis. Since a large portion of Hafez’s poetry is onthis topic, we will present it here.One should know that because of all their impurities, the Sufis made pretencesto abstinence and purity, and so from the perspective of Islamic belief, theyconsidered wine, the lute and the tambourine haram. They had no alternative butto oppose the Kharabatisand were unrelenting in their criticism of them. As aresult the Kharabatisopposed the Sufis, and in the Mongol period a group gath-ered and flourished, and did not desist from evil-speaking and verbosity with theSufis, and they composed poetry criticising them:Say to the two-faced, kherqeh-clad, hypocritical asceticThat the arm pretending to abstinence is long, and the sleeve is short.You wear the kherqeh to gain the favour of the people,You lead the servants of God away from the path through hypocrisy.37The Sufis criticised them, and in reply [the Kharabatis] too resorted to [thedoctrine of ] fatalism and said “God created us as Kharabatis. What can we do?”Oh pure Sufi, don’t obstruct me from wine, because the All-WiseIn pre-eternity purified our clay with wine.I didn’t come to the tavern from the mosque of my own [volition]From the day of pre-eternity this was already pre-determined.38Or they sat and asked themselves, “Why are their acts better than ours?”I fear that there will be no advantage on Judgement day.The halal bread of the shaykh is earned through our haram “water” (ab-e haram).39“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”174"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"The ascetic has the sherbet of Kawsar, and the ‘aref has the begging cup.What is the will of the creator between them?40They said, “This un-hypocritical wine-drinking of ours is better than the ascetichypocrisy of the Sufis.”Drink wine because there is no hypocrisy in itIt is better than selling asceticism in which appears the face of hypocrisy.41They said, “Even the Sufis drink, but [they do it] in private.”Smash the jar! The Sufi does not know its worth.The home-made stuff is just like a crimson ruby [wine].42If you read the poetry of Hafez and other Kharabatis[you will see] it is full of crit-icisms of Sufism. One must say that the Sufis have been punished for their shame-less acts by those more shameful, [and this controversy reached the extent] that itbecame an open conflict because the Kharabatisdid something astonishing. The firstthing was only a joke and something ridiculous, but gradually it became serious, andI will describe it because this episode is so astounding.The Kharabatisreplied to the Sufis in the conflict that existed between them.They wanted to be a step ahead of the Sufis and so they established the kharabator tavern (which was the place for the sons of the Magians who collected the cups,the intoxicated, gamblers, the lute and tambourine players) as the equivalent ofthe [Sufi] khanaqah. They said, “Here too is a place for traversing the stations (tay-ye maqamat).” And they turned to the Sufis and said, “Who are you that [youconsider] us as worthless? What do you have there [in the khanaqah] that we don’thave here [in the kharabat]?”The Sufis said, “We have gathered here seeking God.” The Kharabatisreplied,“Is God only found in the khanaqah? May one not seek him in the tavern? We tooseek him in the tavern.”Ascetic come straight to the Kharabat. Don’t be afraid!Fear in this path is danger. Don’t be afraid!He who fears him does not come to us.Hidden from you, he is in our tavern. Don’t be afraid.In theKharabat of the Moghan I see the light of God,More amazing is that I see such a light in such a place?43Each person seeks the friend, whether sober or drunkEverywhere is the house of love, whether mosque or synagogue.44Just as the Sufis spoke of “love for God” so too did the Kharabatiswho said, “Wedrink wine in the name of that very love.”“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”175"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"We have seen the reflection of the friend’s cheek in the cupOh uninformed one! We always have the pleasure of drinking.Just as the Sufis were shameless on the topic of that very love and called their sha-hed-bazis“love for God”, [the Kharabatis] did not lag behind the Sufis in thatshamefulness:Friends! Don’t criticise Hafez for looking at beauty(nazar bazi)For I consider him one of the lovers of God.45They said, “We know what the Sufis know, but we should not reveal it”:It is not expedient that the secret should be divulged from behind the curtain,But in the gathering of the vagrants,(majles-e rendan)there is no news that is not[spoken].46Ask the secret within the curtain from the intoxicated vagrantsFor this is not the state of the ascetic of lofty stations.47The Sufis had a pirfor each khanaqah. [The Kharabatis] called them derisively, “theMagian, wine-selling pir” with that wine-stained, dirty beard, and they have alsocalled them “our pir.” They said, “This [pir] knows a number of secrets aboutGod and he teaches us”:What difference is there if our guide was the pir of the MagiansThere is not one soul for whom there is not an intimate secret about God.48So they fabricated advice from the words of that very wine-selling pir(the onewhose beard they would touch and at whom they would laugh each day, the oneupon whose head and shoulders they would jump in an intoxicated state). Andthey propagated this advice:The first words of the wine-selling pir is this:Abstain from the companionship of the impure.49The Sufis said: “We try to kill the ‘ego’ in ourselves, and we die to ourselves in orderto reach God.” They [the Kharabatis] have said: “The way to this is drinking wine. Youhave suffered for years to get rid of your ‘ego’. But since we drown the cup in one go,all at once we have become unconscious of the ego and have become selfless.”In the ocean of we-ness and I-ness, I have fallen for thefriend.[Drink]wine and be free in the happiness of we-ness and I-ness.50When from the goblet of selflessness you drink a cup of wineDon’t boast of “I-ness” through[your]selflessness.51“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”176"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The Sufis claimed that even though they were poor and hungry, they bestowedcrowns upon kings and that they could make a king of whomever they wished, orthey could take away his power to rule. The Kharabatistoo have attributed thisclaim in flattery to themselves: “These uncouth beggars who gather in the tav-erns, each one (even if he makes a king out of a beggar, sells and drinks wine), hasan eminent place before God, and they bestow crowns upon kings.”With the beggars in the tavern, the wayfarer of the pathIs courteous if he is aware of the secret of God.At the entrance of the tavern are the vagrant Qalandar (rendan-e Qalandar)Who give and take the crown of kingship.52Earth beneath the head and foot on the tip of Pleiades.Look at the hand of power, and the office of the possessor of rank.53Since the men were idle and had no shame, they spent their time in thisflattery/ridicule and silliness, and sometimes, too, they played a game: one ofthem who had been a Sufi, and who after years in the khanaqah, had not reacheda “station” after [his] suffering and asceticism, and he thought that he would goto the Kharabat, and here “traverse the stations” (tay-ye maqamat). For this reason hecame to the entrance of the Kharabatand knocked on the door, but the Kharabatiswould not open the door for him, or they would say, “Your cloak is unclean, goand wash it and come back.”Clean[your cloak]and then[return]to the hospitableKharabatBecause this Magian monastry will not be polluted by you!They had many of these kinds of games and jokes, and more surprising than allof this is that this shows the compatibility of the Kharabatiswith the Sufis, for justas we have said, first it was a joke and a game, and gradually it took a differentturn when most of the Sufis themselves too engaged in it.This has been another task for the Sufis, each one of them boasted aboutvagrancy (rendi) (which was contrary to Sufism) and [each one of them] used thenameKharabatand spoke about drinking wine. This became another “station”that each Sufi had to traverse. Most of the Sufis who came after Hafez adoptedand repeated his speeches (which were contrary to them). Hatef Isfahani54and‘Esmat Bokhari55and others have spoken about the gift of sharing good judge-ment of speech (sokhan-i sanji). From this perspective one can understand theextent of their understanding and wisdom.The inappropriate explanations that they offerJust as we said, one of the topics from which Hafez sought benefit in his writingswas this conflict between Sufism and Kharabatism, and many of his poems are on“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”177"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"this topic. This conflict arose at the beginning of the Mongol period, and itwas something worthy of attention for idle poets and Kharabatifoolish talk,for without a doubt, they have composed many poems on this topic (some of themare included in the biographies, but since I did not have any at hand, I couldnot see them). So Hafez followed this topic most, and he has given it a [certain]colour.Just as we said, this conflict at first was [no more than a] ridicule and a joke,and in Hafez’s poems a joking tone is clear:What difference is there if our guide was the pir of the Magians?There is not one soul for whom there is not an intimate secret about God.56The guide, according to the Sufis, was a man who was wise, aware and had under-gone ascetic practices, and he had a large base. This was in contrast to the ignorant,wine-selling Magian pirwhose job was among the most despicable. [Hafez] describes[this] and says “there is no difference. There is not one person for whom there areno secrets about God,” and it is clear that this can be nothing but a joke.The people who are unaware of this topic of the conflict between Sufism andKharabatism, and of the surprising episode that we have explained, have not under-stood the meaning of these lines in Hafez’s poetry, and they say things such as:“Hafez battled with hypocritical Sufis and ascetics,” and they considered this asone of Hafez’s skills. But one must say that this is a mistake.I heard a story in my childhood which I must write here. Before theConstitutional period in Iran, pass-words (nam-e shab) were common. One night agroup of singers and musicians were going to a wedding, and at the end of theevening when they were returning home, they didn’t have the pass-word, and theyhad forgotten that they needed to know the pass-word to proceed. And so, whenthey reached the place where the sentinel cried from the distance “Who iscoming?...Pass-word?” their leader thought of a plan and said to the musicians:“Play [your instruments] and sing at the same time ‘Ardabil is the place of delight andjoy,’ ” which was a song that they used to sing in those days in Tabriz. The pur-pose of the leader was to please the sentinel and to go past without [giving] thepass-word. But the pass-word was indeed “Ardabil.” Therefore the sentinelbelieved that they knew the pass-word, and they had just given it in this manner.For this reason he shouted harshly: “The person who gives the pass-word shouldnot play the tambourine. Say ‘Ardabil’.”Now, one should say the very same thing to Hafez: “Mr Hafez! You should notbe hypocritical in making speeches. There is no call for all this nonsense, all thismeaningless praise of wine, all these words about sodomy, all this noise aboutfatalism or all of these lessons about intoxication and apathy.”Indeed, Hafez criticised the hypocritical Sufis, but he himself called the peopleto fatalism, inviting them to intoxication and vagrancy (rendi). He invited them tosodomy and dishonour, all of which were worse than following the hypocriticalSufis. Stupid Hafez is rude to God in several places, which is the worst of sins.“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”178"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"A really horrible habit has become apparent among the Iranians, namely thatwhen someone is praised or criticised, they deceive themselves about that person.We have experienced this in the episode concerning Ferdowsi, when in 1934 acongress in his name opened in Tehran and a great tumult about him arose. Oneperson made Ferdowsi a general, saying that he had been aware of the prevailingmilitary sciences and that he made a war plan in the episode of the war of the“seven places between Iran and Turan” (haft khwan) in the Shah nameh. Anothermade a speech in which he turned Ferdowsi into a medical doctor. Another per-son claimed he was a master of pedagogics and wrote about “teaching andinstruction from the perspective of Ferdowsi.” Another called the Shah namehthe“Persian Qur’an” and said, “One can discover everything in it.” These people arenot those who make up lies, but they have deceived themselves because of thespirit’s weakness. This is an illness that has been found among these masses.In criticism too, [we find] it is the very same thing. Whoever thinks [someone]is evil attributes all kinds of evils to that person. Several years ago when theyarrested Asghar Borujerdi, people went to see him, and when they returned theysaid, “It is clear from his eyes that he is a sinner (jani). When I saw him I realisedthat he was guilty and that he had committed these crimes.” They wrote the samething too in the newspapers, whereas it was only a month previously that thecrime was known and the police were hunting the guilty person. So, AsgharBorujerdi wandered around Maydan-e Sepeh each day, and the police weresearching for the criminal, and I don’t know why these people who recognisecriminals didn’t recognise him then?! Asghar’s eyes were just like the eyes of othersfrom Borujerd, and there is no special meaning that can be derived from them.This is an example of the helplessness of these masses. They cannot discovertruths because the spirit and wisdom have become so weak, and because of thisthey are deceived and deceive themselves. All of that praise that they heap onHafez! And when I got a copy of his book, I read it and saw that most of hispoetry was completely meaningless.For example, derive a meaning from this poem below:Yesterday I saw the angels knocking on the door of the tavernThey kneaded the clay of Adam and moulded [it] to a cup.57What does the poet want to say? There is one meaning, that the Kharabatipoetshave repeated many times, that at the time that they shaped the clay and wantedto mould Adam’s body, they poured a little wine too on to it, and for this reasonthat love of wine remains in our heart, the children of Adam. Hafez too wants tosay this. But he has turned the meaning upside-down and says: “They mixedthe clay of Adam and moulded that too to the goblet (paymaneh)” – which is thevessel of wine, not the wine itself. It is a poem without meaning, but ask theHafez-worshippers and see what meaning they give to this.I have explained the story of the “pir may forush.” Just like the Sufis, each group[ofKharabatis] had a pir, and in ridicule and jest they made the tavern the same“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”179"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"kind of place as the [Sufi] khanaqah. And the [Kharabatis] said: “We too have a pirhere,” and they pushed the Magian may forushforward and called him their pir, andseveral times each day they would laugh at his beard and jump on his shoulders.But [now] people come and say that his [i.e. Hafez’s] meaning ofpir may forushisthe Commander of the Faithful, since they recognised him as their guide (morshid).Not one of them asks: Oh witless one! ‘Ali is one thing and the name of the pirmay forushis another. If it is true that Hafez called Imam ‘Ali Ibn Abi Taleb the pirmay forushthen this sin of his is sufficient.The poet himself made his meaning clear. He says, there is nothing wrong ifwe take the pir moghanas a guide. Why, because he too has some secrets of God inhis head. Just as we said, these arguments were in ridicule, but in any case you seethat the poet apologised that they had taken a pir may forushas a guide. If theintention was ‘Ali, then oh ignoramous, what was the point of this apology?Many times we have seen people, cheeks full of wind, reciting these poems ofHafez:We see the light of God in the tavern of the Moghan,More amazing is that I see such a light in such a place.58They recite this and take pleasure, and they pretend that Hafez made it under-stood in an ‘erfanimeaning in this context. And he understood and took pleasurein it. One day I asked someone: “What is the meaning of this poem?” He said:“Why? Isn’t the meaning of this poem obvious?” I said: “No, its not obvious. Thetavern of the Moghan, a place for wine, is very dirty and base, a Magian pir, witha beard and cloak stained with wine, selling wine, and deceitful and debauch chil-dren give goblets of wine to this and that person, a group of louts and mercilessindividuals have gathered there, and in his own words Hafez pawned [his] cloakand book and drank wine, and when they became intoxicated they composed use-less verse, they cursed each other and they jumped around in an amusing fashion.This was the tavern of the Moghan in which the poet of Shiraz saw the light ofGod in that world of intoxication. This is the meaning of that poem.” He said:“No sir! It has another mystical meaning.” I said: “Tell me.” He was stuck andremained silent. It is not only this poem, and it is not only the poetry of Hafez.In everything it is in the same way that when you ask they cannot give you ananswer. For an experiment, ask what the meaning is of Hafez’s conjecturing andall of his images?! Ask and you will see why they are stuck [for an answer].Hafez’s stupidities reach the extent that he says:Don’t look with contempt at this benefactor of the wretched and weak,Because the wayside beggar has the highest place by the throne of glory.59Ponder well upon the second hemistich of this poem. What does it mean? Whois the wayside beggar? They are those dirty, shameful individuals who you seeevery day in the street leaning against the wall.60This one is naked, another has“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”180"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"wounded his fore-arm or shin with a brand (dagh), and another has placed in frontof himself a child, half-clothed, with a trembling body and tearful eyes. A groupof effortless, bad-habited individuals who have not sought employment havearoused the sympathy of peoples’ hearts despite these bad habits, and they take afew pennies from them. Hafez, the speaker of nonsense, praises them and says,“Because the wayside beggar has the highest place by the throne of glory.” Thisis the extent of the stupidity of the philosopher of Shiraz. Now, if you questionthe supporters of Hafez, you will see that they have not paid attention to themeaning of this poem even though they might have read it a hundred times.Those with blind hearts have read it with great pleasure only because it is a poemof Hafez, but they have not understood the meaning.A list of Hafez’s evil teachingsJust as we said Hafez’s main purpose was composing ghazalsand constructingrhymes, it was not making arguments and making [his] meaning understood. It isthis method that most of the poets adopted, especially in composing ghazals, andtherefore you cannot see a connection in their verses. There is a story about some-one who had a fur over his shoulders in summer time, and he was asked, “Whatis this? Why do your wear a fur in the summer time?” He replied that in the creditstore there was no cloak, and since he had no money he had to purchase some-thing on credit, and the fur was the only thing that the store had. For this reasonhe was content with it.This is the story of the poets. Since it was necessary for them to use such andsuch a word in the rhyme they had no choice but to say whatever fitted the rhyme,in particular, Hafez, who had no special allegiance, said whatever came beforehim. He neither refrained from contradicting himself nor was he afraid of bab-bling; he neither was a follower of religion nor was he bothered with self-esteem.Just as we said, Hafez spoke on several topics, most of which had no relation-ship with the other. For this reason if you read his poems, sometimes he is aKharabati, sometimes a Sufi, sometimes a Muslim, sometimes he is a poet whocomposes flattering verses, sometimes he is a lover. One cannot even understandwhat his short discourses are about. Sometimes, since he finds nothing to say, hesuddenly jumps in and says whatever he wants:The person who turns away from you because of your sword is negligent.Doesn’t the fly truly understand the pleasure [in tasting] sugar?Your alley was flooded with my tears [that were] like an ocean, and I am scared that oncemoreThese worthless rivals will float to the surface, like straw.What is the meaning of this? Why must someone live his life with these stupid,useless arguments?“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”181"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"This is the worst method of the fortune that [can] come from [making]speeches that the poets have used. A speech is a power that is God-given, andit can offer great fortune. It can pour out knowledge and make thousands ofpeople learned, it can explain truths, and it can lead thousands of misguidedpeople on to the [right] path, it can offer advice, it can give counsel, it can incitethe helpless masses and finally it can be the source of money and food. One canget each kind of fortune from making speeches. The worst kind of all of these iswhen someone wants to make a rhyme. He does this by making a list of severalwords, places each one in a poem and constructs a ghazalor a small poem. Thisis nothing more than an irrational game.This is harmful because it sacrifices meaning to words. If Hafez had built bricksin place of this kind of poetry making, he would have found more value beforethe truth, because those bricks would have been of some value, whereas there isno value in these arguments of his. Aside from mixing many evil teachings in hisarguments, he did much harm too.Hafez, the criminal, not stopping with that, wasted his life and spent it incomposing foolish talk; he even included an element of poisonous evil teachingsin his argument. He left them as a keepsake, and they made millions of peopleempty-minded and polluted, just like Hafez himself. The harm in Hafez’s poetry,more than anything else, is in this way, and I will produce a list of those evilteachings here.(1) Nonsensical, limitless praise of wine. For what was all of this praise of wine?I do not say that wine is evil. But this is not the place to discuss [the topic of ] theevil of wine. I ask what is its good? Isn’t all of this praise about wine nothing butfoolish weavings. One derives a little pleasure if a small amount of wine is drunk,but it causes giddiness and delirious ravings when more is drunk, and it causesvomiting and uncleanliness if even more is drunk. Where is the good in such athing? That praise which Hafez and others have heaped upon wine (they havepretended that wine unties knotted secrets and makes known the unfathomable)is nothing but nonsense. Each person has a duty to recognise Hafez as a madbabbler of nonsense just because of his poems:Come saqi! Give me that fire-water of the electSo that I can find freedom from sorrow.Faridun the attribute of Kaveh’s bannerI hold up the jam-e Jam in allegiance.Come saqi! Listen to this [lesson taught] by wine.One draught of wine is better than the crown of a king.One can believe that 90 per cent of the Iranian wine-drinkers have beendeceived by these poems of Hafez and others. I don’t know what the supportersof Hafez say about these ignorant saying of his or what excuses they make.“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”182"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"(2) He made many criticisms of the world. There was a group of individualswho did not seek employment for themselves nor did they put their house or thetools of life into any order, and consequently they remained without any share oflife’s pleasures, and for this reason they spoke out seeking revenge and criticisedthe world.The product of the creator of creatures and the world is nothing more than this.Bring wine because the causes of the world are nothing more than this.61The world and tasks of the world are all nothing.A thousand times I have verified this.62Don’t seek righteousness for the vow has weakened because of the world.This old woman is the bride of a thousand bridegrooms.63If Hafez had profited from wisdom he would have known that he could notlive in this world without a job or profession. He would have known that sittingin tavern corners and composing absurdities, and staring at this king and thatminister, would make a prison of the world for himself, and for this reason he wouldhave adopted a trade or profession, and he would not have needed to criticisethe world.The more [he makes] these criticisms of the world [he shows] he has notunderstood the meaning of the world and life and has offered unconvincingarguments. But these very unconvincing arguments have penetrated into [ peoples’]hearts and it has led [their] thoughts [astray] and weakened their resolution.Today one of the reasons for the lethargy of the Iranians is these arguments.According to them, they do not attribute that worth to the world that theyshould engage in effort and hard labour. They desire this much from the worldthat they acquire food and clothing from whatever path there is and carry onliving.(3) He encouraged people to lethargy, laziness, baseness, indeed to beggingand shamefulness:I am the slave to [that person’s] will, who beneath the blue heavenIs free from all the coloured entrapments.64What would happen to the world if we were poor?Poverty is much better than kingship.Don’t look with contempt at this benefactor of the wretched and weakBecause the wayside beggar has the highest place by the throne of glory.65(4) He repeatedly advocated fatalism:Be satisfied with what is given and don’t frownBecause free choice has not been bestowed upon you or me.“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”183"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Oh wise man, if suffering or comfort come,Don’t be attached to anything else because God does these things [to us].66You may say they forced Hafez to teach people fatalism and he made theseirrational evil teachings stick in [their] hearts, and for this you find very fewghazalsof his that do not have these evil teachings. When the poet wants tospeak about fatalism he reveals such animation that you would say that hewants the inheritance of his father from the people. This topic [of fatalism] isanother example of the ignorance and non-comprehension of Hafez andothers like him. A man with a blind heart saw with his eyes that each personwho is busy in work derives some profit [from that work] and lives happily, andeach person who passes his life (just like him), idle and shameless, remains poor,and therefore does not pull himself together but continually says that thereis no free-will for us. You bloodsucker seeking sustenance that has not beenprovided!(5) He criticises reason (kherad) which is the most precious gift from God,considering it worthless:I made an analogy and gave advice that in the path of love,Reason is like a dewdrop that leaves a trace upon the ocean.67Don’t scare us with the prohibition of reason. Bring wine!That watchman has no work in our lands.68According to Hafez one of the benefits of wine was that it gave humans sometime away from the whisperings of reason.If there is nothing for you from wine, it is enough that youRemain unaware of the whisperings of reason.69Hafez supposes that there is no truth in the world and no profit is derived fromreason, and he adopts one path for a life unlived:Forgive the conflict of the seventy-two nationsThey did not see the reality of the path, and so they invented fables.70According to Hafez, these various sects (which are the consequence of reasonnot being used) are the result of the non-existence of any reality.(6) He criticises God:Our shaykh said: “There was no error in [God’s] pen.”Blessed be his pure sight, error concealing.71“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”184"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Hafez sits in an abject state in a corner of a tavern and criticises God. [Yet hepraises] Shah Yahya72who is considered among the most cowardly commandersof Iran during the Mozaffar dynasty,73and all of these rulers were blood thirsty,cowardly and breakers of [their] promises and truces. The father blinded the son,the son killed the father, and brother waged war against the brother. But ShahYahya was the worst and most cowardly among them all, and it could be said thathe was the origin of that dynasty’s decline more than all of these [others]. YetHafez praises such an unworthy commander and says:It is necessary and proper to honour your soul and wisdom,Your favours upon the creatures and places [are] abundant and perfect.74But with regard to the great creator he is arrogant and makes criticisms. Theysay, “Hafez was a philosopher, the philosophers reveal the imperfections ofcreation.” We say, “The philosopher shows his own faults, because he praisesthe ‘duty’ of one Shah Yahya for a few dinars,” and he says:On the day of Azal, a black drop from your penFell onto the moon’s face, which became the solution to all problems.75When the sun saw that black mole it said to the heart“I wish I were that fortunate servant.”76A philosopher would not show such ignorance.These are the deficiencies in Hafez’sdivan, not taking into account that heboasted shamelessly of playing with young men and not taking into account thathe composed the most eloquent poetry about Sufism,Kharabatismand other vainthoughts and caused them to take root in [ peoples’] hearts.Why is Hafez praised so much?I know that people will say that if Hafez’s poetry is so absurd and damaging thenwhy have so many people praised him and continue to praise him? Why do theEuropeans value him so much?We reply: Why do you bother with what others value and praise. Judge withyour own understanding and reason. God bestowed you with understanding andreason so that you could distinguish between good and evil. Others may say what-ever they say. But if you are seeking after truths, you must consider and under-stand for yourselves. Hafez’s poetry is either completely meaningless or else itcontains injurious meanings. In the thousand or so ghazalsthat Hafez composed,perhaps you will not find [more than] ten verses that possess a wise meaning.I repeat: Hafez was concerned with nothing but making rhymes.“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”185"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"So that it is well-understood that this poet composed nonsense I shall considerand discuss the verses of one of his ghazals. He says:We are shipwrecked. Rise up and blow o favourable wind!Perhaps then I shall see once more the friend.77Here the poet’s ship is ruined (or he is sitting in a ship) and he wishes for afavourable wind. But then suddenly he turns [to another point] and says:Yesterday the nightingale sang sweetly in a party of roses and wine“Bring the morning wine! Wake up you intoxicated ones!”78Yesterday in a party where roses and wine were present, the nightingale hadalso come, and it sings in Arabic, saying: “Bring the morning’s wine! Wake up,even you, intoxicated ones!” That same nightingale was also intoxicated for itcould not distinguish the night from the dawn and sought the evening’s wine forbreakfast.“I recite poetry and seek the meaning from God.” Then, following this, heturns and says:O maker of miracles(karamat)! In gratitude for safety!One day seek out the begging dervish.79The ship is forgotten, the party of roses and wine is forgotten, and he sends amessage to the possessor of miracles (whose identity is unknown) that one day heshould seek out the dervish and the helpless. Following that he turns [to anothertopic] and says:The comfort of the worlds is in the explanation of these two phrases:Be generous with friends and be civil with enemies.80Here, Mr Poet offers counsel and says, “In order to secure tranquility in theworlds it is sufficient that you be gentlemanly with friends and that you helpenemies.

When this helpless poet saw nothing, all of a sudden hebegan to speak nonsense.Don’t be arrogant, for you, like a candle, with jealousy will burnThe sweetheart in whose hand the hard stone becomes wax.83This verse is such nonsense, and I don’t know what meaning to make of it orwhat to write. “Don’t be arrogant, because if you are, because of your jealousyyou will burn like a candle the sweetheart in whose hand the hard stone becomeswax.” Consider whether or not you can yield a meaning from this!The truth is that Hafez did not intend any meaning from these [verses]. Rather,he wrote the rhyme:ashnara,shekara,binavara,madara,qazara,dara,kharaand otherslike these, and he wanted to place each one of them in a couplet, and this is all.From these few verses which we have copied here there is only one meaning,only one meaning can be understood, and that is what Hafez says: These evilsthat I perpetrate and the bad reputation I have acquired are not my volition(ekhtiyari nist): “They did not allow me into the alley of good-reputation.” Considerhow mistaken and harmful this statement is. Consider that if all the evil-doers inthe world offered this as an excuse: for example, Asghar Borujerdi (who killed chil-dren and drank their blood), Sayf al-Qalam Shirazi (who poisoned and killedwomen), Samad Khan Maraghehi, Chingiz Khan, Timurlang, if each oneoffered this as an excuse, what state would the world be in?

He would never have said, “If you don’t like it youhave to change fate.” These are examples of the verses of the Philosopher ofShiraz.

Look at thenonsense of the poet from this perspective: his tooth suffers a hundred thousandwounds from digging a bone. How can one tooth suffer a hundred thousand wounds?So, who are the people that praise Hafez? One group of them are the biogra-phers who have spoken nonsense, just like Hafez, and have considered that kindof poetry (the sole aim of which is composing rhyme) as an art. Their praise ofHafez is just like when gamblers sit down and praise a skillful and clever gambler.These poets were a group who derived pleasure from freeing themselves fromlife’s duties and the efforts that one needs to make. They sat themselves down,composed speeches, wove rhymes and cursed anyone they pleased. They praisedwhomever they wanted, and they spoke about wine and sodomy, sometimes theyoffered philosophical advice, and sometimes just like the vagrants (rendan) theytaught their evil teachings. They did not need anything and they vaunted [them-selves] on the heavens, and there they engaged in supplication and begging. Theysaid whatever they wanted. They did not refrain from being rude and impolite toGod, and they spent their time with this speech-making and satisfying desires, andthey ate the bread derived from the hard work of others, and in spite of all of thisthey are eminent and high-ranking people, and they have been called “poets,”“men of letters” and “philosophers.”This praise that they have steeped on Hafez and Sa‘di, more than anything, hasbeen to advance their own interests, and more noteworthy of attention are thephrases that they have used: “King of the realms of speech, commentator on thebazaar of literature.” What are the realms of speech? And what is the meaningof the bazaar of literature?Another group is composed of European orientalists. These are people who wishill for the East, and they want all Easterners to be just like Hafez, that is, to be sat-isfied with a corner in the tavern and spend time in drinking wine and sodomy. Theyopen the world and its wealth to the greedy ones of Europe and America. Theywant Easterners to be followers of Hafez and Khayyam and to consider effort andendeavour as futile. They want Easterners, at the command of the tavern-dwellers,to consider the world as nothing and empty and to value the present momentinstead of considering the past and future. They want to make machines for them-selves all the time, and to make soldiers, pilots and paratroopers from the ranks ofthe youth, but the Easterners like Hafez, Khayyam and Sa‘di do nothing but engagein making speeches and composing rhyme. The men and women [of the West] joinhands if an enemy appears before them, and they shake the world from East toWest. But the Easterners cling to the skirts of forbearance and say something like:Patience and success, both are old friends.Victory’s moment arrives through patience.84“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”188"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Or they hang the sin around God’s neck and say something like:If suffering or comfort come your way, O wise one,Don’t distinguish between them, as they come from God.85It is not only Hafez and his Divan. These orientalists praise whatever can causebackwardness (ranging from the divansof Hafez, Khayyam, Sa‘di, Mawlavi,Sufism,Kharabatism, other different denominations, snake worship, cow worship,Yogism, Rawzah-Khwaneh and others like these). And they attempt to popularisethese because they serve in the place of several million European soldiers. ThatDivanof Hafez alone serves as one million of their soldiers.This method of theirs resembles the story of those fishermen who did not wantto trouble themselves by catching the fish, one by one. They wanted to do some-thing so that they could get the fish by the hundreds or thousands in one go. Forthis reason they poured poison into the water, which the fish drank, makingthem stupefied, and so the fishermen reeled the fish in and piled them on top ofeach other.Why not make the masses [of the East] sick and backward with evil teachingsand to make millions and hundreds of millions wretched and under the control[of the West] when it is possible to do so?We have come to the people who among the Iranians of today have tied theweight of Hafez, Sa‘di and other poets around their necks, and they continuallyprint their books, compose commentaries and offer praise. There are two groupsamong them:The first group is those who co-operate with the orientalists and they knowinglystrive to ruin the people.Why do they do this? Is there someone who also strives to ruin the people? Cansuch individuals be found in the world? The truth is unbelievable! But alas, suchindividuals have been found in the East. Alas, they [try to] do such things. For thesake of eating well, sleeping well, self-gratification, sitting in fashionable cars andreading useless monthly journals, they have become the tools of the foreigners’politics and they submit to such cowardly work.The other group, unknowingly, have been deceived by them. When they see thatthe names of Hafez and Khayyam have been praised in European books (andbecause of this Mr Forughi, Mr Mohammad Qazvini and Dr Ghani and otherslike them print their divansand write commentaries on them), they fall for thesetricks and imagine that in truth Hafez, Sa‘di, Mawlavi, Khayyam and others likethem were great men. In truth, the Europeans regard this as valuable, and there-fore they continue in their attachment to such poetry and offer it unlimited support.A group of them have been busy in writing biographies, and [these people] arepoets themselves, and their capital is nothing but weaving rhymes. Because of thisthey support Hafez, Sa‘di and the others. They are content in the ignorance ofthe ruin of a section in society, but they are discontent when their futile capitaldisappears.“WHAT DOES HAFEZ SAY?”189"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"These are the people who praise Hafez.

[ The best proof is that] they do not listen or pay attention [to our proofs],but instead they show their low and ill-nature in making ugly and unculturedspeeches, and some of them who want to reply [to us] offer such weak and hollowresponses that one feels sorry for their wretchedness and one sees no way out butto remain silent.For example, we enumerate the evil teachings of the poet – from praise forwine, insistence on fatalism, considering the world as worthless, discussions ofsodomy and other [evil teachings] like these, each one is a great sin and is thecause of great harm to the people.

In an attempt to modernise Iran, many politicians and intel-lectuals desired to mould Iran into a dynamic, rational, motivated and forwardthinking nation. Inevitably, the means to achieve this differed; Kasravi desired toeliminate much of the Iranian mystical and literary heritage, whereas other intel-lectuals did not consider this heritage as inherently inimical with the creation ofa modern nation-state. In fact the range of opinions indicates that the debateabout the role of Sufism and mystical literature was indeed a major issue. Theresponses to Sufism ranged from support and sympathy, from, for example, those inthe circle of the Faculty of Theology at the University of Tehran, to suspicionand dislike by secular intellectuals such as Taqi Arani (who assumed that enthusiasmfor mysticism would disappear with the onward march towards socialism) andoutright hostility from Shi‘ite clerics such as Allameh Borqe‘i. One factor thatunites all of these individuals was their desire to see a strong and free Iran (whichmay account for the distaste among some Iranians, including Kasravi and Borqe‘i,for “agents” of imperialist forces, such as E.G. Browne). Although some strove forhigher goals (such as the universalism inherent within the ideal of creating anIslamic or Marxist ummah), for most the desire for an independent Iran begged thequestion of what it actually meant to be Iranian, and part of the debate wascentred on Persian literature. The wide variety of responses to Sufism and Hafezsuggests that to understand Kasravi’s response it is necessary to look at otherfactors, besides the socio-political conditions, such as important features andevents in his personal life. It has not been possible to investigate Kasravi’s personallife in this study, and it is hoped that further research will shed light on this topic.Kasravi’s anti-Sufism, however, does reveal an interesting dimension of intel-lectual thought in Iran during the period before 1945. The attempt to moderniseIran through a “rational” discourse that demystified religion may be regarded asone of the elements in the modernising project that was spearheaded by RezaShah (and in this respect this work supports the view that the modernisation pro-gramme was not driven solely by Reza Shah). The atmosphere of modern Iranhad resulted in the Sufis reforming themselves, typified in the way that the191"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Anjoman-e Okhovvatstructured and organised itself, and one wonders as to theextent to which such Sufi reforms were a response to Kasravi’s polemics.1Certainly the reforms of the Anjoman-e Okhovvatpre-date Kasravi’s writings, sosuch forms of Sufism at best would have supported the modernising tendencies.However, the issue is not so much whether the Iranian Sufis reformed themselvesas a result of Kasravi’s writing but as to whether the Iranian “advisors” in society,and the masses in general, transformed their way of thinking (for this, accordingto Kasravi, was the real and most virulent danger).Kasravi’s demystification of religion was undertaken by his appeal to reason(kherad), yet his works are littered with weak arguments that are not based onscholarly research. One may sympathise with the aim to create a strong Iran, andone may understand that this aim was, in part, a response to the desperatepolitical and economic conditions of the time, but Kasravi’s writings on Sufismand literature were framed not on reason but on prejudice and clearly selectivereadings of mediaeval texts. His criticisms of Sufism might have fared better hadhe concentrated on his apophatic preferences, but even here, had he pursued thisline in a scholarly fashion, he would have reached an impasse: how can acompletely transcendent, infinite God create the finite world? To create involvessome kind of connection with creation, and to permit this in itself is an admissionthat God may commune with his creation, and this leads to the possibility of mys-tical experience. Of course, this is an ancient problem that Aristotle attempted tosolve with his theory of the unmoved mover, and Islamic theologians and philoso-phers elaborated on this issue in various ways. For the Islamic philosophers, thecosmos consisted of a number of celestial intellects, with the transcendent God atthe outermost level. Even Ghazali, despite his rejection of Islamic philosophy,adopted this hierarchy of cosmic intellectual entities in his discussion ofal-muta‘as an intermediary between God and creation. With Kasravi’s rejection of themediaeval cosmology, and the hierarchy of emanations or intellects, God andman are left completely separated. Yet Kasravi was clearly satisfied with this situ-ation, and it enabled him to cut away at the superstitions and irrational beliefs andpractices that he found in modern Iran and in its literature. However, hiscriticisms of Sufi beliefs betray a lack of research and knowledge of the finerdetails of the school of Sufism that espoused vahdat al-vojud. Although he skirtedprofound theological arguments, it is unfortunate that he never attempted to enterinto them in any great detail. It may be the case that Kasravi felt that his reader-ship restricted him from delving into more serious theological debates. However,it may also be true that the absence of reasoned, intellectual discussions was alsodue to a fanatical and paranoid dislike of mysticism.Kasravi’s blinkered views of Sufism and Hafez, ironically, have some merit, forhis critique of those individuals who limited Hafez to a single interpretation werewell-founded. (It is of interest that a response to Kasravi’s work on Hafez waspublished by Ibrahim Monakkah, entitled “The Key of Explanation (or the Keyto Hafez’s Language) – An Answer to Kasravi,”2in which the author’s main pointis that Hafez was a mystic.) However, Kasravi’s refusal to contemplate theCONCLUSION192"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"possibility that a poet (or an intellectual) may change or develop a certain way oflooking at the world, or that a poet may not be as committed to a certain worldview, certainly restricts a comprehensive understanding of Hafez’s work.(Hafezology, in particular in the twentieth century is a fascinating topic thatdeserves much more attention. The range of opinions expressed on Hafez’sghazalshas been quite diverse, typified in the writings of Ahmad Shamlu,‘Ali Dashti and more recently by ‘Ali Khamene‘i.) Kasravi’s perspective on thenecessity of being committed to a single perspective was not unique in his lifetime,but his view on Hafez and Sufi literature too betrays a seriousness and, perhaps,the lack of a sense of humour. Although the kind of Sufi hagiographies thatKasravi cites most likely had some historical basis, their didactic methodsworked through warmth, exaggeration, hyperbole and other literary devices.Kasravi, as a man of reason, wanted facts and nothing else. He could not seehow mystical literature could provide solace, inspiration, joy and laughter, sinceliterature for him should only be produced when there was a pressing need.Since God was remote and intangible, there was absolutely no need for mysticalliterature.Kasravi’s aim of creating a strong and unified Iran on the basis of “pure rea-son” resulted in him shedding a skin that contributed to the sense of identity thatis claimed by many of Iran’s diverse ethnic groups. The Persian works of Rumiand Hafez are enjoyed by Azaris, Arabs, Kurds and other linguistic groups, andKasravi’s rejection of such literature, epitomised in his book-burning rituals, wasironically tantamount to peeling away this Persian connection between thevarious ethnic groups that shared this melting pot of myths. This was understoodby Kasravi’s contemporary in the Ottoman world, as Ziya Gökalp had aimed tounify and galvanise the Turkish nation by employing useful elements of Islam andSufism. Perhaps the main reason that Kasravi was ultimately unsuccessful in hisattempts to purify Iran from the “detrimental effects” of Sufism and Hafez wasdue to the fact that Iran was still a society that was deeply attached to traditionalforms of religious practice, which included elements of Sufi practice and belief.Why else would Shi‘ite clerics such as Khomeini and Tabataba‘i have held sucha strong attachment to ‘erfanand why else would so many leading secularintellectuals (Hedayat and Arani) have written works that were critical of the Sufitradition?Sufism, for its adherents, was and remains in a personal, ineffable andunverifiable realm, and consequently there are an infinite number of under-standings and interpretations. As a result, criticisms of Sufism can be deflected;the veracity of mystical experience cannot be negated because it is unverifiable. Ifit is the practices and some of the beliefs that are criticised, this in itself does notmean that the “reality” of mystical experience of the divine is untrue. Althoughthe kind of questions that Kasravi asked of the mystical tradition and the natureof his criticism may be questioned, his writings are an important contribution anda good example of the changing nature of Iran in the first half of the twentiethcentury. Kasravi was prepared to challenge virtually everything because of hisCONCLUSION193"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"commitment to the primacy of reason. It is through reason that humans canreach the most sacred truths (which he believed were found in Islam).

Under Reza Shah’srule it is widely acknowledged that the second aspect was severely neglected, while thefirst aspect improved with increasing centralisation (settlement and disarming oftribes) and the influence of the state in fields such as education, justice, and religion.135 It is accepted that Reza Shah was hostile to Shi‘ism, and his rule saw the introductionof numerous policies that belittled Shi‘ite influence. These include the establishmentof Tehran University with a faculty of theology (a rival to the Shi‘ite seminaries), theNOTES202"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"unveiling of women, conscription to the armed forces in 1925 (no exemptions forreligious students), reform of the judiciary in 1926 which eroded the power of theclerics’shar‘courts, the law of uniformity on dress and encouraging Western-styleapparel, the supervision by the Ministry of Education of examinations of clerics andthe licensing of teachers in 1928.

By the turn of the nineteenth century theNe‘matollahi order had split in to several sub-orders, each one recognising their ownleader as the Pole. In the first half of the nineteenth century there had been splits,which produced the Kawsariyyeh Ne‘matollahi branch and the Shamsiyyeh branch.The main branch, recognising Mast ‘Ali Shah (d. 1837) as the Pole, split into furthersub-groups in the late nineteenth century.

This per-son, who was not a Sufi but had connections with them and who liked Sufism,claimed that the Sufis could offer a cure for greed and worldly desire with whichKasravi was always fighting. In reply, Kasravi said that he understood Sufism in twoways.The Sufi of which he approved put others ahead of himself and sought benefitfor others before seeking gain for himself. The detrimental kind of Sufi was one whobelieved in vahdat-e vojudand who played music and danced and engaged in sodomy.See Kasravi,She‘r va sha‘eri, (Tehran: ket a b forushi-ye Tahuri, 1335), p. 42.28 Mehr Baba found a large following all over South Asia between 1939 and 1949.

There is a superficial simi-larity between the koanof the Zen master and the shathiyatof the Sufis, in that theyboth appear to be incomprehensible, enigmatic statements beyond the realms ofrational discourse. However, it is more useful to compare the koan with Sufihagiographies since both were used for educational purposes, and students wouldreflect on them in a sober mood. See C.

Kasravi subsequently con-tinued publishing his views through a variety of publications that he edited. SeeJazayery, “Kasravi, Iconoclastic Thinker of Twentieth Century Iran,” p. 6.3 A name which has mystical overtones.Mastbeing the Persian for drunk andintoxicated.4 Likewise, this name has mystical overtones, as the word ‘Asheqmeans the person whois a lover.5Memoirs of the Saintsis a well-known Sufi text that has been rendered into English inan abridged form, see Muslim Saints and Mystics: Episodes from the Tadhkirat al-Auliya’,translated A.J. Arberry (London/New York, Arkana, 1990).6 Kasravi adds in his text “the third of the late Gibb”. It is likely that Kasravi made anerror here in that the Memoirs of the Saintswas edited and translated by R.A. Nicholsonand was the third volume to appear in the Persian Historical Texts series, publishedin London by Luzac in 1905–7, under the title Tadhkiratu ‘l-awliya(Memoirs of theSaints).7 The Masnaviof Mowlana is of course the famous six volumes of didactic Sufi Persianverse composed by Jalal al-Din Rumi. This has been translated into English byR.A. Nicholson,as The Mathnawi of Jalalu’ddin Rumi(London: Gibb Memorial Series,1925–40).8 The chellehis a Sufi practice of remaining in isolation for a period of forty days forprayer and spiritual contemplation.9 Kasravi’s footnote. He does not state where he discusses this topic.10 Kasravi does not state where he expresses these opinions.11 The Persian reads:nangeshan az nam va nameshan az nang, which reflects Hafez’s state-ment “az nang cheh gu’i ke mara nam z-nang ast, vaz nam cheh porsi ke mara nang z-nam ast”.(What do you say about ignomy, for me reputation comes from ignominy; and whatdo you say about reputation, because for me ignomy comes from reputation.) ThePersian text is found in Arberry,Fifty Poems of Hafiz(Richmond, VA: Curzon press,1993), p. 45.12 The Qalandar were a group of antinomian Sufis who had a reputation for shockingbehaviour, including wearing green clothing (sometimes very little clothing at all), whoshaved their heads and eyebrows, and wandered from place to place, having no fixedabode. For the Qalandar see A. Karamustafa,God’s Unruly Friends(Salt Lake City,1994).13 Kasravi is probably referring to the first edition ofSufigari, which does not include thisintroduction. The story of ‘Eraqi appears on pp. 81–2 of this translation.14 The piris another name for the Sufi leader, guide or sheikh.NOTES209"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"15 Kasravi states that these sentences have been taken from the book The Course ofPhilosophy in Europe.

Kasravi associates the kharabatwith the mediaeval Persian poetsKhayyam and Hafez (see Chapter 6).23 Mir Qavam al-Din Mar‘ashi (or Mir Bozorg) was a member of the Sheikhiyya orderof Shi‘ite Sufis and established a Shi‘ite state – known as the Mar‘ashi dynasty innorthern Iran in 1359. It was short lived and was conquered by Timur in 1391.24 Sheikh Jonayd Safavi emerged as leader of the Safavid Sufi order in the second halfof the fifteenth century, and he died in 1460. For the Safavids, see R. Savory,IranUnder the Safavids(Cambridge: University Press, 1980).25 Sheikh Haydar was the son of Shaykh Jonayd who also inherited the leadership of theSafavid movement. He died in 1488.26 Shah Isma‘il, one of Haydar’s sons, established the Safavid state in Iran when he wascoronate in 1501.27 Sana’i (d. 1131) is generally acknowledged as one of the founders of Persian Sufipoetry. For his work see De Bruijn,Of Piety and Poetry(Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1983).28 For the hagiography of Abu Sa‘id see The Secrets of God’s Mystical Oneness, translated byJ. O’Kane (Costa Mesa: Mazda, 1992).29 ‘Attar (d.c. 1220) was the author of numerous mystical poetic works. The most famousin English is Manteq al-Tayr, translated as The Speech of the Birds, by P. Avery(Cambridge: The Islamic Texts Society, 1998). See also Note 5.30 Mowlavi, also known as Jalal al-Din Rumi. See Note 7.31 Owhadi (d. 1337), as far as I know, there have been no English translations of hismystical verse. He was initiated into the mystical tradition by Owhad al-Din Kermani(criticised later in the text by Kasravi). Owhadi is famous in Iran for his masnavientitledJam-e jam, S. Nafisi (ed.),Kolliyyat-e Owhadi-ye Isfahani ma‘ruf ba-Maraghi(Tehran: 1961).32 Jami (1414–92) was another great mystical poet who also composed works in prose,referred to and cited in Kasravi’s text (e.g.Nafahat al-Ons). Jami’s works have not beenrendered adequately into English.33 Shabestari (d.c. 1320) was the author of “The Rose Garden of Mystery” (Golshan-eRaz) which portrayed the perfection of man through the path of gnosis. SeeL. Lewisohn,Beyond Faith and Infidelity(Richmond, VA: Curzon, 1995).34 Shebli (d. 945) is famous for his paradoxical statements and also for the use of imagerythat become commonplace in later Persian poetry. He is also associated with Hallaj.On his execution, the masses threw stones whereas Shebli cast a rose at him. SeeSchimmel,Mystical Dimensions of Islam(Chapel Hill, NC: University of North CarolinaPress, 1975).35 Bayazid Bastami (d. 874) was probably the first Sufi to describe his mystical experi-ence of the divine in a fashion that resembles Mohammad’s own “Night Ascent”through the heavens to God. He is also famous for his ecstatic statement, “Glory beto me, how great is my majesty.” For accounts of the Ascent of Bayazid Bastami,given in two Sufi mediaeval texts, see R.C.

One of these disciples, Safi ‘Ali Shah (d. 1898) established akhanaqahin Tehran, where he had a considerable number of followers who recognisedhim as the “pole” of the Ne‘matollahi order and also claimed he had performedkaramat. He was prodigious in his literary endeavours and has been called “the greatestNi‘matollahi – if not Persian Sufi – poet of the nineteenth century” (see Lewisohn,“An Introduction to the History of Modern Persian Sufism, Part I”, p. 453).75 See Ziba Mir Husseini. “Faith, Ritual and Culture among the Ahl-i haqq”, inP. Kreyenbroek and C. Allison (eds),Kurdish Culture and Identity(London: Zed Press, 1996).76 These lines starting with “Sometimes” all refer to ‘Ali, who in the Islamic tradition isknown as a brave soldier and who was also prepared to lay down his life as a martyrfor Mohammad. This is often understood with reference to the story of his sleepingin Mohammad’s bed in Mecca on the night Mohammad escaped the wrath of theMeccans by leaving for Medina. The Meccans believed that it was Mohammad in thebed, whereas it was ‘Ali, who knowingly took part in this deception to giveMohammad a headstart from his adversaries.77 Shah is one of the names used typically by Shi‘ites for ‘Ali.78 “Glory be to me,” the phrase used by Bayazid and an expression understood asreflecting the “Glory be to him” of the Qur’an 17:1.79 During the battle of Khandaq, ‘Ali is reported to have pulled the door of the city wallsaway from its hinges and then used the door as a shield.80 Mohammad’s night ascent has been discussed from a number of viewpoints byMuslims themselves, in particular, whether or not it was physical or spiritual. For anacademic perspective of the non-believer see the article by J.R. Porter, “Muhammad’sJourney to Heaven,”Numen, XXI (1974), pp. 64–80.81 Shaqiq Balkhi (d. 809) was one of the first Sufis to discuss the mystical statesexperienced by mystics.82 For a similar version of this see O’ Kane,The Secrets of God’s Mystical Oneness, p. 307.83 Jonayd (d. 910) is one of the most celebrated Sufi masters.

See The Times5 January 1911,cited in Bonakdarian, “Selected Correspondence of E.G. Browne and ContemporaryReviews of the Persian Revolution 1905–1909”, in E.G.

Another example expressing this concern is found in the writings ofHosayn Kazemzadeh, who published the newspaper Iranshahrfrom Berlin between1922 and 1927. In an article on “Religion and Nationality” inIranshahr, the authorwrote, “the problem of communalism is so serious that whenever an Iranian travel-ling abroad is asked his nationality, he will give his locality – not the proud name ofhis country”. Cited in E. Abrahmian,Iran Between Two Revolutions, p. 123.As a nationalist, Kasravi was not a great theoretician, and Abrahamian hasremarked that he did not compose a single detailed, analytical work on the topic ofnationalism in which the structures that shape perceptions of the nation, such as polit-ical will and consent, language, culture and origins could have been discussed.Instead, there are comments scattered throughout his oeuvre such as the following,which appears to endorse a nationalism based on self-determination:Nationalism is when twenty million people who live in a single countrymake an agreement among themselves to co-operate and support oneanother in [all] circumstances. If someone from Kerman or fromKhuzestan is injured, then the people from Azarbayjan and Gilan and allthe others should assist him. And if a problem arises in Khorasan, then thepeople of Mazandaran, Gilan and all the others should rush to help.Everyone should see this country as his own house, and they should joinhands and attempt to make it flourish.(Kasravi,Farhang chist, in Panj maqaleh(Cologne Entesharat-e Mehr: 1372/1993), p. 244.Farhang chistin this edition is a pamphlet of forty-one pages and was first published in 1943–4)16 Kasravi,Tarikh-e Mashruteh-ye Iran, pp. 196–7.17 Cited in Iran-nameh, pp. 343–4, originally found in Kasravi’sZendegani-ye man,p.11.18 Kasravi, writing in Payman, (no date or number) in the volume prepared by Marvi (thebook is entitled Payman, (Tehran: 1381/2002–3)) from the first year of publication in1933, p. 415.

The sixth is the Sufis’ “disregard” for reason:Sitting idle in the khanaqah, eating bread derived from the toil of others,begging in the bazaar, not taking a wife and having children, growing abeard, dancing, clapping hands and spinning themselves around have theleast [degree of] compatibility with reason, let alone all the other irrationalstories about them.20 Kasravi appears to be mistaken here. Indeed, there was a publication of ‘Attar’sMemoirs of the Saints(Tazkirat al-awliya) but this book was not edited by Browne but byR.A. Nicholson. It is likely that Kasravi meant Dawlatshah’sTazkirat al-sho‘arawhichwas edited by Browne and published in 1901 under the title ofThe Tadhkiratu ‘sh-Shu‘ará(“Memoirs of the Poets”)of Dawlatshah bin ‘Alá‘u ‘Dawla Bakhtísháh al-Ghází ofSamarqand. This was the first volume of the Persian Historical Texts (the two volumesthat made up ‘Attar’s works formed volumes 3 and 5).21 Arberry suggests that Browne was extremely charitable: “For his liberality knew nobounds, and the number of Orientals alone who, deserving or undeserving, were therecipients of his charity is hard to estimate.”Oriental Essays(London: George Allenand Unwin, 1960), p. 194.22 For Forughi, see Ibrahim Safa’i,Rahbaran-e Mashruteh(dawra-ye dovvom), (Tehran: sec-ond edition, 1363/1984–5), pp. 539–79.23 Professor Isa Sadiq taught with Browne at Cambridge and was the author of severalbooks including Modern Persia and her Educational System(1931),Tarikh-e Farhang-e Iran(Tehran: Daneshgah-e Tehran 1957) and Tarikh-e Farhang-e Urupa(Tehran:Daneshgah-e Tehran 1957).24 Kasravi,Dar Piramun-e Adabiyyat,p.28.25 Ibid., pp. 28–9. It seems that Kasravi himself was included in these literary associa-tions, as Sa‘id Nafisi mentions that Kasravi attended his literary gatherings. Kasravisuddenly broke the association with Nafisi, claiming that he only used to attend thesesessions to borrow Nafisi’s books. Nafisi claims that Kasravi behaved in the same waywith Bahar (see Note 26). See Sa‘id Nafisi,Khataerat-e siyasi, adabi, javani, pp. 186–7.26 For Bahar (1886–1951), see M.B.

John Gurney in private correspondence has questioned from whereKasravi got this information. In the second edition to Browne’sA Year Amongst thePersians, there is a studio photograph of Browne in Persian clothing, but this photo-graph was taken by Palmer Clarke, and it might well be the case that the photographwas taken in England. Browne does mention (in ibid., p. 605) that he wore Persianclothing on one occasion (during the ceremonies of Moharram) in Iran, but asDr Gurney points out, the fact that Browne felt the need to say this indicates that itwas an unusual occurrence. Browne also remarks on the strictness of the Shi‘ites innot permitting non-Muslims to visit the interior of mosques, as opposed to the Sunnis.See ibid., p. 106.33 See Jalal Al-e Ahmad,Gharbzadegi[Weststruckness], translated from the Persian by JohnGreen and Ahmad Alizadeh (Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda, 1997).34 Much of Shari‘ati’s work has been translated into English, and several articles andspeeches appear on http://www.shariati.net.

Palmer,Oriental Mysticism(London: Octagon Press, 1974, first published 1867), p. xi.39 From the late nineteenth century onwards there was greater interest in Iran’s pre-Islamic heritage. This was partly attributable to the success of Henry Rawlinson whodeciphered the cuneiform Old-Persian, making historical research that much moreeasy. Famous scholars who were interested in pre-Islamic Iran included Ibrahim PurDavud (1885–1969), Abu ’l-Qasim ‘Aref (see Sorour Soroudi, “Poet and Revolution:Part II”Iranian Studies, XII, 3–4 (Summer–Autumn 1979), pp. 239–73), Bahar andSadeq Hedayat.40 See the anti-Arab sentiments of the nineteenth-century literary critic Mirza AqaKhan Kermani in Iraj Parsinejad, “Mirza Aga Khan Kermani: An Iranian LiteraryCritic”, pp. 163–7.41 See A.

Abbas Amanat has drawn parallelsbetween Lord Byron and Edward Browne as champions of victimised minorities: inByron’s case it was for the Christian Greeks, and for Browne it was for the Turks, theBabis, the Iranian Constitutionalists and Irish nationalists. Browne’s interest in the BabisNOTES218"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"is intriguing given his own interest in “Pantheistic idealism” and the similarity expressedby some Babis with Sufi doctrine. (See Browne,A Year Amongst the Persianspp. 355–6 andAmanat, “Edward Browne and The Persian Revolution of 1905–1909,” p. xiii).51 Browne states,It was with Sufis like Abu Yazid of Bistam, and al-Junayd (also, according toJami, a Persian) that, in the latter part of the ninth and the beginning of thetenth centuries of our era, the pantheistic element first makes its definiteappearance...in short, with these men, whom the Sufis reckoned amongsttheir greatest teachers, a very thoroughgoing pantheism is superaddedto the quietism of the older mystics...It was certainly the Persian Sufiswho went to the greatest lengths in developing the pantheistic aspect ofSufism...(A Literary History of Persia, I, pp. 427–8)52 E.G. Browne,A Year Amongst the Persians, pp. 16–17. Browne’s understanding of Rumi’sMasnavias pantheistic must be qualified with reference to the general perspective ofthis Persian poet’s literary works, such as his Divan-e Shams, in which there are versesthat portray God as incomparable. See for example no. 900 in Divan-e Shams,B. Foruzanfar (ed.) (Tehran: Daneshgah-e Tehran, 1957–66).53 Pirzadeh was himself a Sufi disciple of Hajji Mirza Safa (d. 1866) who had many fol-lowers in Iran as well as in Ottoman territories. See H. Farman-Farmaian’s EnglishIntroduction to Safar Nama-yi Hajji Muhammad Ali Pirzadeh(Tehran: University ofTehran, 1963), p. 354 See L. Lewisohn, “An introduction to the history of modern Persian Sufism, Part II”,Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 62, 1 (1999), p. 55, n. 148.55 In the Persian introduction to Safar Nameh-ye Hajji Mohammad Ali Pirzadeh, Iraj Afsharhas included some letters written by Browne to Pirzadeh. In these letters, Browneindeed does refer to Pirzadeh as “the pir of the wayfarers of the path”, and “thattreasury of secrets of reality” and “perfect guide” (p. xxxviii), and “guide of the way-farers” and “pole of those who profess unity”, p. xliv. He is also keen to use the adjec-tive “dervish-like” in a positive fashion (pp. xliii–xliv), and he also refers to Pirzadehas being like his own father (p. xliii). Pirzadeh himself describes Browne as having avery keen interest in learning Persian, and studying mysticism, and so the youngEnglishman would visit him every afternoon and evening. However, it seems thatBrowne was not a Muslim or a Sufi because Pirzadeh who gave Browne the nick-name “Manifestation of ‘Ali” remarked that it was to be hoped that through the bless-ing of the name Mazhar-e ‘Ali, he would come to the correct road, the straight pathof the nation of Islam (sirat–e mustaqim-e mellat-e islam) and the Mohammadan religion(din-e Mohammadi), (p. 318). What can be conclusively inferred, however, is Browne’sardent interest in Persian Sufism, and it appears unlikely that Kasravi was aware ofBrowne’s relations with Pirzadeh.56 See Browne’s introduction to A Traveller’s Narrative, (Cambridge University Press,1891), p. X. It is also worth noting Browne’s comments in A Year Amongst the Persianswhen he remarks that chapter 17:8 of the Qur’an (which he translates as “And thoudidst not slay them, but God slew them; and thou didst not shoot when thou distshoot, but God shot”) “serves the Persian Sufis as a foundation-stone for their pan-theistic doctrines” (p. 135).57 In A Year Amongst the Persians, Browne stated that mysticism appears in all lands, as it isthe “eternal cry of the human soul for rest; the insatiable longing of a being whereininfinite ideals are fettered and cramped by a miserable actuality”. He also describes itas “wonderfully uniform” (p. 136). Later on in the same work (p. 445) he remarks, “Ina well-known aphorism...it is said that ‘the ways unto God are as many as the number ofNOTES219"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"souls of the children of men’. Every religion is surely an expression, more or less clear andcomplete, of some aspect of a great central Truth which itself transcends expression.”The relationship between the study of Sufi texts and Christian spirituality has beenalluded to by Hamid Algar when he claimed,Corbin was certainly not alone among modern Orientalists in experiencinga confluence of spiritual and scholarly interests. E.G. Browne, R. A. Nicholson,and A. J. Arberry all seem to have been restored to a belief in AnglicanChristianity by the study of Sufi texts, and Louis Massignon spoke of beinga “spiritualist guest” in the Islamic world.See “The Study of Islam: The Work of Henry Corbin”, Religious Studies Review,1980, pp. 85–91. My thanks are due to Matthijs van den Bos who drew my attentionto this article.58 E.G. Browne,A Year Amongst the Persians, p. 538.59 Ibid., p. 444. Browne makes the point however that the Babis would adapt their con-versation to those with whom they are speaking. He states that with Muslims theywould speak of the coming Mahdi, and with Christians they would speak of thereturn of Christ (probably Browne is referring to the Babi belief that the Babi was theprophet or one who will come, as is foretold in the Gospel of John and in the Qur’hn).See “The Babis of Persia II”, p. 882. This Babi practice bears some resemblance tothe traditional Shi‘ite practice of dissimulation (taqiya).60 Cited in H.M. Balyuzi,Edward Granville Browne and the Baha‘i Faith(London: GeorgeRonald, 1970), p. 49.61 Ibid., p. 61.62 Browne in his introduction to Kitab-i Nuqtatu’l Kaf(Leiden: Brill, 1910), cited in Balyuzi,p. 88.63 For a period the young Browne had been influenced by his uncle who demonstratedsome traits of Christian puritanical non-conformism. See Amanat, “Edward BrowneandThe Persian Revolution of 1905–1909”, p. xii.64 For example, Browne comments that when a Babi in Taft asked him if he was aChristian, he answered openly that he was. See “The Babis of Persia, I” p. 501.65 Browne’s Introduction,A Traveller’s narrative written to illustrate the episode of the Bab(Cambridge: University Press, 1891), p. ix.66 Ibid., p. ix.67 These sentiments of Browne were published in an article sent to The ManchesterGuardian, 18 January 1909, cited in M.

Amanat, “Edward Browne and The Persian Revolution of 1905–1909”, p. xi.70 E.G. Browne,A Year Amongst the Persians, p. 110. Another example of Browne’s criti-cisms of Iran is found in his opinion of Persian poetry during the Safavid period(1501–1722), when he remarked that not a single poet of merit emerged during thistime when “learning, culture, poetry and mysticism completely deserted Persia”, seeE.G. Browne,Literary History of Persia, IV, p. 26. This view has been challengedrecently, see L. Lewisohn, “Sufism and the School of Isfahan”, in L. Lewisohn andD.

However, M. Ghanoonparvar has claimedthat Kasravi was “knowledgeable” in English. See the translator’s foreword to OnIslam, p. viii.78 Kasravi,Dar Piramun-e Adabiyyat, p. 150.79 One element of the conspiracy theory prevalent in Iran sees a British hand inall malevolent events that occur there. One contentious example of this maybe observed in the observation offered by many Iranians that the British broughtthe mollahs to power in the revolution in 1978. The conspiracy theory, however, isoften lampooned, as in Iraj Pezeshkzad’sMy Uncle Napoleon(first published in Persianin the early 1970’s, translated by Dick Davis, Washington DC: Mage Publishers,2000). For conspiracy theories in Iran see the entry in the Encyclopaedia IranicabyAhmad Ashraf.80 Katouzian has argued that Kasravi did not blame the British for all of Iran’s misfor-tunes. It was Kasravi’s hatred of classical Persian poetry that caused him to detest theacademic writings of academics such as Browne. See M.A.H. Katouzian, “Kasravi vaadabiyyat”, in Iran-nameh, XX, 2–3 (Spring–Summer 2002), p. 176.81 See for example, Kasravi,Dar piramun-e kherad, in Panj Maqaleh(Köln: Intisharat-eMehr, 1372/1993), p. 305.Dar piramun-e kheradwas originally published in 1943/4.82 See Kasravi,Farhang chist, p. 263.83Many Europeans and Americans believe that their factory-owners andinvestors must set in motion their numerous, huge machines, and theyspin, weave and manufacture in the hope of amassing money perpetually.And they pour out [goods], and the people of backward Eastern countries,ranging from India, Iran, China and Arabia continually buy their produce,and in so doing line the pockets [of the Europeans and Americans]. Forthis reason the governments of Europe and America consider it theirright to control one of the Eastern countries and open a market for its ownfactories’ produce. It is an excuse that they have for laying their hands onEastern countries. One should say only this: “They trade through force andmurder.”(Kasravi,Dar piramun-e kherad, p. 323)84 Kasravi,Porsesh va Pasokh, cited in Iran-nameh, p. 319.85 Kasravi,Ayin, p. 47.

For Goethe on Hafez see West-O ̋stlicherDivan, edited and annotated by Ernest Beutler in collaboration with Hans HeinrichSchaeder (Leipzig: Dieterichsche Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1943).87 It is not exactly clear what Kasravi means here. He may be referring to the idea thatEuropeans imagine Iranians to be weak and wretched.88 Kasravi,Dar Piramun-e Adabiyyat, p. 130.89 Ibid.90 Literary criticism had emerged in Britain as an academic subject in the late nine-teenth century and the Newbolt report of 1921 stated that literature could serve to“form a new element of national unity, linking together the mental life of all classes”.(Cited in Hans Bertens,Literary Theory(London: Routledge, 2001), p. 10). Moreover,in the 1930s F.R.

These reforms included the opening of theDar al-Fonunin Tehran, a college for secular learning, and which was instrumental inthe translation of books that were written in European languages. As Sa‘id Nafisiobserves, “The influence of the European literature opened the path for our writers”,Khaterat, p. 410. The treatises of Descartes, August Comte, David Hume, John Locke,John Stuart Mill and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were apparent in the writings ofreformist thinkers such as Akhundzadeh, Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani, Malkam Khanand ‘Abd al-Rahman Talebof.

We will have a bitter life if we are not affected by individual acts and eachunpalatable event, and our plans too will get nowhere. It is a shame for anoble human to be sorrowful and become a slave to circumstances, and forhis existence to be at the mercy of the times.

Then you will see that you have a happydisposition and no kind of pessimism or darkness exist in your spirit or yourthoughts.(p. 213)His view that Hafez was essentially a Sufi can be seen in the following commentwhen he says, “Sufism, especially Mawlavi, ‘Attar and Hafez understood perfectionas having real sight and witnessing (nazar va shohud-e vaqe‘i), and they believed thatrealities become manifest,” p. 187.62 The tomb complex has been added to on several occasions. Of note is the embellish-ment carried out under the instruction of Karim Khan Zand (d. 1779), whocontributed a slab of alabaster as a tomb-stone.
