The lectures he gave in Parisin January and February took place in public halls, such as the SocieteGeographique, Musee Guimet, Loge des Francsmacons, while lessons on Sufismfor students were given at private homes. Since Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan did notspeak French well enough to lecture in that language (in fact, in the West he onlylectured in English), while the audience was mainly French people who spokehardly any English, a simultaneous translation was given, sentence by sentence, bysomeone speaking both languages. The translation most often was written down bytwo French mureeds, M.lle C. Hulot and M.Ile H. Lefebvre. A single copybookcontaining the original texts of eleven lectures in M.lle Hulot's handwriting is in theArchives. Because of the haste with which they were written down, the reportingis fragmentary and often difficult to read. In M.lle Lefebvre's handwriting a largenumber of lectures exist in French, but few among them represent what she tookdown while listening to the lecture. Rather, she made fair copies of the Frenchlater, correcting and improving what she had taken down. Most of her originals,if they still exist, have not reached the Archives, and the French texts we do haveare somewhat farther from the original than M.lle Hulot's.Naturally the person doing the translation into French could not at thesame time write down the English. Since Sherifa Goodenough and Sakina Furneewere both in Geneva at the Sufi Headquarters during the first months of 1922,preparing lessons and lectures to be sent out to Sufi centres (see below underGathas),it may not always have been easy to find an English-speaking person able.to report the lectures. In any case, there are a number of instances where we haveno English original, and in such cases the French is presented here as the closestrecord we have to what was spoken. In most cases M.lle Lefebvre's copied text ispresented rather than M.lle Hulot's, as the latter is too fragmentary and sometimesimpossible to read. No new translations into English are presented here, as thatwould be too much a matter of opinion. In some cases, where the English text was"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiialso recorded, the reporter missed something and filled it in from the oraltranslation into French which followed each sentence; in such cases, the notesinclude a very literal translation in order to complete the English.On the 18th of January, Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan left for Belgium,where he stayed for about ten days. From this period we have four lectures withoriginals in longhand English. On the eighth of March he made a trip of about twoweeks to Switzerland, from which we have but a single lecture. He passed the lastweek of March at Wissous for the last time. A large house had been put at thedisposal of the family at St. Cloud', in the Val d'Or area, a near western suburbof Paris, by Fazal Mai Egeling, a Dutch mureed who had met Pir-o-Murshid atLausanne, Switzerland, in 1921. Pir-o-Murshid had already arranged for thefamily's move there, and when he returned after a tour of six weeks through theNetherlands and England, it was to Suresnes, where his family had taken upresidence in the mansion since known as \"Fazal Manzil\" (House of Blessing).In the Netherlands, during the first half of April, Pir-o-Murshid deliveredseveral lectures and talks, of which four are known to have been taken down. Fromthe 26th of April to the 12th of May he lectured in England, and seven of thoselectures, out of the eleven known to have been given, have survived (including anextensive discourse based on the playCyrano de Bergerac).When he returned to Paris, he continued to give lessons for his studentsat private homes, and once again we often must present French basic texts. Insome cases, however, we find in the Archives an early retranslation into English,indicating that even then no English original existed. Since these early translationsoften formed the basis for editing and distribution of the talk in English, wepresent them here following the French.A verybrief trip to Belgium, late in May,from which but a single lecturehas come down to us, completed the Pir-o-Murshid's travels during the periodcovered by this volume.He continued to lectureand give lessons in Paris (orSuresnes; the exact location is not known)until the opening of the Summer Schoolon the 16th of June at Suresnes.Itinerary1 .1 .22 - 31.8 .22:1 - ca. 20 January: Wissous.

After she wasinitiated in 1921, Pir-o-Murshid asked Sakina Furnee (in later years renamed\"Nekbakht\" by Pir-o-Murshid) to learn shorthand. During the winter and spring shehad mastered Pont's shorthand system, and beginning on June 16th she took downthe Pir-o-Murshid's lectures as he spoke them. At first she simply followed therules for the system she was using, often omitting the articles. But this did notprove satisfactory when she came to transcribe the lectures, since words may havedifferent meanings depending on the presence or absence of the article. Very soonSakina began to record all the articles. Another indication that she was a beginnerat shorthand is that at this early stage she did not always remember theabbreviations available in Pont's system. Little by little she introduced also somepractical ways of indicating special situations; for example, she would put a wordin parentheses when it consisted of two separate abbreviation-signs in shorthand,in order to show that these two parts made one word. She was very accurate intaking down the spoken word just as she heard it. Even foreign words, unknownto her, she would take down phonetically, which often allows us to discern how Pir-o-Murshid pronounced these words. When Pir-o-Murshid corrected himself whilespeaking, in the shorthand we find first what was said first, then crossed out,followed by what he said instead. The original texts in the present edition havebeen rendered in the same way. As Sakina's \"reportings\" (see Explanation of"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xivAbbreviations) were clearly the most exact record of what had been said, SherifaGoodenough, who had been given the task of preparing these lectures forpublication, or for initial multiplication and distribution among mureeds, andtherefore needed a copy of each lecture without delay, in most cases asked Sakinato dictate from her shorthand while she (Sherifa Goodenough) took it down inlonghand. In cases where the Pir-o-Murshid corrected himself, Sakina woulddictate both the word(s) first said and then the replacement(s).Another use to which Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan put Sakina's shorthandskills was in the dictation of his autobiography, which he did in private meetingswith her as time permitted. A substantial portion of this book was dictated during1922. Much of it the Pir-o-Murshid dictated in the third person, as though speakingof someone else, and this first part of the book is known as theBiography. It wasfinally published in 1979 (East-West Publications, London and The Hague) as theBiography of Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan.Most of the materials in this present volume (almost two-thirds) comefrom the period of the Summer School, June 16th to August 24th, and most ofthose lectures come down to us in Sakina's shorthand. This provides an excellentopportunity to present the texts of Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan's lectures exactly asthey were spoken. These same lectures were later edited and presented in variousforms: as papers for private circulation among Sufi Centres (already becomingnumerous and widespread in 1922), as parts of books, as magazine articles. In theprocess they were always edited, mainly by Sherifa Goodenough, who had begunediting Pir-o-Murshid's words in London during the First World War. Later thetexts were often re-edited, sometimes drastically. Many may wonder if it was thedesire of Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan to have his oral addresses edited, to result ina revision more readily understandable to a wider public. However, we do have anumber of statements on the subject from the Pir-o-Murshid himself, clarifying hisfeelings on the subject, such as:\"If you will preserve my words as I have spoken, it will be as saving my life.\"\"Do not change my word, form or phrase unless it is most necessary. Even so,carefully avoid all changes which can be avoided; otherwise you might lose thesense of my teaching, which is as essential to the Message as the perfume in therose. If the form in which I give my teaching seems to you not as correct as itought to be from a literary point of view, do not mind; let it be my own language.There will come a time when there will be a search for my own words. Just nowif my words are not accepted as the current coin, they will always be valued as theantique. \"\"To express my ideas fully my own words are necessary. When they are interpretedthey seem clothed in clothes which don't belong to them.\""},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xv\"I have my own English in which I can best express my feelings. Do not, therefore,try to put my teachings into a better English, for in trying to do so, you mightdrown the sense which is the very life of the Message. \"From these and other statements the intention of the Pir-o-Murshid in arrangingfor these shorthand records of his teaching becomes clear; in fact, he later hadKismet Stam, another secretary, who sometimes travelled with him, learnshorthand as well. In a sense these shorthand records may be said to have giventhe impulse to the project of assembling the present edition ofComplete Works,since the creation of these books was originally the inspiration of Sakina Furndewhen she saw how far the texts, presented as Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan's, deviatedfrom her own shorthand reportings. In fact, later in life, for this reason sheundertook to make a whole new transcription of her shorthand, which, however,by that time she could no longer read perfectly. She conducted lengthy discussions,mostly by mail, with Sirdar van Tuyll, concerning the restoration of the texts towhat had been said originally. She also expressed the hope that the exact words ofPir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan would be published, also mentioning differences inother versions from old documents in the Archives (many of which had alreadybegun to deteriorate), and founded the Nekbakht Foundation partly for thispurpose. The publication of theComplete Workscontinues the work she initiated.In between the lectures in July and August a series of twelve short lessonson Indian music was given privately to Lakmd, the young daughter of a mureed,Mahtab van Hogendorp, at whose home in Switzerland the Pir-o-Murshid had beenwarmly received. She wrote down what Pir-o-Murshid dictated to her. Musicalterms -- in Sanskrit, Hindi or Persian -- were of course unknown to Lakme, andso she wrote down what she heard; sometimes the words are beyond recognition.Later she copied these twelve dated lessons into her copybook, now in theBiographical Department. In the preparation of this material for publication, theyounger son of Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan, Hidayat Inayat Khan, who is amusician, has been requested to add a few corrections and some suggestions fora better understanding. (The lessons continued in Switzerland later in the year;these will appear in the volume 1922 II.) Music here was not explained justtechnically, but simultaneously from scientific and mystical points of view, as musicto Pir-o-Murshid had been his primary means of delivering his Message of Love,Harmony and Beauty. This also is the reason behind the musical form of histeaching in theGayan, Vadan, andNirtan(meaning: singing, playing, and dancing).This was his subtle way of offering the deepest esoteric knowledge to those whowere ready to receive it. Pir-o-Murshid's many vina recitals in London, Paris, andelsewhere, which still occurred in 1922, were also conceived as a means of spiritualteaching.A complete text of the lecture The Spiritual Application in our Daily"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xv iLife\", given at The Hague, Netherlands, on 1st April, does not exist; there are onlysentences or paragraphs of the lecture, written down and numbered by Pir-o-Murshid himself in one of Sirdar van Tuyll's copybooks. After each sentence anopen space was left. This may have been a practice, given by Pir-o-Murshid toSirdar, in memory training, or in training for preparing sermons for the UniversalWorship. If that assumption is right, Sirdar must have been told to listen to thelecture with full concentration instead of reporting it or making annotations, andafter that he had to fill in the blanks after what Pir-o-Murshid had written in hisnotebook, and re-compose the lecture. Unfortunately this \"completed\" lecture bySirdar has not been found.GathasA very substantial number of the talks of Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khanpresented in this volume later were incorporated into a series of lessons forinitiates in the Sufi Order; these are known asGathas.Therefore, some generalremarks about the formation and character of this series and its relationship to thetalks as originally given are due here.OriThe idea of having a regular series of lessons originated in London in theearly days of the formation of a Sufi organisation, which took place during the FirstWorld War. The very earliest publications, for exampleThe Sufimagazine ofFebruary, 1915, announce \"Sufi classes\", some for the public, some for members,and some for initiates. These classes became more numerous in the followingyears, and finally, from October 1917 on, a series of classes on nine subjects washeld monthly, in addition to classes for initiates (also given in regular series), allconducted by Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan himself. From a most interesting letterwritten (at the Pir-o-Murshid's direction) by Sherifa Goodenough to MurshidaRabia Martin in San Francisco on 20 August 1918, we learn that classes were heldfor ten months of the year (once a month, thus ten lessons on each subject) andthat the courses continued for three years. All those present wrote down what thePir-o-Murshid said. Then questions were asked and he answered them. SherifaGoodenough also mentions that when \"Murshid is away on a lecture tour. . .theSecretary reads a paper written by Murshid on the subject of the class, and in thebranches in the same way the Secretary reads a paper and the others write itdown.\" It was, no doubt, from the need to supply centres outside London withteaching materials that the written sets of papers originated, and SherifaGoodenough was designated by the Pir-o-Murshid to put these together. From theclasses given in 1917-1918, in 1918-1919 and in 1919-1920, the three series of ten"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"xviipapers each, of thirteen subjects, were assembled (with some irregularities, ofcourse). These became known as theGitas,which means \"songs\", as inBhagavadGita.The opportunity for the Pir-o-Murshid to give classes on a monthly basis forthree years' running was due to the war and the impossibility of travel outside theBritish Isles. The availability of a fairly exact transcript of what he had said wasdue to the practice of having all those present record the text, which meant hewould speak slowly enough for his words to be taken down in longhand (thougheven in this early period, Dr. Gruner in Leeds, Shabaz Mitchell in Southampton,and Shabaz Best in London sometimes took down his words in shorthand).When the war was over and the situation had settled down enough for thePir-o-Murshid to travel again, he began on the Continent and eventually returnedtwice to the United States as well. Never again did he stay in one place for threeyears to give regular classes. In 1920 he moved his family to France, where, asmentioned above, they acquired permanent quarters in the spring of 1922.However, he tirelessly went on travelling, first through France, Germany, Hollandand Belgium, and later through Italy, Scandinavia, the United States, and finally toIndia (in 1926), for the first time since his departure in 1910 (his intended returnthere from Moscow in May, 1914, having been prevented by disturbances inTurkistan).Sufi Centres'Requirements.Everywhere he went to lecture he left behind a group of people, some ofwhom had taken initiation, interested in his teachings. Groups formed whicheventually became Sufi centres.Since at that time very little of Pir-o-Murshid'steaching had been published,there naturally was a strong desire on the part ofthese growing centres for teaching to give to the many persons interested. Ofcourse theGitaswere available, but some of those had already been set aside foreventual publication, and others were not circulated( of the thirteen subjects, onlyseven have continued to be used in Sufi centres) . Besides,those papers representedthe Pir-o-Murshid's teaching of an earlier period. In the years1920-1923,m any newsubjects were being systematically discussed which had not appeared before. Inanycase, it became apparent that a new series of teachings was needed, and SherifaGoodenough set to work to assemble it from the by then already large store ofaddresses given.She had also by this time left England,and by the end of 1920andduring 1921 mostly worked at the International Headquarters, established inGeneva.It was there also, that Sakina Furnee began to take down in longhandwhat Sherifa Goodenough dictated to her from Pir-o-Murshid' s lectures andlessons already given and available to her, in order to make them into a series,later call ed\"Gathas\"."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"xviiiGitasandGathas.So, while theGitashad been given by Pir-o-Murshid as ten courses ondifferent subjects, theGathaswere assembled and prepared by SherifaGoodenough from teachings given by Pir-o-Murshid at different times, not ascourses, but as the teaching of the Sufi Message in general.Composition of the New Series.Throughout 1921 and the spring of 1922, many of the teachings includedin the first series ofGathaswere assembled in Geneva. In March of 1922 Pir-o-Murshid appointed Sakina as Sherifa Goodenough's assistant for one year, to helpher with this work. The Pir-o-Murshid, meanwhile, (1921 and spring 1922) waslecturing in Paris, England, Germany, Holland and Belgium; Sherifa Goodenoughalways requested transcripts of his lessons and lectures as soon as possible afterthese had been given, for possible inclusion in the new series, though it wasactually only teachings given in Paris at that time which were eventually included.It was M.me Lafitte in Paris who passed on the material to Sherifa Goodenoughin Geneva, and some letters urging that material be sent at once, still survive.Often the material was sent in French, taken from the simultaneous translation,and thus needing re-translation into English.Sherifa Goodenough's original idea was that Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khanwould systematically give monthly lectures on various subjects, as he had done inLondon earlier. This we see clearly in a letter she wrote to Pir-o-Murshid in April1921, where she says, \"Breath, Symbology, andTakua Taharatnumber 1 are allthere. But the lessons have not yet been given for the second month, namelyNumber 2, Series I. The first month is complete; for the second month these three.. .have yet to be given.\" But it was no longer possible for Pir-o-Murshid to give histeachings on such a schedule, since his life increasingly became one of constanttravel. The longest he would stay in one place was the two and one half months ofthe Summer School at Suresnes.We find that most of the teachings which became theGathasof the firstseries come from 1921, 1920 and earlier years. Besides a number of lectures from1921, most of what became the second series ofGathascomes from spring 1922and from the Summer School of 1922. But Sherifa Goodenough needed a few morepapers to complete series II, which she took from talks in July of 1923 (after the-Pir-o=Murshid returned from his lecture tour in America in the spring of 1923).Then she turned to series III, about half of which comes from 1921-22, -- asubstantial number from lectures given during the Summer School 1922 wasincorporated-- and about half from 1923-25. This third series ofGathasincludedalso material given by Pir-o-Murshid as late as November, 1925. It took this longto complete the third series partially because Sherifa Goodenough's time was taken"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"xixup preparing books for publication. With the Summer School of 1923, Pir-o-Murshid focussed his attention clearly on lecture-series designed to be made intobooks.The role ofSherifa Goodenough in the formation of the series ofGathascannot be too strongly emphasized.Although the teachings all originate with Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khanhimself, the form in whichthey havebeen handed downin Suficircles is the work of Sherifa Goodenough. Sometimes, because of length,a talk of the Pir-o-Murshid isdivided byher into two or more Gatha lessons.Sometimes an entire Gatha is put together from the Pir-o-Murshid' s answers toquestions given after lectures on various subjects at different times. She had theneed to make the teachings come out more or less even, so that there would beexactly ten papers on each of seven subjects in three series of approximately equallength.Needless to say, Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan did not give his teachings in210 preciselyequal units.It was the work of Sherifa Goodenough to see that thingscame out in such order, a work whichshe fulfilledconscientiously. Nevertheless,her product cannot be presumedto have fulfilledthe Pir-o-Murshid's intention ateverypoint; because of the rapid growth of the movement, part of the work hadto bedelegated to his helpers andhad to bedone by them independently.Titles. and Namesof CategoriesforGathas.Working papers from Sherifa Goodenough which have survived indicatethat she originally thought in terms of the categories already established for theGitas,but found many of these categories no longer appropriate. She first devisedfive subjects, and later added two more. Still laterKashf-Insightwas substituted forRyazat-Esotericism(Kashfexisted earlier as a category ofGitas,but was theretranslated as \"Occultism\"). Naturally Sherifa Goodenough must have discussedthese categories with Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan, which received their officialnames and the English rendering from him as well.From the titles Pir-o-Murshid frequently gave to his talks in 1922, contraryto what happened in previous years, when titles were often added later by mureeds,we can see that he was aware of series of teachings which were being assembled,and desired to contribute directly to that process. Thus he often calls a talk\"Insight\", \"Symbology\",\"Takua Taharat\",etc., and from the fact that Sakina tookthem down in shorthand, it can be seen that he actually said these titles. Withforeign words like\"Talhua Taharat\",however, Sakina sometimes wrote them out inlonghand as well.From the records that survive it is not possible to determine exactly whenthe title Gatha was applied to the entire series. The Indo-Iranian word was appliedto the teachings of the Persian prophet Zarathushtra, and is used in the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"XcZoroastrian tradition to indicate those parts of theAvestawhich come from theprophet himself. In Sanskrit and Old Persian it means song (cf. Gita).Intended Use ofGathasand Other Teachings.The original intention behind drawing up theGathaswas to havesomething definite, a selection of Sufi items, to be sent out to the centres. At thistime the grades of initiation had not yet been established, and so there was noequivalency between a certain set of papers and a certain initiation in the SufiOrder. Of course those who heard the teachings were those who came to thelectures; in the case of the Summer School, persons who had not been initiated inthe Order were equally permitted to attend. It was only after the imposition ofmuch greater regularisation in the interest of the nascent organization as a wholein late 1923 and especially in autumn, 1924, that the teachings in these series cameto be regarded as restricted only to mureeds of some particular rank. And eventhen, Pir-o-Murshid remarked already in January of 1924 that theGathas,thenbecoming a privilege of the initiated, would someday \"be given to a much largerpopulation\". (TheGathaswere published in 1982 by Servire in the Netherlands.)It is also important to understand that even though material wasincorporated into these papers which later was restricted to initiates, that did notmean it was not to be used for some other purpose as well. Often a lecture wasmade intoa Gatheka, a Gatha, a Gita, a SangathaorSangita,and at the same timewas published in a book or a magazine. A considerable number of sayings,published in theGayan(1923), have been taken by Sherifa Goodenough fromlectures given during 1922; and mostly from those lectures which later have beenclassified into series ofGitas, Gathas, Gathekas, SangathasandSangitas. In thatway the essence of those teachings could reach a much larger public. It was not somuch the material itself that was restricted as the use to which it was put. Initiatesneeded to learn the feeling that the teachings they were receiving were mostprecious, indeed sacred. To emphasize this, they were not to be copied or shared.In fact, the Pir-o-Murshid's original practice at the time his audience consisted ofsmall groups, of having all those present write down the text, was reversed, as thenumbers of his hearers had grown, and no one was allowed to take notes at theclasses. Even at the lectures themselves, from 1923 on only the appointedsecretaries were permitted to take down what the Pir-o-Murshid said, lestinaccurately reported words should be handed on without any control.In general, it may be said that much of Pir-o-Murshid's attention in 1922was focussed on providing teachings for use in Sufi Centres, although he alwayspromoted publication of his words and had a wider audience in mind. Even thoughhe sometimes gave classes for particular groups of mureeds, or special mureeds'classes, his vision of the Sufi Message encompassed this much wider audience."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"xxiNotesAfterLecturesFor each entry, the basic text is the one closest to the actual words of Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan, the oldest one available. All differences from this text inother early documents, up to and including first publication (if any), are indicatedin the notes. An abbreviated title is assigned to each document, and a complete listof the documents compared, along with specific information about each documentfor this particular lecture, appears before the beginning of the notes. Where oneor more of the listed documents is not cited in the notes, this indicates a textidentical to the basic text.Over the course of years, different typewritten copies and stencils wereprepared at International Headquarters in Geneva for distribution among mureeds.In many cases, the earliest Headquarters' stencils (in earlier years called\"cyclostyled copies\") show very extensive editing, and often, therefore, wereconsidered by Sakina Furnee to be incorrect; at the same time, however,chronologically these old stencils were nearer to the original than laterHeadquarters' stencils and sometimes they show originally spoken words whichwere lost in later edited copies of the lecture. But on the whole, later stencils showa return to something closer to the original reporting. Many Headquarters' stencilsare found in the Archives, on which Sakina noted the differences as compared toher shorthand reporting, writing the original words in the margin. In certain cases,however, she did not write the original word(s) in the margin, apparently indicatingthat she accepted the change.There exists an extensiveerratalist on which Sirdar van Tuyll and SakinaFurnee exchanged comments as to the revisions which had been made in the texts.Although this list does not cover all the lectures, it is the only more recentdocument (dating from the 1950's) which is mentioned in the notes, since the workthey were doing then is so similar to, and therefore entirely relevant to, the workof comparison done in the preparation of these books.

And when one observes nature from this point of viewone cannot fail 6from being6 impressed by this: that nature in all its forms glorifiesthe name of God. As in man this tendency develops, he naturally, in his way,expresses his soul's desire, and it is this expression which brings him exaltation; andit is this exaltation which is called prayer. Prayer has 5 different aspects:10 . The praise of God, Who in reality is above all praises; but by praisingGod man gives expression to all the beauty that is intelligible to him. Naturally thereciprocal effect of observation and expression of beauty creates exaltation whichcomes into man's life as a blessing of God, for man's life depends upon what hethinks. If he sees beauty, thinks of beauty, expresses beauty, he lives in beauty. Ifon the contrary he sees ugliness, he expresses ugliness, he is deprives of this beautyfor which his soul naturally longs.20. The second aspect of prayer is to realise one's limitations incomparison to the perfection of God. When man calls Him Almighty, andconsiders himself as weak and small; when man calls Him All-Knowing, and?understands his own ignorance; when he calls Him his King and stands before Himas His servant, these comparisons open up, so to speak, before man the gap whichis between man and God 8 It makes man conscious of its9 limitations10 and of hissmallness; and naturally humbles him before God. In humbling himself beforeGod, man does not lose any virtue, for to God alone is due all humbleness. Thereis another sight11 of this question that although humbleness is hurtful to one'spride, in spite of that, the joy of humbleness the proud one does not know. Theeffect it makes upon one's own feelings is as opening the doorsof God's altar 1 --which is in the heart--12 by tâºe13 humility.A person who asks forgiveness of his friend has a peculiar joy which theone who is asked14 pardon, cannot feel. One must remember it is not only thefeeling of pride which gives joy, it is often the fastening15 of pride--humility--whichgives sometimes a special joy.6.

One shows some form of respect andhumbleness to parents, superiors, learned people and kings. But in the end, whenlife is completely realised, one finds that to God alone the different manners ofrespect and humbleness are due. It is this lesson that different religions have rivenin different forms of prayers16, to different people according to their wants73bme18aspect of prayer is to explain or to tell God one's life's difficultiesand pains, to lay before God one's life's wants and demands. And in fact who inthis world is so deserving this confidence from us as God!--Yes, one has friends,relations who love one, who try to help one, but they are only human beings, theyare in the same boat travelling on the same sea, subject to all errors and difficultiesand to all limitation19 which human beings have. Man can be helped by man, butonly to some extent, and the more one studies the human nature the more onefeels inclined to approach with our21 troubles and difficulties 22near God2.Therefore this is one part of the teaching of religion which is taught in prayer.The 4th aspect of prayer is as an appeal of a lover to the beloved one. Nodoubt this is a higher form of prayer; in order to pray in this manner man shouldbe raised from the everyday plane of his24 life. Since it is difficult to love a humanbeing, how very much 25difficult25 for man to love God, for it is easy26 to loveone's own kind but it is not given to anybody27 to be able to love the one who isshapeless28. To love the ideal God man must evolve by the lesson given by love.No doubt in this love there is no disappointment and God's love alone will fulfilthe aim and desire of the soul.All other forms of love are as steps towards the love of God. The purposeof God is fulfilled in the love of God. But who can say how beautiful is the love ofGod to one who has never experienced it? As God is the perfect ideal, so the love16.

Love of God is the love of the living and of the everlasting and the loveof the true beloved.The 5th aspect of prayer is to know God and thereby to come closer toGod. It is the real meaning of atonement. This cannot be learned because it is anatural thing. The attraction between29 human soul and God is like the negativeand positive of electricity. Man's happiness and peace depend upon his nearnessto God. Religion has taught it in the form of prayer. It is this 5 aspect of prayerwhich constitute a religious worship. Every religion given in whatever time hastaught its methods of prayer. No doubt man always proves a child. He has foughtwith his fellowmen31 not because he does not pray, but because he praysdifferently. Man has taken the form of prayer for an external thing, man hastaken32 the outward religious form to satisfy his vanity. And the consequence isthat the other men revolted against this, renounced prayer. For an instance,Protestants 34 came as a protest against the Catholic form of prayer. Many havegiven away35 both. However36, renunciation37 does-18 suffice the purpose becausethere is nothing to be placed39 in the place of prayer. What man can give up is theabuse instead of renouncing40 the proper use. To-day the great chaos of humans world is caused by the lack of religion. Man's soul wants a religion and man'smind fights against 41the religions41.

In the East a person who does not believein God finds difficult to avow it, but in the Occident on the contrary we find justthe reverse.There are circles where men feel there is an attraction towards God. Butthey cannot avow that they believe in God; they are prevented by others. --Itamuses me very much when they say: gods instead of God--in order to change thereligious ideal, so to make the thing light--or in order to prove that that is themodern way, wanting to show themselves of their time.

(?) 45The question arises in an advanced mind, that since God is in one's self, and knowsall things, and all our difficulties and troubles, our love and attitude towards everything, our faults, what need is there of expressing ourselves in prayer? It is likesaying in loving somebody: \"Why show it by outward manifestation?\" It is a naturalthing to express what we feel deeply. Expression is in the nature of life. Theoutward temple, 46no doubt46, is a temple where47 all gather and offer theirservices to God, and, no doubt, a religious congregation has a great influence uponthose who pray together, because each gives other48 something of 49his 49perfecting in this way the exaltation created by this gathering. But the innerpsychology of the prayer is still different. Man himself is a temple, by offering hisprayer to God he allows the prayer to rise and re-echo in the dome of his own43.

Le vrai but de l'education est d'apprendrea l'enfant a comprendre le but de la vie, et a le diriger dans sa voie. Autrefois onenseignait a 1'enfant les bonnes manieres qui faisaient le charme de la vie, on luiapprenait cet ideal de reconnaissance qui produisait l'amour, le respect,l'obeissance pour ses parents.

Plus on reflechitsur les affaires de ce monde, plus on voit que cette vie est un voyage. La seuledifference est la suivante: que la source et le but de ce voyage ne sont pas connusa tout le monde, et la raison est la suivante: La vie de l'homme se passeordinairement en s'occupant des choses superficielles de la vie.

De cette facon ce qui l'attire et le pousse, ce qui decide sonprochain voyage; et ainsi une personne, dans la vie, voyage d'une chose a une autrechose. Et quand la mort arrive, it se rend compte qu'il n'est pas du tout oil itcroyait, ni ce qui 1'attend de l'autre cote.2Â° . Autre sorte, voyage conscient: I'homme sait d'ou it part, et it sait ou it veutarriver. Par consequent pour ce voyage 1'homme part sachant oil it va, et itaccomplit dans le voyage le desir le plus cher de son coeur. La difference entre cesdeux voyageurs, c'est que Fun saisit l'objet dans l'obscurite, et saisit l'objet quin'est pas celui qu'il s'attendait a toucher. Il fait ceci parceque c'est le desir innd deson ame de voyager, et chaque fois it voit qu'il s'est trompe.Le second, voyage conscient: it sait d'ou it part et ou it veut arriver: it y a sansdoute des conditions, des necessites, des regles et des lois qui doivent etre etudideset comprises. En premier lieu,. . . 3 la chose la plus difficile. . . 3 humaine,parceque la parole humaine a ete. . . 3 exprimer du premier voyage. etit n'y a pas de paroles pour exprimer experience du second voyage. Tout ce qui aete essaye par les grands mystiques et les sages a ete fait au moyen de leur poesie,symbologie, pour eveiller l'homme a la verite. Quand une personne commence cevoyage. it lui est necessaire d'avoir un esprit initiatique, et c'est la personne qui adu courage, qui peut commencer ce voyage, parceque la nature humaine estcomme celle des moutons: ou une passe, les autres passent. Des gens deviennentfixes dans leurs croyances, et quand on leur demande 3 ils hesitent: pourquoi?Parcequ'ils ont pris l'habitude. Par consequent, c'est l'ame courageuse qui se dit:si on m'a appris, etc. 3. Si je trouve autre direction, pourquoi ne le prenderai-je pas? Sans aucune doute, les hommes dependent les uns des autres. par exemplequand une personne arrive dans une ville inconnue, s'il ne demande pas chemin,it arrivera peut-etre, mais surement en gaspillant un peu de temps et de sonenergie. Pour arriver a la destination voulue, it faut que l'homme trouve qu'on luiindique la source. Sans doute, cet enseignement nous le trouvons en nous-memes;cet esprit, dans 1'homme, qui pese et qui juge, qui est capable de distinguer entrele Bien et Mal. Deux autres sources peuvent noun guider dans la voie; une source,signes et traces de ceux qui ont deja fait ce voyage, et qui ont laisse ces signes pourceux qui veulent les trouver. Et plus on dvolue 3 , plus on est aptea voir ces signes dans la poesie, dans la musique, dans la nature, etc. Le poeteSaadi a dit: Si to vue est claire, to peux lire meme dans les feuilles des arbres. Etle signe des grandes times venues de temps en temps pour eclairer 1'ame, quirendent le voyage plus facile, ces signes peuvent devenir si utiles; et 1'homme quipeut les comprendre trouvera son chemin meme dans l'obscurite et les tâ¬nebres.Car pour certains etres, les paroles des grandes times sont seulement des parolessaintes; mais pour les autres, c'est.comme une torche. Cela ne suffit pas, car unsigne n'est qu'un signe. Le maitre est le premier et le dernier. Et celui qui est lepremier et le dernier ne peut pas etre absent d'au-milieu de nous. C'est a cause3 .

Le Maitre qui parle tout bas quand it faut parler tout bas, et parle hautquand c'est necessaire. Par consequent, c'est donc I'homme qui possede ]'esprit duMaitre, et c'est par I'homme qu'on peut apprendre plus que par n'importe quelsigne. On dit en langue Perse:2Dans les deux voyages on trouve les peines; sans doute, dans le voyageconscient apres la peine, it y a une recompense, tandis que dans l'autre, apres lapeine, plus rien. En Anglais: \"Tout est bien qui finit bien.\" Et nous pouvons jugerle resultat quand nous voyons la fin. Quand on fait ce voyage on le fait en dedans,sa nature est le contraire.La premiere difficulte, c'est se rendre compte qu'on n'a pas de pireennemi que soi-meme; que tout obstacle de ce voyage, c'est faiblesses et defautsde soi-meme. Six defauts se montrent dans ce voyage: colere, passion, infatuation,orgueil, jalousie, avarice. II se trouve que toutes les erreurs qu'on peut faire dansla vie, ont leur source dans un de ces defauts, et jusqu'au moment ou I'hommereconnait son ennemi en lui-meme, it lutte contre ces memes ennuis dans lesautres. Le jour ou it se rend compte que cette faiblesse est en lui, sans aucunedoute, it a fait un pas en avant vers le but de son existence. Mais ceci ne met pasfm a la difficulte du voyage. La difficulte est la suivante: des qu'une personnedevient meilleure que la generalite, it souffre davantage; quand it comprend mieux,it souffre d'incomprehension et de manque de sympathie chez les autres. Et sasouffrance et sa sensibilite augmentent. Les epines avec les epines peuvent sepiquer mutuellement; les epines avec la rose, la rose est dechiree, 1'epine reste1'epine, et la rose est dechiree. Plus un homme est developpe, plus it souffre de cequ'il sent chez les autres, et it se trouve solitaire, car chaque personne cherche sonpropre element, et quand developpe, plus difficile a trouver. Sans doute ]'habitudecree la nature, et le moment vient ou l'on a appris a supporter ce qui est difficilea supporter. Cette attitude peut s'appeler la mort, et alors elle a deux attitudes:1Â° . Indifferente, partir et laisser tout; 2Â°. Cette attitude c'est de dire si les bonssouffrent, les mauvais doivent souffrir encore plus, et it a pour eux une immensetendresse.La comprehension atteinte par les adeptes, c'est que plus on avance, pluson approche la vraie source. Le grand poete hindou 3 a dit: Je suis moi-meme le voyageur et je me suis trouve moi-meme etre le but. Quand on se figure4on voit qu'un pole de ce voyage est humain, l'autre pole est divin. Le point d'ouon part pour le voyage peut s'appeler 5. Ceci montre que c'est ledeveloppement humain qui est divin. C'est ce developpement que l'on peutatteindre en faisant ce voyage. 11 n'est pas necessaire que chaque etre humain soitdivin; comme la jeunesse suit 1'enfance, le divin suit l'humain.

The king and queen loved it,admired it, took great care of it. One day the king was going in the woods for shooting.He said: \"Please parrot, I am going in the same woods from where you were brought;is there some message I can say to your fellow creatures?\" The parrot said: \"Yes, I wouldbe much obliged if you take my message. Tell them please that I am very unhappy sinceI have left you all. I long for that freedom which I experienced in the woods andassociation with my fellow creatures. Although the king and queen are both sympatheticto me, they keep me in a golden cage\". On arriving in the woods the king looked andsaid: \"Parrots one of your brothers is in my palace and it has sent you a message: it isunhappy since it has left you and longs to be in this sphere where it was free to dwell.But it does not know that ever it shall be free\". On hearing this the parrots dropped onthe ground one after the other. And the king was so impressed by it. Instead of killingmore birds he went home. He said: \"So many lives I have ruined by giving this message\".The king came near the parrot and said: \"How foolish to give this message! When I toldit, one after the other they dropped on the earth and were dead\". The parrot looked up,heaved a sigh, and dropped. The king said: \"I thought the parrot was foolish, but I thinkIam foolish to say this. Now I have lost the last one.\" The king commanded that theparrot be taken and buried. The servants came with a golden tray, and took the deadbird out of its cage. But as soon as it was out of the cage, it flew and sat on the roof. Theking asked: \"What is it, parrot, you surprise me?\" The parrot said: \"My friends did not die.They played death. They gave me the lesson which I asked them to give. There is nofreedom without death. \"-(From Km.'s transcription of her sh.r . of \"The Freedom of the Soul\", Detroit, February1st, 1926)7 .

If it were as simple as it seems the world would not have gonethrough the great catastrophe which it has gone through. The cause of allthetrouble3 is the lack of realisation of Brotherhood,and that this Brotherhood2 wastaught by the great Teachers of humanity. If the great Teachers have given amessage4 to humanityit is no doubt the message of Brotherhood. In plain words:\"God is love; you must love your enemies. \"No doubt simple things to human beings are too simple; too many peoplewho have studied think that they must no longer learn anything. It is too easy; yetif they would study it closely they would see it is the most difficult thing in theworld.The necessity of life is a spiritual necessity from a metaphysical point ofview.In other words, Brotherhood2 is the nature of man, and the secret ofBrotherhood2 is centred in the idea that like attracts like. Some animals go innumbers; they are attached to each other, and they abide in harmony. But otheranimals, such as lions, tigers&c.do not like to be together; their passion is theirown enemy;they are never contented, becausetheyhave not that spirit of harmonyfor which every soul longs.

In the traditions of East and Westhumanity is the same, and has shown virtues which seem right and wrong (both areso close together), so that it is very difficult to distinguish which is which. Familypride developed into native8 quarrels. The old traditions of Persia explain thosequarrels between men, tribes, and so on; for instance, if the chiefs of two differenttribes were struggling together, the stronger one became chief of the two tribes;yet as long as the feeling of Brotherhood remained, it was a virtue in itself, andit was living. All that is moving is living, and that which is still is dead, and thatwhich is dead is useless in life because it brings about death. In the great war wehave gone through there was a dead element; 9patriotic spirit, so long as it wasprogressing 10was a virtue; but when it ceased to expand itself then it becamecontrary to what Brotherhood2 should be. Any individual in Society\" has totrouble himself about his own interests; a greater virtue is the care for a wholefamily, the endeavour to do all one can to please one's friends. But that virtue issurpassed by the individual who does not only think of himself and his family, butalso of the people in his own village or town. One may even see a man consideringhimself as nothing, because his outlook is greater and he considers the nation first.As long as that heart12 quality is progressing there is a great blessing in society;but as soon as that spirit becomes still and is not given a chance to progress, thenit ceases to fulfil its purpose; it is hindering the progress of human life; and, if itcannot expand it brings about the greatest catastrophes that have been experiencedin the world.From a philosophic13 point of view the whole world is one family; and, ifwe look at the way in which the world is working, we see that everybody is seekinghis own interests. Men, however, are interdependent. A man living in a familycannot expect to be happy so long as one member of the family is unhappy.According to a mystical point of view, the whole world is one body; and, if thereis a weakness in any part of a body, the whole body will be affected by it. Life, atthe present time, is like a child's game; every child is trying to get the other child'stoy,. but he does not know how to keep it. Things in the world are changeable; theyare not to be relied upon.

Of course there are different degrees ofintoxication, such as nourishment, excitement,. .3 intoxication. All of them areintoxication, and affect the mind; but, as mind and body reciprocate every effectof life, the intoxication of life may influence the body. Therefore, all actions areunder the influence of intoxication. No doubt it is well known that everyone iscommitting faults, and that faults may become virtues. Therefore generalintoxication cannot only4 be distinguished.Another idea is that intoxication is material; but there is a desire in thesoul which is material too; and, what happens is, that this intoxication disturbs theactivity of the soul. A great poet ( )5 has written a play called\"Shacounta\"6 which is a symbolical idea of what I am speaking about.

The second act is that inwhich the King gives her an engagement ring, promising to give her his palace,whenever she can come. After returning to the palace, everything so engaged histhoughts that he forgot Shacounta6 .When she comes to the palace she,unfortunately, loses the ring; she sends a word to the King, but he is so taken upwith his duties that he does not believe that there was such a person. The third actis that in which Shacounta6 being disappointed, disappears and goes to heaven; butstill she retains in her breast the promise that the King made, and cherishes thathope even in heaven. In the fourth act the King remembers, and thinks of hispromise; then, every beauty around him becomes mere darkness, and he goes insearch of Shacounta6 until he finds her. This is the story of the soul. In theBible10 it is said that, having made man, God called out Who art thou?\" and theanswer came--\"I am Thy servant\". It is the promise of the King; it is this promisethat every soul gives to its Lord, and that promise was forgotten in the intoxication.When the intoxication diminishes, then the remembrance of the promise comesback to the soul, and the soul sees that all the beauty in the world becomes fadedwhen Shellthinks of the beauty to whom Shellpromised.In order to remind man of his promise the ancient Egyptians had thefollowing custom:--when people were eating, drinking, and dancing a mummy wasbrought in, in order to balance the intoxication by the sight. Even now, among theBurmese, a great feast is made when somebody is dead, and so the intoxication isbalanced by the idea of death. In ancient temples there was always somethingreminding people of death. What is around us is nothing but intoxication; manworks from the morning till the evening under the influence of intoxication, till hefinds that it all is vain; as soon as he realises the intoxication, his first idea is tohumble himself in the dust and say: \"I am nothing\", and only in that moment asense comes by which he feels and sees things clearly.My friends, all the troubles and catastrophes the world has gone throughis the result of intoxication; and although all troubles may seem to have vanished,yet they cannot cease so long as intoxication exists.The chief mission of a religion is to bring about a balance. No doubt itis stupid to think that man could live in the world without being intoxicated; it isjust the same as if we thought that a fool can swim in wine without becomingintoxicated. We breathe intoxication and every movement is made under its influ-ence. But we can make a balance between intoxication and soberness. People thinkthat by study we can solve the enigmas of life; it is just the point of view of adrunken person compared with that of a sober man. A drunken man will saysomething is a serpent, but if a sober man comes and proves that it is nothing buta cord, what influence can the drunken man have on his fellow creatures9.

There are a great many scientists whodesire to get at something which is hidden; they cannot deny that their souls havenot yet found the happiness they are seeking. Manyof them do not allowthemselves to admit there is a soul,and to confess there is a God; but then themoment of soberness brings them a great force; they cannot help thinking ofsomething above this changeable world. This shows that in the darkness ofintoxicationeveryone isseeking, just like a person in a dark room; but he does notknow what he is seeking for. He is seeking for a friend in whom he may confide;he is seeking for a judge who knows real justice which cannot be found here; heis seekingfor beautythat never vanishes; he is lookingfor lifethat never finishes;for knowledge that never changes; and in seeking all these he is seeking God.Now, there seems to be in this world a kind of attraction to spiritualthings,and sometimes one fords amusing things; the tendency of some intellectualswho tryto photograph the soul, or to design it; they seem to be ignorant of limitsbetween changeableand unchangeable.

It is just the same as when we look at what we can the horizon; wetry to see something and see the horizon; but in fact it is nothing. And so it is withthe constant occupations which keep us so busy; we have an innate desire to findwhat we do not know. It is that desire of the children which makes them interestthemselves with their toys; and so it goes on from one thing to another; we arenever satisfied. 2Sometimes one thinks that it is the inefficiency of things that is thecause of dissatisfaction. Gemetufnes one thinks !hatit 69 theOneffieveneyef things that69 th e2; sometimes one thinks that his desires are one particularthing, and therefore not satisfactory; but the inner cause is that the soul is seekingwhat reason does not understand; and the day when the mind will understand it,it will be like being reborn. In the holy scriptures it is said that if the soul be notreborn it cannot enter the kingdom of God, which shows that entering the kingdomof God necessitates re-birth.Now, coming to the different desires of the soul; there are different desireswhich are answered by one thing. The first desire is for 3dependent happiness3,and when one does not find happiness, he seeks for pleasure which brings him ashadow of happiness, as the pleasures of the body cost more than they give; thereis no earthly pleasure which has much happiness attached to it. An Arabian storygives an example of this. In the Palace of a King a slave, wiping down the furnituretook rest on the royal bed. It was so soft and full of beautiful ornaments 4she slept fast; she did not know where she was.

Itamused the king and queen, and they asked her if she was proud of her action, andshe replied thus: \"I have slept one or two hours in this bed and I have receivedone blow; I wonder how many blows you Shave received5, you, who sleep hereevery day\". That constant desire of the soul is the seeking for pleasure, and as mancannot reach it, he must content himself with touching wine with his lips withoutdrinking it.There is another desire--to know. That desire manifests itself in the child;he tries to understand; yet a man may read all his life, and at the end he will seehe knows nothing. An Arabian scholar said: \"I have read all my life; but I onlyunderstood when I closed my book.\" There is a tendency to say--\"You are right\"or \"You are wrong\", \"I believe\", \"I do not\"; it is just like the desire for pleasure--we try to find out the truth.Friends! earth is limited, and all that it contains is limited. Sometimes Iam asked what is my idea of God. It is just like asking what a table, or a chair is.All you can say is, \"Here it is.\" Can you express your first thoughts? or all that isthe6 first part of your nature? You cannot express it in words. How can God beexpressed in words? We can only recognise him. To explain God is to destroy Him;to analyse God is to 7 Him. This materialism of the word has torn Godto pieces by pulling Him down from a metaphysical point of view. The way inwhich the soul can accomplish its purpose is different: it is by meditation, by thegreat lessons given by the great teachers of humanity, by worship and devotion; asChrist has said: \"Seek the kingdom of God first, and all will come afterwards.\" Onestudies a long time without attaining the soul's purpose. Man is mistaken; he triesto find under his feet what he ought to look for above his head. By looking downon the earth we cannot see the moon.The third desire isto loveandto be loved, because the soul comes fromthe source of all love. God is, all love. It is said in the Bible, \"God is love.\" Hewants love, and gives love; but really speaking, His nature is that of giving. Yet itis reciprocity that keeps the flame alive; it raises the soul to a state where it cansee the truth. The secret is to be independent and master of love. And the masterof love is the one who does not care whether it is given in return or not. What isgiven, is given back a thousand times more; he always gives love. This is theprinciple that Christ taught when he said--\"Love your enemies.\" The sun shinesequally on fertile and desert lands; and so is the nature of man, in which God'snature is reflected. Of course, we, human beings, learn this lesson sometimes whenit is too late. But, if, at any moment, we can forgive somebody who has offendedus, we have really found God. This is what is wanted in the world. There is lovebetween two individuals when one says \"I love\", and the other is inclined to say \"I5 .

Two men, loving fromthe same source, make love complete; and it is only when we love somebody inGod that we can tolerate our enemies.The fourth desire of the soul is that for beau , and beauty comes fromharmony. Things are beautiful if they are harmonious; and it is a pity that whenman knows beauty he forgets to develop that beauty in himself. How many peoplecomplain about rudeness? We should try to produce in ourselves what we find tobe wanting in others. Every soul complains about something that is wanting inothers; but there is only a 8 soul which produces that beauty in one's life that iswanting in others. The real search after God is the contemplation of the wholebeauty. Imagine all the beauty of nature; has that all been created without science?Can art imitate it? If one turns to that source from which all beauty comes we maythen find the beauty that is wanting; the finer yeas one becomes the morecrudeness manifests itself; and it is natural that the more one progresses the moreone becomes sensible. One begins to see how inconsiderate people are, and tonotice that under those conditions one cannot progress. If a person depends on allthe beauty of the earth, he will not be able to find it, for even then he must looktowards the source of all beauty.The fifth desire is that forpeace. Everybody seeks for peace, and we seethat there is not one soul whose greatest desire is not for peace; and yet there aresuch great troubles in the world. And if there is lack of peace it shows that thereis something wrong10, externalt0 remedies do not suffice. We must begin withmaking peace in ourselves. If something we are thinking or doing, if our thoughtsor actions compromise that state of peace, then we are in an unnatural condition,and we cannot bring about peace among our friends; we must, therefore, seek thepeace of God.And these five desires bring us back to the word of God--\"Seek thekingdom of God first, and all else will come afterwards. \"8 .

In the first place Silence proves control of oneself, which means theruling of one's own domain. And it is the lack of ruling power when a person lackssilence. In everyday life a person says things which he ought not to say; andafterwards he reflects2. It is, of course, a lack of self-control that makes one saywhat he does not wish to say. Besides, there are many things secret, which onedoes not like to tell everybody. But, when one has no control, he tells them. Inmany circumstances it is under the influence of emotion that one says what heshould not say. Sometimes a person says \"Yes\" or \"No\", submitting to the will ofanother; at that moment he does not know what he says. Sometimes one says \"Yes\"or \"No\" to something he does not know, and people who are a little 3 can,in that way, turn a friend into an enemy, or an enemy into a friend. There aremany people in the world who are just like machines in human form; they can beturned that this way and that way; that shows, that, to be a real human being, onemust have power. Consideration is necessary at every moment of life; at one timesomething must be spoken--the next, not; one must know the proper time when tosay something, or not. There are moments when you can say something ten timesin vain; there are other moments when it is fruitful; one must judge of4 themoment.

The philosopher said--\"Come back in forty days\"; but the disciple did not understand his meaning. Afterforty days the mother came back with her son, and the philosopher told him thathe should be more considerate, and ought to think of all that his mother had donefor him. No doubt this made a great impression on the lad; for, from that day, herespected his mother. But the disciple asked the philosopher why he had told herto come back after forty days. His reply was that he had \"to reflect forty days, inorder to put it into the best words.\" How very few people think forty days abouta small thing like that! Very, very often they speak immediately.Why are these mournings, and divorces, and troubles in the world? Theyall show the lack of self-control and consideration, and the consequences can bereckoned by the past war. There are now less troubles; from a physical point ofview they seem to have diminished, but not from a moral point of view. As longas man does not consider, it is impossible for the world to become better. Forpeace at home, and order in the community, self-control and consideration arenecessary. There are three homes--the house, the nation, and the world; and thenatures of the three homes are the same. The same laws are applicable to thethree. There is a well-known story in the East, of a woman who went to a physiciansaying that she had troubles at home always. She said, \"Every day there is aquarrel, and I have now come to the conclusion that I must finish with my life\". Butthe physician, who was a great master of human nature, said--\"I shall give yousome sweets which you will keep every evening in your mouth, and you must notopen your mouth during that time.\" She followed his advice, and her husband,who was in a mood to disagree, did not get any reply. Therefore, after a little time,he ceased, and there was no fight. It never went further, and soon both thehusband and wife were very glad to see there were no more troubles. She wentback to the healer with a present, asking him to give her some more sweets. Buthe answered--\"It is not the sweets which have helped you--it is the principle. Yourhusband has no control of himself, but, if you have it, you give it.\" That shows that,if you are strong, you give others strength, but if you are weak you give othersweakness.The school of the Sufi has a method to strengthen oneself, to control thebody, the mind and its vibrations; and nothing is so precious as being the ruler ofone's own domain. Those who cannot control themselves are dependent uponothers and act as machines; but those having control are engineers.

What is known with certainty is the high esteem in which they were heldand the strict secrecy which attended them. The word means: silence; to beinitiated was \"to be made silent\". Access to the lesser mysteries was easy; tens ofthousands were initiated. The temples in which the rites were practised were underthe protection of the state. In them were enacted the lives of the gods in whosename the mysteries were celebrated, and great use was made of music. Themysteries were held to remove the fear of death and to give assurance of thesurvival of the departed. Those who had been initiated were believed to be happyafter death, while others led a dismal life hereafter, clinging to their graves.Documents:Gd.h.1 = a text in Sherifa Goodenough's handwriting, copied from a reporting of thelecture.

Mostly materialists have become morematerialist because religious people dragged them in their religion. Hisposition is such that he is blamed and attacked by religious people--themore he is attacked, the more he becomes stronger in his materialism. Butthere is no soul who has no religion. Some souls follow the religion ofmany, but some have a religion of their own. To some souls their religionis too sacred to show, they prefer be called materialist than show theirreligion. Therefore, who can be called a materialist, when every man hasa 4religious moral4 of his soul?1 .

Le but Soufi est de ramener a cet esprit religieux, quiest mort. Son but aussi est de reveler le secret8 cache par les formes, paroles etrites.Ceci ne veut pas dire que le Message Soufi ne donne pas a ceux qui en ont besoinune forme de religion; ni que le Message Soufi ne donne pas une direction dansles affaires morales et materielles de la vie.Ce qui est particulier au Message Soufi, c'est qu'il ne se limite pas par des formesspeciales, ni dogmes.La methode du travail Soufi dans le champ religieux, enseigne aux Boudhistesselon enseignement de Boudha; aux Musulmans, selon les paroles du Coran; auxChretiens avec les paroles du Christ.

It is progress towards one's self, plainly speaking, within oneself, andno new experience does one meet with on the way; but one finds all that is knownand has been forgotten by one's soul. And in this pursuit in the beginning onedoes not feel one is progressing, for one finds nothing new.Many Eastern ideas seem severe in the Western mind. Western natureis self-assertive and demanding.

The nature of this disease is such that the more it is treated,the worse it becomes. It is like trying to ease an eruption on the body byscratching. It may be relieved for the moment, but in reality the very act ofscratching, on the contrary, must increase the irritation.If an ulcer on some part of the body is only treated outwardly the samemust break out in some other part; and so it is that every superficial attempt madefor the betterment of the world cannot bring about a lasting result.There is but one remedy for the world's complaint of the present day, andthat is the awakening of the divine consciousness in humanity which is thewatchword of the Sufi Message. We, the members of the Sufi Order3, musttherefore consider it our duty and privilege to contribute our devoted services inthe blessed work of the world-relief; and spare no time nor effort in performingour sacred task, at the same time bearing in mind that life is an opportunity.Yours in the Infinite,Inayat Khan.Document: \"Sufism\", March 1922, \"a quarterly magazine for seekers afterTruth,\" edited by MissS .E .M.

Faith is the purpose of the whole creation. It is thesecret of the attainment, to2 which the soul is striving constantly. It is thereforethat in the Bible from the beginning to the end the word faith has beenemphasised. But not only the Bible, also3 the Koran 3 is full of the word faith. TheProphet called his disciples\"mounir\"4(?),the faithful. But5 Hinduism, the religionwhich is known to the world6and proved6 to be a religion of reason and science,even6 faith is the centre? theme 8of that religion8. Somebody who was opposed toidol-worship asked a Brahman whether the god of stone will ever answer hisprayer. The Brahman said in answer that9 if my faith is right, even through thisidol of rock God will answer, but if your faith is not right, the God in Heaven willnot answer. There are six words which are related to faith: hope, belief, trust,confidence, realisation, conviction. These six words are related to the word faith,yet faith stands aloof by itself. No other word can explain what faith means. Veryoften people misuse the two words faith and belief, using the one for the other.Yes, belief explains faith, but the force the word faith has, belief has not got10. Foran11 instance, a person says, \"Yes, I believe so,\" which means: \"It may be so.\" Ibelieve means that9 I am not sure, but I think by any12 reason that it will be so.But when one says, \"I have a13 faith in that person, in that particular thing,\" itmeans much more than that. Now the idea is that man uses this word faith,Document: Sr. = a carefully handwritten copy, with some corrections and editing, written in inkby Sirdar van Tuyll, apparently copied from his own or someone else'sunknown reporting; all corrections in the original are included in the basic text.Later, Sherifa Goodenough did further editing on the same manuscript indifferent ink; all of these changes are indicated in the notes by the word \"later\".Notes:1 . \"the\" later crossed out2. \"to\" later changed to \"toward\"3.

Plainly speaking,to God alone faith is due. Only it is difficult for everybody to have some idea ofGod and it is difficult to have experience faith in God. Therefore, all things directedto God, such as admiration, respect, faith, we learn by directing the same tomankind first. Our dealings with our fellowmen is16a rehearsal, the performanceof which is to God. We learn to admire beauty on the earth; we do not see beautyin Heaven. We learn to respect someone on the earth; we do not know the worshipof God to begin with. That shows that all virtue that comes from our heart we firstdirect in the world, and as it rises, we direct it towards God. A person with norespect for his fellowman 17can not have r+e17 worship18-attitude for19 God. Aperson who cannot trust his fellowman, cannot have faith in God. Now why I said:faith is due to God alone20. For the very reason of the true meaning of faith. Theword faith, briefly explained, means belief in something to which even our reasoncannot help, belief in something that our perception cannot touch, belief insomething that our thought or imagination cannot fully make21, a horizon that canbe known by faith and to the faithful alone. Faith is 22the evidence of itself 22. Ifthel reason has helped, it is belief. When experience has helped, then it issomething limited, touchable. Something which is beyond perception, abovelimitation, that alone can be reached by faith. That is God. In order to explaint4âºet this idea, very often a story is used23 in India. A religious man was preachingbefore thel peasants, telling them the power of a sacred word. He said that9 if onecan repeat this word with faith, one can walk on the water. When he was giving hisnext sermon, and old peasant said, 24I could that hem not understand hisyour complete idea, but ?? ?? I have been benefitted by one thought. It # hasbenefitted him me immensely.24 I would consider myself most honoured if you willaccept my invitation to lunch with me.\" The preacher very kindly accepted. Theystarted to go. While travelling there came a little stream which they had to crossand the priest asked if there was a boat. The peasant said, \"I thought you wereready to walk on the water; because I heard your preaching, I said the word andwent over the water.

If you asked me the secret of success, of goodness, ofspiritual progress, it is faith. Man, however capable in business, in politics, inindustry, in any direction of mind, without this tendency of faith he32 can neversucceed in life. No great enterprises, whether the33chief of33 earthly object or34 attainment of heavenly object, is ever attained without faith. The idea is this:35the Creator Himself, the Spirit that continually works in Himself, is faith.Therefore, faith and trust is what He asks of those He has created. No doubt thisbeautiful virtue of every soul is very often tested in daily life. If a person lackspatience, wisdom, he is likely to lose his faith. It is not really lost, it becomescovered under the clouds of ignorance, caused by disappointment in the life of theworld. It wants a very brave heart, which can stand all the disappointments thisworld can give, to keep the 36work given36 and to keep on till at37 the end he iscrowned with success. In the first place man's own weakness is his own enemy.This first of all tries to take away man's faith, And next one's surroundings, one'sdealings with one's dear ones, one's friends and enemies, from all sides come trialsto test one's faith. And the conditions of life, the ever-changing conditions, therisings and the falls, all work against the development of this virtue. Only thecourageous one, who sticks to this virtue at the cost of a great deal of patience andperseverance, even at38 loss of many things, many sacrifices in life, he39 cansucceed. The Prophet says that every child is born with faith, it is afterwards he ischanged in life.The teaching of the Sufi Message is not specially a new one, it is the same oldwisdom, the old wine which always existed and will ever remain. The Sufi Messagedoes not pretend to give to a person faith who has not got that tendency in hisheart. It only answers the demand of the' faith, helping the' faith to arrive at itsnatural destiny. For instance, the method that 34Sufi takes in that direction is tomake a person see for himself, if he can stand to40 the best to of keeping his faith.The relation of betweenmurshidandmureed, guruandchela,the teacher and the26. \"made\" and \"learn\" later crossed out, \"taught\" put in place of \"made\"27. \"that\" added later28. \"deepest\" later replaced by \"depth\"29. \"it that is\" inserted later30. \"phenomena\" changed to \"phenomenon\"31.

The soul aftercoming upon earth opens its eyes in childhood, and every impression it receives isan impression of love, kindness, tenderness, all so to speak building a foundationfor the life the child has to experience. When the parents do not consider theimportance of that time, that opportunity is lost. The soul grows old and learnsto understand, that5 the first moment6 when the soul is looking, seeking, andgathering impressions of beauty, goodness and truth, that first opportunity is lost.Often the parents think that childhood is a time for the child to play; others thinkthe child must have its own way of looking at things in life, but in both cases oftena great mistake has been made. In the first place the childc an play, and the playcan be useful7, and that same play could be made useful if the parents understoodthe psychology of life, and made play for the child an education.

Every youth wishes to become good;tries to understand what is best, and at10 that stage, when the youth has no cares,worries or responsibilities, but is busy with amusements and pastimes, is the mostvaluable opportunity for the soul. Every human being in the world must feelresponsible for the children of humanity, and11 if one could only think of the youthof the different nations to-day after the war, what effect it has made on the health,mentality and development of the children. For lack of understanding many beginto take a narrow view of life. It is easier for the soul in youth till hardened by 12theforce of12 disappointments; he has been made bitter, and once bitter he becomesvery difficult to melt13.

This is thetime for exploring into the science, into the philosophy that he has gone through,that he may be more useful to others.Then comes the still greater time of responsibility when man can give tothe world the things he has learnt from his experience, from his experiments, hisdisappointments, his failures, his successes.

One comes toknow comfort and ease in life, one learns how one can make good use of money,and how one can waste and abuse it. Poverty teaches a still greater lesson; hardtimes come, and then true human nature makes itself manifest, one learns what thelove of relations and friends can be; one knows what helplessness and lonelinessmean; so poverty and riches are great opportunities in life. They do not come invain if one realises that they come to make man understand life better; there is aHindustani saying by 14: the world is not set before you as a stageto amuse yourself; it is a school in which to learn your lessons\". There aremoments when a person finds himself occupying an important post perhaps, orsome high rank in society; times when persecutions are many and he fords himselfblessing each situation because each has its lesson.

He who is ready to learn from the experience ofothers, is helped more because he will have 14. It is a great work todevelop in oneself that attitude of pupilship, of discipleship, and when the attitudeof the disciple is developed, then the teacher is there. Some are thinking of theteacher in the past, others are looking for one to come in the future; but theTeacher who has said, \"I am Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last\", cannot beabsent from the world. If one becomes a pupil, the Teacher is never absent. Thepresence of the spirit of pupilship opens the vision to recognise the Teacher.There are many teachers; the innocent child, the loving mother, the kind father, theinspiring friend; all are different aspects, different opportunities given in life. Themore one thinks of this the more one realises the value of every experience andevery single moment in life.But the most important thing, the purpose of every soul is that spiritualattainment towards which all the religions of the world are striving, and thoughsome think perhaps 15if I do not attain in this life, in the life to come I shallattain15, and there are others who think there is nothing to be attained, but their16soul is never satisfied; the constant cry of the soul for an answer from somewhere,14.

Guided by Beauty, led by Light, he may use theopportunities of life for whatever his soul for the moment longs; but he must watchfor the moment when all these things become as toys before a grown person; thenthe colour fades, and the beauty no longer charms. Until the soul arrives at thispitch of realisation, he must not force himself to seek something he does not knowhow to use; to go in that path is no virtue. What is Virtue? Virtue is what the soulseeks, for the soul is Virtue, and seeks Virtue. It is only a matter of understandingwhat it is that my soul is seeking. Man, however wicked, always expects from hisfellow man goodness and kindness. Does this not show that in the wicked man thesurface only is wicked; he himself is good, for he is seeking good, only he does notunderstand how to give good to others. Think what an opportunity life is, to giveto our fellow man goodness, love, justice, kindness, all that one's soul longs to getfrom others; then to give to othersis18 toreciprocity adding to their goodness andkindness.It is not only the work of the soul to come to the realisation of spiritualattainment; for if it were so, it would not have been created in matter. Matter hasa mission; for only through matter does spirit attain to its highest realisation, andwhile the soul is experiencing life through the material body is the time. Once thesoul has departed, then the vehicle, is the, so to speak, telescope through which thesoul must experience life to its satisfaction, remains unfinished19.

In thefirst place there is no form or figure which man has ever drawn or painted, whichdoes not exist in nature. Man's imagination cannot reach beyond what he has seenor known, or has heard of. For instance, when he thinks of an angel, he cannotpicture an angel any different from what he is accustomed to see,37 the form of achild, the form of a woman, the form of a man. 38But perhaps he38 attaches thewings of the birds which he has seen already. Even in his dream he cannot dreamwhat he has not seen, and this very fact shows the limitation of man who calls hisArt an improvement on Nature. It is not an improvement on Nature, it is a mixtureof Nature. What he learns from the forms and colours he mixes and producessomething different. Man has not found out the numerous colours which exist inNature, repeated by different flowers and leaves, and seen in different shades oflight. Man has not produced anything new, except what he has got from Nature,and out of Nature he has made his harmonies, and therefore it is the pheno-mena39 of nature; 40that, and40 also his love of beauty which induces him toperfect something which he imagines--it is that tendency to perfection which is Art.And if one could41 look upon Art in that light, Art will become a religion becauseit gives an inherited faculty that man gets from the Divine Spirit which he expressesin his Art, whatever 42be his Art42 - Painting, Drawing43, Music, Poetry,Sculpture, 44 Architecture. Not only 45things which we call the different aspects ofArt, but in all walks of life man can use that Divine inherited faculty which iscalled Art. In dressing, in managing the house, in doing the work at the office, inthe shop, in all things that man does, he can express Art. It is not necessary thathe must46 be an Artist 47, that he must practise some Art47; Art is an expression32. S. : \"and\" instead of \"when\"33.

Hamsais a bird in the Indian legend. Thereare two different tendencies which are known as two different aspects of humannature. One is called50, the other is 51. The bird,Hamsa,is saidto drink milk and leave the water. It absorbs the essence but leaves out thewater,5253is the pig, and the tendency of the pig is to sitanywhere, sleep anywhere, o anywhere, regardless of whatever place it is; 54 andthat is the artistic tendency.49 '5 The tendency of the Artist in life is to take beautyin all its forms. And among all different Arts the greatest Art is the Art ofpersonality. He is the greatest Artist, and the natural artist, who has developed Artin his personality. All that he sees beautiful in human nature, in form andmovement, in manner, attracts him, and he expresses it. Really speaking goodnessis natural to man. Man is born with goodness. It is afterwards that he partakes55and covers that inherited goodness which is within his soul. Therefore, by thisartistic tendency56of gathering56all that one sees of good and beautiful, one bothcollects beauty and expresses it. But when a person 57partakes and57 collects forhimself all that is devoid of beauty,58everything which is worth criticising,58 it isjust like gathering and collecting the faults of human nature, and he loses thepossibility of expressing the Art of Life. Really speaking, in Art God Himself worksthrough man, finishing His ideal of beauty. There are two ways of creating bywhich He makes His Creation. One way is direct, which is done from nature, andthe other is through Art.Art becomes religion as soon as one realises the inspiring spirit which ishidden in man's form and heart, and until he has risen to this stage ofdevelopment, he does not really know the Divinity of Art. When the artist thinks,\"this picture is made by me; this is my imagination\", when he has composed a songbut59 thinks, \"I have composed it\", he has not yet risen to the perfection of Art.The perfection of Art is that which makes the Artist wonder, \"Is it I? Is it mylimited self who is able to make this?\" As soon as perfection expresses itself theartist begins to wonder60, \"No, it is not myself; there must be something behind it48.

The greater his Art becomes,the more he feels this, \"it is not I\", and it is that which engages him in the searchfor that spirit, that Divine spirit which has inspired him with the Art. There aremany who call themselves poets, many who call themselves painters, many whothink themselves to be musicians, but a few musicians alone can work61, only a fewpoets 62speak those words which make62 the souls of men respond. And what isit63? Where has it come from? Why cannot man's brain produce it? Why cannotevery man produce music? Why must there be rare artists like these? And theanswer is, that as long as new life is not produced in the Art, the Art is not yetborn, and that Art is not living. The living Art must give Life, and a living Artmakes an Artist live. The charm of the Art moves the Artist to ecstasy, and theartist forgets himself in the Art, and in that moment the Art is perfected. Myself,being specially interested in this question, I came in contact with great souls,artists, poets, writers, thinkers and painters, not only in their Art, but also in theirways64, and this experience convinced me that the greatness of Art is not only seenin their65 Art, but that you can see it in their65 personality. And that shows thatfirst the soul of the Artist becomes an Art, and then it produces a66 spirit of Art67from which the living artist produces,67 andthey are absorbed in their Art andthey do not know where the Art is 68 They69 are surrounded by an atmosphere ofbeauty. They see nothing but beauty in all beings. Their kindness, their forgiveness,their tenderness, the gentleness in their hearts, their interest in the affairs ofeveryone, 70and besides that70 their simplicity, their child-like innocence, this allshows that Art is not an ordinary thing. Art is religion if the Artist understands it.And it is not necessary that every individual must know some Art. What isnecessary is this; that every individual must find out the artistic faculty in himselfand try to express that artistic faculty in all things he does in life. What seemslacking today in humanity? The Art of Life, the tendency of reciprocity of Love andof kindness, that desire for harmony which comes from balance, that model offriendship which every religion has come to teach us, and that tendency to \"giveand take\" beauty, the only gracious thing, 71beauty in all its forms, beauty in one'swords, in one's manner, in one's port, in one's feeling to one another71. Very oftenman makes a mistake in understanding the Art of personality - what 72they ca1172in the ordinary sense of the word, politeness. Man learns politeness for61.

That is not true Art. 73That for a painter73 is notArt, unless life is produced in his painting, and so every beautiful manner is notreally beautiful unless the life is produced in it, and that life is sincerity. Politeness,without sincerity is a dead art, 74 the talk of brotherhood or unity without love.What, today, we need, is actual practice which is a thousand times more powerfulthan any words. If we think of the prejudice that today exists among humanity75,race against race, nation against nation, community against community, the follo-wers of one religion looking upon the followers of another religion as heathen, thisall shows that there is no Art there. Art is beauty, Art is harmony, Art is balance,Art is life, and when Art has gone then life becomes devoid of beauty and that iswhat we have seen. Allthe lack of beauty that we find in the world today, inhumanity, is a lack of Art. But when one goes further one finds that even religion,the message that the great prophets and Seers have brought to the world, what wasit? Was it the truth? If we say it was the Truth, this Truth cannot be spoken. Thereare some things which cannot be put into words, and wanting to put the Truth intowords is just like wanting to put the ocean in a bottle. And therefore, what thegreat Teachers gave to the world was a presentation of the Truth to some little ex-_tent in the form of Art. A man has always worshipped beauty, and man has seenhis ideal in the religion of beauty, and therefore, when a message was given, whena name76 was shown to man, it was shown in the form of Art. 77The picture ofthe goddess of Knowledge in Hindu Mythology 78. The goddess sat witha Vina, surrounded with beauty with the peacock to complete the picture. It allshows beauty, and the religion and message of God has been the Divine Art, andby the Divine Art, truth was expressed that man may first become attracted to thebeauty, and by attraction to the beauty he may ponder upon it, 79that he may beelevated to understand for himself the truth which is hidden in the Art. Not onlyreligion, even mysticism, which is the inner kernel, and which Sufism represents,is an Art, an80Art of unfolding a soul, an8o* Art of expressing the divine virtuewhich is hidden in the heart of man. It is the teaching81 to understand the Art oflife, one's relation to one's fellowman, one's duty to one's neighbour, one's relationto God, and the way to attain82 that83one and only object which every soul thatcomes on earth seeks after, and cannot be happy unless it is attained.73.

For, on consideration of this subject, onefords that one is always asleep and always wakeful. The difference is that of theparticular sphere of which man is conscious when he is awake; in one sphere hethinks \"I am awake,\" and when that sphere is not before his consciousness he thinks\"I am asleep\". Therefore, sleep and the wakeful state are nothing but the turningof the consciousness from one side to the other, from one sphere to the othersphere, in other words from one plane to another; and, therefore, according to themystical idea, man is never asleep. Although the soul is much higher than thephysical body, it is the character and nature of the soul which the physical bodyexpresses.When a man is looking on one side he is unconscious of the other. Thisshows that the faculty of seeing and being conscious of what one sees, can engageitself fully with one thing at a time only. A conception of musical sound which inthe East has been held for a long time, and which is to-day recognized by thescientists in the West, is that man's ears can hear fully one sound at a time, nottwo or three. This shows that every sense is capable of looking on one side onlyand, therefore, the other side is absent from the consciousness, and in order to seea particular side one has to turn one's face; in other words, one has to expose one'sfaculty of seeing to that side. This is not only the nature of the body, but also thenature of the mind. The mind cannot think of two things at the same time.Another thing is, that when mind is at work, and when mind is full y absorbed ina certain thought, a certain imagination, the outer senses may be opened2, but theyare not fully at work.

His eyes are open, but he does not see, and if it happens that he sees at thetime he is thinking, then it is just like a film of the moving pictures. It is so manydifferent pictures which come one after the other, and so it seems that they arecontinuous. When mind stops, the eyes work, and when the eyes work the mindstops; and in the end it seems to make one picture, but it is a separate action ofthe mind and senses. Besides that the wakeful state of every individual is differentand peculiar to himself, 3as the sleep of every individual is different and peculiarto himself3. There is one person who is what is called fast asleep, i.e., in deepsleep. There is another person who says: \"I was half asleep.\" Another personknows what is going on4 about him, and yet is asleep. This shows that the extentof sleep is different in every experience. And no one can make a division of thisextent of sleep.Also the wakeful state of every individual is different. Many people maybe sitting in the room, but one is more conscious of what is going on in that roomthan another. Five people may be hearing music, and each will give hisconsciousness to what he hears differently. And, therefore, each one will enjoy andwill receive the effect of the music differently, and this shows that the body or mindare vehicles or instruments through which the soul experiences life5, and inexplaining what is soul, I should say that part of our being which is capable ofbeing conscious by the means of mind and body. Therefore to the mystic, it is thatpart of one's6 being which 7witnesses life through vehicles such as the mind andbody which is the real being. And it is that part of his being which7 he callshimself or his soul. In the terms of the Sufis it is called Ruh, and in the Sanscritand Vedantic terminology it is calledAtma8, the real being of man. By experiencein life, with the help of the mind and body, thisAtman,or Soul, becomes deluded,and that delusion is that it loses consciousness of its pure self; as it is natural thatwhen a person is poorly dressed he thinks he is poor, he never thinks his dress ispoor. When he is moving in a beautiful palace he is a big man. He does notthinks it is the palaces which10 are big instead of himself. This shows it is notwhat a man is, but what hebelieveshe is, that he is related to. The soul is neverill, but when it is conscious of the illness of the body, man says, \"I am ill.\" It is justlike a person's garment being torn. He thinks, \"I am torn,\" instead of the garment.And the reason is that he cannot point out to his own consciousness his own truebeing; as the eyes cannot see themselves, but can see the whole world, so the soulcannot see itself except when it is conscious of all which is reflected in it. Neitheris the soul poor nor is it rich, it is never sorrowful nor joyous. There arereflections which fall into it. And as it cannot realise itself it considers itself that3.

Heis, at every moment, what he is conscious of. In cheerful surroundings he ispleased. In miserable surroundings he is sad. There is nothing of sorrow or joywhich can make an everlasting impression on the soul, because the nature of thesoul is like a mirror, and all that stands before the mirror is reflected in it, butnothing can stay in the mirror. 11 No reflection can remain in the mirror11. Whenthe person who was the subject which was before the mirror is removed, then themirror is as clear as ever; and so it is with the soul.For convenience the mystics have divided into five different phases thatwhich consciousness experiences; and distinguished them as one different from theother. The particular phase of which the consciousness is most familiar is thewakeful state in which the soul experiences through mind and body. This state inthe Sufic term is calledNasool12,and in Vedantic terms is calledJagrat. As thesoul considers what it experiences through these senses with the help of the mindthere are many souls who are not ready to believe in the soul or in the Hereafteror in God, for the reason that the soul is acquainted only with one sphere, and thatis the sphere which it experiences with the help of the body and mind. Anintellectual person also develops consciousness of another sphere which is calledMalakootin Sufic terminology andSwapnain terms of Vedanta. This state isexperienced in two ways. When a person is absorbed in a thought, and is notaware of his surroundings, all he knows at that moment is the imagination in whichhe is absorbed. It is that state which is calledMalakoot,which is not dependentupon the body for its joy or its experiences of sorrow. A person who canexperience a joy and sorrow by raising his consciousness to that plane can makehis heaven in himself. The great poets, thinkers, writers, who have lived throughdifficulties, through poverty, through such conditions that people did notunderstand them, opposed them and even despised them, have lived a most happylife, for the reason that they had been able to raise themselves to that planewhen13 they could enjoy all the beauty, comfort and joy that the ordinary man canonly enjoy if it is given to him on the physical plane. And when the key of thisplane has come into the hand of man, he is then the master of his future life. AsOmar Khayyam says in hisRubaiyat,that Heaven is the vision of fulfilled desireand Hell the shadow of a soul on fire. In this he shows that when theconsciousness has heaven reflected in it, then man is in heaven; and when man isconscious of torture, and pain, and suffering, he is in the place of suffering. Manmakes his heaven or his hell for himself. How many in this world you will findwho keep their illness by thinking about it all the time by being conscious of it; andone sees many who might become well after having suffered a pain for some years,but14 the consciousness of the pain is held by them not as something new, but as11.

Nothing belongs to man unless he iswilling to hold it. But when one becomes accustomed to holding a certain reflectionnot knowing the nature of it, in time that reflection becomes his master, and hebecomes a slave to15 that reflection. And so it is with the worry and anxiety andsorrows which people have on their mind. Many say \"I cannot forget,\" becausethey imagine it. It does not mean that that person cannot forget but that he isholding something which he does not wish to throw away. There are many peoplewho say \"I cannot forget it,\" but if only they knew it is not that any other personis holding something before them, it is they themselves who hold it. Somememory, something disagreeable, something sorrowful, some severe pain, anxiety,worry, all these things man holds in his own hands and they are reflected in hisconsciousness. His soul, by nature, is above all this. This is an illusion. Its placeis beneath the soul, not above, unless man, with his own hands, raises it and looksat it. When we consider the psychology of failure and of success, failure followsfailure. Any why is it? Because the consciousness reflecting success is full ofsuccess, and the activity which goes out from the consciousness is creatingproductive activity, and if the consciousness has success before its view, then thesame reflection will work and bring success, whereas if the consciousness isimpressed with failure, then failure will work constantly, bringing failure afterfailure. Very often pessimistic people speak against their own desire. They wantto undertake some work, and they say \"I will do this, but I don't think I shallsucceed in it.\" They thus have hindered themselves in their path. Man does notknow that every thought makes an impression on the consciousness and16 therhythm with which the consciousness is working. According to the rhythm, thatreflection will come true and happen, and man proves17 his own enemy by hisignorance of these things. The mistake of one moment's impulse creates a kindof hindrance in the path of that person through all his life. But this state ofconsciousness is also experienced in the dream; for the dream is the reaction ofman's experiences in his wakeful state. The most wonderful thing which one canstudy in the dream is that the dream has a language, and a true knowledge ofdream experiences teaches one that every individual has a separate language of hisdream peculiar to his own nature. The dream of the poet, the dream of the manwho works with his hands, the dream of the king, the dream of the poor man, allare different. There are many differences and one cannot give the sameinterpretation to every person for his dream. You must first know who hasdreamed it. It is not the dream which has its interpretation, it is the person towhom 18the dream came18 that one must know, and the interpretation is accordingto his state of evolution, to his occupation, to his ambitions and desires, to his15.

Hq.tp. : \"came the dream\""},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"138present, his past and his future, and to his spiritual aspirations. Thus the languageof dreams differs, but there is one hint which may be given, and that is that in thewakeful state man is open to outward impressions. For instance, there aremoments when the mind is receptive, there are moments when the mind isexpressive. And during such moments, when the mind is receptive, everyimpression 19which comes19 forth, sent intentionally or without intention from anyperson, becomes reflected in the consciousness. Very often one fords oneselfdepressed and one cannot find a reason, and then one finds oneself in a mirthfulattitude and one cannot find the reason. As soon as a person has a certain feelinghe at once looks for a reason, and reason is ready to answer him, rightly orwrongly. As soon as a person thinks, \"What makes me laugh?\" there is somethingwhich his reason offers as the reason why he laughed. Really speaking thatimpression came from someone else. What he thinks is the reason is2O different,and so very often in the dream it happens that the reasoning faculty answers to thedemands of the enquiring mind and frames and shapes the thoughts andimaginations which are going on so freely when the will power is not controllingthe mind in sleep; it is producing at that time just like an actor on the stage, free,without control of the will, and therefore if it happens that at a certain moment,when the mind is in a receptive condition, it receives the impressions coming fromother persons, from those who are friends, or from those who are enemies, allthose who think of the dreamer, or with whom he is connected in any way. Thosewho are spiritually inclined, or who are connected with souls who have passedaway, also feel the impressions reflected upon their souls, sometimes as guidinginfluences, sometimes as warnings, sometimes as instructions. They alsoexperience what are known as21 initiations, and sometimes have deluding,confusing experiences, but it all takes place on that particular plane where theconsciousness is experiencing life independently of the physical body and of thesenses.The third experience which the consciousness has is called in Sufic termsJabroot,and in Sanscrit and Vedantic termsSushupti.In this state, asconsciousness is not accustomed to this22 world very much, it does not bring itsexperiences to the world, except that it brings a feeling of joy, of renewed strength,or health, and all one can say after this experience is, \"I have had a very goodsleep, and feel very much better for that.\" Really speaking, the cause is that theconsciousness was freed from pain and worry, and any activity, or any limitationof life, and even prisoners can enjoy the blessing of this state when they are fastasleep; they do not know whether they are in a palace or in23 prison. They reachthe experiences of that plane which is better than a palace. Man does not realise19. Sk.tp.: \"coming\" instead of \"which comes\"20. Sk.c . : \"something\" added21.

He cannot sleep; then he begins to think there is nothing hewould not give to be able to sleep soundly. That shows that it is not only the sleepwhich he needs, but a blessing behind it. It is something which the soul hastouched which is much higher and deeper, for this experience is greater than onecan imagine. In this, consciousness touches a sphere from whence it cannot get animpression of any name or form. The impression itgetsis a feeling, a feeling ofillumination, of life, of joy25, and what message26 does it give? It gives amessage26 of God which comes directly to every soul. And what is this message26?God says to the soul, 27\"I am within you27,281am with you28. I am your ownBeing, and I am above all limitations, and I am Life, and you are more safe, moreliving, and more happy, and more peaceful in this knowledge than in anything elsein the world.\" Besides these three experiences there comes a fourth experience tothose29 who search after it. Why does it not come to everybody? It is not that itdoes not come to everybody, but everybody cannot catch it. It comes and slipsaway from a man, and he does not know when it came and when it went. In thelife of every man there is a moment during the wakeful state, a moment when herises above all limitations of life, but it so swiftly comes and goes, in the twinklingof an eye, that one cannot catch it, one does not know it. It is just like a birdwhich came and flew away, and you only heard the flutter of his3O wings. Butthose who wish to catch this bird, those who wish to see where this bird goes, andwhen 31 does it31 come, and when 31 does it31 go, they look out for it and they sitto wait and watch for the moment when it comes, and that watching is calledmeditation. Meditation does not mean closing the eyes and sitting; anyone canclose his eyes and sit, but he may sit for hours, or he may sit all his life and notknow what came and what went. It is looking out for what comes, and not onlylooking out for it, but preparing oneself by making one's senses keen, by makingone's body and mind a location for the vibrations, that when then bird makes thevibration the feeling is that it has come, and it is that which is32 expressed in theChristian symbology of the dove. In other words, it is the moment of that blisswhich approaches one's consciousness rapidly, that one, so to speak, touches thedepth33 of the whole life, reaches above the sphere of action and all that, evenabove the sphere of feeling, but now you will say, \"What does consciousness receivefrom it?\" It receives a kind of illumination which is like a torch lighting anotherlight; this inner life, touching the consciousness, produces a sort of illumination24.

It is just like touching the Presence ofGod, when one's consciousness has become so light and so liberated, and free, asto raise itself and dive, and touch the depth of one's being. That is the secret ofall Mysticism and Religion and Philosophy. And the process of this experience islike the process of alchemy, which is not given freely, except to those who areready, and who feel there is some truth in it. It takes time for a person to becomefamiliar with things of this nature, even for him to think there is some truth inthem and that it is not only talk and imagination, and one who has felt the truthof the mystical state may question if it is worthwhile to go on this quest, but if hedoes so he must take the guidance of someone who has knowledge of this path, inwhom he can put his trust and confidence. But it must be understood that thePath of Discipleship, which in mystical words is known as the Path of Initiation, isnot such that the Teacher gives to his pupil some knowledge, tells him somethingnew which he has not heard, or shows him some wonder; and if he does he is notthe35true Teacher. Man is his own teacher, in him is the secret of his being. TheTeacher's word is only to help him find himself. Nothing you can learn in words,nothing that can be explained in language, nothing can be pointed out with afinger, is Truth. If a man is sure of himself, he can go further, but when he isconfused in himself, he cannot go further, and no Teacher can help him.Therefore, although in this path the Teacher is necessary, and his help is valuable,self-help is the principal thing, and one who is ready to realise his own nature,and to learn from himself, it is he who is the true Initiate, and it is from thatInitiation that he will go forward step by step, and will find the realisation andconviction that he seeks, and all that comes to him throughout36 his life will butdeepen that realisation of Truth.34.

And so is the wakeful state which in reality is never absentunless to a part of our being. What we call night and day are distinctions that wefind in absence and presence of the sun. The world has always the day -- theworld is always exposed to the sun and we who are miniatures of the world arealways wakeful but part in consequence of a certain aspect of life; that part is onekind of wakeful, to another kind of wakeful not accustomed to, so man calls it thestate of sleep and the wakeful state, nothing but an experience of consciousness inone plane of life, the physical plane of life, man thinks I am awake. When theconsciousness arises above this plane and has no experience of the same nature orcharacter, it feels a blank. And of that blankness or mist the consciousness bringsno intelligible experience, and so man thinks he was asleep. In reality life iswakeful in all its forms, even vegetables, fruits, flowers respond to the love of manand respond to the atmosphere, and by studying the nature of birds and beasts, petcats and dogs, one finds they are conscious of conditions even more than membersof family; their warnings of nature express feeling of pleasure or pain, unrest,whatever the family feels. This shows that life is awake in all its forms and themore keenly one studies life and nature, the more one sees that every aspect ofnature is life, and though not compared with our life, there is no such thing as alifeless object, all things are living, and this brings the reality that life is one2 in all forms, animal, vegetable, mineral state, but it is a kind of gradualawakening through different forms of consciousness.

Man knows himself to be a body,the peat man in rags: \"I am poor,\" but the rags are poor, not the man; but manattributes to himself what he sees outside, palace etc., and cause of this is that thehuman heart is a mirror and whatever is reflected in mirror,man thinks \"I am this\",poverty, poor--etc., illness--etc., health--etc.--Whatever man holds in his mind isreflected in his heart but does not stay in heart as the reflection in mirror notengraved in mirror. So all conditions that man feels and attributes to himself aredelusions. When removed mind is clear. According to mystics soul is calledatman,which means immortal essence of God, being of God, life itself, intelligenceitself, love itself, and is above all stains of sin or virtue, etc. All stand beneath it -every impression soul gets, it holds, but it the impression does not belong to it.By nature soul is beyond the joy or sorrow of this mortal world, but manexperiences life through organs of senses, for an instance the five senses, sight etc.Beyond this man experiences life by five different faculties of mind: reason,memory, retention of thought, creation of thought and the ego. In Vedantic fivefaculties called - - - - - - - - - - - - - -. And as these are different senses, throughthese senses man experiences the variety of life. And so when consciousness arisesabove these faculties and senses, he begins to feel lost, like a person who has beenin the light, goes into room where there is darkness; the room is full of objects, hecannot see, is in mist; not that he is not capable of seeing, but because gone fromlight into mist, his eyes are not able to see room clearly. So experience of sleepnot realised by everyone. Two distinct stages of the experience of consciousnessin sleep: 1. What Vedanta calls. .. 3, dream, it is a most wonderful stage, full ofmystery if one could study and understand not only the mechanical working ofimpressions one has gathered in wakeful state, but it is kind of symbolic productionof past, present and future. So a glimpse of scheme of nature working aroundpreparation action becoming manifest in the day often in a contrary formbut sometimes similar. Like law of harmony in music different forms of harmony.And so it is not always that it is waiting for future, but one who by intuition andstudy can understand, he has a great deal to learn.

For that one, deep thought is a confusion,and as a person evolves through life according to state of evolution his dreamsbecome more and more subtle. Three movements of dreams. Three laws ofharmony. First law is: dream has similar effect next day or few days after. If onehas seen fruit or flower, etc., he will have in near future joy, happiness or pleasure.If dream of fear, worry, sorrow, warning of some sadness coming. Another law:contrary effect of dream: in the dream one has seen great happiness, fulfillment,satisfaction, and in wakeful state all gone--one experiences here contrary to whatone dreams. Third law is: that dream tells exactly what is going to happen, givesthe same picture, and so those spiritually advanced dreams become so realistic thatoften dream at night is outline of their everyday occupation. Of course, some havea confusing dream, broken impressions, you cannot make it clear like with differentmoving picture films cut and put together, nothing is clear. This outcome of acondition of mind when man's mind confused and has lost tranquility, then hisexperience of dream confused because nature of heart like pool of water. Whenwater still and pure every image becomes reflected and becomes clear, but whenwater is disturbed, then reflection not clear--and it is a condition of mind. Personabsorbed in thoughts of fear and confusion, falsehood, deceit, mind disturbed andso reflections are not clear. So purity of heart is the 4 of religion. Butanother stage of sleep, called in Sanscrit 5, which is when man fast asleep, nodream disturbs--that is time when consciousness touches higher step of being. Oneexperiences the natural vibrations of one's soul when nearer to God. There oneexperiences love, peace, rest, calm, beauty and happiness, but when awake, as thesethings are only vibrations and feelings, one cannot point out, because in that stateno form, only a fine feeling. So when person has had a good sleep, he is fresh,invigorated; if he was angry,cross, disturbed, all gone, his expression is innocentafter a good sleep, because all the earthly experiences give restless fear and terrorand disturbance in mind, they sink down like dust sinks into the water. So whenman awakes he feels lighter, all earthly, mundane gone down, he becomes free.But as it is usual experience one does not think much of it. Rumi, great poet ofPersia, explains beautifully in verse; says: \"Sleep, you are such an exaltation thatprisoners in prison forget they are captive, those ill, suffering in pain, at thatmoment forget--in poverty, misery, lifted up from misery\"; he says, \"Sleep, you area bliss that no other he can be compared\", and the more one 6 the nearerone comes to spiritual realisation. In the first place one realises man's natural Selfnot wicked, no evil there, his soul is pure and free from evil, illness, free from fear,restlessness, there is life, goodness, 7 sense.

The2 tendency in the animals to3 look for a clean place to sit and amongbirds4 to go on the lake or on the river and to bathe4 and to clean their feathers.Then in humanity one sees the same tendency pronounced. A man who has notrisen above the material life uses that faculty towards cleanliness, but behind itthere is something else hidden, and that which is hidden behind is the secret of thewhole creation or the purpose for which the whole world was made. Purity is aprocess through which the life rhythm of the spirit5which has worked for agesthrough the mineral and vegetable kingdoms, through the animal to6 the humankingdom to pass through this process and to arrive with all this experience of theway to that realisation where the life of the spirit finds itself pure, pure in itsessence, in its pure condition, in its original condition. The whole process of thecreation and the spiritual unfoldment shows that the spirit that represents life, andin life the divine, has wed wrapped itself in numberless folds and in that way soto speak has descended from heaven to the earth. And the next process is tounwrap itself and it is that unwrapping 7process in it7 which may be called thepurity. In the Arabic language the same word purity is calledsafi,from which theword Sufi comes, which means unfoldment of the spirit towards its originalcondition. What does pure mean? For instance, when a person says it is \"purewater\", it means it is not admixed with sugar or salt; it is pure, it is original.Therefore, it is searching for one's original self, the desire to reach it, this originalself, and the means of getting to one's original self is really speaking the purity oflife. But this makes the same meaning in every form which the world has used.If it is used pertaining to the body it means the same, that what is foreign to thebody must not be there, and that is cleanliness. That is the first stage of purity.And so it is with mind: when a person says \"pure-minded\", what does it mean?That what is foreign to mind does not belong but what is natural to the mind, thatremains. And what is natural to the mind? What one sees in the little child andadmires it, the tendency to friendliness, ready to see or admire something beautifulinstead of criticising, willing to smile in answer to anybody's love or smile, respond-ing, to learn to believe without questioning \"What is it?\" or \"I believe this\" or \"Idon't believe this\", a natural believer, a natural friend, who by nature is respondingand yielding, a natural admirer of beauty without criticism who overlooks all whichdoes not attract him, who knows love but not hate. That shows that is the originalstate of mind, that is natural to man's mind. When the mind of man has come intothis world what is added is addition. It may seem good for the moment, it may2.

A person may be called clever,a person may be considered learned, a person may be called witty, but with allthese attributes it is not pure. When you say that a person is pure-minded, itmeans beyond all that. Yes, but there is a question; the question is: Is it thendesirable that a child should never learn anything which is worldly, and remainalways a child? It is just like saying: Is it then desirable that the spirit never cameto earth but always remained a spirit? No. The exaltation of the spirit is to havecome to the earth and from the earth to have risen to the spirit state, and fromthere the spirit has realised its perfection. And therefore all that the world givesin the way of knowledge, in the way of experience, in the way of reason, all thatone's own experience and the experience of others teaches us, all that we learnfrom life, from the sorrows, disappointments, all that helps us to become loving,to become kind. Through all these contradictory experiences one after the other,if one held his spirit high, went through all these and yet did not allow his spirit tobe stained, it is that person who is pure. The person who is considered pure-minded, who has no experience of the world, but does not know joy or evil, he hasno credit. He is a simpleton. A rock does not know what is evil. He is no betterthan a rock. Ymen The greatness is that he has gone through all this which takesaway that purity of mind with which man is born and 8through that has risen8, notbeing pushed under, but holding to its original purity, rising above all that pulls itdown and keeps it down on to the earth. It is a kind of fight through life. He whodoes not have cause to fight, he has not known life. He is perhaps an angelicperson, perhaps a pious person, and that we can call him out of respect, but plainlyspeaking he is a simpleton. There are so many phases in this process which onehas to go through in the process of purity of life, that the process through whichone has passed seems of no importance. The phase which one is passing throughis of the9 importance. The outward purity matters little when a person goesthrough the inward purity of life. But the first purity is the purity of the physicalworld where one keeps to the laws of cleanliness, to the laws of health, from thepsychic, from the physical, from the hygienic point of view he takes one stepforward towards spirituality. Then the next is what is called in general purity oflife. That purity of life is the purity of one's conduct in dealing with others, andvery often a man takes one direction of the purity of life and in another directionforgets it. The churches, the religions, the national and social laws very often makerigid principles about purity of life and a man begins to know the man-made purity10which is necessary to go through to reach the higher planel0'11.

For instance, when a younger person is insulting to anelderly person, people do not call it a very great fault. Sometimes such a littlefault can rise and make a worse effect upon his soul than the faults which arerecognised faults in the world. A person by a sharp tongue, by his inquisitivenature, by his satiric remarks, by his thoughtless words can commit a fault whichcan be worse than so-called great sins.

Therefore,that is the stage when man begins to understand what virtue means. He begins tounderstand the glimpse of that virtue which came. He thought it was virtue butnow it is the whole life and the whole life becomes virtue and one lives in it andlife means virtue. It is lack of life which is sin. He But then there is a purity andthat further purity is that in purity or freedom from thought of oneself, from one'sown thought. And by thought of self I do not mean the thought of one's real self.Thought of one's limitation covers what is true in one's being, one's true self. Itis this limitation which makes one feel at times that \"I am good\" or \"I am bad\". Hethen realises that \"I am neither good or bad, I am what I am; neither good makesme perfect nor bad makes me imperfect\". Good and bad do not exist when oneis above them. It is purity from all shapes and colours, purity from all the formsof life. It is like rising above heaven and hell and it is like touching the throne ofGod. It is just like bathing in the truth of God.

Divinity is reduced God and enlarged man. The whole difficulty that hasoccurred in all periods of the world's history has been the difficulty ofunderstanding Divinity or apprehending the mystery of Divinity.Man cannot think of man being God, nor can man think of God beingman. Therefore, sometimes the claimant of Divinity has been called God, but hasbeen kept remote and aloof from human beings.Sometimes the claimant of Divinity has been brought to the earth and hasbeen called no better than man. Really speaking Divinity is 3expansion of thehuman soul: plainly speaking Divinity is human nature in God3, therefore God isone and the Only Being; but Deities are as many as there are human beings, forthe Deity is the enshrined God whom man has conceived by his thought and idea.God was enshrined in his heart, therefore the ideas of Deity differed.

The Chinese have perceived numberless gods.The believers in one God have ridiculed them, but by looking at it from a rightpoint of view it is one and the same conception looked at from different points ofview.One person can be praised by one, can be hated by another and tenpeople around him may have a different idea of the same person who is beforethem, because each understands him according to his state of evolution. Each seesthat person according to his point of view, each looks at him through his own eyesand therefore the same person is different in each being. In the mind of oneperson the same person is a sinner, in the mind of another the same person is asaint.The same person, who is considered gentle and good, is considered byanother the contrary. If that can be in connection with a living being, the personwho is before you, this is quite possible that various ideas of the Deity should beformed in each heart, and that each soul must mould his own Deity according tohis own evolution and according to his way of idealising and understanding.Therefore the Deity of every heart is different, is as that person has imagined, butthe God of every soul is one and the same Whom they imagine. It is the sameGod they imagine but their imaginations are different, and it was6lack of thisunderstanding which made the differences? of religion.We read in the books of the past that there used to be blood feuds, familyfeuds, for the reason that one family believed in one God and another family hadanother God, and they called him a family God, and these families used to fightwith one another because of their separate Gods and they were giving their livesfor their God. And it is not very much different even now when nations fightagainst nations; for the time being the God of each becomes different, or at leastthey think the hostile country is not doing the will of their own God. Man is thesame down the ages, only he shows his evolution in degrees. The Deity is picturedsometimes as a spirit, sometimes as a person, sometimes as a king, sometimes asa master. The picture of Deity according to the Hindus is as Creator, as Sustainerand as the Destroyer. According to the terminology of the Vedanta, the wordDivine comes fromDevaand the wordDevacomes from , which meanslight, but every soul is a light itself, but the light is surrounded by clouds, cloudswhich have risen from the earthly impressions, and surrounded the human heart.These clouds keep the soul covered, butDevaor which means light, isthere and one reads in the Bible that no one should keep his light under a bushel,and the hint to raise the light, shows to us thatDevaor the divine spark is withinman. That Divinity is human infiniteness, and only its expansion and the disclosingof this light is necessary.

In the same way it is the same God, Who was an unmanifested God, as theseed of the plant of this Creation rises again to the fulfilment of this Creation, andin that fulfilment He gives the seed in the heart of that flower, and it is that flowerwhich is Divinity. The effort8 made by some religious authorities, who wish torecognise the Divinity of Christ, but ignore the Divinity of humanity, have tried tomake Christ different from what may be called human; by doing so they have notbeen able to keep the flame alight, because they have covered the main Truth thatreligion had to give to the world, and the Truth was that Divinity was in human-ity, that the Divinity was the outcome of humanity, that humanity was the flowerin the heart of which the Divinity was born as a seed. And by this they have notdone good to religion; on the other hand, they have harmed religion, trying tomake man something else, not knowing that all is in man, Angel is in man, animalis inm an, Djinnis in man and God is in man. There is no thing which is not inman, of earthly properties such as metals, gold and silver and iron and steel, theyare all to be found in the body and mind of man. If one knows the alchemy he canmake use of it, he can make out of man the man of flesh, he can make out of mana man of gold. This is what Christ wanted to do when he said to the fishermen,\"Come with me, I will make you fishers of man\". He wanted to do that alchemy.And what they call the philosopher's stone, what stone is it? It is the heart of theDivine man, whoever it touches it turns into gold. It is the philosopher's stone, ithas gained the alchemy. Then all living beings, creatures higher and lower,creatures of the water, creatures of the forest, creatures that fly in the air, insects,germs and worms, their nature, their character, their form, all can be found inman. The character of the bull, the character of the fish, the character of theinsect, the character of the animals can all9 be seen gin man. Think then, thatwhat you can find through the forest by going thousands of miles, you can find inonehuman personality. All is there, only it wants to be seen and he can see whoseheart's eyes are open. Many in this world, their external eyes are open but theman is asleep, they are moving about and think they are living, but there issomething which is asleep, which is not awake and if they cannot see they cannotsee what a great treasure is hidden in him. Again all jewels and precious mineralsand pearls, all can be found in man, in his character, in his external and innerbeing. All this is hidden; you can see in a person a pearl, you can see in the heartof man a diamond, you can see an emerald, all the jewels of this world are thereif you can see. And not only that, not only worldly treasures, but all heavenlythings. Man represents the planets, represents the sun and moon and representsheaven and its angels; and what does man not represent? He represents God.8. Ibid. : \"effect'' instead of \"effort\"9 .

Christ is the example of the culmination of humanity. Andit would be hiding the human virtue by hiding this secret, which is the key to themystery of the whole universe. Of course, compared with God Divinity is theimperfection of God but the perfection of man.It is just like a drop of water which is entirely water, absolutely water, andyet it is a drop in comparison with the ocean. The ocean is God, but the drop isDivine. If man had known this secret of life, no wars, no differences would havecome among the followers of the different religions, who have in all ages had warsagainst one another's differing ideas of religion. No prophet or Master at any timewould have been rejected or tortured or refused if the world had only known this:that He always comes, that He always shows Himself through the heart of theGodly. The comparison of the Divine with God is just like a sun glass placedbefore the sun. The sun glass partakes of the heat of the sun and drops the heaton to the earth, so the divine man, the Messenger in all ages, comes and partakesof the rays from God and drops them down to earth in the form of the DivineMessage.There are ages of aristocracy, there are ages of democracy in all form10,not only in the forms of the State, but in the form of religion. And as it is naturalthat aristocracy should be misunderstood, so it is natural that democracy should bedemoralised by the ignorant who cannot understand but the names11 of democracy.And the aristocracy of religion is belief in God, worship of God in a certain form,in the form of prayer and service, the form of ceremonial or ritual, whatever form,and the recognition andacceptance when it is given by an actual man, not onlythat, but the recognition of that illumination which completes its development inthe soul of man. As the Zoroastrians had taught in the ancient ages by the Sunworship that the Sun represents the light of the spirit, so the Son of God representsthe Light of God; but others have misunderstood it, they have taken it differently.The Son of God is He who finds out and who is conscious of his inheritance fromGod, not from man. One who is conscious of his earthly origin is the earthly man,one who is conscious of his heavenly origin is the Son of God. Man is what he isconscious of. Man's grade of evolution depends upon the pitch he has attained;it is a certain pitch which makes you conscious of a certain phase of life. A personstanding upon the earth cannot enjoy the fineness of the air which is upon the topof the mountain; in order to enjoy it you must be there. Therefore, an insincereclaim makes no effect. A man who is standing upon earth and talking about air,it is nonsense. It will have no effect because he does not know what is in the air;he must come to the air and then he must get the experience and talk from thereof what he is experiencing. Then it will make an effect because then his word issincere. It is not by theory that a person can trace his origin, no it is in practice.It is not only to know a thing but to live it and be it. And it is not easy, although10 . Ibid. : \"forms\"11 . Ibid. : \"name\""},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"156there is no need to divide Christ from men and for the very reason that one manis so above another man. There is such a great gulf of difference when one cancompare the evolution of one soul with another, that if one should say that oneman is standing on the earth and another is in the sky, it would be quite right. Butof course that aristocracy of religion is misused. The religious authority has madeit as a means, as an instrument, to keep the people under a certain law, and, so tospeak, used the religious authority of aristocracy for the sake of worldly purposes.Then naturally that aristocracy breaks and there comes a time ofdemocracy, and it is necessary that the religious democracy must come, becausethe fulfilment of the religions ideal is in religious democracy and religiousdemocracy is this, that no soul must ever think that \"I am human and someone elsewas divine and God is in Heaven and unattainable and imperceptible and far awayfrom our soul\", no, he must realise that Divinity is in my soul, God is within me,I am linked with God and God is linked with me and my soul can expand, for I amnot different from God nor God different from me. Only the danger of democracyis that when it comes too soon, before the person is ripe, then it brings disaster,because man's natural progress is to follow his highest ideal, and when man,blinded by the spirit of democracy becomes so agitated that he wishes to break thatideal, in that way he works to his own disadvantage. He comes down instead ofgoing up. And so in all ages and in different nations and races it has happened.The ideal must be before one that the main purpose of life is to ennobleone's soul. And religion is to observe, to appreciate, to recognise and to respectand to follow the ennobled soul, not with the thought of following, but with theideal of being that which your soul sees as the lofty and beautiful, realising thepossibility of touching that spot which is attracting your soul, as the light of theport attracts those who travel on the sea, which gives you hope, which invites youand tells you that the port is here.If we think of the present condition of the world, the more we think aboutit the more we realise that from the religious and spiritual point of view it seemsto be going from bad to worse.Religion is a thing which is first necessary for improvement of humanity.That seems to be sinking down, and we can only ask what is the reason, and thereason is this: that religion is a kind of negative battery, given by the positivebattery and charged by the positive battery. It goes on for some time as themagnetism would go on, and then the time comes when the positive battery shouldtouch it to make it alive again. But the difficulty is that man shows his childishnature at all times. The thing he once held in his hand he thinks belongs to him,and therefore those in authority of religions, when once they have charge of acertain church or community, or religion, or authority, then they would like to keepit even if it were the positive battery that came. They think it would be better keptaway, and as it is the people for whom the positive battery comes who throw it"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"157away, not the followers 12 of the religion, it is the religious authorities, the veryheads of the thing, they would like to keep it away, and that has been the wholefight which has been always with the prophets and teachers of humanity, withMahomet and Buddha, with Moses, with Christ, with Rama, with Krishna. Thefight that has been, has been of the same character. The holders, those in chargeof the negative battery have covered it when the positive battery came to touch itand make it alive, and what therefore happens is that the religions remained onlyin name, but the life-giving force which came from time to time and wanted tomake it alive, that had to be disappointed. But at the same time, the positive cancreate its negative. It is that, symbolically expressed in the Bible when you readof Eve coming from the side of Adam. When the Message comes, it does notcome to make a religion, but it makes a religion from necessity. If religion wouldhave taken the Message, the Message would not have formed a new religion.Christ never said, \"I have brought a new religion\"; he said: \"I have come to fulfilthe law\", \"I have to come to give you the same Message\". But those who had thereligion hid it and the consequence was that what Christ gave was the livinjreligion, but they hid it and it became dead. And so in all ages. The Gold1Temple of Solomon is gone, but the words that Jesus scattered on the river bankare living today. It always has happened and always will be so that the real is notonly real by its genuineness, but it is real by its power, that if there is no negativebattery to respond, the real will create a negative battery for its manifestation.Divinity is not only the expansion of the human soul, but it is anillumination of human soul. It takes time, it works gradually, it works directly orindirectly, it works with difficulty or ease, but it works, and it must work, and thephenomena14 of Divinity is not a miracle, the phenomena14 of Divinity is theenlightenment of humanity.12 .

And often they call what they do notreally like 4(La mort et le bucheron)4. The more you contemplate on this subject,the more you will see it is an enormous field, and we say or do what we do notwant. Alcool, opium; it is not the thing that they want, and though they seek forit, all their logic, common sense tell that it is bad, but all the same, they look forit .We must not play with an idea that we disapprove, it is dangerous, becausewe set a line. How can we wipe out a line? It is as difficult or even more than toclose a stream or a river. But one thing can help us, that is the fight with the self,and it is the fight with the line which the person thinks, \"It is myself\"; it is not theperson. It must be blocked up by what is contrary to it (as water is blocked byearth). For instance, there is a deep 5 to enjoy flattery; and that onecan work against it by taking the habit of humility, till it becomes such a deep line.And the good habit will take the bad one as a river takes a pond. But to be cured,the proportion must be like 1/100 against 99/100.The real self, according to metaphysics, is our soul, not our mind, norbody. But for a musician, whatever great the musician, if the piano is out of tune,what is to be done? The piano is not the musician, but he expresses himselfthrough the piano.A last example: There is a story in the Bible that Satan visited Jesus. And2 . HI. : \"explique la cause de cet effet\"3 .

And sometimes he used tosay, 'Oh, death, why do you not come? I would rather die than live such a life.' And oneday death got pity on him and appeared before him. And the moment he looked at thedeath, he was so frightened, that he began to beg him to leave him for some time in thisworld, that he would never invoke his name again, that he very much liked to live a fewdays more on earth. So it is with everyone. They call death when death is not present,but when death comes, then they are frightened. \"5.

If a person becomesaccustomed to sit on a certain rock in a garden, he forms a habit 16to go andseek16 the same rock every day. 17A certain spot in nature if one fancies17 helongs to see it every day. Of course, it depends upon the depth of the line. Thedeeper the line the more one lives in it. When talking, a business man explainsthings in 18terms of pounds and shillings, and19 an architect in the terms of hiscompass and tools. Every person has his own language and that language is madeof the words which come from the deeply engraved line of his mind. Therefore thework of the mystic is to be able to read the language of the mind. As the girl20at the telegraph office reads letters from the ticks, so the Sufi gets 21 at the backof 21 every word spoken to him, and 22finds out22 what has prompted the word tocome out. He therefore reads the lines which are behind man's thought, speechand action. He also understands 23by knowing this theory23 that every kind oflonging and craving in life, good or bad, has its source in the24 deep impression.By knowing this root of the disease he easily is25 able to find out its cure. Noimpression is such that 26cannot be erased27. 28Two processes the mystics have28in dealing with these lines. One process is to renew this line by putting in someother colour, and therefore changing one impression into another impression. Nodoubt this needs a29great knowledge of mental chemistry. Another way that themystic takes is to rub out the line from the surface, but often, when the line isdeep, it takes30a great portion of the31 mind to be rubbed out 32in destroying32one line. Naturally the mystic becomes tolerant of every sort of dealings' 3hereceives from others, as he sees not only the dealing as it appears, thoughtful orthoughtless, cold or warm, but the cause which is at the back of it.

There is one sense beneath, and that senseis expressed by different arts. For me, poetry is not very different from painting;at the bottom of all this there is the dance of the soul. When the prophet4 wasasked \"What is the soul?\" he said it was \"The action of God.\" That action isinspiration. Soul unmanifested is the soul; manifested, it is the inspiration of Art.One may say that the divine wisdom has come in the form of art. Engravings inthe stones, and carvings in the wood are a living examples of what I say. InBombay, in Agra or any other place in the East you will always find the symbolsof life written as a manifestation of art. Learning has now spread more in theworld. Before this century there were but very few lettered people, thereforeteaching, instead of being given by manuscripts, was conveyed by the medium ofart. To me it has always been a revelation. Whenever I saw engravings in thestones, or carvings in the wood, or whenever I have read the ancient scriptures,it has been as if I heard the cry of the soul. Besides that, all the great scriptures--the Vedantas5,and so on--have come as poetry. This shows that the message ofGod comes in the form of art. Wisdom is not only enlightening but alsocomforting. In the Hindu mythology art is pictured as a very beautiful goddess,represented by a peacock with feathers. They explain that by saying that God isbeauty, and loves beauty.

The idea is that it is manifested in so many places of life, and that aperson, conscious of superior beauty, cannot indulge in inferior places. No livingsoul is devoid of the innate idea of beauty; no doubt, the appreciation of beauty isrelative, for what is beautiful for some is not beautiful for others.If we look at the difference of classes in society we shall see that it is likean inartistic epidemy6, and the right way to check this epidemy would be toimpress ourselves with all that is good and beautiful, and to help our brothers. Allthat we appreciate in colour and form; all that we find beautiful and artistic in theform of words--manners and so on; all that appeals to us as feeling; all that wecollect in ourselves we must absorb; and, instead of thorns let us become roses. Wemust not use our faculties for vanity and pride, as there is nothing moredisagreeable than what comes from them. But, if we adorn ourselves with thejewels of real beauty, modesty and unselfishness, surely we can satisfy the desirefor the beautiful.Friends! today every soul seems to seek something higher. It seems towant something wonderful which it has never seen before. This is not the need ofhumanity, for the need of humanity is to think of simple things. Just think of thatwhich great prophets, like Krishna and Christ, have said in simple words. Peopleare spoiled today by having new inventions, and they are sick of truth. They desirethat even spiritual men come and tell them, \"I have discovered this; we have comefurther\"7; man cannot 8 further. He simply goes up and down like a swinging9machine. Remember the word of Solomon--\"There is nothing new under thesun.\"1Â° There are many things we never think about, because they are too simple.Yet it is necessary to consider them. Perhaps if one word of the Sufi teachingwere taken into account the mission would be fulfilled.Really speaking, a sign of degeneration in the life of a nation is the lackof art. When art becomes a pursuit of luxury, degeneration has come. Since thelast century science has been developing, but art is disappearing; yet the idealshould be that science and art should progress simultaneously. It has had a markedeffect upon human character; the beauty of reverence seems to disappear, because,on the one hand there was a religious influence that gave an idea of refinement;but, since it disappears, there remains nothing else. Education took only the nameand the form, and taught only to defend one's own interests.There is a question whether art is a kind of imitation of nature, or acorruption. In answer to this I will say that false art is a corruption of nature, butthat true art is an improvement on nature. This seems to imply that nature is notperfect. But the perfection of nature includes art. The heart of man points outthat perfect picture that has not yet been realised; in other words, the Creator6. an obsolete form of \"epidemic\"7 .

What is necessary today is not only art, but also the recognition of thedivinity of art; and the great art of the human soul is when she realises beauty inlife, to use all that beautiful quality in life. For instance the more we develop inour nature our artistic tendency, the more we begin to find out the lack of arteverywhere, and the consequence is that it pricks us and makes us unhappy.11.

After the21 observation one will come to understand that27 \"All Ilike in the world is what I have always liked, and all I dislike is what I have alwaysdisliked in life.\" It can be said in other words, \"What I know to be loveable I havealways loved, and all that I don't know I cannot love at once.\" This shows thatignorance is28 a cover over all that is beautiful and ugly, and knowledge uncoversit ; like29 comes from knowledge and dislike from ignorance, although both arenecessary. Also it is possible that by30 ignorance one may like a certain thing andby knowledge one may rise above that liking. However, the higher knowledge mustalways give liking for all things, and31 things which do not deserve liking, abovethem a soul will rise by the help of knowledge.15 .

The whole creation is purposed to7 something greater thangoodness or even spirituality, and that is fruitfulness. Goodness and spirituality arethe means, not the goal. If there is any goal, it is fruitfulness. Therefore it is theobject of life which the symbol of peaches represents.Fruitfulness has three aspects. The first aspect is when8 man benefits fromhis own life; the next aspect is when9 man benefits from the life outside himself;and the third aspect is when9 man is a benefit to himself and to the life outside,and the life outside is a benefit to him. That is the moment of the fruitfulness oflife. It takes all the patience one has to arrive at this realisation, but it is for thisrealisation that God created the world, that man may10 enjoy fruitfulness therein.It is the absence of faith and lack of patience which derive11 man of this bliss; ifnot, every soul is purposed for this. For instance, when a musician begins to enjoyhis own music, that is the first fruit12, when he enjoys the music of others, that isthe second stage of realisation, but when man enjoys his own music and makesothers enjoy too, then his life has become fruitful. There is a great treasure ofblessing within oneself, and there is a vast treasure of blessing without13 oneself;and when one has become able to find out the treasure one has within oneself andto exploit the treasure which is outside oneself, and when there is a14 reciprocal15exchange between his own treasure and the treasure outside, then his life hasbornel the fruit for which his soul was born. There comes a time in the life of thefruitful souls when every moment of their17 life bears a new fruit, 18as if it were18a plant which bears fruit at all times of the year.7 .

So,in proportion to his might, man makes what he thinks, what materialises we callhappening, but what has not been materialised we don't know, and what we don'tknow still exists in the thought-world. In the Koran it is said, \"The organs of yourbody will become16 evidence of your action on the 17last day17.\" Really speaking,noti8 19only action19 but 20even the evidence of thought20 is given by every atomof the body immediately. The nature of the manifestation is such that there isnothing hidden except that which one cannot see, and what one cannot see is nothidden in itself, but from one's own21 eyes. The aim of the Sufi, therefore, is tosee and yet not be interested. 22For instance22, suppose you were mounting23 Mt.Everest and were interested in a certain spot24 which you liked, to admire it, or25the part which you disliked, to breakit . Inboth cases you have allowed your feetto be chained to that place for more or less time, and by that26 lost time andopportunity, whereas you could have gone on forever and perhaps seen and learntmore than27 stopping there. Those who trouble about others'28 thoughts andinterest themselves in others'28 actions most often lose their time and 29preventtheir inner sight from being keen29. Those who go farther, their moral is tooverlook all they see on their way, as their mind is fixed on the goal. It is not asin to know anybody's thought, but it is a fault, no doubt, when30 one professes todo so. To31 know the thought of another for one's own interest is not just nor32beneficial, at the same time to sit with closed eyes is no 33 good either.

In that case the divine spirit is buried in his heart. A person who isalways concerned with his own feeling13, is so absorbed in himself that he has notime to think of another. His whole attention is taken up with his14 own feelings,he pities himself, he worries over15 his own pain and 16never opens16 tosympathize with others. 17The one17 who takes notice of the feeling of another18with whom he comes in contact, 19is the one who19 practises the first essentialmoral of Sufism.The next way of practising this religion, is to think of the feeling of the. One feels for a person who isperson who is not at the moment before you20present, but one often neglects feeling2' for someone who is out of sight. One22speaks good to the face of someone22, but if one speaks good23 of someone 24inhis absence24, 25it is sti1125 greater.

Our life in the world from 12morningto evening is full of experiences, good and bad, which can be distinguishedaccording to their degree. And the more we study the mystery of good and bad, themore we see that there really is no such thing as good and bad. It comes from ourattitude and the conditions that things seem good or bad for13 us. It is easy for anordinary person to say what is good or bad, just or unjust; it is very difficult for awise man. Also14, everyone from his outlook on life turns things from bad to good,and from good to bad. Everyone has his own grade of evolution, and reasonsaccording to that. Sometimes one thing is subtler than other things, and then it isdifficult for him to judge. There was a time when Wagner's music was notunderstood, and another time when he was considered the greatest of musicians.Sometimes things are good, but our own evolution makes them less good for us.What one considered15 good a few years ago may not seem good at a later degreeof evolution. A child at one time appreciates a doll most, later the work of greatsculptors. This proves that at every step and degree of evolution, man's idea ofgood and bad changes. Therefore a thinker will understand that there is no such16thing as right and wrong.171fthere is wrong, all is wrong17,if there is right all isright, and no doubt there is a phase when man is a slave of what he has himselfmade right or wrong, and there is another phase in which he is master, and18 thismastery 9 comes from his realization of the fact that right and wrong are made byman's own attitude to life, and then right and wrong, good and bad will be hisslaves, because he knows ttâºinke2o that it is in his power to turn the one into theother; 21 and it is this attitude that the Sufis 22 of old calledmantig21'23.This opensthe door to another mystery of life which shows that as in each thing there is aduality, so there is in every action.

And asto the average man the moving pictures27, theatres, bazaars are interesting, so tothe Sufis28 the whole29 life is interesting, a constant vision of bewilderment. Hecannot explain to the world because there are no words to explain it. Can onecompare any joy to that of taking things quietly, patiently and easily? All other joyscome from outward sources, but this happiness is his3O own property. When aperson arrives at this feeling it expresses itself, not in words, but in the \"smilingforehead\".There is another side to the subject, and that is that man is pleased to seethe one he loves and admires and respects; and if he frowns at someone, it isbecause it is someone he does not admire or respect. Love is the divine essence inman, and is due to God alone, and love for man is a lesson, is a first step forwardto the love of God. In the31 human love one begins to see the way to divine love,as the lesson of domestic life is seen by a32 little girl playing with her dolls. Nowone learns this lesson by loving one person, a friend, a beloved33, father, mother,brother, sister, or teacher. But the use of love becomes wrong when the love isconstantly developing and not spreading. The water of a pond may turn bad, butthe water of a river remains pure because it is progressing. Therefore by sincerelyloving one person one rears the plant of love and makes it grow and spread. Lovehas done its work when man becomes 34 all love, his atmosphere, his expression,every movement he makes. And how can that man love one and refuse another?That countenance, that presence becomes35 a blessing. In the East when we speakof a saint or a sage, it is not for their miracles, it is for their presence and theircountenance which radiate vibrations of love. How does this love express itself? Intolerance, in forgiveness, in respect, in overlooking the faults of others. Theirsympathy covers the defects of others as their own. They forget their owninterests36 in the interests36 of others. They don't37 mind what conditions they arein ; be it high or humble, their foreheads are smiling. To their eyes everyone is theexpression of the Beloved whose name they repeat. They see the divine in all formsand in38 all beings.As the religious person has the religious attitude in a temple, 39the Sufihas that attitude before every being because he is the temple of the divine.26.

But God cannot arise in theshrine which is as dead by its own poison; it must be purified first and made real for Godto arise. The soul who had to sympathise with the whole world was thus prepared, thatthe drop of that poison which always produces contempt, resentment, and ill-feelingagainst another, was destroyed first. So many talk about the purification of heart, andso few really know what it is. Some say to be pure means to be free from all evil thought,but there is no evil thought. Call it evil or call it devil, if there is any such thought it isthe thought of bitterness against another. No one with sense and understanding wouldlike to keep a drop of poison in his body, and how ignorant it is on the part of man whenhe keeps and cherishes a bitter thought against another in his heart.

This can be done by giving the idea of that one truth whichstands as the stem of religion, in12 all different faiths are as its branches.

A true worshipperof God sees His presence in all forms and ttfas27 in respecting others, he respectsGod. It may even evelve develop to such an extent, that the true worshipper ofGod 28Who is28 Omnipresent, walks gently on the earth bowing in his heart evento every tree and plant, and it is then that the worshipper forms a communion withthe Divine Beloved at all times, when he is wakeful29 and when he is asleep.9 .

A composerof music performs his small part in the scheme of nature, as a creator. Musicbeing the most exalted of all arts, a composer of music has his work no smallerthan the work of a saint. It is not only the knowledge of technicality, theknowledge of harmony, the knowledge of theory that is sufficient. The composerneeds tenderness of heart, open eyes to all beauty, the conception of the beautiful,the true perception of sound, and rhythm, and its expression in human nature. Bycomposing music, a composer must create his own world in sound and rhythm.Therefore, his work is not a labour, it is a joy, the joy of the highest order.If the composer writes music because he must write something, that is not thething to do. The composer must write music when his heart feels like writing,when his heart is singing, when ' his soul is dancing, when his whole being isvibrating the harmony. That is the time that he must write music. The composermust not make an effort of writing. What he must try is to make himself a perfectchannel, to let it flow freely out of himself, what comes from within, and expressthat sentiment coming in the form of inspiration, in the realm of music.Documents:Lm. = a handwritten copy made by Lakme van Hogendorp from her own longhandreporting.o .t . = an old typewrittencopy made from \"Lm.\".Sk.tp. = a typescript made from \"o.t.\" by Sakina or under her supervision.Notes:1.

But none of these words can explainfully the meaning of the word. Holy--Holiness is the next degree to piety. Godrealisation is piety. Self realisation is holiness. The first step to self realisation isGod realisation. It is not by self realisation, that man realises God, it is by Godrealisation that man realises self.Holiness is a spark of divinity in man, therefore no soul must be regardedas being deprived or without the spark of divinity within it. The spark is light itself,it exists also in the lower creation, in the form of life among beasts, birds, treesand plants, but in man this life has the opportunity to blaze into flame. At first thislife is buried in the heart of man. From the moment that this spark of divinitybegins to sparkle in the heart of man, he shows the sign of holiness. Thereforeholiness is no human heritage, it is inherited by every human soul from God, butit manifests only when the heart is open and when out of that spark which is divinein man there rises a tongue of flame which illuminates the path of man in life'sjourney towards life's Goal. It is the lack of understanding of the subject which hasmade man accept one teacher in whom he or his friends or his ancestors recognisedivinity and reject +in others with all their holiness. Holiness does not belong toa particular race, community or family, it comes naturally in the life of some, inthe life of others digging is necessary to find it. The fire is there but it is buried,it needs to be brought to the surface, sometimes blowing is needed to help theflame to rise.Is holiness seen in action? Yes, it can be seen in action, but who can judgethe action, when it is difficult for the wise to judge the action of the worst sinner,who, with any sense would be willing to judge a holy man? Only a fool!!! Canholiness be recognised in goodness? Yes, it can, and yet no one canfixa standardof goodness, for what is good for one, is bad for another, something which is apoison for one, is a remedy for another, and the goodness of every person ispeculiar to himself. The worst person in the world can accuse the best person oflack of goodness if he wishes to. No man has ever proved, nor will any man everprove to be good to the satisfaction of every soul that demands goodness. Butholiness is in itself goodness, if even if it is not in accord with people's standard ofgoodness. Holiness is a continually rising fountain of light, a marvel itself, it isillumination and it is illuminating.

It is selflessness3, which often produces humiliation inone's spirit, taking away the intoxication, which enriches the soul. Independenceand indifference, which are as4 two wings which enable the soul to fly, spring fromthe spirit of selflessness. The moment the spirit of selflessness has begun tosparkle in the heart of man, he shows in his word and action a nobility which5 nothingewthly no earthly power or wealth5 can give. There are many intexieating6ideas that7 intoxicate man. Many feelings there are which act upon the soul aswine, but there is no stronger wine than the wine of selflessness. It is a might andit is a pride that no rank of the world can give. To become something is alimitation, whatever one may be8; even if a person were to be called the king ofthe world, still he is not the emperor of the universe. If one is the master of theearth, he is still the slave e4- the of Heaven. It is he 9who is no one9, 10and yet10 all.The Sufi therefore takes the path of being nothing instead of beingsomething.

While wanting to straighten13 up commercial difficulties, political problemscreep up. While considering 14social questions14, moral difficulties manifest toview. Therefore in wanting to serve humanity in the work of reconstruction, whichis the duty and responsibility of every sensible soul, whatever be the15 rank orposition or qualification in life, first the question must be studied, what will be theremedy for all the mental maladieswhiehthat manifest on the surface of the16 lifetoday. There is one principal17 thing, and that is the changing of attitude ofhumanity, which alone can18 help in all directions of life, and the attitude can bechanged by a19 moral, spiritual and religious advancement. The work that the SufiMessage has to accomplish, is in this particular direction.The Sufi Message is no new religion, no20 particular system, but it is amethod of changing the attitude in life, which enables man to have another outlookon life. The chief thing that the Sufi movement will try to avoid, is sectarianism,which has divided man in all ages of the world's history. The Sufi Message is notopposed to any religion, faith or belief: on the other hand it is a support to allreligions, it is a defence for religions which are attacked by the followers of otherreligions. At the same time the Sufi Order21 provides humanity with the religionwhich is in reality all religions. The Sufi Order 1 is not supposed to take the wholehumanity in its arms, but in22 the service of the whole humanity is the fulfilmentof the Sufi mission. The Sufi Order21 therefore does not stand as a barrierbetween its member and his ewn23 religious faith, but as an open door leading tothe heart of his faith. The member of the Order21 is a messenger of the DivineMessage to the followers of the Church or the sect to which he belongs. The workof the Sufi Order21 is not to collect all the rainwater in one's24 own tanks, but towork and make a way for the 25of the Message to flow, 26for the26 supplyingwater for27 all the fields of the world. The work of the Sufi mission is sowing:reaping we shall leave to humanity to do. For the fields do not belong to ourparticular Order21; all the fields belong to God. We, who are employed on this12.

The mystic, byhis intuitive knowledge of the Kosmos, has found from the astrological point ofview the relation between notes, sounds and vowels, with the sun and moon, andwith colours.From a mystical point of view the whole creation has come from movement, whichin its forest form is called vibration, and he4 has attributed the movement whichbecomes both audible and visible in its further creation toNada Brahma,theCreator, God.Therefore there are certainragasto be sung at certain5 times and seasons.This idea still exists in India. Many cannot toleratea ragasung untimely. However,few realise the reason why they should sing6 at any particular time. No doubt, itis a matter of habit, as untimely food is often distasteful to many. So theragawhich the ears become accustomed to hear at a certain time, soundsunharmonious7 when sung at a wrong time.It is like taking a stroll in the midsummer morning, wearing an evening dress. Butbesides this, those who have introduced this idea, have found some connectionintuitively between the modes and their relative time and season, which is veryoften felt by the keen students of Indian musical cult.Documents:Lm. = a handwritten copy made by Lakme van Hogendorp from her own longhandreporting.01 = an old typewritten copy made from \"Lm.\" .Sk.tp. = a typescript made from \"o.t .\" by Sakina or under her supervision.Notes:1.

One who is conscious of matteralone is material. One who becomes conscious of spirit also is spiritual. 16Whothinks, \"I am my body', and sees no further, is material; he may as well say, \"I ammy coat\", and when the coat is torn17 he may say, \"I am dead\".

It is the spirit itself which must realize itself. The soul is its ownevidence. Nothing else will make the soul realize its own being.

It does not mean that the human being must not havethose feelings, but what belongs to Heaven is only one thing, all other things belong toearth. We cannot live without food. We have to have food in order to be on earth. Sogrief is also one of the things for our use. But at the same time joy is something different.It is Heaven. It is divine.

Allthe tragedy in life comes from the absence of purity. And what does purity mean?Purity3 means to be natural; 4the absence of purity means to be far from beingnatural. \"Pure water\" means that5 no substance, such as sweet, sour, or milk, or6any other substance6 is mixed 'with it7. Sterilised water means water made purer,in other words natural. Sufism, therefore, is the process of making life natural.You may call this process a religion, a philosophy, a science, or a mysticism,whatever you may. It is true that all the religious teachers who have come in thisworld from time to time, have brought this process of purity8 in the form of areligion. It is therefore that Christ has said, \"I have not brought you a new law,buts I have come to fulfil the law.\" It is not a new process, it is the same oldprocess that the wise of all ages have given.

Now, in thispresent period of the world, it is given in the present form.A person 10thinks, perhapsl0 that by spirituality it is meant that one mustlearn something which one did not know before, or one must becomeextraordinarily) good, or one12 must attain some unusual powers, or one12 musthave experiences of a supernatural kind. 13None of these things 14Sufismromises, although nothing 5, in the path of the Sufi, is too wonderful for him. All~6the above said things16, and even more are16 within his reach. Yet that is notthe Sufi's aim. By this process of Sufism one realises one's own nature, one's truenature, and thereby one realises human nature, and by the study of human natureone realises the nature of life in general. All failures, disappointment, and sorroware caused by the lack of this realisation; all success, happiness, and peace isacquired by the realisation of one's own nature. In a few words, Sufism means toknow one's true being, to know the purpose of one's life, and to know how toaccomplish that purpose. Many say, out of disappointment,17\"I shall perhapsnever be successful in my life\", not knowing the fact that man is born18 to do whathe longs to do. And success is natural, failure is unnatural. If man is himself thewhole world is his own; if he is not himself, then even this19 self 20does not belongto him. Then he does not know what he is, where he is, why he is here on earth;then he is less useful to himself and to others than a rock.It is in self-realisation that the mystery of the whole life is centered. It isthe remedy of all maladies, it is a secret of success in all walks of life, it is areligion and more than a religion. And at this time when the whole world is upset,this message conveys to the world the divine message. What is wrong withhumanity today is that it is not itself, and all the misery of the world is caused bythis. Therefore nothing can answer the purpose of humanity save this process ofsages and of the wise of all ages, which leads souls to self-realisation.To be read at the Meetings of the Universal Brotherhood.10 .

II.Toward the One, the Perfection of Love, Harmony and Beauty, the Only Being,united with Allthe Illuminated Souls, who form the Embodiment of the Master,the Spirit of Guidance.SULUK.FIVE CHARACTERISTICS THAT THE SUFIDEVELOPS ON HIS PATH TO PERFECTION.There are no principles that the Sufi is obliged to follow, but there arecertain characteristics favourites of the Sufi, and which make his life easy on thepath to perfection.The first characteristic is to recognise the divine in man, which in timedevelops so that he recognises the divine in all, deserving or undeserving, wise orfoolish, saint or sinner. In all forms of life he sees God, and thereby he has towardeverybody that attitude which a lover of God, a worshipper of God has towardGod. Therefore the Sufi complains no more, has no grudge against anyone, hasnothing to grumble about: \"That person insulted me\", or \"treated me badly\", or\"behaved unjustly\", or \"acted unkindly\", --no complaint whatever, for complaintcomes to a person who thinks of himself most of the time. He is inclined to self-pity at every moment, self-pity,--which is the worst poverty. The one who issensitive to all things that come from the people around him will have a thousandcomplaints, whatever be his life's position. In a palace or in a cottage, be he pooror rich, he is always full of complaints. Nothing is right to him, nothing is just,except himself, everybody is cruel to him; and for that poor person life is death.If this person thinks of his health, then he has many complaints to makeabout different pains and aches and disagreeable things he feels, and if he thinksof his friends and foes then he has many things to say about them. The Sufitherefore, fords the only way out of the distress of life, the life which will alwaysfail to prove true to one's ideal. He rises above it, taking all things as they come,patiently. He does not mind how he is treated. His principle is to do his best, andin that is his satisfaction. Instead of depending on another person to be kind tohim, the Sufi thinks if he were kind to another person, that is sufficient. Everywise man in the long run through life will find in this principle the solution ofhappiness. For we can not change the world, but we can change ourselves; and if"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"374we made ourselves as we wish others to be to us, it would not be a smallachievement in life.The fourth characteristic of the Sufi is to fulfil his obligations to thinkwhat he is expected to do by all those with whom he comes in contact in life, toanswer their demands to the best of his ability, willingly, patiently.And the fifth characteristic of the Sufi is to practise forgiveness, showingthereby the Divine Spirit reflected in his heart. Forgiveness can be practised indifferent ways. In all such things as tolerance, forgetting, overlooking, forgivenessacts in different forms.The Sufi need not speak about these five principles, but practise them.The Sufi does not profess to have these five characteristics, but he tries to practisethese principles, which enables him to tread the path with less difficulty and withease.Document: this typescript is the oly document found in the archives.

People take unnecessary trouble, which could just aswell be avoided. Worry about another person's action is unnecessary. Everyonehas his own worry about himself, and his own action is quite enough for him.When should we have time to worry about others? Every person has his own lifebefore him and the answer to his own action. If he is hot, cold, good, bad, foolish,wise, he has to answer to that. And suppose we love him? We love him, but whyforce upon him to act as we do? In the first place, no one is ideal, so as to say:\"Everyone should act as we do\". As we take freedom ourselves to act as we like,so we should give freedom to another to act as he likes. And the only way of livinghappily in the world is to leave another alone. If he is kind, \"Thank you\". If he isnot kind, \"Thank you\". Instead of your giving him punishment, let him go a stepforward and get the punishment of his action. Those walking in the spiritual pathmust not trouble about others. A lifelong time is not sufficient if we are to botherabout others. Every moment of life is too precious to waste on bothering aboutothers. Another thing is that every person has a nature peculiar to himself, everyperson has an object, a purpose different from that of others, the conduct of everyperson's life is different. And when one thinks, \"Everybody in the world shouldspeak, act, think and feel as I want them to\", he must try and become God.

Do we satisfy ourselves by ouraction, thought and speech? Then what right have we to blame another person ifhe does not act as we wish him to? However dear and near that person may beto you, he is a separate individual, he has his separate individuality, he has his ownideas. In some ideas he may be with you, but in other ideas he may differ.Without difference life can not exist. Suppose we all had the same face and form,we should not be able to recognise each other, life would not be interesting. Andsuppose the whole humanity were good, as good as we can picture it to be, theworld would be the most wretched place to live in. Man would be so tired ofgoodness that every soul would hunger and thirst for badness. There is no betterprinciple than to leave everyone alone, not to force our sympathy upon another tosuch an extent that he must change his individuality. The best way of expressingour love is to leave one alone to choose his way in life.Yes, if we wish that the others should yield to our wish and act as we wishthem to act, then the best way is to reverse that desire, to practise that oneselftoward others, instead of expecting that from others. It is not said in the Bible:\"Ask another to walk with you two miles if he be only willing to walk with you onemile\"; it is said otherwise. By wanting others to act as one wishes, on attractsdisappointments and unhappiness in life, one becomes weak, dependent,sorehearted, for human nature will always disappoint.

And as it has been quite adifferent direction, its progress has been peculiar to itself. As the music of Indiaevolved, the technical side of the music evolved too. But what is always consideredideal in music by the Indians, is its appeal to the human soul, which is the missionof every art.Indian music is always kept an art. In all the stages of its progress, it is all alongkept an art by the freedom of expression for the composer, singer or player in theform of improvisation.The composer 3only provides3 an outline of music as a designer; 4the artist thenembroiders it4, making their choice of colour and material. They choose gold,silver or silk thread, and it is the artists who make the choice of colours.This shows the capability of the artist, who is not obliged to keep strictly to thelines of the composer, but who is free to express his soul in his art.In this way, the artist in India, instead of being the reproducer of the composer,becomes a part of the composer. What the composer begins, he finishes. Thecomposer makes the base5 and artist accomplishes it.Documents:Lm. = a handwritten copy made by Lakme van Hogendorp from her own longhandreporting.01 = an old typewritten copy made from \"Lm.\" .Sk.tp. = a typescript made from \"o.t.\" by Sakina or under her supervision.Notes:1 .

Every soul differs in itschoice in life, in its choice of the path it should follow. This is owing to thedifference of mind, but in their essence souls do not differ. Therefore whatevermeans be chosen to bring the different minds of people together, there cannot bea better means to harmonise them than music. It would be no exaggeration if Isaid that music alone can be the means by which the souls of races, nations andfamilies, which are today so apart, may become one day united. Therefore themusician's lesson in life is a great one. Music is expressed not by language, but bybeauty of rhythm and tone reaching far beyond language. And the more themusician is conscious of his mission in life, the greater service can he do tohumanity.Now as to the law of music which exists in different nations. There areof course differences of method2, but in the conception of beauty there is nodifference. The differences come when the music is man-made, there is nodifference in the soul-made music. Suppose a man from the far3 Far East, theextreme North, South or West may come, but wherever he sees the beauty ofnature, he cannot help4 admiring and loving it. And so a music lover, fromwhatever country he comes, and whatever music he hears, if the music has soul,and if the music lover seeks for the soul in the music, he will appreciate andadmire all music. Furthermore music has a mission not only with the multitudes,but with individuals, and its mission with the individual is as necessary and greatDocuments:Kf. = a copy of the lecture in Kefayat LLoyd's handwriting.

All the trouble in the world, and all thedisastrous results arising out of it, all come from lack of harmony, and this showsthat the world needs harmony today more than ever before. So if the musicianunderstands this, his customer is the whole world.When a person learns music, he need not necessarily learn to be amusician, or to become a source of pleasure and joy to his fellow man, no, but byplaying, loving and hearing music, he must develop music in his personality. Thetrue use of music is to become musical in one's thoughts, words and actions. Wemust be able to give the harmony, for which the soul yearns and longs everymoment. All the tragedy in the world in the individual and in the multitude comesfrom lack of harmony. And harmony is best given by producing harmony in one'sown life.There are different kinds of music, each kind appealing to certain soulsaccording to their evolution. For an instance the children in the streets are verypleased by beating the tins5, because that rhythm has a certain effect upon them;but as a person evolves, so he longs for a finer harmony. Why people like or dislikeeach other is owing to their different stages of evolution, for an instance one is ata stage when he appreciates a certain kind of music, another person whoseevolution is greater, he wants music appropriate to his evolution. So it is inreligion. Some stick to certain beliefs, and do not wish to evolve beyond, so it ispossible that the lover of music may be tempted to keep to 6certain sorts6 ofmusic, and will not rise further. The true way of progressing through music is toevolve freely, to go forward, not caring what others think; and in this way togetherwith one's development in music, harmonising one's soul life7, one's surroundings,and one's affairs.During my travels throughout the world, I have heard the music of manydifferent places, and always I have felt that intimate friendship and brotherhoodexisting in music; and I always had a great respect for music and for the devoteeof music. And one thing I believe, and, when in India, was convinced of it timeafter time; Bin meeting those who have touched some perfection in music, that8 notonly in their music but in their life one can feel the harmony which is the real testof perfection. If this principle of music were followed, there would be no need forang external religion. And some day music will be the means of expressinguniversal religion. Time is wanted for this, but there will come a day, when musicand its philosophy will become the religion of humanity.5 . Ng.t . : \"time\" was misread for \"tins\";tp . : \"time\"6 .

We cannot expect every person to become most interested inthe cause at` the first moment dhe comes to us. It is probable' but not usual.

Yes, we learn from our mistakes.If one is afraid of mistakes, he will never learn; it is a matter of courage. Of whatuse is the virtue learned from others, that others tell \"That is right for you to do\"?It is of no use. If only you can realise God here9 Who is living in the heart of man--and no one is closer to us than God -- then no one else is capable of telling whatis right than10 your God within tells you.If you say, \"Several times I thought that something was right, and it turnedout wrong in the end\", I will say: \"You were not sure, perhaps your mind doubtedif it were right or wrong, perhaps you were dependent upon other people's advice,perhaps preconceived impressions influenced your determination of right andwrong. If it simply came from the bottom of your heart, and you accepted it andwent on with courage through life; then it would be successful, or\" if it met withfailure, the failure would become the stepping-stone to success\".You must remember that God never misleads His followers. Those whofollow the advice of the God within are always protected by God; for their affairsGod Himself is responsible. Only what is necessary is an open discrimination of12what you wish to do. You must ask yourself, \"Is it my real feeling? Is it telling meto do it? Is my sense of justice satisfied with it? Is my reasoning in accordancewith it?13 Is there any conflict with myself or is it all smooth?\" If all is smoothwithin, all is smooth without; the way is open, it is all clear.Then you14 only have to have faith, trust and courage to go forward in thestrength of the goodness of God, and remember, it is not your strength, nor15 yourexperiences, nor15 your knowledge, that can give you success. No, it is God.That is what is meant symbolically by the story of Arjuna and Krishna,that when Krishna consented to drive the chariot16, Arjuna's heart was free fromworry and anxiety.

True success is God alone, and all other things added.Remember, therefore, that in a small affair or in a big affair first consultyourself and find out if there is no conflict in your own being about anything youwant to do; and when you find no conflict there, then feel sure that a path isalready made for you.

He gets into disagreeablemoods when there is nothing he agrees with, even he cannot agree with himself.Others blame him, dislike him, avoid him, escape from him, call him a difficultperson, not knowing that it is not the person who is difficult, it is some difficultyhe possesses in himself which he himself 13knows not13, but finds every out reason,object or person that he touches at that moment to be the cause of his agitation.In this way the real cause remains hidden, and that person turns from bad toworse. Few will help him14, and fewer still will understand. It is a matter ofpatience, endurance, tolerance, besides a keen insight into human nature tounderstand a person's condition. It is natural that a person with a wound mustfret, the wounded must show restlessness, dissatisfaction; nothing to him is tasteful, nothing agreeable, 15there is15 nothing on which he can set his hope. It is oftenthe case that the person himself is at a loss about his own complaint. If it is16 anouter wound 17he may see it17 for himself; but the inner wound he hifnself18 cannotalways19 realise, he only feels pain and he does not know where it comes from.While looking for reasons, everything every being, every condition that presentsitself before him, he attaches all blame to it20, because that is human nature. Thework of the Sufi, therefore, is to stop and think before being annoyed, and seewhat is the matter with a person, to find out what is at the back of it, to find outwhere is the sore, where is the wound which is hidden. Then his work is to washthat wound with the water of life, and then try to heal it. What it needs is cooling,not irritating, which is mostly done by the ignorant; annoyed with 21 the cry of21 thewounded, they give back a little more irritation. No, it is the cooling which isrequired; a word of love, of affection, a word of consoling can cool the22 irritation.Love which manifests as tolerance, as forgiveness, that love it is which heals eventhe wounds of the heart. Only patience is required, and a continual work with faithand confidence in the divine power of Love.10. Gd.h ., Hq.t . : \"This\" instead of \"His\"11.

For the vibration takes three forms ofexpression: in the voice in singing, in the sound in playing, and in the movementsin dancing. However, singing is considered to be the principal part insangita -music.Music is considered by some of the Hindu thinkers and writers to be even greaterthan theVedas,the sacred scriptures, for they say \"First is thenada- the word, andthen comesveda3,the scripture\".The greatest souls of India who have been revered by Hindus in all ages, such asShiva, and Mahadeva, such as Krishna, Narada and Tumbara, were the greatestmusicians of their time.Sangitain its above three sections makes a part of Hindu worship.

And when there is more than one note played together, theconflicting vibrations, however sympathetic, must necessarily produce an obscurity.No doubt, this idea made the music of India individualistic instead of beingcollective or universal.

Therefore neither the pitchof the3 instruments is fixed, nor the pitch of theraga.The music of India, being constructed4 mainly on nature, and having been keptthrough all stages of its evolution close to nature, its notes are determined onnature, on the natural sound of birds and beasts.Of the notes so constructed there arefeatthree notes upon which generally thedifferent songs are based:shadja grama,from c.madhyam grama,from f.nishad5 grama,from b.Shadja gramais said to be the pitch of man; madhyama gramathe pitch of woman,andnishad gramafor the children.

Many wonder if sinis an attitude or an action or a situation or a result, and the answer is that all thesecombined together make either a virtue or a sin. The absence of one from it makesit incomplete, but all those together make it a complete virtue or a sin. Now thequestion is where it is originated, what is the source of it, and the answer is thatits origin is in wrong thinking. Wrongdoing comes from wrong thinking and wrongthinking comes from wrong feeling. And yet it is difficult to distinguish betweenfeeling right and wrong. In short, as a definition of the word I would give this:every attitude, word or action that deprives one of the expected result, the resultwhich is expected not only by the mind but by the soul, may be called sin. Thatwhich deprives one of peace, of4 freedom, of4 happiness, of 4tranquillity of mindand of 4ever-increasing power of will may be called sin, whatever be the action. Itmay be an action which all the orthodox call virtue, and yet it can not be 5virtue.Why is 5virtue called a virtue? Because it brings happiness. It is not because it isa particular kind of action, it is because it brings to one 6which one's whole soul6is desiring. It brings freedom, it brings the air of happiness, it gives by its pressureupon one's mind an increase of will power. That is why it is called virtue. It istherefore that no person in the world can judge another person, whether superiorto him in evolution or inferior; the person himself is the best judge of his action.Documents:Gd.h . = an edited text in the handwriting of Sherifa Goodenough, copied by her froman earlier document, probably her own Ih. reporting of the lecture.

It brings the spiritof freedom, 10that gives the air of happinessl0 with increased willpower, whichopens up freedom for those that11 can recognise for themselves the differencebetween right and wrong, and in that the evolution of humanity is12 a step forwardfrom what it was before. After a certain time the same principle that the SufiMessage has brought to the world will culminate and will appear as a law amongnations, because the Message is the throwing of the seed. Just now you do not seethe fruit13 and the leaves, just now you see the seed which is hidden under the dustand on the ground. But time will show the tree, with its fruit and its leaves. Whenthe nations will recognise the divine law and the law of the time then humanity willno longer be ruled by the laws made by a few intellectual people for theirconvenience and as they think right, but the law will recognise the divine indicationwhich is constantly working through every soul, guiding it on the path, showing itthe way of its destiny. And when such a time will come there will not be the14necessity for so many laws, and as many laws so many lawyers, and probably asmany lawyers so many lawcourts, and no end of prisons and no limit to theprisoners. This will cease to exist. There will not be the necessity of strict laws andsevere punishments for nothing. If one could only see that among one hundredpeople who are sentenced by the courts there is hardly one to be blamed, to beheld responsible for his fault. And if there is anyone to be held responsible it is15in all15 human beings. Why do we not all work? Why do we not all help themto kindle the light in their soul that would show them their path plainly? It is notnecessary that the clergyman, the priest only, should be responsible for theevolution of each individual. We must work in the capacity of brother and sisterto everyone.

II.Toward theOne, the Perfectionof Love,Harmonyand Beauty, the Only Being,united withAll theIlluminated Souls, who form the Embodiment of the Master,the Spirit of Guidance.TASSAWUF. 1There are three things which those who follow the inner cult use asexercises for spiritual attainment. One thing is concentration; the other thing iscontemplation; another thing is meditation.Concentration is an exercise to train the mind to hold a certain objectsteadily, without wavering; and by the power of concentration there is nothing inthe world that cannot be attained. But concentration is a very difficult exercise toaccomplish; for the nature of the mind is such that when the mind takes by itselfsomething, worry or trouble or a grudge against someone, or insult, it holds itwithout any effort; but when one desires to hold an object in mind for the sake ofconcentration, the mind acts like a restive horse. Once concentration is mastered,one has mastered life on earth.Contemplation is not much different from concentration, the differencebeing only that in concentration the mind holds an object, in contemplation theobject holds the mind. Concentration itself, when mastered, turns intocontemplation. The contemplative person is he who easily holds in mind all hethinks about. The mystics contemplate upon the sacred names which signify thedifferent attributes of God. By contemplating upon divine attributes man wakensthe same attributes within himself, his heart reflects the light of that divineattribute which he contemplated upon.Meditation is something different. It is a training of the mind not inactivity but in passivity, the training of the mind to receive some inspiration, poweror blessing from within. Meditation is more important and less difficult. Themystical temperament is a meditative temperament. The mureed who is receptivecan benefit most from the contact of Murshid. Therefore meditation is consideredby Sufis the thing of the greatest importance in spiritual attainment.Note1 . According to an annotation by Sherifa Goodenough on this lecture,the title of the originallecture was\" Concentration, Contemplation, Meditation\", which she replacedby \"Tassawuf\"when she designated the lecture, in later years, to be included in the Headquarters' seriesSangathaII, where it became the 52nd item."},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"466A copied text in KefayatLLoyd's handwriting.Given at \"Les Solitudes\"1, 12 August 1922MusicMusic, the word that we use in our2 language is nothing less than thepicture of the Beloved. But the question is what is our Beloved? And where isour Beloved?It is because music is the picture of our Beloved that we love music. OurBeloved is that which is our Source and our Goal. And what we see of our Belovedbefore our natural eyes, is the beauty which is before us. And that part of ourBeloved 3which is3 not manifest4 to our eyes is that inner form of beauty of whichour Beloved speaks to us. If only we will5 listen to the voice of all the beauty thatattracts us in any form, we shall find that in every aspect it tells us that behind allmanifestation is the perfect Spirit, the Spirit of Wisdom.6What do we see as the principal expression of life in the beauty visiblebefore us? It is movement - in line, in colour, in the changes of the seasons, in therising and falling 7of the7 waves in the wind, in the storm, in all the beauty ofnature there is constant movement. It is this movement which has caused day andnight and the changing8 seasons; and this movement has given us thecomprehension of what we call time, otherwise there would be no time, for it iseternity. And this teaches9 that all we love and admire, observe and comprehendis the life hidden behind, and that life is our Being.Documents:Kf .c. = Kefayat LLoyd's copied text.tp . = a typescript, probably made from \"Kf.c.\" .tp .c. = a later typescript with several inaccuracies, and some corrections andalterations in Sakina's handwriting.Notes:This lecture was first published inTheSufi Message of HazratInayat Khan, Volume II, chapter 2.1 .

All11 forms of nature,the flowers so12 perfectly formed and coloured, the planets and stars, the earth, allgive the idea of harmony, of music. And then the whole nature is breathing, notonly living creatures, but all nature, and it is only our tendency of comparing thatwhich seems most living13, with that which to us seems14 not so living, whichmakes us forget 15all things and all beings are living one perfect life. And the signof life this living beauty gives, is music. What makes the soul of the poet dance?Music. What makes the painter paint beautiful pictures, the musician sing beautifulsongs, it is the inspiration that beauty gives. 16The Sufi has called this beauty Said,the divine giver Who gives the wine of life to all. What is the wine of the Sufi? Allbeauty in form, 171ine 18colour, in imagination, in sentiment, in mannersl0, in allthis he sees the one Beauty. Allthese different forms are part of the spirit ofBeauty, which is the life behind19, always blessing.Now we come to what we call in everyday language, music. To mearchitecture is music, gardening is music, farming is music, painting is music,poetry is music. 2All the occupations of life where beauty has inspired, where thedivine Wine has been outpoured, there is music. But among all the different arts,the art of music has been especially considered divine, because it is the exactminiature of the law working in21 the whole universe. For instance if we studyourselves we shall find that in the beats of the pulse, and the heart, in22 theinhaling and exhaling of the breath, 23al1 is24 the work of rhythm. Life dependsupon the rhythmic working of the whole mechanism of the body. Breath manifestsas voice, as word, as sound, and the sound is continually audible, the soundwithout, and the sound within oneself, and that is music. This shows that there ismusic outside, and music within ourselves. Music inspires not only the soul of thegreat musician, but every infant the instant he comes into the world begins to movehis little arms and legs with the rhythm of music, and therefore it is noexaggeration to say that music is the language of beauty, of the One Whom every10.

Thetrue answer3 is, \"Life is joy\", and at the same time life contradicts it. Reallyspeaking the nature of life is joy, the soul is joy itself and the experience one haswhich is contrary to it comes from the limitation of this dense earth. Man's realbeing is joy itself and man seeks for joy by all different ways, by gaining wealth,power, renown, greatness, or by seeking for pleasures, comfort, by being good orvirtuous, pious or spiritual, in different forms, according to his particular evolutionman seeks after joy. And yet, ninety-nine out of a hundred can say in this worldthat4 \"The more we pursue joy the farther5 we seem to have been removed fromit.,, 6Coming to the cause of the lack of joy one realises by pondering on thesubject that it is not pursuing after joy that results in disappointment, it is thewrong method adopted in the pursuit of joy which brings instead of joy sorrow ordisappointment. For instance when the source of joy is in the North and? manmistakenly goes in its pursuit to the South, when joy is in Heaven8 man looks forit on the earth, when joy is within9 man wishes to find it without, then naturally hemeets with disappointment.

This shows thatin reality joy does not come from the external life, though always it seems so. Joyhas only one source and that is the heart of man, which is the globe over his soul'slight.

He willhear it more or less in every soul-inspiring song, and especially in greaterfulness in that divine song that comes to the world as the Message.Question: How can one define the transcendental and the immanent God?Answer: This question has always been of very great interest among Sufis in theEast. The distinction between the manifest9 and the unmanifested Godin Sufi terms is called 10. Science in the West, especially thescience of psychology, is approaching to that ancient ideal, which is theessence of religion, philosophy and mysticism, the ideal which they canpantheism. But unless a greater light is thrown on the subject, the truesubject11 of the pantheistic ideal remains hidden to the view of man12,and they begin by their knowledge of pantheism to ignore God. Truepantheism and true Christianity are not different, yet a Christian willdeny13 he is a pantheist and a pantheist will consider himself far beyondwhat is, called Christianity in the simple sense of the word. To us namesmake no difference - call it pantheism or Christianity, Sufism or wisdom,call it nothing, or call it everything, it is all the same. One thing is true,all we see, hear, smell or touch, every aspect of life which is within thereach of our comprehension comes from the one Source, out of whichSource it is born. Therefore in point of fact all we know as variousforms14 in reality are one and the same, which is the manifestation, theimmanence of the Source which is hidden behind. But as we standapart, and see our body and mind, our thoughts and feeling, so, thatunmanifested spirit of God Who is Perfection Himself sees all Hisimmanence standing apart from it.

Noman mustever claim to be the knower of hearts, no Murshiddare claim such a thing, nor a prophet; if he happens to know, it is givento him, therefore that attribute belongs only to God.In answer to the 2nd part of the question, does the link become closerwhen the form of words is given? No, the link between Murshid andmureed is not increased or decreased by words which are only theoutward manifestations of thought. Where there is a link, it isstrengthened most by the confidence given to Murshid, also the mureed'ssympathy for the Murshid, and the Murshid's sympathy for the mureedstrengthens the link. But a 3rd answer can be given, perhaps thequestioner wants to know if there is need of explaining things in words,or if it is sufficient to keep all one's thoughts and feelings in silence? Theanswer is that the truth need not be spoken. The existence speaks louderthan words, still the law of life in the world is such that words give afuller expression to one's thoughts and feelings resulting in a greatersatisfaction, therefore the best thing is to say what can be said, and notto try to put into words what can never be expressed in words, trustingto one's own sincere devotion, and to the sympathy of Murshid, thatnothing will remain not understood.Documents:Kf. = a copied text inKefayat LLoyd's handwriting of five questions and answers.Three of these have not been found in an earlier document.Sk.tp. =a typewritt encopy of \"Kf.\" madeby Sakina,with a few correctionsin Sk.'s hwr.Notes:1.

It depends upon the person whathe wishes to produce. Life before me is a place where every person isgiven a piece of ground, one person a larger piece, one person a smaller,and he is told: now you have the ground, and there are seeds, grass,weeds, corn and good fruit, flowers and poisonous fruits, sow what youlike, sow all that interests you and produce, or do not sow at all, but stillthe ground belongs to you.\" So is the life of an individual in this world,every person has his farm. There are some who sow thorns, and whenthe thorns are up they become painful, and they feel: \"why did we dothis?\" or they say: \"I am so tired of this farm, I wish I were not here.\"They wish they could be taken away from this farm and put in a farmwhere flowers and fruit are growing already without the trouble ofsowing, but that is against the law. Man is intended to live on this farmand all through life he is sowing what will be his hereafter. Heaven andhell are not made ready for a person after this life on earth, the samefarm that is given to man is turned hereafter into his Heaven or Hell.So the man must build Heaven now on the farm that is already hispossession. He must put into it all that he likes and loves, and put outfrom it all that is hurtful, harmful6 or disagreeable, making his farmfrom now of the nature of heaven, which in the hereafter will culminateinto a perfect heaven.Question: What is the law of the sacrifice of the personal self for a principle or tobenefit another?Answer: Sacrifice is only legitimate when it is willingly done and through everycost or loss. The one who sacrifices may feel rewarded much more thanthe cost or the pain he has endured or suffered in sacrificing. The lawof sacrifice is that it is only valuable when it gives pleasure to the one4 . Kf. : added by Kefayat, \"Later Murshid returned to this question and said, \"5 .

The sacrifice must be done wholeheartedly. Sacrifice islike a bath in the Ganges. It can be more sacred than anything in thisworld, but when a person does not do it for a principle, but only for thereturn in good that he may receive, then it is useless. When it is donefor the joy of sacrifice, in that case his joy is great. The law of sacrificedepends upon the degree of evolution. One sees this among children. Agrown-up child who understands life better, is perhaps more ready tomake a sacrifice than the child who knows only the object he wants andnothing else. So in this world it is not a difference of years but of8 evolu-tion of every soul which keeps it young, the more grown-up the moreready to sacrifice, and the younger the less ready for the joy of sacrifice.Apart from the point of view of the benefit hidden in the idea ofsacrifice, it is not a thing which every soul can understand. One personwill do something and consider there is great wisdom in the sacrifice,while another who is not evolved enough to understand will say \"howvery foolish\". Therefore remember that not only to the wise the man oflittle sense appears foolish, but even to the foolish person the wise seemfoolish, for the points of view of both are different, one looks from thetop of the tower, the other stands on the ground and looks, and thereis a vast difference in the range of their sight. It is man's outlook on lifewhich makes him broad or narrow, and it is the grade of evolution whichgives man the illumination of sacrifice. What a man was not inclined todo last year, he may be inclined to do this year. The sacrifice one couldnot make yesterday, one can make today, for9 the rate of speed of man'sevolution cannot be limited to a particular standard. A broad outlookenriches man, and a high point of view ennobles the soul.Question: Is the law of evolution so entirely impersonal, so well balanced, that it willrespond equally to our efforts for doing good or evil?Answer: Yes, there are so to speak two floors in the life of the world. The onewhere one is with the whole world, connected and linked with athousand ties, and on this floor there are also a thousand things whichdrag one down, there are difficulties, and obstacles to the carrying outof one's best intentions. Therefore, when a person is on this floor, to dogood is more difficult than to do evil, although good is natural, and evilis unnatural to man's nature. But on the next floor, one is among, andyet detached from difficulties, temptations and troubles. One is abovethem. On this floor doing good is easy and doing wrong is difficult.These two floors are as two stages in human evolution.8. Sk.tp. : \"the\" added9 .

A person who responds to the advice that is given to him, takes instructionswith responsiveness, will carry out his instructions and will accomplish all affairsperfectly. The artist who responds to nature, responds to all beauty, certainly canproduce wonders. The person who sympathetically responds to the needs, to thesufferings of others, certainly lives a fuller life. A person without this quality,whatever be his interest in life, will never be able to accomplish anything worthwhile in life. Allpeople who do something worth while in life are the responsiveones; those who do not respond are failures.Responsiveness may be explained as faith, trust, concentration,singlemindedness, a living interest, contemplation, and love. To respond means togive full attention and not divided attention but single attention. Responsivenessis focussing one's whole being to something of interest. When a person hasdeveloped this faculty even in his interest in worldly affairs has so developed hisfaculty of responsiveness, then it becomes easy for him to respond to the call of thespirit. It is therefore that in the spiritual path responsiveness is of the greatestimportance.The mystery of responsiveness is that the responsive one must forgethimself in order to respond; and the same mystery may be called the path toperfection. A person who is not capable of forgetting himself, however good,pious, or spiritual, will always prove imperfect in his life. All misery comes fromthe consciousness of the self. The one who does not forget is constantly called byhis own limited life, which enslaves him constantly. The one who forgets himselfreceives the call of God, if he was able to respond to God.Document: this typescript is the only document found in the archives.

Jones's copybooks, containinglectures only which have been inserted in the series ofGathas1The Mysteryof the PyramidSuresnes, 18th August 1922The custom of the ancient thinkers was to teach their philosophy in therealm of art, and this way art was made second, not only that art comes frominspiration, but also that through art most sacred ideas can be represented. Thereare many ideas which words can not very well explain, and yet they are of verygreat importance, as they are concerned with human life.The Pyramid in Egypt is one of the most ancient places of pilgrimagewhere in symbolical art mysticism and philosophy are expressed. The symbolswhich many followers of the Inner Cult' have imitated are originally from theEgyptian Pyramid. That stone of triangular form which appears from a distanceas a form of head, represents that the source and goal of the whole creation, anddepth and surface of the whole universe, also the mystery of heaven and hell, areall to be found in man, and what is man but head, for the head represents man,not the body. The word\"mana\"from which \"man\" comes (is)2 mind and it is thehead which represents mind. Allthe fine senses of perception, by the help ofwhich the mind gets the conception of life, is the secret of the whole being.Another thing it suggests is: if there is any place which could be called a centrewhere one could have a glimpse of the light which is hidden, it is the head.Another proof of the head being mind more than the body, is that the sign of thedevelopment of mind in all the different directions of life, is marked on the headof man. Every faculty man develops in life is to be traced in the humps of thehead. Every lack of human mind can also be found in examining the skull.Besides this, the head which stands in the place of the Pyramid is the mostimportant of symbolical signs there. It says to the seer: \"I am made in God's ownimage.\", in other words, God's image is seen in man. Many will say: God is all-pervading, all forms are His forms, all faces His faces, why specially man's imagemust be called God's image? The answer is that God becomes conscious ofHimself in man, if man ever rises to that plane of realisation. Although God is inall beings, yet every creature is conscious of its own individuality, and as realisationof God is God-consciousness, every man who is only conscious of himself cannotrise to that perfect state of which it is said in the Scriptures: \"We have made manin our own image\".Notes:1 .

The Prophet6 has worked as an alarm to warn people of the comingdangers, thePaghambarhas brought reforms to improve the condition of hispeople. 7Nabiis the prophet who is not only for a certain section of humanity,although he may live and move only in a limited region of the world, yet what hebrings has its bearing upon the whole8 humanity. It may not be fulfilled in hislifetime, but a day of the9 fulfilment comes some time, even if it be in somecenturies that all he brought reaches the whole8 humanity. Rasoulis a term whichdenotes 10a degree advanced10, where the Prophet has not only brought a messageto the world, but fulfilled his task during his lifetime, through all tests and trialsthat a Prophet is meant to meet in life.The Prophet is an interpreter of the divine law in human tongue, he is anambassador of the spiritual hierarchy, for he represents to humanity theilluminated souls who are known and unknown to the world, who are hidden andmanifest, who are in the world or on the other side of the world. The Prophet isan initiate and initiator, for he is an answer to the cry of humanity, of individualsand of the collectivity, the one who sympathises with those in pain, guides those indarkness, harmonises those who are in conflict and brings peace to the world,which always, when excited with its activity of centuries, loses its equilibrium. TheProphet can never tell the ultimate truth, which only his soul knows and no wordscan explain. His mission is therefore to design and paint and make the picture ofthe truth in words that may be intelligible to mankind. The bare truth not everyman can see. If he can see he needs no more teaching. The Prophet, so to speak,listens to the words of God in the language of God and he interprets the samewords in the human tongue. He speaks to every man in his own language, heconverses with every man standing on his own plane. Therefore he has littlechance to disagree, unless there were someone who wanted disagreement andnothing else, there he cannot help.

If a person knows one reason for it,there is another reason hidden behind16, which he does not know.

II.Toward the One, the Perfection of Love, Harmony and Beauty, the Only Being,united with Allthe Illuminated Souls, who form the Embodiment of the Master,the Spirit of Guidance.SULUK.THE GOOD NATURE AGAINST LIFE IN THE WORLD.It is a question that rises in the mind of every thoughtful soul when a soulbegins to realise the beauty of goodness and refinement, such as patience,endurance, thoughtfulness, consideration, yielding, when one has to deal withpeople of various natures, various dispositions, people of various grades ofevolution in the world. And it is right that only learning to be good and refinedthrough life is not sufficient. A step farther is necessary to know, that can be madepracticable when one has to live in the world. For the sages who lived in theforests, in the caves of the mountains, where nobody could touch them, for thekings and sovereigns who are always in the palaces, surrounded by the mostcultured and refined souls waiting on them, it is easy; but for those who have tomake their life in the world, coming against all sorts of different temperaments,some hot, some cold, some warm, some lukewarm, some high, some low in theircharacter, manner, in their personality, some facing the South, others North, somelooking up, others looking down, it is most difficult to make a standard of actionto fix one's attitude in one's thought, speech and deed.It is therefore that when a religious person makes a kind of law for action,the Sufi sees its impossibility. The standard of the Sufi is what he makes at everymoment of his life; change for him is not a new thing; life changes, he changes.Every experience in life brings a new change with an inspiration which directs theaction of the Sufi. If you asked a Sufi \"this does not agree with what you havespoken the day before yesterday\", he will say, \"what was for the day beforeyesterday, this is for just now; for tomorrow I will speak to you tomorrow\". Afresh inspiration every moment, which Hafiz explains so beautifully in his firstpoetry in the Divan,\"Mutaba khush. . . . . . . . .\"O singer of delightful voice, sing a songevery moment new, new, fresh, fresh. \"What is necessary, therefore, in life, is not only learning of goodness andfineness of manner, for that is only the alphabet, that is not the book. After"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"506learning that alphabet you must read the book of life and see the demands of everymoment, what every moment in life demands of us, what every moment in lifeasks of us, and how to deal under different circumstances. There comes a momentwhen silence is good, there comes a moment when an advice is desirable, there isa moment when you can be yielding, there is a moment when you must becomeindifferent, there is a moment when the serious expression is needed. There is atime when the face must be smiling. If one does not do what is asked of him bythe circumstance, by the moment, he certainly loses the opportunity offered to himby life, which will never come again, once it is offered. Every moment is anopportunity and it is only once offered. If it is lost it is lost. If one has made useof it one has gained. Therefore no teaching on the subject can be sufficient, wordscan never fully express how one must deal in life. If there is any source fromwhere one can get the direction on how to act in life, it is to be found in one'sheart. The exercises of the Sufi help to get to the source where one can get thedirection, the right direction, where there is a spark of the Spirit of Guidance.Those who care to be guided by the spirit, they are always guided, but those whoknow not whether such a spirit exists or does not exist, they wander through lifeas a wild horse in the woods, not knowing where it goes, why it runs, why it stands.It is a great pity to be thirsty and remain thirsty when the spring of fresh water iswithin one's reach. There can be no loss so great in life as having the sparkglittering in one's heart and yet groping in the darkness through life.Document: this typescript is the only document found in the archives. its title and date appearon a list in Gd.'s hwr. of some thirty lectures which she later designated for inclusionin one of the Headquarters' series of lessons San atha II,Suluk, item nr. 53)."},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"507A text in Sherifa Goodenough's handwriting, probablycopied from her own longhand reporting of the lecture.Suresnes, August 21, 1922Takua Taharat2A ll that exists lives on its own element, springs from its own element andreturns to its own element.

And thereason is that every stage of2 the sincere followers of the divine Message 4that he4has to go through in his life has no end of interest and happiness in it. Anotherthing is that one stage is quite different from another stage and therefore eachstage is a kind of contrary action to the 5stage which was previous5.Now these three stages may be called, receiving of the Message,assimilating of the Message, and representing the Message. For a sincere mureedthe first stage can be so interesting that he may think it is never enough, thatDocuments:01 = an old typescript of the lecture, although not from the days after it had beengiven, with typewritten above= \"Gatheka. The Message\". But from a list oflectures in Sherifa Goodenough's handwriting, given during the Summer Schoolat Suresnes in 1922, in the evenings, it appears that originally no title had beengiven to it. At some time this lecture may have been used as an \"Advice to theWorkers\", which is written in Gd.'s handwriting above. Later it seems to havebeen the intention to use it also as aGatheka, then it became a ReligiousGatheka. At the same time it was published inThe Unity of Religious Ideals,Part VI, as the second part of chapter III. In the 1930's the lecture was insertedin the collection ofSangitas (no. 120).Hq.t. = a typescript made from \"o.t .\" at Headquarters, Geneva, with three words of theInvocation written above by Sk.Hq.st . = a stencilled copy made from \"Hq.t.\", identical to it in wording, and therefore notmentioned in the notes after note 1.bk.p . = a copy of \"Hq.st.\" used by Gd. for a bookpreparation.bk. =The Unity of Religious Ideals(London, 1929), Part VI, chapter III, second half.tp . = a later typescript made from \"o.t .\" and meant for insertion in the Sangitas I.Notes:1 .

One assimilates it by the power of contemplation, by pondering over thesubjects that one hears, by practising the teachings in one's life, by looking at theworld from the point of view which has been told6, by observing one thing in itsthousand different positions,7one assimilates7. Many before assimilating theknowledge wish to reason it, wish8 to discuss it, wish8 to justify it and see how itfits in with one's9 own preconceived ideas. In this way they disturb the digestivefire of the spirit, for as the mechanism of the body is always working to helpassimilate the food, so the spirit is constantly working to assimilate all that onelearns through life. Therefore it is a matter of patience and it is taking life easilywithout troubling the mind too much over things, and allowing the knowledgewhich one has received as a food of the spirit to have time to assimilate10 .Bytrying to assimilate knowledge before the time man loses his normal health, 11justlike taking a drug to help digest food, which is not beneficial in the end.But the third process is also necessary, and those who care little for thethird stage, of representing, miss a great deal in life. A person who has seensomething beautiful, who has heard something harmonious, who has tastedsomething delicious, who has smelt something fragrant alone, has enjoyed it, andyet not completely. The complete joy is in sharing one's joy with another. Theselfish one who enjoys himself and does not care for others, whatever he enjoys,things of the earth or things of Heaven, his enjoyment is not complete. So it is inthis third stage that the following of the Message is fulfilled, when a soul has heardand has pondered upon it and has passed 12 the same blessing to the others.6 .

The world is a place where every individual wishesto be the king, so many kings and only one kingdom, and the whole tragedy of life.is accounted for by this.The wise out of wisdom make life easy. But among the wise there are twocategories, one is the master, the other is the saint. The attitude of both in life isquite contrary 9to each other9. The attitude of the saint is to feel sympathy for theothers and to see the difficulties of theet4' efssituation in life of others as of himselfand to sacrifice his wants for the need of others, realising that he knows that lifeis difficult and those who are void of wisdom have still more difficulties, as theyknow not how to surmount the difficulties of life. Out of his love, mercy andcompassion he thus sacrifices his life to the service of his fellowmen10 by makinglife easy for them. In the first place he sees the worst enemy of his fellowmen10in himself, knowing that the nature of every ego is hostile, and by being resignedto the will of his fellowmen10, by sacrificing his life's advantages for his brother,he feels he has given his fellowmen10 some relief that he could give him on hispart11. By practising this moral through life at every step that a wise man takes, hebecomes a source of happiness to all he meets and with whom he comes in12contact in life and his spirit becomes deepened in saintliness. 13The spirit of asaint results in being tuned to the whole universe, he is in tune with the climates,with the weather, with nature, with animals14, birds, he becomes in tune with thetrees and plants, in tune with all atmospheres, with all human beings of variousnatures, because he becomes the keynote to the whole universe. All harmonisewith him, the virtuous souls, the wicked souls, angels and devils, all become intune. He becomes in harmony with every object, with every element, with thosewho have passed from this earth, andwiththese whe he is in tune15 with those in theatmosphere, he is in tune 16with them16 and in tune with those whoâº3e''e live onthe17earth. The moral of a saint is very difficult, but the spirit of the saint is abenediction to himself and blessing to others13.Then there is the way of the Master, which is quite the18 opposite. 19Heconquers himself, he battles with life, he is in 20 war with destiny, he invades21 all9.

It is not a claim, it is an action which proves the Master.And yet what do they care if the world acclaims them as a saint or as a Master?What benefit is it to them?

By understanding this one canmaintain the purity of mind and it requires fortifying oneself with willpower,making the heart as a stone wall, for all that is thrown at it would22 not 23piercethrough but23 fall down.

Therefore28, by being on one's guard, and29 insteadof resisting evil, if3 one only31 would slide it over, it would run away by its ownforce. However good a person, if he 32is easy to partake32 impressions, he cannotbe trustworthy. The one who has no willpower cannot even trust himself. Thereis no willpower in fighting with another, one shows willpower in fighting with self.The one who is strong enough to keep away from his mind all undesirableimpressions will in time radiate harmony and will create the atmosphere of peace,thus making himself happy he will bring happiness to others.17.
