We need a deeper understanding and appreciation of other peoples and their civilizations, especially their moral and spiritual achievements. And we need a new vision of the Universe, a clearer insight into the fundamentals of ethics and religion? How ought men to behave? How ought nations? Does God exist? What is His Nature? How is He related to His creation? Especially, how can man approach Him? In other words, there is a general desire to know what the greatest minds, whether of East or West, have thought and said about the Truth of God and of the beings who (as most of them hold) have sprung from Him, live by Him, and return to Him. It is the object of this Series, which originated among a group of Oxford men and their friends, to place the chief ethical and religious masterpieces of the world, both Christian and non-Christian, within easy reach of the intelligent reader who is not an expert-the under­graduate, the ex-Service man who is interested in the East, the Adult Student, the intelligent public generally. The Series will contain books of three kinds: translations, reproductions of ethical and religious art, and Background Books showing the surroundings in which the literature and art arose and developed. These books overlap each other. Religious art, both in East and West, often illustrates a religious text, and in suitable cases the text and pictures will be printed together to complete each other. The Background Books will often consist largely of translations. The volumes will be prepared by scholars of distinction, 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"6 SUFISM who will try to make them, not only scholarly, but intel­ligible and enjoyable. Their contents will also be very varied-ethical and social, biographical, devotional, philosophic and mystical, whether in poetry, in pictures or in prose. There is a great wealth of material. Confucius lived in a time much like our own, when State was at war with State and the people suffering and disillusioned; and the \"Classics\" he pre­served or inspired show the social virtues that may unite families, classes and States into one great fa mily, in obedience to the Will of Heaven. Asoka and Akbar (both of them great patrons of art) ruled a vast Empire on the principles of religious faith. There are the moral anecdotes and moral maxims of the Jewish and Muslim writers of the Middle Ages. There are the beautiful tales of cou.rage, love and fidelity in the Indian and Persian epics. Shakespere's plays show that he thought the true relation between man and man is love. Here and there a volume will illustrate the unethical or less ethical man and the difficulties that beset him. Then there are the devotional and philosophic works. The lives and legends (legends often express religious truth with clarity and beauty) of the Buddha, of the parents of Mary, of Francis of Assisi, and the exquisite sculptures and paintings that illustrate them. Indian and Christian religious music, and the words of prayer and praise which the musicintensifies. There are the Prophets and Apocalyptic writers, Zarathustrian and Hebrew; the Greek philosophers and the Christian thinkers-Greek, Latin, Medieval and Modern-whom they so deeply influenced. There is too the Hindu, Buddhist and Christian teaching expressed in such great monuments as the Indian temples, Barabudur (the Chartres of Asia), and Ajanta, Chartres itself and the Sistine Chapel.

In God-loving India the poets, musicians, sculptors and painters inspired by the spiritual worship of Krishna and Rama, as well as the philosophic mystics from the Upanishads onward. The two great Taoists, Lao-tze and Chuang-tze and the Sung mystical painters in China, Riimi and other Sufis in Islam, Plato and Plotinus, followed by \"Dionysius,\" Dante, Eckhai:,t, Teresa and other great mystics and mystical painters in many Christian lands. Mankind is hungry, but the feast is there, though it is locked up and hidden away. It is the aim of this Series to put it within reach, so that, like the heroes of Homer, we may stretch out our hands to the good cheer laid before us. No doubt the great religions differ in fundamental respects. But they are not nearly so far from one another a:s they seem. We think they are further off than they are largely because we so often misunderstand and misrepresent them. Those whose own religion is dogmatic have often been as ready to learn from other teachings as those who are liberals in religion. Above all there is an enormous amount of common ground in the great religions, concern­ing too the most fundamental matters. There is frequent agreement on the Divine Nature; God is the One, Self­Subsisting Reality, knowing Himself, and therefore loving and rejoicing in Himself. Nature and finite spirits are in some way subordinate kinds ofBeing, or merely appearances of the Divine, the One. The Way of man's approach or return to God is in essence the same, in Christian and in non-Christian teaching. It has three stages: an ethical stage, then one of knowledge and love, leading to the mystical Union of the soul with God. Each stage will be illustrated in these volumes. Something of all this may (it is hoped) be learnt from these books and pictures in this Series.

Much labour and erudition however have also been expended upon the attempt to shew how one fo rm of mysticism has been influenced by another; while proof is often difficult or even impossible in such elusive matters, it is generally agreed that no religious movement can come into being or develop without having contact with other established faiths or denominations which are bound to leave their impress upon the new creation of thought and emotion. In giving a necessarily brief account of Sufism, which is the name given to the mysticism of Islam, it is proposed fo r the sake of brevity to accept these two propositions as proven; no time will therefore be wasted upon reviewing or restating the argument, in progress for more th.an a century, that the Sufis owed much or little of what they did or said to Christian, Jewish, Gnostic, Neoplatonic, Hermetic, Zoroastrian or Buddhist example. Having noted that the area in which Islam and Sufism originated and flourished is that which witnessed the rise and triumph or rout of several other creeds each with its own particular mysticism, we shall leave this fact to speak for itself, and confine our attention to presenting Sufism as if it were an isolated manifestation; viewing the movement from within as an aspect of Islam, as though these other factors which certainly determined its growth did not exist. By following II"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12 SUFISM this procedure it is hoped to draw a picture recognisable as a unity in itself, a picture of a mysticism developing out of a single creed and ritual, which may then be compared and contrasted with the mysticisms of other faiths and so be seen for what it really is. For while mysticism is un­doubtedly a universal constant, its variations can be observed to be very clearly and characteristically shaped by the several religious systems upon which they were based. In this varied company Sufism may be defined as the mystical movement of an uncompromising Monotheism. The central core of Islamic teaching is the doctrine that God is One, that He has no partners or equals to share or contest His Omnipotence, that He admits the right of none to vary His Decrees or intercede with His Judgments. Islam recognises no incarnate God, no Saviour; the matter lies between Allah the One Lord (rabb) , and every man His creature and servant ('abd) . A few men have been called to be God's Prophets, whose duty, from Adam to Muhammad, was simply to call mankind to Him. They are the vehicles of the Divine Message to humanity, which varies not from age to age or people to ਏpeople. Otherwise the Prophets are men like other men, except as God has and may have willed them to be the recipients of His especial Grace and Favour. The Prophet is certainly not to be worshipped, for this would be polytheism (shirk) and infidelity (kufr), though he is obviously to be revered and imitated, since he has been spoken to by God and chosen by God to be His messenger. For the Muslim, God's Message is wholly contained in the Koran, a volume of revelations sent down from time to time to the man Muhammad. This Book does not annul but rather confirms the Divine Message as preserved, though in a corrupt and distorted tradition, in the Holy Scriptures of the Jews and the Christians. The Koran is"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"  13  INTRODUCTORYaccordingly the supreme authority to which the Muslim mystic looks for guidance and justification. The manner in which the Koran was revealed to Muhammad is naturally of great interest to the Sufi, for is it not a visible proof that God speaks to man? And since it is his ardent desire himself to hear the Voice of God, he must be concerned to know how it came about that the Founder of his faith was so privileged as to be throughout his prophethood in constant touch with his Creator. Therefore the Sufi is bound to study the life of Muhammad (sira), to comprehend his code of conduct (sunna), and to be intimate with the Traditions (hadith), handed down from generation to generation, first by word of mouth and later in writing, which are the unique and abundant source upon which he may draw for enlightenment. The hadith is the second pillar after the Koran upon which he, like all Muslims, rests the fabric of his faith and life. From the earliest days of Islam the Prophet lacked not for faithful followers who sought to copy his example and live righteously and humbly in the sight of God and man. The uprightness of their conduct and the fullness of their piety were so pleasing to their Creator that of His Infinite Goodness He chose them to be His \"friends\" {auliyd\\ sing. wall), a term which afterwards became more or less synonymous with the Christian \"saint\". The Sufi, who desires earnestly to be admitted to like intimacy and privilege, is diligent in learning how these holy men conducted themselves publicly and in private, committing to mind and heart the words of wisdom and sanctity, the songs of devotion and heavenly love which were remem­bered of them. These he took for his third pillar. Finally, in a life of sincere obedience to the Will of God, lived abstemiously and meditatively, guided by the Word of God, the Life of His Prophet, and the example of His"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14  SUFISM  saints, the Sufi is himself the recipient of such marks of favour as God may choose to vouchsafe him. Passing through the various states (akwdl, sing, hdl) and stages (maqdmdt, sing, maqdm) of the spiritual pilgrimage, he encounters many proofs of the special relationship in which he stands to God (kardmdt, \"graces\"). These personal experiences constitute the fourth pillar of his temple of righteousness. So guided and favoured, the Muslim mystic may hope even in this mortal life to win a glimpse of immortality, by passing away from self (/and') into the consciousness of survival in God (baqd*). After death and judgment, he aspires to dwell forever with the angels and prophets, the saints and saved, in the near and blissful Presence of the Almighty,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"TWO THE WORD OF GOD MuHAMMAD, the son of 'Abd Allah and Amina of the aristocratic tribe of Quraish, was born at Mecca, in the year A.D. 571 according to Arab historians. His parents were noble but impoverished members of a proud clan; his father died before the infant was born, his mother when he was about six years old. He grew up in the protection first of his grandfather 'Abd al-Muttalib and then, when he died, of his uncle Abu Talib, a trader. As a boy, Muhammad roamed the hills about Mecca watching over the family's flocks; thus early he grew accustomed to the loneliness of orphandom and the desolation of Arabia's arid wastes. At twenty-five he married Khadija, a wealthy widow fifteen years his senior, and during her lifetime took no other partner; he was now fo r the first time comfortable in circumstance; he attended to his wife's business with scrupulous care and honesty. Still in the intervals of his work he often retired to the hills which he had known so well as a poor lad. There, it is said, he meditated upon the cruel tribal strife which drenched the sands of Arabia in blood, the abominations of idolatry and licentiousness that reigned in the noisy towns. Towards his fortieth year he experienced a strange visitation which proved to be the beginningofhis prophetic mission. Absorbed in thought within the cave of Hira, he suddenly heard a voice bidding him \"Recite in the Name of thy Lord\" 1: a brief message followed which encouraged him to believe-for he was more or less familiar with Jewish tradition-that he had been called to prophesy to man. After an interval during which no further revelations 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 SUFISM came (so that he began to be torn with doubts and mis­givings), he presently received a yet clearer message. Hurrying home in a state of extreme agitation, he begged Khadija to wrap him in a mantle; as he lay quiet and attentive he heard the voice as urgent as before. \"0 thou enwrapped in thy mantle, arise and warn!\" 2 Thereafter, and during the remainder of his earthly life which closed in A.D.632, Muhammad heard the voice-identified as that of the angel Gabriel-at regular intervals. Whatever he heard he repeated to his kinsmen and followers : in course of time the series of revelations was gathered together into a book and called the Koran-a word which means \"recitation\" and is derived from the same root as the first word he ever heard descending out of heaven. The Koran is a volume of scriptures consisting of many varied elements ranging from apocalyptic admonition­visions of heaven and hell and the summons to repent betimes-to rhapsodic accounts of the missions of former prophets, to ritual and legal ordinance. It is a confirma­tion and not· an abrogation of the revelations accorded by God to earlier messengers, including Abraham who built the Holy Shrine (Ka'ba) of Mecca, Moses the lawgiver of the Jews, and Jesus son of Mary, Word of God, who was not as the Christians alleged killed upon the Cross, a simulacrum being divinely substituted fo r him. While the Muslim Scriptures prescribe in detail the religious duties incumbent upon the believer, and regulate his behaviour as a servant of God and a member of the faithful community, we are not immediately concerned here to summarise these aspects of the Koran. We are interested rather to examine those passages beloved by the Sufis as testifying to God's Nature and Attributes, His Self- revelation· to mankind through the voice of Gabriel speaking to Muhammad. For these mystical texts are the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"17 TH E WORD OF GOD chief encouragement and justification of the Sufi in his belief that he also may commune with God. While God is presented throughout the Koran as the One Omnipotent Lord, \"Master of the Day of J udgment,\"3 Omniscient beyond the understanding of men so that \"they comprehend not aught of His knowledge,\" 4 yet He repeatedly commands His servants to consider His works and contemplate His creation, for by that mean's He may be known as God. \"Do they not look upon the camel, how she is created?\"6 God asks; and again, \"Have they never looked up at the birds subjected to Him in Heaven's vault? None holdeth them in hand but God: in these are signs fo r such as believe.\" 6 The bee too furnishes \"a sign for those who consider.\" 7 In a noble passage God pro­claims, \"Assuredly in the creation of the Heavens and of the Earth; and in the alternation of night and day; and in the ships which pass through the seas with things useful to man; and in the rain which God sendeth down from Heaven, giving life thereby to the earth after it was dead, scattering over it all manner of cattle; and in the change of the winds, and in the clouds that are made to do service between the Heaven and the Earth; in all these things are signs for those who understand. \"8 So from the greatest and most majestic aspects of creation, to the least and lowliest: ''Verily God is not ashamed tosetforth as well the instance of a gnat.\" 9 \"If My servants enquire of thee concerning Me,\" God charges Muhammad, \"lo, I am near\"10; indeed, He is \"nearer to him than his own jugular vein.\"1 1 If a man would see the marvellous works of God, he is bidden to \"journey through the earth, and see how He hath brought fo rth created beings\"12਎a command which the wandering friars of Islam took to heart, and quoted in support of their way oflife. \"Whithersoever ye turn, there is the Face ofGod''18: this most beloved of all texts has been the inspira­"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18 SUFISM tion of many fine sayings and poems. But perhaps the most justly celebrated of all such passages is the so-called Light-Verse and those following it, the subject of constant meditation and commentary. God is the Light of the Heavens and of the Earth. His Light is like a niche wherein is a lamp, the lamp encased in glass, the glass as it were a glistening star. From a blessed tree it is lighted, the olive neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil would well nigh shine out, even though fire touched it not. It is light upon light. God guideth whom He will to His light, and God setteth forth parables to men, for God knoweth all things. In the temples which God hath allowed to be reared, that His Name may therein be remembered, do men praise Him morn and even: men whom neither merchandise nor traffic beguiles from the remembrance of God, and from the observance of prayer, and the payment of the stated alms, through fear of the day when hearts shall throb and eyes shall roll, that fo r their most excellent works God may recompense them, and of His bounty increase it to them more and more, fo r God maketh provision for whom He pleaseth without measure. But as to the infidels, their works are like the vapour in a plain which the thirsty dreameth to be water, until when he cometh unto it, he findeth it not aught, but findeth that God is with him; and He fully payeth him his account: for swift to account is God: or like the darkness on the deep sea when covered by billows riding upon billows, above which are clouds : darkness upon darkness. When a man reacheth fo rth his hand, he well nigh cannot see it! He to whom God shall not give light, no light at all hath he. Hast thou not seen how all in the Heavens and in the Earth uttereth the praise of God?-the very birds as they spread their wings? Every creature knoweth its prayer and its praise: and God knoweth what they do. God's is the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth: and unto God shall be the final return. 1' God spoke of old to every prophet in turn, each according to his especial mark of favour: \"to Moses and"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"19 THE WORD OF GOD Aaron the illumination, and a light and a warning for the God-fearing\" ; 15 \"unto Abraham his direction, fo r We knew him worthy\"; 1 8 \"and We gave Solomon insight into the affair, and on both of them (David and Solomon) We bestowed wisdom and insight; and We constrained the mountains and the birds to join with David in Our praise, and to Solomon We subjected the strongly blowing wind: it sped at his bidding to the land We had blessed.\" 17 God spoke to Moses through the miracle of the burning bush; 18 \"and when Moses came at Our set time and his Lord spake with him, he said, '0 Lord, shew Thyself to me, that I may look upon Thee.' He said, 'Thou shalt not see Me; but look towards the mountain, and if it abide firm in its place, then shalt thou see Me.' And when God manifested Himself to the mountain He turned it into dust; and Moses fell in a swoon.\" 1 9 So in due time Muhammad too was vouchsafed a wonderfu l mark of Divine favour, when \"He carried His servant by night from the sacred temple (of Mecca) to the temple that is more remote (of Jerusalem) whose precincts We have blessed, that We might shew him of Our signs.\" 2° Concerning this miraculous journey a wealth of pious legend grew up to which reference will be made later; fo r the present it suffices to refer to another passage in the Koran which is commonly taken as expanding upon the very brief hint just quoted, and describing visions of Gabriel experienced by Muhammad on two separate occasions. \"It is naught but a revelation that was revealed : one terrible in power taught it him, endued with wisdom. Evenly poised he -stood in the highest part of the horizon: then came he nearer and approached, and was at the distance of two bow-shots, or even closer. And He revealed to His servant what He revealed; his heart falsified not what he saw. Do ye then dispute with him concerning what he saw? He had seen"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 SUFISM him also another time, near the Sidra-tree which marks the boundary, near which is the garden of repose. When the Sidra-tree was covered with what covered it, his eye turned not aside, nor did it wander, fo r he saw the greatest of the signs of his Lord.\" 21 Some commentators took these mysterious words to signify an actual vision of God; but this question came to be fraught with grave theological problems, and the more cautious view inclined to the theory that the reference was to angels, or a sheet of gold. It has remained a subject of serious dispute whether Muhammad was in the flesh or the spirit when he saw these wonders. If it should be objected that the fo regoing marvels were accorded to prophets only, who are by definition specially privileged among men-and Muhammad being the Seal of the Prophets, none after him may hope to be favoured by God in like manner-yet the Koran has a message no less encouraging fo r every individual man. For man, by virtue of his descent from Adam, is created higher than the angels; for him indeed was all creation made. \"He it is Who created for you all that is on Earth, then proceeded to the Heaven, and into seven Heavens did He fashion it: and He knoweth all things. When thy Lord said to the angels, 'Verily, I am about to place one in my stead (khalifa) on earth', they said, 'Wilt thou place there one who will do ill therein and shed blood, when we celebrate Thy praise -and extol Thy holiness?' God said, 'Verily, I know what ye know not.' And He taught Adam the names of all things, and then set them before the angels, and said, 'Tell Me the names of these, if ye are endued with wisdom.' They said, 'Praise be to Thee! We have no knowledge but what Thou hast given us to know. Thou, Thou art the Knowing, the Wise.' He said, '0 Adam, inform them of their names.' And when he had informed them of their names, He said, 'Did I not say to you that I"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"21 THE WORD OF GOD know the hidden things of the Heavens and of the Earth, and that I know what ye bring to light, and what ye hide?' And when We said to the angels, 'Bow down and worship Adam,' then worshipped they all, save Eblis. He refused and swelled with pride, and became one of the un­believers.\" 2 2 Not only was man created in order that he might be God's viceregent in the earth; even before he or aught else was made, man entered into an eternal covenant (mithiiq) to worship God as the One Lord. \"And when thy Lord brought fo rth their descendants from the reins of the sons of Adam, and took them to witness against themselves, 'Am I not', said He, 'your Lord?' They said, 'Yea, we witness it'.\" 23 We shall see how in later times this verse, interpreted as referring to an event which took place in pre-eternity, served as the fo cal point in an elaborate theosophy. \"Adore, and draw thou nigh\" 24: these were the last words uttered by the Voice in the first revelation of all. Elsewhere in the Koran we are told that every godly act of man is preceded by an act of God's favour towards man. \"Then He turned to them, that they might turn'', u He said, referring to three backsliders among Muham­mad's immediate followers who repented. \"God was well pleased with them, and they were well pleased with God\" 26: so God describes the blessed saints in Paradise; fo r \"He loveth them, and they love Him\". 27 This last text is of great significance as supporting the Sufi doctrine of love (mahabba) and as providing the ultimate authority for the idea of a trinity of Lover, Loved and Love. The conception of a remote, indifferent Potentate of the Universe is wholly overthrown by this picture of the Merciful Allah ever taking the first step towards man, the elect of His creation, to draw him unto Him by the powerful cords of love."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"22 SUFISM Yet more; there is a passage, relating to the victorious battle of Badr, where God says, \"So it was not ye who slew them, but God slew them; thou didst not cast when thou didst cast, but God cast\". 28 These words, constantly meditated, seemed to the Sufi conclusive evidence that God even acts through the instrumentality of man when He finds man worthy to become His instrument. Just as the miracle of the gravelstones and dust scattered by God into the eyes of the Meccans at Badr decisively influenced the issue in the struggle between faith and unbelief, so at all times God is able and ready to work wonders, in the persons of His saints, to prove the realities of true religion. The foregoing are some of the passages in the Koran into which the Sufis read a mystical significance; there are many others besides, too numerous fo r quotation and too elusive in the ordinary way to carry much conviction, which are sprinkled through the pages of the Sufi books as testimony to their teachings. \"Remember God often\" is a phrase which constantly recurs in the Koran: in its context it has an obvious, neutral meaning, but the Sufis interpreted it in a special way, and the word \"remem­brance\" (dhikr) acquired in time a very particular connotation. \"Every thing upon the earth passeth away, save His face\" 29 seems where it stands to be innocent of all but its apparent intention; it is taken by the Sufis as the peg upon which to hang their characteristic doctrine of the passing away (fana') of human attributes through Union with God, whereby the mystic achieves the eternal continuance ( baqa') of spiritual life in Him. To understand the extreme lengths to which the Sufis were prepared to go in reading esoteric meanings into the quite simple language of their Scriptures, it is necessary to remember that the Koran was committed to memory by all deeply religious men and women, and recited con­stantly, aloud or in the heart; so that the mystic was in a"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"23 THE WORD OF GOD state of uninterrupted meditation upon the Holy Book. Many passages which would otherwise pass without special notice were therefore bound to arrest their atten­tion, already sufficiently alert, and to quicken their imagination, already fired by the discipline of their austerities and the rigour of their internal life. Minds naturally subtle-for the Arabs and Persians proved apt disciples of Aristotle and Plotinus-found no difficulty in applying to the Koran those methods whereby Philo had philosophised the Pentateuch. Finally the very style of the Muslim Scriptures-rhapsodic, nervous, highly rhetorical -proved ideally suited to such extravagances of inter­pretation; while its occasional real obscurities, which provided orthodox exegetes with so much opportunity to display their lexicographical learning, added fu rther fuel to the flame of mystic fervour. The esoteric exposition of the Koran became a central point in the hard training of the Sufi."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THREE THE LIFE OF THE PROPHET CoNTEMPORARY information on the life of the founder of Islam is confined-apart from such hints as the Koran itself offers-to anecdotes or \"traditions\" (hadith) ascribed to one or other of his many early followers and handed down from generation to generation in a chain of trans­mission. It was not until the second century of the new faith that serious attempts began to be made to collect and codify this extremely varied and scattered material. The hadith acquired ever greater importance as the theology and religious law of Islam, already from earliest times the subject of ardent debate and bitter dispute, made increasing demands upon such sources of evidence as might supplement the insufficiently detailed authority of the Koran. The religion now being torn by faction and schism, it became the interest of partisan champions of the clashing. viewpoints to gather up-or, as their opponents were quick· to allege, invent-Prophetic sanctions to support their rival claims. The third century (or the ninth by Christian reckoning) produced the great canonical collections of hadith, notably those of al-Bukhari (d.256/87o) and Muslim (d.261/875). These were accepted by the accredited theologians and lawyers as comprising all the traditions whose authenticity had stood the searching test of historical scholarship applied with a rigorous zeal fo r orthodoxy. By this time the Sufi movement was firmly established, and the mystics had assembled many traditions favourable to their own outlook which failed to qualify fo r admission to the canon. This is not to say, of course, that the Sufis did not also 24 "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"  25  THE LIFE OF THE PROPHETdraw to a very considerable extent upon the accepted corpus of hadith as well; but it is always the eccentric that attracts most attention, and when in due course Sufism encountered the hostility of those who suspected the soundness of its doctrines and practices, the Sufis were liable to be condemned as weak in Tradition. When we examine the sayings and anecdotes connected by the Sufis with Muhammad, we find that a substantial proportion of the most telling—from their point of view— is rejected by Bukhari and Muslim. This need not wholly disconcert us, however, when we remember that Bukhari \"selected out of the 600,000 traditions he collected from 1000 sheikhs in the course of sixteen years of travel and labour in Persia, al-'Iraq, Syria, al-Hijaz and Egypt some 7275.\" * All the same it is important to have in mind that by the highest standards of Muslim scholarship this material, of fundamental significance to the Sufi, is suspect. As in the preceding chapter, we shall here cite some characteristic examples of the hadith which are most fre­quently upon the lips of Sufi writers and apologists as justifying various aspects of their teachings, not entering into the controversy whether the examples quoted are the genuine utterance of Muhammad or not. We shall divide the material into two parts, representing the ascetic and the theosophical tendencies of Sufism, remarking that the \"ascetic55 traditions are, as might be expected, far less suspect in the eyes of orthodoxy than the \"theosophical.\" \"Poverty is my pride.55 This saying of Muhammad, afterwards taken as the watchword of many Sufi orders, reflects the generally accepted view that the founder of Islam lived lowly and humbly all his days, and that the great power and increasing riches which accrued to him in the later years of his mission did not change the austerity of his habits. The Prophet is said to have prayed, \"O God, make me live lowly and die lowly and rise from the dead"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"26   SUFISM   among the lowly\"; he also said, \"On the Day of Resurrec­tion God will say, 'Bring ye My loved ones nigh unto Me5; then the angels will say, 'Who are Thy loved ones?3 and God will answer them, saying, 'The poor and destitute.5 55 2 There is abundant authority in the Koran for the view that the amassing of worldly possessions is displeasing to God: \"The life of this world is but a sport, and a play, and a gaud, something to boast about among yourselves.553 To Muhammad the Final Judgment seemed a near reality, and he constantly urged his followers to abstain from material pleasures in order to lay up treasure in Heaven. \"Do not strain thine eye after the good things wherewith We have provided a few of them—the gauds of the present life, to try them thereby55 4: riches were given by God to a few men, not as a mark of superior worth or favour, but to prove their faith. An angel is said to have come down to the Prophet out of heaven with a message from God, saying, \"These are the keys of the treasures of the earth, that they may be thine, both gold and silver: in them thou mayst dwell until the Day of Resur­rection, and they shall in no wise lessen the portion that is laid up for thee with God.55 But the Prophet rejected the proffered riches, saying, \"Once I hunger, and once I am filled,55 counting this offer to be a testing and a trial from God.5 Poverty brings out two virtues: it encourages abste­miousness and the eschewing of unlawful pleasure, and it stimulates trust in God. The Prophet once said to Haritha, an illustrious Companion, \"How farest thou this day, O Haritha?55 He replied, \"Believing truly, O Messenger of God.55 \"And what,55 asked the Prophet, \"is the truth of thy belief?55 Haritha answered, \"I have turned my soul away from this world.

The Prophet said, \"If ye trusted in God as ye should, He would sustain you even as He sustains the birds, which in the morning go forth hungry, and return in the evening filled.\"7 It is sincere trust (tawakkul) that converts the fear natural to the heart of sinful man into an abundant hope of God's forgiveness; it sustains him in adversity, and humbles him when prosperous, so that he continues all his days well pleased with God, a state which we have seen from the Koran to be symptomatic of God's pleasure with His servant.8 The Prophet relates in one of his descriptions of Paradise how the blessed there petition for God's good pleasure, and God replies, \"It is My good pleasure that hath made you to dwell within My house, and to attain My bless­ing.\" • As trust, leading to satisfaction (ridd), brings man for the first time into a partnership of spiritual emotion with God, so it leads on to the yet higher sentiment of loving God, a state similarly preceded by a like disposition on God's part.10 The Prophet said, \"God said, In no way does My servant so draw nigh Me as when performing those duties which I have imposed on him; and My servant continues to draw near to Me through works of superero­gation, until I love him. And when I love him, I am his ear, so he hears by Me, and his eye, so that he sees by Me, and his tongue, so that he speaks by Me, and his hand, so that he takes by Me.\"1 x This celebrated Tradition forms the basis of an elaborate structure of mystical theosophy in the writings of the later Sufis.

Muhammad is even said to have declared, \"He that hath seen me hath seen God.\"14 There being in every man that which God loves, it behoves the mystic to examine himself constantly until he truly knows himself, for \"Whoso knows himself, knows his Lord.\"1 5 \"Consult thy heart,\" the Prophet said to one of his followers, \"and thou wilt hear the secret ordinance of God proclaimed by the heart's inward knowledge, which is real faith and divinity.\"16 On another occasion he said, \"Beware of the discernment of the true believer, for he sees by the light of God.\"17 By loving God and knowing God, the faithful can realise supernatural powers; for the Prophet said, \"If ye knew God as He ought to be known, ye would walk on the seas, and the mountains would move at your call.\"18 We have referred above to the Night Journey (isrd9) of Muhammad, which for the Sufis constitutes the Prophet's supreme mystical experience and an example which they may aspire to follow. It is therefore not without significance that Abu '1-Qasim al-Qushairi (d.465/1074), author of the most famous and authoritative treatise on Sufism in Arabic, wrote a separate work on this theme in which he collected together several versions of the Ascent (mVrdj)"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"29 THE LIFE OF THE PROPHET together with the comments of celebrated Sufis on the enigmatic references to the event which are contained in the Koran.

Upon the way he met the earlier prophets who without exception acknowledged his superiority, and the supremacy of his community over all others; finally he was privileged to hear the Voice of God proceeding from the Throne. When he said, \"0 God, I know not how to utter Thy praise,\" God answered, \"0 Muhammad, if thou speakest not, I will speak; if thou deemest thyself unworthy to praise Me, I will make the universe thy deputy, that all its atoms may praise Me in thy name.\" 19 Some went so far as to declare that upon this night Muhammad actually saw God, but this report was denied by 'A'isha the Prophet's favourite wife, and rejected by the majority of Sufis who held to the orthodox opinion that God has never been seen in this world. 90 It was with reference to this miraculous experience that the Prophet said, \"I am not as one of you; verily I pass the night with my Lord, and He gives me fo od and drink,\" and on another occasion he declared, \"I am with God in a state in which none of the Cherubim nor any Prophet is capable of being contained with me.\" 21 In an ecstasy of bliss Muhammad prayed to God, \"Do not transport me to yonder world of affliction!

When Abii Bakr succeeded to the leadership, and the world in its entirety came to him in abasement, he did not lift up his head on that account, or make any pre­tensions; he wore a single garment, which he used to pin together, so that he was known as the 'man of the two pins.' 'Umar b. al-Khattab, who also ruled the world in its entirety, lived on bread and olive-oil; his clothes were patched in a dozen places, some of the patches being of leather; and yet there were opened unto him the treasures ofChosroes and Caesar. As for 'Uthman, he was like one of his slaves in dress and appearance; of him it is related that he was seen coming out of one of his gardens with a faggot of firewood on his shoulders, and when questioned on the matter he said, 'I wanted to see whether my soul would refuse.' When 'Ali succeeded to the rule, he bought a waistband for four dirhams and a shirt for five dirhams; finding the sleeve of his garment too long, he went to a cobbler and taking his knife cut off the sleeve level with the tips of his fingers; yet this same man divided the world right and left. 1 So the \"Righteous Caliphs\" appeared to al-Kharraz, fa mous mystic of the third/ninth century; and the report of their holiness was widely accepted. With the succession of the cunning Mu'awiya (661-80) all was changed; worldly considerations supplanted spiritual aspiration as the basis of government; while Mu'awiya's son and heir Yazid (680-3) was a confirmed drunkard. The transference of the capital from Mecca to Damascus was itself sympto­matic of this decline in piety; the enervating effeminacy of Syria replaced the ascetic manliness of Arabia.

Secure in the conviction of their own righteousness, they did not fe ar to thunder denunciation and threaten the imminence of Divine punishment; and it became the well approved diversion of puritanical circles to listen to the eloquent jeremiads of the ancient faithful. There was one honourable exception to the rule of caliphal ungodliness in the person of 'Umar b.

The tenor of al-Hasan's message, which may be taken as typical of the ascetics of the first age and has in it nothing of the theosophy which developed later, is illustrated by some passages from a letter which he wrote to his exalted patron. 2 Beware of this world with all wariness; for it is like to a snake, smooth to the touch, but its venom is deadly.Turn away from whatsoever delights thee in it, for the little companioning thou wilt have of it; put off from thee its cares, for that thou hast seen its sudden chances, and knowest for sure that thou shalt be parted from it; endure firmly its hardships, for the ease that shall presently be thine.

Even had the Almighty not pronounced upon the world at all, nor coined fo r it any similitude, nor charged men to abstain from it, yet would the world itself have awakened the slumberer, and roused the heedless; how much the more then, seeing that God has Himself sent us a warning against it, an exhortation regarding it! For this world has neither worth nor weight with God; so slight it is, it weighs not with God so much as a pebble or a single clod of earth; as I am told, God has created nothing more hateful to Him than this world, and from the day He created it He has not looked upon it, so much He hates it. It was offered to our Prophet with all its keys and treasures, and that would not have lessened him in God's sight by so much as the wing of a gnat, but he refused to accept it; and nothing prevented him from accepting it-fo:r there is naught that can lessen him in God's sight-but that he knew that God hated a thing, and therefore he hated it, and God despised a thing, and he despised it, and God abased a thing, and he abased it. Had he accepted it, his acceptance would have been a proof that he loved it; but he disdained to love what his Creator hated, and to exalt what his Sovereign had debased. As for Muhammad, he bound a stone upon his belly when he was hungry; and as for Moses, the skin of his belly shewed as green as grass because of it all: he asked naught of God, the day he took refuge in the shade, save fo od to eat when he was hungered, and it is said of him in the stories that God revealed to him, 'Moses, when thou seest poverty ap­proaching, say, Welcome to the badge of the righteous! and when thou seest wealth approaching, say, Lo ! a sin whose punishment has been put on aforetime.' If thou shouldst wish, thou mightest name as a third the Lord of the Spirit and the Word (Jesus) , for in his affair there is a marvel; he used to say, 'My daily bread is hunger, my badge is fear, my raiment is wool, my mount is my foot, my lantern at night is the moon, my fire by day is the sun, and my fruit and fragrant herbs are such things as the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"35 THE ASCETICS earth brings forth for the wild beasts and cattle.

All these hated what God hates, and despised what God despises; then the righteous thereafter followed in their path and kept close upon their tracks. Here we already see the establishment of an important Sufi theory, that poverty and abstinence were practised by the prophets themselves; and it is interesting to note how al-Hasan al-Basri attributed to Jesus and David the austere practices which presently characterised so dis­tinctively the Sufi ascetics, even to the wearing of wool. Ibn Sirin (d. I 10/728), a celebrated scholar contem­porary with al-Hasan who attacked the latter's teachings and habits on many accounts,3 in particular condemned the wearing of wool (suf), which was already being affected by certain devotees, as being an imitation of Jesus, saying that \"he preferred to fo llow the example of our Prophet who clothed himself in cotton.\" 4 The nickname Sufi, which is undoubtedly derived from the Arabic word for wool, appears to have been applied in the first place to a certain Abu Hashim 'Uthman b. Sharik of Kufa, who died about the year 160/776; by the middle of the third/ ninth century it had become the regular appellation of those who practised austerity; in the fourth/tenth century it also acquired a theosophical connotation.5 From Basra and Kufa the ascetic movement spread to all parts of the Islamic world, notably to Khorasan which during the second half of the second/eighth century ecame an important fo cus of political and religious"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"g6 SUFISM activity; it was in Khorasan that the plot was hatched which overthrew the U mayyads and established the Abbasid caliphate. To this remote province, which had once been a flourishing centre of Buddhism, belonged the celebrated Ibrahim b.

'My father was of Balkh,' Ibrahim b. Adham is reported to have said, 8 'and he was one of the kings of Khorasan. He was a man of wealth, and taught me to love hunting. One day I was out riding with my dog, when a hare or a fox started. I pricked on my horse; then I heard a voice behind me saying, 'It was not for this thou wast created: it was not this thou wast charged to do.' I stopped, and looked right and left, but saw no one; and I said, 'God curse the devil!' Then I pricked on my horse again; and I heard a voice clearer than before, '0 Ibrahim ! It was not for this thou wast created: it was not this thou wast charged to do.' I stopped once more, and looked right and left, and still I saw no one; and I repeated, 'God curse the devil!' Then I pricked on my horse once more; and I heard a voice from the bow of my saddle, '0 Ibrahim! It was not for this thou was.t created: it was not this thou wast charged to do.' I stopped, and said, 'I have been roused! I have been roused! A warning has come to me from the Lord of the Worlds.

Then he said, 'Every night one chick­pea.' I said, 'What stirs thee in thy heart, so that this pea suffices thee?'

He has no trust nor hope save in God; his trust and hope are exalted above every created thing, and repose in the Creator of all things. He labours and exhausts himself, and wears out his body for God's sake, so that his eyes are sunken and his ribs stare; and God requites him therefor with increase of intellect and strength of heart, and all the things besides that He has stored up for him in the world to come.

The servitor said to him, 'Thy words do not accord with thy deeds.' S}laqiq said, 'How is that?' The other replied, 'Thou hast asserted that thou hast a Creator, Who is All-providing and Omnipotent; yet thou hast exiled thyself to this place in search of thy provision. If what thou sayest is true, He Who has provided for thee here is the same as He Who provides for thee there; so spare thyself this trouble.' Shaqiq said, 'The cause of my abstinence (;::uhd) was the remark of that Turk.' And he returned, and gave away all he possessed to the poor, and sought after knowledge. In Shaqiq's discour&e, so much of it as is preserved by later writers, we discern the beginnings of a formal system of self-discipline, such as the Sufis of the third /ninth century developed much further. His pupil Hatim al­Asamm (d.237 /852), himself a noted member of the school of Khorasan, quoted him to the following effect. 14 If a man continued alive for two hundred years and did not know these four things, he should not (God willing) escape fr om Hell:-first, the knowledge (ma'rifa) ofGod; second, the knowledge of himself; third, the know­ledge of God's commandment and prohibition; fourth, the knowledge of God's adversary and his own. The interpretation of the knowledge of God is, that thou knowest in thy heart that there is no other who gives and withholds, hurts and advantages. Knowledge of self is to know thyself, that thou canst not hurt or advantage, and that thou hast not the power to do anything at all; and likewise to oppose the self, which means, to be sub­missive to God. Knowledge of God's commandment and prohibition is to be aware that God's commandment rules over thee and that thy provision depends upon God, and to trust in this provision, being sincere in all thy actions;"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"40  SUFISM  and the sign of such sincerity is not to have in thee two characteristics, namely covetousness and impatience. Knowledge of God's adversary means being aware that thou hast an enemy, and that God will not accept from thee anything save it be as a result of warfare; and the warfare of the heart consists in making war against the enemy, and striving with him, and exhausting him. Typical also of the Persian school of asceticism is cAbd Allah b. al-Mubarak of Merv (d. 181/797), claimed by the Sufis as one of them, who wrote a book on self-denial [Kitab al~Zuhd) which has survived.15 It consists of a collection of hadith relating to abstinence, and is therefore of some importance not only as being the earliest of such specialised collections but also because it shews the ascetic at work assembling evidence in the Prophet's life and preaching to justify his own. A somewhat later native of Merv was Bishr b. al-Harith al-Hafi (\"Barefoot\") (d.227/841), who in his own words was \"a rogue, a gangster\" before he heard the call to God.16 He taught a doctrine of indifference to the opinions of other men that foreshadows a later development in Sufism, the Malama­tiya movement which came to acquire much notoriety, Bishr is reported to have said, \"Conceal your virtuous actions, as you conceal your evil deeds,\" and again, \"If thou art able to be in a situation where men will suppose thee to be a thief, by all means contrive to be so.\"18 He wrote to a disciple as follows.19 Return to the course that is nearer to thee, namely to please thy Lord; let not thy heart revert to the applause or reproof of the people of thy time.

Be not concerned if any man desert thee, and despair not over losing him, for it is more fortunate for thee to have them afar than to have them nigh thee; let God be thy sufficiency, take Him for thy associate, and let Him be the substitute for them. Beware of the people of thy time: it is not good to live with any that men to-day think well of, nor with any they think ill of either. It is better to die alone, than to live; for if any man thinks he can escape from evil and from the fear of temptation, let him know that there is no escape for him; if thou givest them power over thee, they will incite thee to sin, and if thou avoidest them, they will lay a snare for thee. So choose for thyself, and shun their society. I hold that the best counsel to-day is to dwell alone; for therein lies safety, and safety is a sufficient advantage. The extreme pessimism of the outlook of Bishr is eloquently evidenced in verses*attributed to him,20 I swear it is the nobler part To drink the salt tears of the heart, And crush the datestone, than to stand With greed in soul, and cap in hand, To gain—for recompense enow!— The lowering glance and wrinkled brow. Then with despair be satisfied; 'Tis greater wealth than aught beside, A bargain to rejoice the soul. Despair is fine and worshipful; God's fear is true nobility, Desire leads on to infamy; For, let the world be fair to-day, It shall at last assault, and slay. Meanwhile in Iraq the ascetic movement was similarly striking out in new directions. The violence of Bishr b. al-Harith's reaction against society is fully matched by the sentiments of al-Fudail b. 'Iyad (d. 187/803), him­self a Khorasanian by birth who lived for many years at Kufa and died in Mecca. \"In truth/5 he said, \"I would"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"desired children.\" 42 SUFISM rather be this dust, or this wall, than dwell in the shambles of the noblest of earth's inhabitants to-day.

Her hand was sought in marriage by a number of pious men, but she declined all offers, declaring, \"The contract of marriage is fo r those who have a pheno­menal existence.

Two ways I love Thee: selfishly, And next, as worthy is of Thee. 'Tis selfish love that I do naught Save think on Thee with every thought. 'Tis purest love when Thou dost raise The veil to my adoring gaze. Not mine the praise in that or this: Thine is the praise in both, I wis. 28 We quoted at the beginning of this chapter some verses by Ahmad b. 'Asim of Antioch, and will end our brief review of the early ascetics with him, fo r he furnishes an excellent example of the beginning of a transition which from his time forward gradually affected the character of Sufism; converting it from a way of life taken up as a protest against the worldliness prevalent in high places, into a theory of existence and a system of theosophy. Him­self a pupil of a noted ascetic, Abii Sulaiman al-Darani, he is the writer of the earliest surviving treatises that can be truly said to be mystical in character, and he is thus the fo rerunner of the great Sufi authors of the third /ninth century. 27 A brief dialogue between him and an unnamed disciple shews him in the part of spiritual preceptor, a feature of Sufism which now assumes increasing impor­tance. 28 Q.

But then desire diminished and purpose flagged : and with this came the spate of questions and answers, books and treatises; the inner meanings were known to those who wrote, and the breasts of those who read were receptive to under­stand them. 1 Arabia, Iraq, Syria and Khorasan had participated equally in the growth of the ascetic movement. We have watched self-denial (;:.uhd), a virtue applauded by the most orthodox of Muslim theologians-and the illustrious Ahmad b. Hanbal (d.241 /855), founder of the strictest of the four schools of Sunni jurisprudence, himself wrote a book entitled Ki tab al-Zuhd2-g radually turning into something quite different: a total-disregard of worldly wealth and ambition is exalted into an entire absorption with the fe ar, and then the service, and finally the love of God. Asceticism fo r its own sake tends to become a rather joyless and negative attitude to the universe; when warmed by spiritual emotion it converts into an ardent fe rvour rejoicing in hardship and delighting in ecstatic experience; subjected to the searching light of speculative reason, it is transformed into the hard discipline that is the necessary prelude to a proved theosophy. This final development took place at Baghdad, which now became the most important centre of Sufism as it had also come to be the focus of literature, theology, law and philosophy. No 45 "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46   SUFISM   doubt the free debates between Christians and Muslims, which for a brief period of splendid tolerance enlivened the Abbasid court, and the translation of Plato, Aristotle and the later Greek philosophers into Arabic, played an important part in stimulating this transition. The doctrine of the Divine Unity (tauhid) exercised the minds of the learned and religious increasingly, as the contest between creeds and sects became keener; so that it is scarcely surpris­ing that the Sufis should also have evolved their own inter­pretation of this crucial point in Islamic theology. But an examination of these interesting matters lies outside the scope which we have allowed ourselves in the present book. The first Sufi author of the foremost rank whose pre­served writings may truly be said to have formed to a large extent the pattern of all subsequent thought was al-Harith b. Asad al-Muhasibi. He was born at Basra in 165/781 but came early in life to Baghdad, where he passed the greater part of his days, dying in the Abbasid capital in 243/837. Being a keen student of hadith, he lavished extreme care upon providing apostolic authority for his teachings; but Ahmad b. Hanbal condemned him for using \"weak\" traditionists, and he was constrained for a time to flee to Basra. One of his disciples was the eminent al-Junaid, who has supplied a revealing account of the relationship in which he stood to his master.3 Al-Harith b. Asad al-Muhasibi used to come to myhouse and say, 'Come out with me, and let us grind.' I would say to him, 'Wilt thou drag me forth from my solitude and spiritual security into the highways and allurements, to behold lustful things?' He would answer,'Come out with me: there is nothing for thee to fear.' Andwhen I had come with him to a certain place where hesat down, he would say to me, 'Ask me a question/ Iwould reply, 'I have no question to ask thee/ Then he"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"47 THE MYSTICS would say, 'Ask me whatever comes into thy mind.' Then the questions would rush upon me, and I would question him, and he would answer accordingly forthwith; then he would return to his dwelling-place and make them into books. Here we have the portrait of the Sufi teacher acting like any other learned man of his time, composing his fu ndamental works in reply to questions put to him by a pupil. The structure of al-Muhasibi's books, especially his masterpiece al-Ri'iiya li-huqflq Allah, 4 fully confirms this description. The bulk of al-Muhasibi's writings is concerned with self-discipline-his name is connected with the word fo r self-examination (muhiisaba)-and al-Ri'iiya in particular exercised a great influence on the illustrious al-Ghazali (d.505/I I II) when he came to write his lh]ii' 'ulum al-din, to which we shall refer later, His Kitiib al-Wasiiyii (or al-Nasii'ih) is a series of sermons mainly on ascetic themes. The introduction to this work is autobiographical in character, and may well have been in Ghazali's mind when the latter wrote his famous al-Munqidh min al-daliil. Some extracts translated from an unpublished manuscript of the Wasiiyii will indicate its character. It has come to pass in our days, that this community is divided into seventy and more sects: of these, one only is in the way of salvation, and fo r the rest, God knows best concerning them. Now I have not ceased, not so much as one moment of my life, to consider well the differences into which the community has fa llen, and to search after the clear way and the true path, whereunto I have searched both theory and practise, and looked, for guidance on the road to the world to come, to the directing of the theolo­gians. Moreover, I have studied much of the doctrine of Almighty God, with the interpretation of the lawyers, and reflected upon the various conditions of the community, and considered its divers doctrines and sayings. Of all this"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"48  SUFISM  I understood as much as was appointed for me to under­stand: and I saw that their divergence was as it were a deep sea, wherein many had been drowned, and but a small band escaped therefrom; and I saw every party of them asserting that salvation was to be found in following them, and that he would perish who opposed them. Then I considered the various orders of men. For some there are who are acquainted with the nature of the world to come, and do prefer it: such are hard to find, but they are very precious. And some know nothing of this: to be far from them is a boon. Some make show to be like them that know, but are in Jove with the present world, and prefer it. Some carry an uncertain knowledge of the other world, but with that knowledge seek after respect and elevation, obtaining through their otherworldliness worldly goods. Some carry a knowledge, but know not the interpretation of that knowledge. Some make a show to be like the godly, and to resemble good folk, only they have no strength in them: their knowledge lacks in penetration, and their judgment cannot be trusted. Some possess intellect and intelligence, but are lacking in piety and goodness. Some secretly conform with their desires, being ambitious for worldly gain, and seeking to be rulers of men. Some are devils in human form: they turn their faces from the world to come, and rush madly after this world, greedy to collect it, avid of enrichment in it: report says they live, but in truth they are dead; with them virtue becomes an abomination, and evil-doing a virtue. In all these classes of men I sought for my aim, but could not find it. Then I sought out the guidance of them that were right guided, looking for rectitude, truth and guidance: I looked to knowledge for direction, thinking deeply and considering long. Then it was made clear to me, from God's Book, and the Prophet's practice, and the consensus of believers, that the pursuit of desire blinds to right direction, and leads astray from truth, causing one to abide long in blindness. So I began to expel desire from my heart. I paused before the divergences of the com­munity, ardently seeking the party of salvation, and anxiously avoiding fatal schisms and sects bound for ruin; for I feared that I might die before finding the light. With all my heart I sought for the path of salvation; andWith all my heart I sought for the path of salvation; and"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"49 THE MYSTICS I found, through the consensus of believers regarding the Revealed Book of God, that the path of salvation consists in laying hold of the fear of God, and performing His Ordinances, abstaining from what He has made lawful and unlawfu l alike and following all that He has pre­scribed, sincere obedience to God, and the imitation of His Prophet. So I sought to inform myself of God's Ordinances, and the Prophet's practices, as well as the pious conduct of the saints. I saw that there was both agreement and contrariety; but I found that all men were agreed that God's Ordinances and the Prophet's practices were to be found among those who, knowing God and knowing of God, laboured to win His Pleasure. I therefore sought fr om among the community men such as these, that I might follow in their footsteps and acquire knowledge from them; and I saw that they were exceed­ingly few, and that their knowledge was utterly swept away: as the Prophet said, 'Islam came a stranger, and shall return a stranger as it began.' Great then was my trouble, when I could not find godfearing men to be my guides; for I fe ared lest death should suddenly overtake me while my life was yet confused. I persevered in my quest for that which I must by all means know, not relaxing my caution nor falling short in counsel. Then the Merciful God gave me to know a people in whom I found my godfearing guides, models of piety, that pre­fe rred the world to come above this world. They ever counselled patience in hardship and adversity, acquies­cence in fa te, and gratitude for blessings received; they sought to win men to a love of God, reminding them of His Goodness and Kindness and urging them to repen­tance unto Him. These men have elaborated the nature of religious conduct, and have prescribed rules for p iety, which are past my power to follow. I therefore knew that religious conduct and true piety are a sea wherein the like of me must needs drown, and which such as I can never explore. Then God opened unto me a knowledge in which ·both proof was clear and decision shone, and I had hopes that whoever should draw near to this know­ledge and adopt it for his own would be saved.

Upon this I have built my actions, in it moved in all my doings; and I ask God to quicken me to gratitude for His blessing me therewith, and to enable me to keep the Ordinances He has thereby taught me. Yet know I well my shortcoming in this, and that I can never thank my God for all that He has done fo r me. The Kitab al-Ta wahhum of al-Muhasibi is a highly imaginative and artistic presentation of the terrors of death and the Last Judgment, culminating in a splendid picture of the Beatific Vision. But his most original thought is contained in a treatise on Love (fast fi 'l­mahabba) which is only known to us by quotation; the extract which follows indicates something of its subtlety and originality. 6 Q. And what is the Original Love? A. The love of Faith; God has testified to the love of the faithful, saying, 'And those who believe do love God the stronger' (Kor. 2:r6o) . The light of yearning is the light of love (mahabba) ; its superabundance is of the light of fondness (widiid) . Yearning is stirred up in the heart by the light of fo ndness. When God kindles that lamp in the heart of His servant, it burns fiercely in the crevices of his heart until he is lighted by it, and that lamp is never extinguished except when a man regards his actions with the eye of complacency. For if a man feels secure in his action from the malice of his adversary (Satan) , he will parade that action without any trepidation of being deprived (of God's Grace) ; conceit thus occupies his heart; his soul runS wild in vainglory; and the Wrath of God descends upo!J him. It is just, if any man being entrusted by God with the charge of His Love delivers over the reins of his soul into the hands of complacency, that the loss (of God's grace) should bear him away swiftly to utter ruin. A pious woman once said, 'Ah! if only God had bestowed on those that yearn to meet Him such a state that, if they lost it, they would be deprived of ever­lasting bliss.' She was asked, 'And what might that state"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"  51  THE MYSTICSbe?5 She replied, 'To regard their much (virtue) as little, and to wonder how it ever came to pass that their hearts should be the recipients of those (Divine) Favours.' A pious man was asked, 'Tell us about thy yearning for thy Lord— what does it weigh in thy heart?' He answered, 'Is this thing said to such as me? There is nothing in my heart that can be weighed, except in the presence of the soul; and if the soul is present while the heart is enjoying any heritage of proximity (to God), its joy is at once disturbed and turned to distress.' Mudar the Reader was asked, 'Which is better for the lover—fear or yearning?' He answered, 'This is a question I cannot answer; the soul has never looked upon anything without corrupting it/ 'Abd al-'Aziz b. 'Abd Allah recited to me these verses on the same subject. Best let the sinner grieve and fear, When he would turn to God in prayer; The heart obedient and pure Alone in Love may dwell secure; But they that noble are and wise Look unto God with yearning eyes. For that reason it is said that love is yearning, becauseone does not yearn except for a beloved. There is no distinction between love and yearning, when yearning is abranch of the original love. It is said likewise that loveis known by its evidences upon the bodies of the lovers,and in their speech, as also by the multitude of favours they enjoy through constant union with their Beloved.When God befriends them, He bestows His Favours uponthem; and when these Favours become manifest, they areknown for their love of God. Love itself has no manifestingshape or form, for its nature and form to be known; it isthe lover who is known by his character, and the multitudeof Favours which God displays upon his tongue, by gentlyguiding him, and by what is revealed to his heart. Whenthe roots of these Favours are firmly established in theheart, the tongue speaks of the branches thereof; and God's Favours reach unto the hearts of those who love Him. The clearest sign of the love of God is excessive pallor,associated with continuous meditation, and prolonged"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"52 SUFISM vigil accompanied by complete self-surrender, obediently and with great haste ere dread death come upon him; and the lover speaks of love according to the measure of the Light bestowed upon him. Hence it is said, that the sign of the love of God is the indwelling of God's Favours in the hearts of those whom God has singled out for His Love. A learned man quotes these lines on this theme. He hath His chosen few, Inspired to love Him true; Elect expressly so In ages long ago; Elect, or ever He Fashioned them forth to be The vessels of His Love, His Benefits to prove. Contemporary with al-Muhasibi was Dhu '1-Niin the Egyptian ( d.246 /861), whose tombstone at Giza still survives. He is generally credited with having introduced the idea of gnosis (ma'rifa) into Sufism, but this would appear to be incorrect since the conception certainly occurs in the fr agments of earlier ascetics. Dhu '1-Niin is represented in Sufi biographies as an almost legendary figure, half-mystic half-alchemist; he is said to have known the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, and to have been familiar with the Hermetic wisdom. A number of short treatises of extremely doubtful ?-Uthenticity are attributed to him; his poems and prayers, so much as are preserved of them, give a truer impression of his mode of thought, which is marked by distinctly pantheistic tendencies. 0 God, I never hearken to the voices of the beasts or the rustle of the trees, the splashing of waters or the song of birds, the whistling of the wind or the rumble of thunder, but I sense in them a testimony to Thy Unity (wahdiiniya), and a proof of Thy Incomparableness; that Thou art the AU-prevailing, the All-knowing, the All-wise, the All-just,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"53 THE MYSTICS the All-true, and that in Thee is neither overthrow nor ignorance nor folly nor injustice nor lying. 0 God, I acknowledge Thee in the proof of Thy handiwork and the evidence of Thy acts: grant me, 0 God, to seek Thy Satisfaction with my satisfaction, and the Delight of a Father in His child, remembering Thee in my love for Thee, with serene tranquillity and firm resolve. 7 In his poetry Dhu '1-Niin uses the passionate language of the devoted lover, as Rabi'a of Basra had done before him, and so helped to fix a tradition that is thereafter so promi­nent a characteristic of Sufi literature. I die, and yet not dies in me The ardour of my love for Thee, Nor hath Thy Love, my only goal, Assuaged the fever of my soul. To Thee alone my spirit cries; In Thee my whole ambition lies, And still Thy Wealth is far above The poverty of my small love.

How great is My Majesty!\" His ecstatic utterances (shathiyat) were a grave embarrass­ment to his more \"sober\" brethren, until they developed the technique of interpreting them as innocent of the blasphemy that to the uninitiated seemed all too apparent in them; al-Junaid himself, a very lucid and subtle thinker and no \"drunkard\", exercised his ingenuity in writing a commentary upon them.9 Abii Yazid was also the first to take the Prophet's Ascension (mi'raj) as a theme fo r expressing his own mystical experience, in this setting a fashion which others later followed. 10 I saw that my spirit was borne to the lheavens. It looked at nothing and gave no heed, though Paradise and Hell were displayed to it, fo r it was fr eed of pheno­mena and veils.

When I looked I myself was all those. I cried : '0 Lord, with my egoism I cannot attain to Thee, and I cannot escape fr om my selfhood. What am I to do?' God spake: '0 Abii Yazid, thou must win release fr om thy thou-ness by fo llow­ing my Beloved (sc. Muhammad) . Smear thine eyes with the dust of his fe et and fo llow him continually'. Similar in spirit is another narrative attributed to Abii Yazid. 11 Once He raised me up and stationed me before Him, and said to me, '0 Abii Yazid, truly My creation desire to see thee.' I said, 'Adorn me in Thy Unity, and clothe me in Thy Selfhood, and raise me up to Thy Oneness, so that when Thy creation see me they will say, We have seen Thee: and Thou wilt be That, and I shall not be there at all'. Here we may observe fully developed the doctrine of passing away in God (fanii') which from Abii Yazid's time onwards assumes a central position in the structure of Sufi theory. It was after all not a difficult transition to make from saying that all else but God is nothing (which is the logical outcome of the extreme ascetic teaching that the world is worthless and only God's service is a proper preoccupation of the believer's heart) , to claiming that when self as well as the world has been cast aside the mystic has passed away into God. Credit for reconciling this daring but logical develop­ment with the orthodox doctrines of the Divine Unity (tauhid) is sometimes assigned to Ahmad b. 'lsli al­Kharrliz ( d.286 j8gg) ;12 however, his Kitiib al-Sidq, which alone survives of his writings, is pitched at a somewhat lower level of thought. Nevertheless this little book is full of interest and significance to the student of mysticism. The uthor was at pains to prove that all the prophets of"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"56   SUFISM   old followed the kind of life which the Sufis sought to attain.13 The climax of the treatise is an eloquent and, as it seems, authentic description of the state of intimacy with God.14 Know that the disciple who is seeking after truth­fulness acts in all his affairs in the fear of God, keeping watch over his heart, his purpose, and his members, and examining them. He concentrates his purpose, being afraid lest aught which concerns him not should enter into it, and being afraid of heedlessness, lest his bodily motions as manifested in his external members cause him to be somewhat wanting, and lest the purposes which enter inwardly into his heart perturb his (single) purpose. Thus he frees himself from all such motions, even if they be right and proper: for the heart is overwhelmed by an urgent desire that his recollection (of God) shall be perpetual, and his purpose single. If he continues thus, his heart gains a quick understanding, and his thoughts become clear, and light lodges in his heart: he draws near to God, and God overwhelms his heart and purpose. Then he speaks, and his heart surges with the recollection of God: the love of God lurks deeply hidden in his inmost heart, cleaving to his mind, and never leaving it. Then his soul is joyfully busied with secret converse with God, and passionate study, and ardent talk. So he is, eating and drinking, sleeping (and waking), in all his motions: for when God's nearness takes possession of a man's heart, it overwhelms all else, both the inward infiltrations of the purposes and the outward motions of the members. Thereafter that man continues, going or coming, taking or giving: there prevails in him the purpose which has ruled his mind, namely, the love of God and His nearness. So far as reliable documentation goes, it appears that the responsibility for developing the doctrine oifancC as an integral part of a well-coordinated theosophy belongs to al-Junaid of Baghdad (d.298/910), pupil of al-Muhasibi, called in later times \"the Shaikh of the Order,\" by far the most original and penetrating intellect among the Sufis of"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"57 THE MYSTICS his time. Whereas others before him and his contem­poraries had by brilliant flashes of intuition grasped one or another of the spiritual heights now falling to their mastery, he, standing as it were upon the supreme mountain-peak of analytical thought, took within his ranging vision the whole landscape of mystical speculation stretching . below him, and with an artist's eye brought it to comprehen­sion and unity upon a single canvas. In aseriesoflettersand brief tracts brought but recently to light, 15 he sketches in profoundly subtle, deeply meditated language a consistent system of Islamic theosophy which has certainly not been improved upon, and which formed the nucleus of all subsequent elaboration. The classic definition of tauhid given by al-Junaid, and quoted by many later writers, is that it consists in \"the separation of the Eternal from that which was originated in time.\" 16 Taking as his point of departure the pre­eternal covenant sworn by man with God and referred to (according to Sufi exegesis) in the Koran, 1 7 he views the entire course of history as the quest of man to fulfil that covenant and return to \"the state in which he was before he was.\" In a comment on the conversation said to have taken place between man and God on that remote occasion, al-J unaid writes : 18 \"In this verse God tells you that He spoke to them at a time when they (sc. Adam's descendants) did not exist, except so far as they existed in Him. This existence is not the same type of existence as is usually attributed to God's creatures; it is a type of exis­tence which only God knows and only He is aware of. God knows their existence; embracing them He sees them in the beginning when they are non-existent and unaware of their future existence in this world. The existence of these is timeless.\" Elsewhere he remarks: \"In this verse God has stated that He spoke to them when they had no formal existence. This is possible because God perceives"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"SUFISMss them in their spiritual existence. This spiritual existence connotes their knowledge of God spiritually without in any way postulating their being aware of their own individuality.\" Man's separate and individual existence in the universe, according to al-Junaid, is the consequence of a deliberate act of God's Will, Who at the same time desires to \"over­come\" man's existence by the outpouring of His own Being. Commenting on the well known hadith, \"When I love him, I am his ear, so that he hears by Me, etc.\" 1 9, he remarks, \"Then it is God Who strengthens him, Who enables him to achieve this, Who guides him and gives him the vision of what He wishes in the manner He wishes, so that he achieves rightness and is in accord with Truth. This then is the Act of God in him, the Gift of God to him and only to him. It is not to be attributed positively to the worshipper, since it does not originate from him.\" In a definition he describes Sufism (tasauwuf) as meaning that \"God should cause thee to die fr om thyself and to live in Him.\" 20 This \"dying-to-self\" is called by al-Junaidfana' (a term reminiscent of the Koranic phrase \"Every thing is perishing (fani\") except His Face\" 2 1; the \"life-in-Him\" is named baqa' (continuance). By passing away from self the mystic does not cease to exist, in the true sense of existence, as an individual; rather his individuality, which is an inalienable gift from God, is perfected, transmuted and eternalised through God and in God. At the same time the return to continued existence is a source of trial (bala') and affliction, fo r man is still apart and veiled from God ; and so al-Junaid uses the imagery of the lover yearning after the Beloved, yet taking intense joy in the suffering which this separation causes him. Having enjoyed mystically anew the experience of life-in-God, and being restored to material life-\"after their union with Him, He separates them from Himself"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"59 THE MYSTICS (and grants them their individuality again), fo r He makes them absent (from this world) when they are in union with Him, and makes them present (in this world) when He has separated them from Himself\"-thereafter \"the souls of those who have known God seek after the verdant pastures, the beautiful vistas, the fresh green gardens\" and every lovely thing in this physical world, to console them, as examples of God's handiwork, for the loss of the Artist's own Presence. It is to this dual sense of union and separa­tion that al-Junaid refers in a short poem. 22 Now I have known, 0 Lord, What lies within my heart; In secret, fr om the world apart, My tongue hath talked with my Adored. So in a manner we United are, and One; Yet otherwise disunion Is our estate eternally. Though fr om my gaze profound Deep awe hath hid Thy Face, In wondrous and ecstatic Grace I fe el Thee touch my inmost ground. When al-Junaid in this way was succeeding to escape from the mortal peril of preaching the apotheosis of man, his junior contemporary al-Hallaj was not so fo rtunate in his reading of the riddle of existence, and being condemned fo r blasphemy he was executed upon the cross in 309/922. He went along with al-Junaid so far as seeing in the supreme mystical experience a reunion with God; but he then proceeded fu rther and taught that man may thus be viewed as very God Incarnate, taking as his example not, as one might suppose, Muhammad, but Jesus. He did not claim Divinity fo r himself, though the utterance which led to his execution, \"I am the Truth\" (ana 'l-haqq)"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"6o SUFISM seemed to his judges to have that implication.

And I, though I am killed and crucified, and though my hands and fe et are cut off-I do not recant. In al-Hallaj we have the supreme example-even more extreme than Abii Yazid--ofthe \"intoxicated\" Sufi; so complete was his absorption in serving the Will of God as he conceived it to be that he was utterly reckless of the consequences, which in his case were certainly disastrous. The legend of his death invests him with extraordinary nobility, and challenges comparison with the Christian story of the Crucifixion which may well have been in his mind as his torturers made ready to slay him. When he was brought to be crucified and saw the cross and the nails, he turned to the people and uttered a prayer, ending with the words: 'And these Thy servants who are gathered to slay me, in zeal for Thy religion and in desire to win Thy fa vour, fo rgive them, 0 Lord, and have mercy upon them; fo r verily if Thou hadst revealed to them that which Thou hast revealed to me, they would not have done what they have done; and if Thou hadst hidden fr om me that which Thou hast hidden fr om them, I should not have suffered this tribulation.

Not least important of these was al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi (fl. 28oj8g3), the psychologist of Sufism, whose lost work the Kh atm al-wilaya in which he argued that the saints had a \"Seal\" as well as the prophets compelled him to flee for his life, and was afterwards a source of Ibn 'Arabi's theory of sainthood and prophetship. 25 In a review of this kind, however, it is impossible to include more than a brief account of the leading figures, and we conclude the present chapter by quoting a few verses of Yahya b. Mu'adh of Raiy in Persia (d. 258/871), the associate of Abii Yazid, and of Abu '1-Husain al-Niiri of Baghdad (d.295/907), al-Junaid's colleague. In doing so, we must draw attention to the important part played by mystical verse in the Sufi life. Many anecdotes of the early Sufis relate how fond they were of quoting love-poetry, often in the first place of a purely human character, which they interpreted allegorically to accord with their own passionate spiritualism. We have seen how such saints as Rabi'a and Dhu'l-Niin composed original verse, sometimes of high quality, in which they expressed their emotions in fr ankly e;otic imagery. Fully to understand the later poetry of Sufism, especially that of the Persian school-though this is equally characteristic of writers like Ibn al-Farid and Ibn 'Arabi-it is necessary to keep in mind how fu ndamental in Sufi thought is this allegory of love, and how readily in their minds human and Divine imagery is interchanged.

In Thy valley we go around, And therefore we beat the ground. A man came to Abu '1-Husain al-Nuri on the eve of the Bairam festival, and asked him what garments he proposed to wear upon the morrow. He answered:28 'To-morrow is the festival!' they cried, 'What robe wilt thou put on?' And I replied: 'The robe He gave me, Who hath poured for me Full many a bitter potion. Poverty And Patience are my raiment, and they cover A heart that sees at every feast its Lover. Can there be finer garb to greet the Friend, Or visit Him, than that which He doth lend? When Thou, my Expectation, art not near, Each moment is an age of grief and fear; But while I may behold and hear Thee, all My days are glad, and Life's a Festival!'

'Abd al-Jabbar al-Niffari (fl.350/961) and Ibn al-Khafif of Shiraz (d.371 /982). Of these the most curious and interesting figure is al-Niffari, who left behind him a series of \"revela­tions\" (Kitab al-Mawaqif and Kitab al-Mukhatabat1) pur­porting to hav.e been received from God in a state of ecstasy, possibly by automatic writing. While these are for the most part brief sentences, composed in general in a highly technical vocabulary and style, and require a commentary to be understood, certain passages have an authentic beauty and seem to possess the ring of genuine mystical experience. The writer pictures himself as stand­ing before God (mauqif-a term perhaps originally borrowed from the descriptions of the Last Day) in one or other spiritual state, and hearing God speaking to him. The pattern fo r this situation was no doubt borrowed from Abii Yazid-we have quoted above an example pointing to this conclusion2-but the treatment is new. He stayed me in Death; and I saw the acts, every one of them, to be evil. And I saw Fear holding sway over Hope; and I saw Riches turned to fire and ·cleaving to the fire; and I saw Poverty an adversary adducing proofs; and I saw every thing, that it had no power over any other thing; and I saw this world to be a delusion, and I saw the heavens to be a deception. And I cried out, '0 Knowledge!'; and it answered me not. Then I cried 64 "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE THEORISTS OF SUFISM 65 out, CO Gnosis!'; and it answered me not. And I saw every thing, that it had deserted me, and I saw every created thing, that it had fled from me; and I remained alone. And the act came to me, and I saw in it secret imagination, and the secret part was that which persisted; and naught availed me, save the Mercy of my Lord. And He said to me, 'Where is thy knowledge?' And I saw the Fire. And he said to me, 'Where is thy act?' and I saw the Fire. And He said to me, 'Wher§ is thy gnosis?' And I saw the Fire. And He unveiled for me His Gnoses of Uniqueness, and the Fire died down. And He said to me, 'I am thy Friend.' And I was stablished. And He said to me, 'I am thy Gnosis.' And I spoke. And He said to me, 'I am thy Seeker.' And I went forth.3 But the age of al-Niffari was above all a period of organisation and construction. The Persian Hujwiri^ writing in the middle of the 5/1 ith century, enumerates no fewer than twelve \"sects\" of Sufism, of which ten are stated to be \"orthodox\" and two \"heretical\"4; these \"sects\" are named with one exception after their reputed founders, and a body of distinctive doctrine is assigned to each. Hujwiri's learned translator saw \"no adequate ground at present\" for supposing his author to be merely inventing for the sake of systematisation, though he adds, \"It is very likely that in his account of the special doctrines which he attributes to the founder of each School he has often expressed his own views upon the subject at issue and has confused them with the original doctrine.\"5 It is curious that no other writer but Hujwiri supplies this information, however, and his evidence must of necessity be treated with suspicion; but we are on safe ground enough if we assume, as the general body of documenta­tion justifies us in assuming, that the group of pupils which attended each great Sufi teacher preserved, and in turn transmitted to their pupils, as much as they remem­bered of their master's instruction, thus creating at least the illusion of forming, not indeed \"sects,\" but well"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"66 SUFISM founded and individual \"schools\" of Sufi tradition. A fair parallel would be the chains of transmission which are fo und prefixed to many ancient Arabic manuscripts of books on various subjects, including Sufism. During the 4/Ioth century this work of preserving and handing-on the teachings of the Sufi masters continued apace. What is more important and significant, we now for the first time meet with systematic and documented \"histories\" of Sufism-a sure sign that the task of building was felt to be complete and that the movement was now sufficiently established and organised to be capable of description and discussion. Another and certainly more urgent motive for undertaking this work was provided by the scandal which culminated in the execution of al-Hallaj. The Sufis had been under the fire of the narrowly orthodox for some considerable time, and scarcely any of their prominent teachers after al-Muhasibi escaped the accusation of being zindiq-a convenient portmanteau term of abuse used by the zealots to cover a multitude of suspected heresies. There was thus an urgent need to rehabilitate the movement, if it was to survive in these less liberal times and continue to be an effective force in the community. The need produced the men, and the men produced the books eminently suitable for the purpose. The first to address himself to this labour was Abii Sa'id Ibn al-A'rabi, a learned jurist and Traditionist, a disciple of al-Junaid, who died at Mecca in 341 /952 at the age ofg4. His Ta baqiit al-nussiik (\"Classes of the Pious,\" a term reminiscent of the tabaqiit of poets, lawyers, theologians, grammarians and other scholars which were being compiled at about the same time) has unfortunately not survived, but what we know of it by quotation makes it clear that the author gave a fairly full account of the lives and teachings of the great Sufi masters. We regret"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE THEORISTS OF SUFISM 67 equally the loss of the Hikdydt al-auliyd? (\"Tales of the Saints\") by Abu Muhammad al-Khuldi (d. 348/959), but happily it is extensively reproduced by later writers and so its contents have not wholly perished. The oldest surviving general account of Sufism, and in many respects the most valuable, is the Kitdb al-Lumcf of Abu Nasr al-Sarraj (d. 378/988)6. This great and funda­mental book, which is fortunately accessible in a sound edition and an English summary, differs in character from the biographical sketches of Ibn al-A'rabi and al-Khuldi as being constructed, more after the pattern of theological treatises, in such a fashion as to describe and analyse the doctrines and practices of the Sufis; the author also gives particular attention to the technical vocabulary of the movement, which had by his time become both copious and complex. One entire section is devoted to the \"imitation of the Prophet,\" and another to accounts proving the saintliness of the Prophet's Companions; al-Sarraj describes the miracles that have been accorded to the especially holy, and discusses the differences of doctrine dividing certain schools of Sufism. While he defends at length the \"ecstatic utterances\" {shathiydt) of various mystics, and in particular those of Abu Yazid whose interpretation by al-Junaid he quotes verbatim, he concludes his book with a long and detailed exposure of the \"errors\" of theory and practice committed by some Sufis. The Kitdb al-Luma* is extraordinarily well documented, and abounds in quotations not only from the sayings and poems but also from the letters of the mystics; its author was living at no great distance from the golden age of al-Muhasibi and al-Junaid, and gives the impression of being as honest as he is well-informed.

He is well grounded in theology and Traditions, and is greatly interested to prove the orthodoxy of Sufi doctrine and practice, so that his famous work, the Qjlt al-qulub, is found to contain somewhat more of careful argument and somewhat less of curious quotation. Nevertheless the book is of primary importance, as being the first-and a very successful­attempt to construct an overall design fo r orthodox Sufism; like al਍Muhasibi, Abii Talib al-Makki was care­fully studied by al-Ghazali and exercised considerable influence on his mode of thought and writing. The pattern of the Q,Ut al-qulub is a little reminiscent of that of the standard manuals of religious jurisprudence, with its minute discussion of the ritual practices of Islam which are, however, treated from the mystical standpoint. He is by no means content to answer the criticisms of the professional theologians but carries the war into the enemy's camp. Claiming that the Sufi way of life and thought represented an authentic tradition of the Prophet's teaching, transmitted first by al-Hasan al-Basri and maintained scrupulously intact by relays of teachers and disciples, he declares that the fa shion of writing on dogmatic theology was itself an innovation, and an evil one at that 7• They used to receive the instruction one fr om the other and preserved it carefully, because their hearts were clear of doubts, fr ee fr om worldly preoccupations, and unsullied by passion; because their purpose was lofty, their reso­lution strong, and their intention excellent.

So matters have continued to develop down to this present time. Now the scholastic theologians are called learned ('ulamii') , the mere roman.cers are named gnostics ('iirifin) , the narrators and informants learned, though they have no true grounding in religious lore nor the apperception that comes of faith. For all the care lavished by the author on avoiding extremist views, it is perhaps scarcely surprising that his work was not received with favour by strict Sunni opinion. Towards the end of the century a third fundamental though much shorter treatise on Sufism was written by Abii Bakr al-Kalabadhi (d. 390/1ooo), who also composed a book on Traditions. His al-Ta 'arruf li-madhhab ahl al-tasauwuf8 is still more frankly apologetic than his predecessors' works had been. The author takes one by one the essential elements of Islamic theology, quoting as it seems verbally from the \"creed\" known as al-Fiqh al-akbar (II), and asserts of each in turn that it was firmly held by the great Sufis; he produces quotations to prove his points. After this task of rehabilitation has been completed, al-Kalabadhi sketches briefly and section by section the characteristic mystical doctrines of Sufism, and concludes his little handbook with some paragraphs on miracles. This manual was well regarded in later times; commentaries upon it were written by, among others, the celebrated Persian mystic Ansari (d. 481 j10BB) and Qonawi (d. 729/1329), and it was extensively quoted by the Egyptian polymath Jalal al-Din al-Suyiiti (d. 9III 1505) · A little later than al-Kalabadhi wrote Abii.

Perhaps more important, al-Sulami also wrote a commentary on the Koran from the Sufi stand­point which has not yet been thoroughly studied but is likely to be extremely valuable, as shewing how the mystics addressed themselves to this, the fundamental Muslim science. A short treatise by the same author on the \"errors of the Sufis\" is our best source of information concerning the Malamatiya, 1 o an extremist sect who held that the true worship of God is best proved by the contempt in which the devotee is held by his fe llow-men; on this argument they justified not only the total neglect of the religious prescriptions of Islam, but the commission of the most outrageous sins as testifying to their disregard of human opinion and judgment. Thisratherunsavourydevel­opment of \"drunken\" Sufism achieved wide notoriety in later times and brought the whole movement into disrepute. The 5/1 Ith century fo und Sufism firmly established and widespread throughout all Islam. Early in this period the distinguished historian Abu Nu'aim al-Isbahani (d. 430/ 1038) wrote what is unquestionably the most important and valuable work on Sufi biography and individual doctrine, the massive Hilyat al-auliyii'. This veritable encyclopaedia, which has been printed in ten volumes, takes into the category of \"saints\" not only a large number of the Companions of Muhammad and their followers­including the \"righteous\" caliphs-but also the four founders of the Sunni schools of jurisprudence.

This medium sized work is the most esteemed and popular book on the subject in Arabic, and was the principal study of all later scholars, at a time when Sufism had come to be regarded as one of the Islamic \"sciences\"; commentaries were composed by several, including the learned Zakariya' al-Ansari of Cairo (d. 916/151 I or 926/152 1). Like al-Sulami, al­Qushairi also wrote a commentary on the Koran which has similarly not yet been studied, as well as numerous other books including a monograph on the Prophet's Ascension; but his fame chiefly and justly rests upon the Risiila which, as giving our most concise and authoritative description of Sufi doctrine, will be used in the next chapter where we shall present an outline of the mystical system as fully evolved and widely accepted from the 5/1 Ith century onwards. Almost contemporary with al-Qushairi is the earliest fo rmal study of Sufism in Persian, the Kashf al-mahJub of Hujwiri (fl. 450/1057), from which we have quoted above; this important work, similar in pattern to the Risiila but with some remarkable individual fe atures, is available in an excellent English translation and therefore requires no fu rther description here.11 We conclude this sketch of the early theorists by referring to one other outstanding figure of the period, a man who was both a devout practising mystic and a theorist, the Persian 'Abd Allah al-Ansari (d. 481j1o88), better known in Persia by his poetical soubriquet Pir-i Ansar.

The following translation of its opening passages, beginning with a ghazal (lyric) and ending with a rubd'i (quatrain), will give an impression of the character of this charming little book.

When al-Qushairi wrote his Risala ('Epistle to the Sufis') in 438/1046 he had several earlier compendia to draw upon, and in fact we find him quoting quite freely from the writings of al-Sarraj and al-Sulami. The classical formulation of Sufi doctrine on the mystical side has always been held by the Sufis to have been finally accomplished by al-Qushairi; its reconciliation and assimilation with orthodox Sunni theology and religious law was the work of the great Abii Hamid al-Ghazali (d. 505/1111), carried out by stages in a considerable number of relatively short books, and consolidated and consummated in the lhya' 'ulum al-din, which was written between 492/1099 and 495/1 102. After a brief preface the Risala, which was composed with the express purpose of rescuing Sufism from the ill-fame to which it had been exposed by the extravagant antinomianism of the Malamatiya, begins with the assertion that Sufi doctrine in no way conflicts with orthodox theology. The author proceeds to illustrate and justify this claim in a series of brief biographies of promin­ent Sufis, beginning his list with Ibrahim b. Adham; before him, he argues, the term zahid (abstainer) or 'abid (devotee) was applied to saintly men generally, but after the rise of schismatic sects the pious among the orthodox (Sunnis) were distinguished by the new title of Sufi.1 The list of biographies concludes with the name of Abii 'Abd Allah al-Riidhabari (d. 369/980). 74 "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"75 THE STRUCTURE OF SUFI THEORY AND PRACTICE Next comes a section explaining certain technical terms current in Sufi literature. A fu ndamental distinction is drawn between maqam (station) and hal (state) ; briefly, the maqam is a s tage of spiritual attainment on the pilgrim's progress to God which is the result of the mystic's personal effort and endeavour, whereas the hal is a spiritual mood depending not upon the mystic but upon God. \"The states,\" says al-Qushairi, \"are gifts; the stations are earnings.'' The first station is stated to be conversion (tauba), a view commonly held by the Sufis 2, who mean by this term not of course the formal profession of Islam but the conscious resolve of the adult Muslim to abandon the worldly life and to devote himself to the service of God. It is in this sense, as we shall see, that al-Ghazali after achieving a great reputation as a lawyer and a theologian turned away from formal religious learning and, experiencing conversion, declared himself to be a Sufi. Thereafter, al-Qushairi traces the penitent's onward journey according to the fo llowing pattern. (2) Mujahada, a collateral fo rm of jihad (the so-called \"holy war\"), taken to mean \"earnest striving after the mystical life.\" The term is based on the Koranic text, \"And they that strive earnestly in Our cause, them We surely guide upon Our paths.\" 3 A Tradition makes the Prophet rank the \"greater warfare\" (al-jihad al-akbar) above the \"lesser warfare\" ( al-jihad al-asghar, i.e. the war against infidelity), and explain the \"greater warfare\" as meaning \"earnest striving with the carnal soul\" (mujahadat al-nafs) . 4 (3) Khalwa wa-'uz[a (solitariness and withdrawal) : the neophyte must train himself to live in isolation from his fellows, and so to rid himself of his evil habits.

It will be seen that al-Qushairi, despite the care with which he analyses the mystic's moral and psychological advance, did not always mark carefully the distinction which later theorists observed between maqiim and hiil.

Sufism had produced many men of conspicuous sincerity, holiness and intuition during the first fo ur centuries of its existence; but it never made a more important conquest than when Abu Hamid Muhammad b. Muhammad al-Ghazali, the Hujjat al-Islam (\"Proof of Islam\"), declared himself its champion. Born in 45 I I 1059 at Tus in Khorasan, al-Ghazali lived his early years in this north Persian province which had raised up so many mystical geniuses. His schooling was that of an orthodox theologian and lawyer, and he had established himself as the leading Sunni scholar of his day when he was appointed professor of divinity at the Nizamiya Madrasa, Baghdad, in 484/1091 . Yet despite his celebrity and authority-his work as a lawyer in particular qualified him to be called the greatest Shafi'i jurisconsult after al-Shafi'i himself-he was dissatisfied with the intellectual and legalistic approach to religion, and felt a yearning fo r a more personal experience of God. In 488/1 095 he gave up his teaching, and lived in retirement fo r ten years. The famous story of his conversion to Sufism is told in the autobiographical al-Munqidh min al-dalii/. 16 "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"So SUFISM Then I turned my attention to the Way of the Sufis. I knew that it could not be traversed to the end without both doctrine and practice, and that the gist of the doc­trine lies in overcoming the appetites of the flesh and getting rid of its evil dispositions and vile qualities, so that the heart may be cleared of all but God; and the means of clearing it is dhikr Allah, i.e. commemoration of God and concentration of every thought upon Him. Now, tQ.e doctrine was easier to me than the practice, so I began by learning their doctrine from the books and sayings of their Shaykhs, until I acquired as much of their Way as it is possible to acquire by learning and hearing, and saw plainly that what is most peculiar to them cannot be learned, but can only be reached by immediate experience and ecstasy and inward trans­formation. I became convinced that I had now acquired all the knowledge of Sufism that could possibly be obtained by means of study; as for the rest, there was no way of coming to it except by leading the mystical life. I looked on myself as I then was. Worldly interests encompassed me on every side. Even my work as a teacher-the best thing I was engaged in-seemed unim­portant and useless in view of the life hereafter. When I considered the intention of my teaching, I perceived that instead of doing it for God's sake alone I had no motive but the desire for glory and reputation. I realised that I stood on the edge of a precipice and would fall into Hell­fire unless I set about to mend my ways . . .

He had by heart all the terminology of the philosophers and the theologians.

This period was followed by an age in which theory went hand in hand with practice, and famous shaikhs, themselves holy men, taught the nascent doctrine of Sufism to disciples, either solitary or i}l groups. The Persian theorist Hujwiri, writing in the 5/1 Ith century, enumerates several schools of mysticism which transmitted the teachings of the masters. The relation of teacher and pupil, familiar in other disciplines, presently developed into the characteristic Sufi counterpart of elder (shaikh, pir) and disciple (murid, shagird) ; and convents (ribat, khanqah) were founded and endowed where a celebrated saint would reside with a group of his followers, who studied under him and worshipped with. him for a shorter or a longer period. Initiation into the Sufi mysteries was marked by the investiture of a special frock (khirqa) symbolising his acceptance of and into a tradition of Divine service mount­ing back stage by stage to the Prophet Muhammad. So, Abu Sa'id b. Abi '1-Khair (b.357/967) received his khirqa successively from al-Sulami arid Abu '1-'Abbas al­Qassab.1 It is important to remark that residence in a Sufi convent by no means implied celibacy, and most of the fa mous Muslim mystics are known to have been 84 "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE SUFI ORDERS as married.

Hitherto the convents had been isolated. oases in the desert of worldly life; the time had come fo r them to be linked up irt a widespread brotherhood of mystics acknowledging a common master and using a common discipline and ritual. The first of these Orders was the creation of Muhyi al-Din 'Abd al­Qadir b. 'Abd Allah al-Jili (al-Jilani). Born at Gilan in Persia in the year 47 I jio78, 'Abd al-Qadir migrated to Baghdad at the age of seventeen to study Hanbali juris­prudence. Experiencing conversion, he began in 52 1 /I I 2 7 to preach regularly on the holy life; many flocked to hear his sermons, attracted by the reports of the miracles he was said to perform. By his death in 56 I /I I66 his influence had become so great that convents in many centres recognised his authority, and Sufis called themselves Qadiris after his name. Many of 'Abd al-Qadir's writings, sermons and prayers have been preserved; his most cele­brated book, al-Ghunya li-talibi tariq al-haqq, was for many generations a favourite manual of instruction. The Qadiri Order found fo llowers in numerous parts of Islam, and was especially powerful in India, where its influence is widespread to the present day. No doubt a determining fa ctor in the success of this and other similar Orders was their faithful adherence to the religious laws and prac­tices of orthodoxy, and their strong condemnation of antinomianism and incarnationist tendencies. The Ghunya contains very little that could possibly be condemned by any but the most extreme \"puritans\"; its teaching is firmly based on the Koran and Traditions; the religious exercises it recommends are unobjectionable.

His fellow-townsman Abu '1-Futiih (d.587 /1191) was a voluminous and imaginative writer of a characteristic Persian type, and being inclined towards pantheistic allegory he was condemned to death and executed fo r heresy. Shihab al-Din was more fortunate; a model of orthodox moderation, he enjoyed the confi­dence and patronage of caliphs and princes, while his lectures and sermons were attended by admiring multi­tudes, many coming fr om far to hear him preach. Pilgrim to Mecca in 628/1231, he there met the great Egyptian mystic poet 'Umar b. al-Farid; he numbered among his students the even more celebrated Persian poet Sa'di (d.691/1292). Shihab al-Din wrote many books large and small, the most fa mous and influential being the 'Awarif al-ma'arif which became the fundamental textbook of the Order. His teaching was carried to India by Baha' al-Din Zakariya' of Multan, and there fo und immediate accep­tance. The name Suhrawardy is renowned in modern Bengal and Eastern Pakistani politics. The third Order in date of creation owed its inspiration to a scholar of the Maghrib (Western Islam), Niir al-Din Ahmad b. 'Abd Allah al-Shadhili (593-656/1 19 6-1258). A pupil of Ibn Mashish (d.625/1228), al-Shadhili won such a large following in Tunis that the authorities feared his influence, and he found it more prudent to flee to Alexandria.

The prayers (ahz&b, sing, hizb) of al-Shadhili have been preserved and are used to this day in the devotions of his followers. A very influential member of the Order was Ibn 'Ata' Allah of Alexandria (d. 709/1309), whose little collection of Sufi aphorisms, al-Hikam al­'Atd'iya, achieved an extraordinary popularity, as witness the large number of commentaries written upon it; in style and contents this work recalls the utterances of the Baghdad mystics of the ninth century.

Thy desire to be isolated (from worldly things and to be only with God) when God causes thee to dwell in (secondary) causes comes of secret lust (after personal glory); and thy desire for (the possession of secondary) causes while God causes thee to dwell in isolation (therefrom) is a declension from the high purpose (to be united with God).

All have fo llowed a broadly similar pattern. The Order is presided over in each age by the \"successor\" (khalifa) of the fo under, and his supremacy is acknowledged by the heads of the several branches in different centres. A relatively small number of professional Sufis reside in the lodges established for teaching and worship; the preponderant majority of adherents to the Orders are lay brethren, fu lly engaged in their mundane occupations, who prove their support by attending the d i:ual performances on the proper occasions. Each Order is marked by its particular ritual, far more than by any discrimination of doctrine. E. W. Lane, who was in Egypt early last century at a time when the influence of the Orders was at its height and life in general had been little affected by modern thought or Western influence, gives us in his Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians some entertaining details of Sufi performances which he observed.

I had not waited many minutes before they began their exercises. Several of them first drove back the surrounding crowd with sticks; but as no stick was raised at me, I did not retire as far as I ought to have done; and before I was aware of what the durweeshes were about to do, forty of them, with extended arms, and joined hands, had fo rmed a large ring, in which I fo und myself enclosed. For a moment I felt half inclined to remain where I was, and join in the zikr; bow, and repeat the name of God; but another moment's reflection on the absurdity of the performance, and the risk of my being discovered to be no durweesh, decided me otherwise; so, parting the hands of two of the durweeshes, I passed outside the ring. The durweeshes who formed the large ring (which enclosed tour of the marble columns of the portico) now com­menced their zikr; exclaiming over and over again, \"Allah!\" and, at each exclamation, bowing the head and body, and taking a step to the right; so that the whole ring moved rapidly round. As soon as they commenced this exercise, another durweesh, a Turk, of the order of Mowlawees, in the middle of the circle, began to whirl; using both his fe et to effect this motion, and extending his arms : the motion increased in velocity until his dress spread out like an umbrella. He continued whirling thus for about ten minutes; after which he bowed to his superior, who stood within the great ring; and then, without showing any signs of fa tigue or giddiness, joined the durweeshes in the great ring; who had now begun to ej aculate the name of God with greater vehemence, and to jump to the right, instead of stepping.

On my presenting myself at the door, a servant admitted me; and I joined the assembly within. The sheykh, having dismounted, seated himself on a seggadeh II spread upon the pavement against the end-wall of a tukhtabosh (or wide recess) of the court of the house. He sat with bended back, and down-cast countenance, and tears in his eyes; muttering almost incessantly. I stood almost close to him. Eight other persons sat with him. The durweeshes who had entered with him, who were about twenty in number, stood in the form of a semicircle before him, upon some matting placed for them; and around them were about fifty or sixty other persons. Six durweeshes, advancing towards him, about two yards, from the semicircle, commenced a zikr; each of them exclaiming, at the same time, 'Allahoo hhai!' ('God is living!'), and, at each exclamation, beating, with a kind of small and short leather strap, a baz, which he held, by a boss at the bottom, in his left hand. This they did for only a few minutes. A black slave then became mel boos; 8 and rushed into the midst of the durweeshes; throwing his arms about; and exclaiming, 'Allah la la la la lah!' A person held him, and he soon seemed to recover. The durweeshes, altogether, standing as first described, in the form of a semicircle, then performed a second zikr; each alternate zikkeer exclaiming, 'Allahoo hhai!' ('God is living!'); and the others, 'ra hhai!' (0 thou living!'), and all of them bowing at each exclamation, alternately to the right and left. This they continued for about ten minutes.

Most of the durweeshes there present then kissed the hand of the sheykh; and he retired to an upper apartment. Such were the exercises whereby the Sufi dervishes sought to reach a sense of exaltation, in which they felt themselves to be in the presence of God. For the great majority, no doubt, these performances were little more than manifestations of animal magnetism, and the sensa­tions they experienced, sometimes assisted by partaking of drugs and stimulants of various kinds, 7 readily to be explained as of the order of hypnosis. But the elect few, who were familiar with the esoteric teachings of their Orders, found the ritual to abound in significant mysteries, and related their successive moods and feelings to the theoretical speculations of the theosophists.

Since the preaching of Union with God was liable to misunderstanding and open to the charge of forbidden \"incarnationism\" (hulul) , it was necessary to discover some substitute doctrine which, while coming to much the same port, sailed nearer the wind of orthodoxy. We have seen how al-Hallaj surprisingly took Jesus as his example of a holy man in whom God was incarnate; Sufi theory had only to substitute Muhammad for Jesus, and to moderate the extravagance of al-Hallaj's language, to invent a system of speculative theosophy which would beguile all but the wariest critics. The task was made that much the easier by the existence of an old and honourable tradition of composing panegyrics to God's Messenger in which Muhammad was spoken of in terms of veneration only just short of cult-worship. It is uncertain who introduced the Logos doctrine into Islam, by which is meant the theory that God's vicegerent controlling the material universe is \"the Idea of Muhammad\" (al-haqiqat al-Muhammadiya) ; it has been suggested that this doctrine fo rmed a part of al-Ghazali's esoteric teaching, and that it is hinted at in one of his last works, the Mishkiit al-anwiir. 1 Likely efiough the concep­tion, like many others of later Sufism, had its roots in the secret tradition handed on by word of mouth from the third/ninth century masters.

We find this notion fully developed in the writings of Ibn al-Farid of Cairo (586-632/II8I-I235), by far the greatest mystical poet in Arabic literature. His poetry, judged by accepted Western canons, is exceedingly diffi­cult and obscure, and abounds moreover in verbal jugglery which offends our very different taste; its appre­ciation is rendered all the more hazardous by his fidelity to the conventions of the classical ode of ancient Arabia and his metaphorical use of erotic imagery. Yet, \"if his verse abounds in fa ntastic conceits, if much of it is enig­matic to the last degree, the conceits and enigmas are not, as a rule, rhetorical ornaments or intellectual conjuring tricks, but like tendrils springing from a hidden root are vitally connected with the moods of feeling which they delineate. It may be difficult to believe, what is related on the testimony of his most intimate friends, that he used to dictate his poems at the moment when he came out of a deep ecstatic trance, during which 'he would now stand, now sit, now repose on his side, now lie on his back, wrapped like a dead man; and thus he would pass ten consecutive days, more or less, neither eating nor drinking nor speaking nor stirring.' His style and diction resemble the choicest and finest jewel-work of a fastidious artist rather than the first-fruits of Divine inspiration. Yet I am not inclined to doubt the statement that his poetry was composed in an abnormal manner.\" 2 So writes the scholar who has done more than anyone else in our time to elucidate Ibn al­Farid's obscurities and to advance the literary appreciation of his compositions.

The opposite case is that of one who speaks because he is dominated by his feeling (hal) , and who is therefore under the control of an influence (wiirid) .

He gathered into the comprehensive range of his meditation the entire learning of Islam, and was perfectly familiar not only with the writings and teachings of the orthodox Sunni theologians, lawyers and philosophers, and of the Sufis from the earliest times to his own day, but also with the schismatic and heretical movements like the Mu'­tazilites, Carmathians and Isma 'ilis.

To indicate in a small way the nature of the perpetuation of his ideas in later Islamic writings, it will be enough to recall that the Persian poet 'Iraqi (d.688j128g) composed his Lama'at after hearing Sadr al-Din Qonawi (d. 672/1273) lecture on Ibn 'Arabi's Fusils al-hikam, and that Jami not only compiled a commentary on the Lama' at but also composed his Lawa'ih in emulation of that work.

Accepting Ibn 'Arabi's conception of the Unity of Being (wahdat al-wujiid) , he traces the descent of Pure Being, which in itself is without name and attribute, through three successive stages of manifestation which he calls Oneness (ahadiya) , He-ness (huwiya) , and !-ness (aniya) . \" Man, in virtue of his essence, is the cosmic Thought assuming flesh and connecting Absolute Being with the world of Nature.\" 1 3 Through three corresponding stages"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"THE THEOSOPHY OF ISLAMIC MYSTICISM I05 of mystical illumination (tajalli) , the mystic may aspire to retrace the order of his descent and finally, by becoming the Perfect Man, being stripped of every attribute, return once more as Absolute to the Absolute. The idea of the descent of the Universal Spirit into matter, and of the purgative ascent of man out of matter, was of course fa miliar to Sufi thought long before al-Jili's time; his particular merit is that of crystallising the conception, under the influence of Ibn 'Arabi's general system, into a clear and consistent metaphysic. To see how long are the shadows cast by these great figures of mediaeval Islamic mysticism, we may notice that the late Sir Muhammad Iqbal (d.1938), who had made a detailed study of Sufi thought, appears to have derived his special theory of Higher Selfhood in part out of the Sufi doctrine of the Perfect Man and in part from the Superman of German philosophy culminating in Nietzche."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"TEN THE PERSIAN POETS FRoM the fo regoing review of Sufism in Arabic literature it will have been observed that the Arabs, or non-Arabs writing in Arabic, stressed in particular the philosophical side of Islamic mysticism, and devoted especial care to constructing a stable theosophical system. If Sufism had given birth to nothing more than a lofty ethic and a subtle metaphysic, it might have been allowed that the movement had made a substantial contribution to human thought and experience. But when Sufism gripped the mind and soul of Iran, and the abounding poetic imagina­tion of the Persians discovered this new theatre to display itself, Islamic mysticism developed aesthetically in a manner soaring high above the ranges of pure speculation. Classical Persian poetry is to a very notable extent Sufi in content and inspiration. The Sufi poetry of Persia (and what is said of Persian poetry here applies equally to Turkish and Urdu) falls into three main categories, and will be reviewed under these heads-didactic, romantic and lyrical. The first Persian author to write an e:xtensive poem elaborating the doctrines of Sufism was Sana'i, whose literary activities cover the first half of the 6j1 2th century. He was a prolific poet, composing very freely in the two classical fo rms of Qasida (ode) and Ghazal (lyric) , as well as in Ruba'iyat (quatrains) and Mathnawi (rhyming couplets) ; it was in the fo urth of these forms that he wrote his epic Hadiqat al-haqiqa, which set up a model followed by later authors.

Rumi, a far greater thinker and poet, freely acknowledged his indebtedness to Sana'i, not only quoting from the Hadiqa in his own Mathnawi, but also in direct confession :•— Attar was the spirit, Sanai his eyes twain, And in time thereafter Game we in their train. Farid al-Din 'Attar, who flourished some sixty years after Sana'i, was an even more productive author; not only did he compose easily in all the categories of verse, but he also wrote a valuable and highly esteemed treatise on the biographies of Muslim saints and mystics (Tadhkirat al-auliya*). His numerous mathnawi poems include three of first rate importance, the Asrdr-ndma ('Book of Secrets') on general Sufi principles, the Ildhi-ndma ('Divine Book') on mystical love, and the Mantiq al-tair ('Speech of Birds'), a splendid allegory portraying the mystic's progress towards Union with God.

It is against the background of this allegory of love and worship, of faithlessness and shame, that the lyrics of Sana'i, 'Attar, Rumi, 'Iraqi, Maghribi, Amir Khusrau, Sa'di, Hafiz, Jam! and many another must be read; I have attempted in my Immortal Rose to give a few illustrations of the development of this school of poetry, and would refer the reader curious for examples to that anthology. But the matter is not altogether free of difficulties and complexities, for several of the Sufi poets were at the same time earning their livelihood by courting kings and princes, and many of their lyrics must be,regarded as double allegories—the reference is made simultaneously to the Divine Beloved, and to the very earthly patron whose favour is no less difficult to win. This caution seems to be especially necessary in the case of Hafiz, but Sana'i and Sa'di are also to be handled with care. Running through all the poets—and even Rumi comes into this— there is also an element of human affection, so that the visible object of regard, be he a handsome young Sufi or a revered preceptor, shares with God the poet's passionate addresses.

But it is a difficult position to maintain consis­tently; while one can be confident that such austere mystics as 'Attar, Riimi and Jami were wholly innocent in their use of this dangerous imagery, it is by no means to be imagined that others employing the language of the tavern did not refer to a literal as well as a metaphorical drunkenness. There is also a third kind of intoxication, the intoxication of the intellect, what I have referred to else­where as the philosophy of unreason 7; I believe this to be the implication of Hafiz' wine-vocabulary, and most likely too of 'Umar Khaiyam's. While the language of love and wine is common to all the Persian mystical poets, Riimi stands out supreme in this convention and technique too, not indeed for stylistic perfection-Sa'di and Hafiz are his superiors there­but fo r inventiveness of imagery and ·fertility of allusion. He superimposes upon the general fo undation of Sufi metaphor several new ranges of comparison; one category he derives from the ritual of his religious Order, with its dancing and music, so that the drum, the reed-pipe, the whirling movements of the dervishes, all have their special mystic meanings. Riimi is particularly fascinated by the idea of rotation, and under the inspiration of the Mev levi dance he invents a wonderfu l symbolism of circling spheres and planets, of mill-wheel and mill-stone. Thy mountain of the sun I'll fa shion to a mill, And as my waters run. I'll turn thee at my will.

Thereafter, although through the numerous and ever multiplying Religious Orders the influence of Sufi thought and practice became constantly more wide­spread, and though sultans and princes did not disdain to lend the movement their patronage and personal adherence-a striking example is thਉ noble and pathetic figure of Dara Shikoh, son of the Mogul emperor Shah J ahan, who wrote a number of books on Sufism, in one of which, the Majma' at-bahrain, 1 he sought to reconcile its theory with the Vedanta-the signs of decay appear more and more clearly, and abuse and scandal assail and threaten to destroy its fair reputation. It was inevitable, as soon as legends of miracles became attached to the names of the great mystics, that the credulous masses should applaud imposture more than true devotion; the cult of saints, against which orthodox Islam ineffectually protested, promoted ignorance and superstition, and confounded charlatanry with lofty speculation. To live scandalously, to act impudently, to speak unintelligibly-this was the easy highroad to fame, wealth and power. The history of the decline varies from country to country according to circumstance, but the general pattern, though admitting differences of detail, is fairly consistent throughout.

A modern Egyptian researcher has dated the decline of true Sufism in his country from the political and economic disorders of the second half of the 9I I sth and the beginning of the IO/I6th centuries. 2 Though this is perhaps too broad a generalisation-for there can be little doubt that the decay set in considerably earlier-it is certainly true that Sufism shared in the general collapse of learning which preceded the Ottoman conquest. The picture drawn of Sufi life in those times reveals how completely unreason had triumphed over the sober speculation and steadfast piety of the great mystics. Not only did the popular \"saints\" exhibit the utmost contempt fo r the ritual obligations of Islam, so that they made a boast of not performing the prayers-and one, Barakat al-Khaiyat (d.g23/1517), on being pressed by the Mufti and Ulema of the Azhar to accompany them to Friday prayer, obliged them by performing the ritual ablutions in filthy water-but they also treated the secular rulers of the country with outrageous impertinence. As for the example they offered to the public at large, the story is told how 'Ali Wahish (d.g17 /151 1) made a special point of display­ing his bestialism on the common highway whenever opportunity presented itself. 3 The neglect of religious ordinance and moral order was serious enough; even more disastrous was the contempt fo r all learning, which now masqueraded in the thread­bare garb of piety. For whatever the Sufis of old may have been-and many of them were openly hostile to orthodoxy a;nd bold against authority of every kind­they generally maintained a decent respect for study, and constantly had upon their lips the Prophet's injunction to \"seek learning, even if it be from China.\" The new Sufis, however, made boast of ignorance, which they"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"THE DECAY OF SUFISM I2I were indeed interested to applaud in the masses, fo r it secured them from rational attack and lent credence to their claims of miraculous powers.

The Religious Orders spread their influence and their organisation throughout the country, ruling the masses through a well-planned hierarchy that allowed the freest regional autonomy. Every village or group of villages acquired its local saint, to be supported and revered during his lifetime, worshipped and capitalised after his death.

And that is due to blindness of vision: woe to the man whose heart God has blinded ! Such was the dark side of Sufism in its last phase. It is a picture familiar enough from the accounts of travellers in the Muslim world during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; and it is the picture that is all too present before the eyes of modern Muslim thinkers when they write on Sufism in general. It is understandable that the renaissance of learning in Islam should have been accompanied by a violent reaction against the abuses and superstitions which were rightly regarded as important causes of the back­wardness of these peoples. Sufism was now increasingly the prime target of attack fo r those wrathful intellectuals who desired to see their countries independent, and their countrymen delivered from the bondage of spiritual enslavement. Though the Sufi Orde:r:s continued-and in many countries continue-to hold the interest and allegiance of the ignorant masses, no man of education would care to speak in their favour. Yet while admitting the deplorable effects of supersti­tion allied to mystification, it would surely be unjust to pretend that Sufism, even in the last stages of its decay, did not retain some noble and ennobling elements, or that its influence at its most degraded period was wholly evil. Though no doubt the majority of these professional mystics were either hypocrites or self-deluded, and battened on the credulity of their fo llowers, the movement never at any time lacked fo r a fe w sincere men of high principles and true faith, whose example shed a brave light in the surrounding darkness of ignorance and misery.

The political intriguer is ready to guarantee an earthly paradise as the swift reward fo r murderous insurrection; but those peoples among whom murder and insurrection have had free play do not appear to have approached very appreciably towards the promised land. The mystic holds out the prospect of present tranquillity and future bliss as the consequence of accepting God's Will; the first part of their programme is certainly fulfilled, so that men who lack not courage and resource are able to suffer the most shocking blows of fo rtune without losing their faith and human dignity. It is easy to laugh at the fo llies of credulity; but is not credulity itself but the poor relation of fa ith? And without faith, hope withers and love dies, and all the light goes out of life. Even in its death-throes Sufism gave birth to a man of no small genius, whose life and writings mirror faithfully the worst as well as the best of this final period. 'Abd al­Wahhab al-Sha'rani (8g8-973/1493-I565) lived through the ruin of Mamluk rule and the subjugation of Egypt to the Turks, yet he was learned in all the Muslim sciences, and himself wrote upwards of sixty books, mostly Sufi in character. A Western critic has appraised him as \"a com­prehensive and honest scholar of wide education but uncritical and highly superstitious. His tremendous exaggeration of his own value is an unpleasant fe ature in him; he usually boasts of his own works that they were pioneers and nothing similar existed on the particular subject. But the honesty, uprightness and enthusiasm of his character, his championship of justice, humanity and toleration, his sincerity and the fr ankness with which he holds up the modesty of the Christians and Jews as a pattern for the 'Ulamii, and finally his high respect fo r the dignity of womanhood all make an exceedingly favourable impression.\" 5"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"12 4  SUFISM  In point of fact there is nothing very original about al-Sha'ranfs doctrines; he is content, like all in this period of decline, to epitomise and annotate the writings of the great masters, shaping the pattern alike of his life and his thought to the model they invented so long ago.

So he died, and so he was buried. I saw him after his death, and asked him, 'Are you still paralysed?' He replied, 'Yes, and I shall be raised up like this too, and mostly on account of you and Shaikh Shu'aib the Preacher.' When I told this to Shaikh Shu'aib, he remarked, 'Yes, it is quite true.

Its heat will burn up all the corrupt particles in the body, while the sound particles will be irradiated by the Light of Majesty.
