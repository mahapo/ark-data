When I inquired into spiritual dimensions of Islamwithin the larger doctrinal tradition, the superficial dichotomybetween\u0002ulamå\u0001– the trained scholars – and s≠f⁄s (mystics of Islam)was the accepted model of presenting the subject. Some legitimates≠f⁄s were masters of the inner spiritual life of Islam, while the\u0002ulamå\u0001were the true religious authorities of the Islamic tradition.In recent years, excellent scholarship by Carl Ernst, WilliamChittick, and Annemarie Schimmel and many others has demon-strated the false pretense in documenting constructions of anti-s≠f⁄rhetoric.1The modern period is filled with many complexities of secular versus religious thinking, science versus philosophy,western versus eastern civilizations, developed versus underdevel-oped societies, male versus female, and so on, which has set a cycleof dichotomous models as the natural way of studying traditions.As a result, there is a center of authorities that has control overreal knowledge and then on the periphery are opposition groupswho are perceived, understood, and presented as fringe irrationalesoteric minded individuals. However, many individuals whocharacterized the s≠f⁄tradition in these definitions, which are trans-parent categories, have constructed it with modern agendas ornever studied the basic concepts of s≠f⁄knowledge.Within the Islamic tradition, modern reformers have argued thats≠f⁄s are the one single reason for weakening Islam and initiated the decline of Islamic thought.2These reformers hold s≠f⁄s respon-sible for the collapse of Islamdom which paved the way for Euro-pean domination. Reformers argue some major repetitive themes such as the factionalism of the s≠f⁄institutionkhånaqåh, the “cult11111011111110111011101111111olio1"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"worship” of s≠f⁄shaikhs, and the convergence of philosophy withmystical theology. Essentially, modern Muslim reformers call for a process of internal purification of Islamic thought, practice, and education in order to return to the glory days of high Islamdomculture.3One of the main historical problems that still exist in studyingthe s≠f⁄tradition is the acceptance of the \u0002ulamå\u0001versus s≠f⁄para-digm. Scholars like Ira Lapidus, Marshall Hodgson and FazlurRahman used this two-tiered model where there is a normativeofficial religion organized under the authority of the clerics anddesigned for the cultural elite.4Any deviation from the “main-stream official religion” is an aberration from the original doctrinesof Islam and such practices are followed by the masses orcommonly referred to as “popular religion.” Until recently, s≠f⁄swere categorized under the title of popular religion which wasbased on fixed, superstitious, misguided beliefs and practices in-fluenced by other religious traditions. It was suggested that thepeople who practiced these s≠f⁄beliefs were illiterate, anarchistic,and opponents to the religion of the literate clerics. Also, the masseswho took part in “popular religion” were not susceptible to histori-cal changes or capable of contributing intellectually to the tradi-tion.5Fazlur Rahman argued that the appeal of the s≠f⁄traditionwas due to the deceptive and spiritual demagogy of s≠f⁄shaikhssupports this line of thinking. He stated the following:Instead of being a method of moral self-discipline andelevation and genuine spiritual enlightenment, S≠fism wasnow transformed into veritable spiritual jugglery throughauto-hypnotic transports and visions just as at the level ofdoctrine it was being transmuted into a half-delirioustheosophy.6Fortunately, S≠f⁄studies have progressed since Rahman withworks specializing in s≠f⁄thought, mystical theology, s≠f⁄author-ity, the ta‚awwufpath, ethics, epistemology, and analysis of modelsof the s≠f⁄journey. Some recent works by Th. Emil Homerin, ValeriHoffman, Vincent Cornell, and Stephen Hirtenstein have given thefield of S≠f⁄studies a new way of thinking about s≠f⁄s and theirreligious practices.7These works are important in many respectsbecause these authors, and others, have analyzed s≠f⁄authority, themystical teachings of s≠f⁄shaikhs, the conduct of s≠f⁄disciples withmediating s≠f⁄shaikhs, critical theories of s≠f⁄theology, and s≠f⁄INTRODUCTION111011110111011101111111lio2"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"epistemology. This current work builds upon the works of pastscholars and their interests in the s≠f⁄tradition, and moves to incor-porate the various intellectual, religious, political, philosophical,literary, artistic, and theological contributions to the tradition ofIslam.The field of S≠f⁄studies still has a number of problematic andoutdated theories regarding the perception of s≠f⁄theology and theta‚awwufpath. It is not my claim here that all scholarship producedby researchers concerned with data information and social roles ofs≠f⁄s is absolutely invaluable to the understanding of the s≠f⁄tradition. Rather, these types of works are useful in providing asocial historical context of the tradition. The main problem withdata-oriented scholarship is that it is tied with an area studiesapproach toward ta‚awwufand it sets superficial and isolatedcategories on the s≠f⁄shaikh, the †ar⁄qa, and the larger theologicalaspects of ta‚awwuftradition. In some works, there is no cohesivebridge between one †ar⁄qato another †ar⁄qaor there is no connec-tion to the larger intellectual, religious, and philosophical Islamiccontext. As a result, the achievements of s≠f⁄shaikhs and their s≠f⁄orders are unique only to Egypt, to Turkey, or to Iran, or it ispresented as a special case study within the entire Islamic tradition.8The pendulum often swings the other way too; that is, one s≠f⁄shaikh’s metaphysical or ta‚awwuftheories influenced all scholar-ship in the region and touched every life in the Islamic community.As in area studies, generally speaking, the scholarship on the s≠f⁄tradition suffers from narrow interpretations and courageousconclusions of uniqueness while neglecting what the s≠f⁄traditionmeans to human existence and to the human spirit. As an example, Ira Lapidus’s work on the history of Islamicsocieties is an important contribution because of its depth and inte-grated overview of various sections of Islamic communities. In thearea of the s≠f⁄tradition, he situates s≠f⁄as members in socialorganizations and part of the larger society. During the medievalMiddle Eastern urban eras, he categorized s≠f⁄s into three areas of society: first there were s≠f⁄s who were part of the \u0002ulamå\u0001group; second there were s≠f⁄s who led ascetic lives, and third therewere s≠f⁄s who were considered to be extreme in every practice and belief.9Also, Richard Eaton built on the social function of s≠f⁄s in India by studying their multi-level relationships and func-tion in society. Eaton demonstrated that s≠f⁄s acted as reformists,warriors, literati, wealthy landowners, and ascetic dervishes. Withmuch criticism to his interpretation of s≠f⁄documents, EatonINTRODUCTION11111011111110111011101111111olio3"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"concentrated on s≠f⁄s as social actors who performed a variety offunctions for the state.10While all of these categories are pertinentto making sense of the social context, it does not explain the fluidityof s≠f⁄s at various cross-sections of Islamic society; more import-antly, it does not address how their ta‚awwufgave sacred meaningto their lives.Clearly S≠f⁄studies has developed enormously since the works ofLapidus and Eaton, but what has persevered in the scholarship arethe\u0002ulamå\u0001–s≠f⁄relationship models and the social roles of s≠f⁄s indifferent cross-sections of society. In consistency with these models,the perception of s≠f⁄s as primarily intoxicated, dancing, sociallywithdrawn ascetics is still conjured up in contemporary works. Thisidea is continued with s≠f⁄s or dervishes who needed no spiritualguidance from a teacher, and essentially, the belief that the ta‚awwuftradition is nothing more than an individual journey without anyboundaries or religious instruction. Some of the problems that areassociated with the individual s≠f⁄journey without any structure tothe Islamic doctrines and law are tied to western studies of mysti-cism like that of William James and Evelyn Underhill and the influ-ence of their own traditions on their work.11Given the rampantR≠m⁄-mania in contemporary American S≠fism and in New AgeReligious movements, the perception of s≠f⁄s with absolutely no the-ological base in the Qur\u0001ån,shar⁄\u0002åor adhering to the sunnåof theProphet is alien to the history of the s≠f⁄tradition.12Some contem-porary works on ta‚awwuf, specifically on R≠m⁄, never or hardlymention the theological roots of the s≠f⁄shaikh or his s≠f⁄orderbeing studied, and rarely will one see the correlation of the s≠f⁄shaikh’s theosophy with the Qur\u0001ån, and ªad⁄thsandsunnåof theProphet. This is a major problem when one is content with won-derful mystical statements on reunion with God and being detachedfrom the world, but there is no critical analysis of the theology andphilosophy of the shaikh’s ta‚awwufwithin the Islamic context.Suhraward⁄studiesWithin the area of Suhraward⁄studies, the majority of works havefocused on one figure who coalesced Persian philosophy, the s≠f⁄tradition, and reason with the Greek intellectual tradition. SinceOtto Spies published Three Treatises on Mysticism by ShihabuddinSuhrawerdi Maqtul, Shihåb al-d⁄n al-Suhraward⁄’s (d. 1191)philosophy of illumination (Óikmat al-Ishråq⁄) has been revivedand studied by John Walbridge, Mehdi Amin Razavi, Hossein Ziai,INTRODUCTION111011110111011101111111lio4"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"and Henry Corbin.13Many of these works are studies of history ofphilosophy and focus upon logic, syllogism, and epistemology crit-icism and not on Shihåb al-d⁄n al-Suhraward⁄’sta‚awwufas itpertains to the Islamic religious tradition. In this list of Shihåb al-d⁄n al-Suhraward⁄’s texts is Emile Maalouf’s monograph entitledRisålat Maqåmåt al-Í≠f⁄ya – The S≠f⁄Stationsrelated to theauthor’s ideas on metaphysics, s≠f⁄stations and states, and teach-ings.14Another study that concentrated on this single figure’sillumination mysticism is William M. Thackston’s The mystical andvisionary treatises of Shihabuddin Yahya Suhraward⁄.15While thesebooks bring a critical understanding of ishråq⁄philosophy withother humanistic philosophies, one does not know more aboutSuhraward⁄ta‚awwufin a larger Islamic doctrinal context.The serious problems in Suhraward⁄studies have been the satu-ration of the study of only one thinker and the scholarly neglect ofanalyzing the larger Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄orders in the Middle East andin South Asia. To assume that there are no Suhraward⁄s afterShihåb al-d⁄n al-Suhraward⁄or that ishråq⁄philosophy is the foun-dation of all Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s, common statements among scholarsof Persian s≠fism, reinforces the influence of modern culturalagendas in area studies. Fortunately, recently a small group ofscholars has focused on other important members of theSuhraward⁄s≠f⁄order.Kitåbådåb al-Mur⁄d⁄n of Ab≠al-Naj⁄b al-Suhraward⁄was translated by Menahem Milson; Richard Gramlichwrote an excellent textual analysis of \u0001Umar al-Suhraward⁄’s trea-tise in Die Gaben der Erkenntnisse des \u0002Umar as-Suhraward⁄(\u0002Awårif al-Ma\u0002årif); and Aisha Yusuf Manai’s doctoral thesisfocused on al-Suhraward⁄’s life and ta‚awwufinAb≠Hafs\u0002Umaral-Suhraward⁄: hayåtuh≠wa-ta‚awwufu.16Angelika Haartmann’sAn-Nåsir li-Din Allåhfocused on the policies of caliph al-Nåsirand included references to al-Suhraward⁄; and, in Damascus, Dar al-Anwar published al-Suhraward⁄’s text Rasa’il a’lam al-huda wa ‘aqidåt arbåb al-tuqa.17There is a good amount ofsecondary sources written in Urdu and Punjabi, mainly because the Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄are still an active s≠f⁄order in South Asia.Scholarship and critical research is not precisely the same as it isin western academia, however, since these works mainly reviewSuhraward⁄shaikhs and their respective ta‚awwuftheologies.

Shaikh Ab≠Hafs\u0001Umar al-Suhraward⁄wrote a succinct and an influential s≠f⁄treatise of that time and itwas widely distributed and studied by other s≠f⁄orders. Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s\u0002Awårif al-Ma\u0002årifwas widely read because it servedas a manual for ta‚awwufpractices and studying s≠f⁄theology.Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s work contains instructional guidelines forinternal and external discipline for s≠f⁄s to follow in every aspectof life. For instance, in performing the ablution ritual for prayer,al-Suhraward⁄explains what the believer needs to recite and thinkin almost every component of the ritual.While washing his hands, the believer says: God, I only askyou for happiness and blessing and I seek refuge with youfrom misfortune and disaster. While rinsing his mouth hesays: My God, Bless Muhammad and help me to reciteyour book and to remember you often. While taking thewater into the nostrils one says: O my God, Bless Muham-mad and let me experience the fragrance of Paradise whenyou are content with me. While blowing out the water onesays: My God, bless Muhammad. I take refuge with youfrom the stench of Hell fire.19Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s description demonstrates a ta‚awwufthat is deeply committed to the minute details of faith because everyact and thought advances the s≠f⁄disciple toward the Creator. Theta‚awwufbeliefs of al-Suhraward⁄are a combination of living a lifein this world and observing strict ta‚awwuf–shar⁄\u0002åguidelineswhich is understood as a comprehensive discipline.Why study the Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s?The Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s still exist in the Islamic world and have madeimmense intellectual, historical, literary, political, economical, andspiritual contributions to the Islamic tradition. Their s≠f⁄orderstretches from many corners of the world, now in both western andeastern societies, and have historically been scholars of shar⁄\u0002å,fiqh,Qur\u0002ånic and ªad⁄thstudies, philosophy, metaphysics, theology,INTRODUCTION111011110111011101111111lio6"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"logic and reason, ethics, and ta‚awwuf. While their original s≠f⁄khånaqåhswere in Iran and Iraq, they rapidly expanded and flour-ished in Syria, Anatolia, and in South Asia. A study of the historyof Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s and of their theological ta‚awwufin theseregions and in different periods is needed for an understanding oftheir enormous contribution to the Islamic tradition. The goal of this work is to move beyond the dichotomous models of “official” versus “popular” religion by viewing Shaikhal-Suhraward⁄and the Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s as members of societyconcerned with ta‚awwufand upholding the shar⁄\u0002åandsunnåofthe Prophet. This work examines sources that prove that, at times,Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s were members of the cultural elite and pivotalpolitical figures of the state enterprise, but at other times there wereSuhraward⁄s who secluded themselves from political activities andthe luxuries of materialism.

Thetheoretical limits of this study are not restricted to the dualisticmodel of world-embracing s≠f⁄s versus world-rejecting s≠f⁄s. It isclear that from early Suhraward⁄history they professed the ideasof living and enjoying the worldly life but within the confines of astructured, disciplined guidance of elder s≠f⁄shaikhs who knewfiqh,shar⁄\u0002å, Qur\u0002ånic and ªad⁄thstudies, and kept the spiritualityof the Prophet in the forefront of their ta‚awwuf.This work is interested in the ways in which Suhraward⁄s inter-preted their ta‚awwufand as s≠f⁄s how they made each con-struction into a sacred experience. Whether it is political activities,social charities, or anti-social behavior, the way Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄sviewed the world as manifestations of the sacred (and through theirrituals they symbolically united with the holy) is critical for thisstudy.

The chronological period extends from early thir-teenth century to the late fourteenth century, to be specific, the timewhen Shaikh \u0001Umar al-Suhraward⁄is appointed the shaikh al-Islåmunder caliph al-Nåsir.

For some have argued that hagiographicaland s≠f⁄literature are filled with exaggerations and excessive devo-tion to the s≠f⁄shaikhs. However, these sacred texts cannot be dis-missed as unreadable for scholarly research, rather they serve to beinstructional for readers and devotees alike.21If one is to only readthese sacred texts as instructional guides to condition the humanpsyche, then one fails to understand how these texts bring about anawareness, a new enlightenment to the reader.In Chapter 1, this study investigates Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’spolitical career in the context of working toward consolidatingcaliph al-Nåsir’s empire and simultaneously attempting to estab-lish the Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄order. It examines the dynamics of this s≠f⁄–state relationship on two levels. On the popular level, al-Suhraward⁄’s social and religious influence contributed to thedefeat of anarchistic fityångroups and at the same time unified the decentralized fut≠wwainstitution. In addition he workedtoward building a positive, coalescing relationship with the alien-ated Nizår⁄Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄community. On a political level Shaikhal-Suhraward⁄advocated and popularized a specific religious beliefthat equated the caliph as the main defender of shar⁄\u0002å. This sectiondiscusses al-Suhraward⁄’s reformist ideas connecting the two areasofta‚awwufand politics, and how these changes were critical forconsolidating the power base of the caliphate. It demonstrates thatfrom the beginning the Suhraward⁄were a politically driven s≠f⁄order because of their deep commitment to defending shar⁄\u0002åandthe authority of the caliph. This chapter highlights the political,social and religious climate in which Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄wasinvolved and it shows a growth in Suhraward⁄ta‚awwuf. It empha-sizes the critical point that ta‚awwuf, according to the shaikh, doesnot necessarily have to be compromised or sacrificed if properlyunderstood and practiced.Chapter 2 examines al-Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄religious and culturalattitudes that became normative for the Suhraward⁄order. Atextual analysis of al-Suhraward⁄’s treatise, \u0002Awårif al-Ma\u0002årif,demonstrates his understanding of an ideal world and whatINTRODUCTION11111011111110111011101111111olio9"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"methods are involved in achieving it. Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄believedthat his †ar⁄qawas more than an organization for s≠f⁄s to learnspiritual purity, but every single action and thought was related tothe larger purpose of returning to the divine. To him, this meantthat s≠f⁄s and non-s≠f⁄s were responsible for controlling them-selves at every moment, in every place. Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’semphasis on an internal and external structure for the individualrequired a strict observance to hierarchies, rituals, worship,political authority, social etiquette, shar⁄\u0002å,Qur\u0001ån,ªad⁄ths, andta‚awwufpractices, all for the purpose of preparing for the momentof unity. These concrete views of living in this world to create anideal world served to be the religious ideological foundation forsuccessive Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s.The main concern for Chapter 3 is the eastward expansion ofthe Suhraward⁄order to Multan by al-Suhraward⁄’s primarykhalifåShaikh Baha\u0002udd⁄n Zakariyya. An analysis of MultaniSuhraward⁄biographical collections (tazkiråt), recorded s≠f⁄conversations (malf≠zåt), and a collection of religious opinions(makt≠bat), illustrates how successive Suhraward⁄s recollected,interpreted, imagined, and practiced a particular type of Suhra-ward⁄ta‚awwuf. This demonstrates both a continuity in theSuhraward⁄ta‚awwuftradition, as well as significant changes thatwere required to adjust to the challenges of Multan and Ucch inthe Delhi Sultanate period. Unlike Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s supremeauthority in thirteenth-century Baghdad, Multani Suhraward⁄s inthe mid-thirteenth-century and fourteenth century were confrontedwith unstable and altering governments and intense competitionfrom other s≠f⁄orders and \u0002ulamå\u0001. In addition, being situated in apredominantly non-Muslim region allowed Suhraward⁄s to takepart in unprecedented cultural and religious exchanges. It demon-strates that Suhraward⁄ta‚awwufin many ways adjusted to a newcultural, social, economical, and political region, but the ta‚awwufof political activism, defending the shar⁄\u0002å, and following the sunnåof the Prophet were all equally important in institutionalizing thes≠f⁄order.After the discussion of the Suhraward⁄order’s adjustment andassimilation to Multan, Chapter 4 concentrates on the ways inwhich Suhraward⁄ta‚awwufconsisted of symbolic meanings thatcommunicated an aspect of their spiritual beliefs. It is concernedwith Suhraward⁄rituals as living and breathing symbols that werepurposely constructed to be a part of a larger whole.

Ab≠Naj⁄b al-Suhraward⁄was born in 1097 in thetown of Suhraward, which is west of Sultaniyya, in the provinceof al-Jibal, Iran. Shaikh Ab≠\u0002n-Naj⁄b (d. 1168) became involvedwith the s≠f⁄tradition with his association with Shaikh Ahmad al-Ghazål⁄, the brother of the well-known Ab≠Óamid al-Ghazål⁄,educator and scholar at the Nizåm⁄yyamadrasain Baghdad. It wasShaikh Ahmad al-Ghazål⁄who invited Shaikh Ab≠Naj⁄b to becomehis disciple and advance in his studies of ta‚awwuf. No sooner had he become proficient in s≠f⁄spirituality, than Shaikh Ab≠Naj⁄bal-Suhraward⁄built a khånaqåhon the banks of the Tigris river,and wrote the popular s≠f⁄manualÅdåb al-Mur⁄d⁄n, that describesthe importance of disciplined s≠f⁄behavior. Shaikh Ahmad al-Ghazål⁄, Shaikh Ab≠Naj⁄b and their contemporary \u0001Ainu\u0002l-Quzåt,all belonged to the Junåyd⁄school of ta‚awwuf. But contrary toJunåyd’s mystical tradition of sobriety (sahw) they were all moreinclined toward mystical intoxication or sukr.1Preachings andwritings by Shaikh \u0001Ainu\u0002l-Quzåt infuriated the shar⁄\u0002å-mindedscholars and he was imprisoned in Baghdad. \u0001Ainu\u0002l-Quzåt’sTamhidåttreatise argued that his doctrine of fanå\u0001was neitherpantheism nor introducing the contingent being into God’s Being.2\u0001Ainu\u0002l-Quzåt asserted that he was not different from earlier s≠f⁄sbut firmly agreed in many of areas of ta‚awwufwith the greatscholar Ab≠Óamid al-Ghazål⁄(d. 1111).

After a systematic study of ta‚awwufandlegal studies the young al-Suhraward⁄was initiated into ta‚awwufby his uncle, Shaikh Ab≠Naj⁄b al-Suhraward⁄. It was not longbefore the budding scholar of ta‚awwufwould encounter criticismfrom senior theologians and legalists. In his late teenage years, al-Suhraward⁄came across vigorous opposition from the greatestHanbal⁄theologian in Baghdad, Abdu\u0002r Rahmån ibn al-Jawz⁄(1126–1200),3who was also a master interpreter of jurisprudence(fiqh) and ªad⁄ths(muªad⁄th). Abdu\u0002r Rahmån ibn al-Jawz⁄was aprolific author and preacher, and held a considerable amount ofreligious and political influence with the \u0001Abbåsid Caliphs as thedesignatedShaikh al-Islåm. Aside from the religious differencesbetween Ibn al-Jawz⁄’s legalist thought and Jilån⁄’sta‚awwufunderstanding of Islåm, Shaikh ibn al-Jawz⁄accused al-Suhra-ward⁄’s teachings of furthering the cause of philosophical heresy inIslamic intellectual circles. Criticisms against al-Suhraward⁄werenot isolated events, but according to Ibn al-Jawz⁄’sNaqd al-\u0001Ilm wa\u0002l-\u0001ulamå\u0001andTalb⁄s Ibl⁄she went so far as to condemn non-Sunn⁄sects and even attacked a large number of Sunn⁄jurisconsults,shar⁄\u0002å-minded folks and leading s≠f⁄s including Ab≠ ̋ålib al-Målik⁄, Qushåir⁄and Ab≠Óamid al-Ghazål⁄.4The turningpoint to Ibn-al-Jawz⁄’s public service came when caliph al-Nåsir(1179–1225) reversed the policy of blind support for Ibn al-Jawz⁄,and instituted more of a “middle-of-the-road” and centrist policyoutlined by Shaikh Ab≠Hafs\u0001Umar al-Suhraward⁄. Like Ibn al-Jawz⁄, Shaikh \u0001Umar al-Suhraward⁄served as political–religiousadvisor in the capacity of Shaikh al-Islåm, as which he assisted the\u0001Abbåsid administration’s goal of consolidating power in globalIslamic politics.

In his s≠f⁄beliefs,al-Suhraward⁄was quite conservative and spoke out against thephilosophical speculative orientation of his contemporaries, such as Ibn-\u0001Arab⁄. He was a strong supporter for obeying Islamic law(shar⁄\u0002å) as the legitimate form for society to be structured and for true religious understanding. With shar⁄\u0002åand other related dis-ciplines such as theology, Qur\u0002ånictafs⁄r, and sunnåstudies,al-Suhraward⁄believed that they all must be strictly observed for realinner spiritual ascension. For him, theshar⁄\u0002åwas not only a set oflegal codes to memorize, understand, and enact, but it entailed adeeper understanding of the divine path that leads the individualback to the creator. Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄believed that thoseindividuals who argued over the insignificant minuscule elements of the shar⁄\u0002åwere lost in human argumentation and missed theobvious divine essence. He explicitly opposed the philosophicalspeculation of the Faylas≠fs, because an untrained person could put forth an interpretation that is totally false from the Islamic prin-ciples. Even with these discrepancies, Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄wastolerant of all kinds of s≠f⁄beliefs and practices, but was interestedin those who followed the particular Suhraward⁄yyata‚awwufway of obeying the shar⁄\u0002åand adhering completely to the sunnåofthe Prophet.Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄viewed s≠f⁄beliefs as a way to perfect devo-tion in which one can fully enjoy divine beauty; ta‚awwufwas therecreation of a divine connection one had previously experienced ina pre-existent time. To him this did not contradict the use of goodsense and the ability to lead a practical life by embracing the bene-fits of this world. He encouraged living in a s≠f⁄lodge,khånaqåh,while at the same time earning an income by working. Within thekhånaqåhthere were several administrative and clerical positionsthat provided a salary, but the khånaqåhinstitution was supportedby charitable foundations (\u0002awqåf) and could not employ all of itsdisciples, but more often the disciples who dedicated their lives tothe order took on the limited positions.6Thekhånaqåhhad a pri-maryshaikh al-s≠f⁄yyåwho was the spiritual leader of the organi-zation.

TheProphet Muhammad was the primary model for s≠f⁄s to mirrorthemselves on because he embodied human perfection and ultimatedivine guidance. For shaikh al-Suhraward⁄there were only a fewadvanced spiritual devotees who were able to pray all night andwork all day. For the rest of the believers, according to Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄, all they had to do was to combine following thesunnåof the Prophet and studying the Qur\u0001ånwith certain s≠f⁄practices, such as dhikr, as part of their daily routine. On thedebatable issue of whether s≠f⁄s should maintain a celibate lifestyle,he felt that only the s≠f⁄shaikhs were qualified to judge their disci-ples on whether they were spiritually equipped to take on thatchallenge. His defense in opposing the practice of celibacy was thatit was not practiced by the Prophet Muhammad himself; however,Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄thought it was permissible for the few elitespiritually advanced s≠f⁄elders. But one area he was very adamantabout counteracting was the lifestyle of the nomadic beggingQalandars, who were extremely controversial at this time becauseof their antinomian characteristics and outward disrespect for theshar⁄\u0002å. While the Qalandars(sometimes called Dervishes) were nots≠f⁄s associated with the state or organized †ar⁄qåts, they were moreor less connected through deep individual conviction of their ownpersonal journey. For al-Suhraward⁄, the Qalandars’ disregard forthe state was far from any reasonable interpretation of the madªåbsand their awkward ascetic way of life could not have had any asso-ciations to any of the shar⁄\u0002å-obeying established s≠f⁄†ar⁄qåt.For many political theorists during this time like al-Måward⁄,who believed that an effective caliph should designate power toregional sultåns in order to maintain a centralized authority, Shaikhal-Suhraward⁄felt that the caliph was the central focus of theshar⁄\u0002å.8With the aid of expert advisors, the shaikh felt that the caliph had the sole authority to determine internal and inter-national policies.

While caliph al-Nåsir’s role as theprime supreme s≠f⁄was not explicitly expressed in s≠f⁄terms,he was directly involved as the leader of fut≠wwagroups. Thesefut≠wwagroups were the main channel for expressing lower-classinterest in the urban centers, and they were pervaded by s≠f⁄teach-ings and a s≠f⁄networking system. Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄taughtthat the fut≠wwasystem was a part of the s≠f⁄way, intended forordinary folks who found s≠f⁄†ar⁄qåtstoo demanding for them tobecome associated. Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄advocated that fityånwere inherently part of the larger shar⁄\u0002åsystem, where of course,the caliph was responsible for all religious, social, and politicalactivities, and these powers were sanctioned by the divine.Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s hierarchical model established the prior-ity of the fut≠wwa, s≠f⁄orders, and the caliphate in an ascendingorder. He defined the caliph as the “representative” or “viceregent”(khal⁄fa) of God on earth. According to him, humanity is incapableof returning to God on its own without a temporal overseer. Forthis reason God chose a mediator, was⁄la, between Himself andhuman beings. It is the caliph who is the representative of God and has the ultimate responsibility to bring human beings from acorrupt way of living and back to Him.9Those mediators who arenear to God provide a service for the pious collective community,jama\u0002åt.10Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄became one of the most import-ant associates in structuring caliph al-Nåsir’s domestic and foreignpolicies and he went on key diplomatic missions with these ideasin mind.

Al-Suhraward⁄’s political activitiesdemonstrate another significant dimension to the development andinstitutionalization of s≠f⁄orders during the thirteenth and four-teenth centuries. On one level he was serving as a political advisorfor the caliph of the \u0001Abbåsid dynasty who needed his expertise inbuilding alliances and confidence with other Muslim adminis-trations. On another level, Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄possessed aconsiderable religious authority in both areas of legal training andta‚awwufIslåm.11The reason al-Suhraward⁄stands out among hiscontemporaries is because he achieved a high position in the state’sapparatus, and was responsible for consolidating its power base,while at the same time being able to penetrate into weak socialinstitutions. The way Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄successfully balanceda s≠f⁄–state cooperative relationship leads to a greater under-standing of the way these relationships influenced caliph al-Nåsir’sadministration (1180–1225), and more importantly, how theserelationships affected the outcome of state policies and the expan-sion of the Suhraward⁄yya order. It is important to put al-Suhraward⁄in his context as a political and religious advisor duringcaliph al-Nåsir’s reign in order to realize his contributions onmultiple levels.The ideological side to the policies of the \u0001Abbåsid caliph al-Nåsirprovides answers to his objectives in being the “caliph of unity.”Shaikh\u0001Ab≠Hafs\u0001Umar al-Suhraward⁄(1145–1236) appears tohave been one of many advisors to assist in caliph al-Nåsir’s aimsof consolidating his control over various Islamic institutions andregions.

He used it to strengthen his own power base in fut≠wwagroups by maintaining influential Hanbal⁄authorities for the trans-mission of ªad⁄th, such as Shaikh \u0001Abd al-Mugh⁄th, Shaikh al-Lat⁄fal-Baghdåd⁄, and Shaikh Ibn al-Mi\u0001mår.14Shaikh Ibn al-Mi\u0001mårwas a prominent chronicler of fut≠wwaritual and beliefs andultimately served as an important advisor to assert control over thefut≠wwastructure under al-Nåsir’s administration. In 1179,shortly after the caliph al-Nåsir had made his annual visit to thetomb of Ahmad ibn-Hanbal in Baghdad, he recognized the Hanbal⁄madªåbas the legal school of the administration.Caliph al-Nåsir’s involvement with fut≠wwagroupsBy the time of caliph al-Nåsir in the mid-twelfth centuy, fut≠wwagroups (pl. fityån) were institutionalized and mainly consisted ofurban lower-class men. There were several types of fut≠wwagroups; some were dedicated to occupational associations, whilesome were formed for sports and mutual aid. Many fut≠wwagroups consisted of young men and were essentially “youth gangs”that found ways to be in solidarity and assert their independ-ence in a variety of ways. It is clear that the members in fityånweremost often poor and young men who did not have the familyconnections of notables, and some had an anti-establishmentquality to them. Fut≠wwagroups maintained an unconditionalloyalty to members and to each other, even to the extent that youthgangs insisted on cutting ties from their family members.

Inaddition, a s≠f⁄influence brought a cross-regional networkingsystem that enabled fut≠wwamembers to increase their politicaland social contacts beyond their immediate neighborhoods. By the eleventh century, many fut≠wwaorganizations had adoptedaspects of s≠f⁄language for expressing loyalty and magnanimity,which they transformed into loyalty to God. Some historians of thetime interpreted the fut≠wwaas a sort of lesser s≠f⁄way for thoseunable to achieve the full mystical way. Sometimes fut≠wwaclubscame to have their own s≠f⁄ceremonies. The fut≠wwahad becomeessentially the s≠f⁄dimension of organizations.15In 1182, caliph al-Nåsir recognized a dissident branch of thefut≠wwathat had existed in Baghdad since the tenth century andcalled it “niqåbat al-fut≠wwa.” He was a member of the group, as were Shaikh \u0001Abd al-Jabbår and Shaikh Ibn Y≠suf Sålih(d. 1187) – the very person who invested al-Nåsir with the libås al-fut≠wwa. The famous chronicler, Ibn al-Jawz⁄, observed s≠f⁄traitsin the fut≠wwaof\u0001Ayyårun Fityån. There were rules of purity,respect for one’s brother, and the swearing of oaths. He called themthe “protectors of the poor and women.”16The\u0001Ayyårunwereinternally organized with a strong hierarchy of leadership, and theybelieved the state was corrupted by politicians who did not servethe community. From time to time the anarchistic views of the\u0001Ayyårunwere expressed in social unrest; they took part in lootingstate buildings, setting fires in the markets, and causing violence inthe streets.17In twelfth-century Baghdad, Ibn-Bakran was a sourceof trouble for both caliph al-Muqtaf⁄and Sultån Mas\u0001≠d. IbnBakran’s anarchistic violence flourished in the late 1130s, but even-tually he soon found himself in a close relationship with wåz⁄raz-Zaynab⁄’s son who was bestowed the saråw⁄l al-fut≠wwa, aspecial s≠f⁄garment.18The\u0001Ayyårun Fityånbecame less of a threatunder the wåz⁄rIbn-Hubayra, but within ten years of caliph al-Nåsir’s succession to the caliphate, Hanbal⁄scholars dominated thefut≠wwainstitution, which ensured a degree of stability and simul-taneously a decline in popular anti-state sentiments.

This may have very well been the reasonfor the edict of 1207. Al-Nåsir wanted to root out the fut≠wwagroups that bore arms and were linked to volunteer militia groups.For example, the aªdåth fut≠wwaorganization in Syria oftenparticipated in battles alongside the Turkic troops to defend theirregions from hostile invasions. An uncontrolled militia fut≠wwagroup would have threatened al-Nåsir’s aim of being the primaryuncontested leader of all fut≠wwaorganizations.Al-Nåsir moved to control the fut≠wwafrom within to ensurethat the past history of turbulent fityånwould not pose a threatunder his administration. After twenty-five years as an initiate inthefut≠wwa, in the year of 1207, he was ready to consolidate the position he had gradually gained. He declared himself the soleauthority over all fut≠wwaorganizations both in Baghdad and else-where, and any organization that did not acknowledge hisleadership was banned, and was not to be recognized as a truefut≠wwa.19He also went on to encourage mutual tolerance amongMuslims, with the fut≠wwarather than with the \u0001ulamå\u0001; severalfut≠wwaorganizations were told that they were integral parts ofthe Islamic umma, and that it was necessary to recognize eachother’s validity.In 1207, al-Nåsir made his political objectives clear and public.Caliph al-Nåsir recognized the fut≠wwamovement itself anddeclared all other fityånillegal except his fut≠wwaorganization.He also declared himself the central authority of the fut≠wwa.Later in the year, al-Nåsir issued another decree which set forth thecode of behavior for fut≠wwamembers and declared that God had designated the caliph as having sole responsibility to maintaintheshar⁄\u0002å. And also in 1207, al-Nåsir received his permission orijåzaas a transmitter of ªad⁄thfrom the leaders of the four schoolsof jurisprudence. A letter to the representatives of the four schoolsof jurisprudence at the Dår al-ªad⁄thin Damascus included al-Nåsir’s words of “on conditions of sound authority.”20Thisensured him full support for uniting his administration by imposinghimself not only as an active participant but also as the leader inthe forefront of that movement.Unlike other periods of time, this caliph’s period is particularlydistinct because, on the one hand, it consists of complex relation-ships between state authority, social institutions, and religiousaffairs, and on the other, there are major transformations of socialinstitutions under the direction of the \u0001Abbåsid caliph.

And was itpossible for caliph al-Nåsir to consolidate fut≠wwaorganizationswithout the assistance of Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄?These issues are very controversial for scholars like ClaudeCahen who believed that al-Nåsir recognized the fut≠wwaorder inpart to spread the ideas of al-Suhraward⁄, the principal propagan-dist of fut≠wwareforms and one of the most revered men of his day.21Cahen believed that early ideas in reforming fut≠wwaorganizations were probably not from the caliph himself, but fromshaikh al-Suhraward⁄. To him Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄was themastermind in designing the religious, political, and social reformsoffut≠wwaorganizations, because they increased the shaikh’sopportunity to advance his particular form of s≠f⁄islam to fut≠wwamembers who were already sympathetic to s≠f⁄ideals. It alsoallowed al-Suhraward⁄to recruit members to his tar⁄qaand expandSuhraward⁄khånaqåhsin the western regions. Cahen does notdiminish the importance of caliph al-Nåsir’s expansionary policies,but in regard to altering the religio-political philosophy of fityån,Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄should be given primary credit.One of the ways in which Cahen proved that al-Suhraward⁄’sefforts were essential to reconstructing fut≠wwaorganizations wasby using al-Suhraward⁄’s innovative political and religious beliefsinta‚awwuf. To Cahen, Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄developed a theoryfor unifying the caliphate in a way that fityånandta‚awwufislam were essentially one single entity. And both of these entitiesbelonged under the supervision of the caliph, where the descendingorder after the caliph was s≠f⁄†ar⁄qåts, then the fityånwhich werereally a subordinate part of the s≠f⁄†ar⁄qåts. According to Cahen,this theory certainly did not conflict with al-Nåsir’s political ambi-tions and his conception of himself as the primary leader offut≠wwaorganizations. Cahen believed it was through the signifi-cant collaborative and intellectual efforts of al-Suhraward⁄thatcaliph al-Nåsir was successful in making himself the final authorityinfut≠wwaorganizations, as well as expanding his power as thecaliph.Two authors of this period who studied fut≠wwastructure,ideas, beliefs and rituals were Ibn al-Mi\u0001mar al-Baghdåd⁄andal-Khartabirti. In Ibn al-Mi\u0001mar’sKitåb al-fut≠wwathere areTHE LIFE OF SHAIKH ‘ABÁHAFS\u0001UMAR AL-SUHRAWARDÛ111011110111011101111111lio22"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"references to al-Suhraward⁄’s statements connecting fut≠wwaorganizations to the shar⁄\u0002å.22It is not surprising then to see Ibn al-Mi\u0001mar use s≠f⁄metaphors for internal hierarchy, where the essenceof the fut≠wwais in the “kab⁄r” (elder or greater in rank) and“ibn” (son or pupil). In many respects the s≠f⁄spiritual model ofap⁄randmur⁄dwas mirrored in fityån, and in these organizationsthere was a hierarchy of its members whose main objective was touphold the precepts of Islam.23Scholarly debate over al-Nåsir’s and al-Suhraward⁄’s complexroles in the fut≠wwaorganizations and over al-Suhraward⁄’scontributions to reforming social institutions to influence a s≠f⁄theology is important to understanding the Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄order. Recently, scholars argued that caliph al-Nåsir’sfut≠wwainvolvement was a part of his social reform policy to bring aboutgreater stability to the region. However, Paul Wittek believes thatal-Nåsir’s motives were to counteract the threat of the crusaderhostility and to unite the Islamic world by means of patronizingthefut≠wwaorganizations.24The main problem in Wittek’s theoryis that caliph al-Nåsir was not in the vanguard in defending againstthe Crusaders. In fact, when Salåh ad-d⁄n requested military andeconomic support from caliph al-Nåsir, to defend against theCrusader aggression, he was given a minimum and insufficientnumber of troops. In addition to this aspect, Wittek argues that al-Nåsir – being the caliph of Baghdad, which had a considerableamount of historical, political, and religious significance to theglobal Islamic community – was mainly interested in preserving the prestigiousness of Baghdad as the center of Islamic culture byprotecting Muslims from both Crusader invasions and anarchisticfut≠wwamembers.25Wittek’s interpretation of al-Nåsir is one thatpositions the caliph in the center of Islamic politics, and as thecommander of the faithful (“amir al-mumin⁄n”) whose objectiveswere to protect the regional borders, even if it meant subvertingprivate social organizations like the fityån.For some scholars Wittek’s arguments do not take account of the nature of the relationships between the caliph and non-governmental private social organizations. To scholars likeTaeschner, the grass-roots popularity of fityånalong with theirindependent political and economic capacity was the real threat tothe established caliphate institution. According to Taeschner, caliphal-Nåsir’s role in the fityånwas mainly to strengthen the authorityof the caliphate by being the “caliph of unity.”26He thinks thecritical weakness of the fut≠wwawas that it had a vacuum ofTHE LIFE OF SHAIKH ‘ABÁHAFS\u0001UMAR AL-SUHRAWARDÛ11111011111110111011101111111olio23"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"power, and it was al-Nåsir’s aim to centralize it with him at the cen-ter.27Taeschner treats the fut≠wwaorganizations as another areafor the caliph to assert his authority over the lower classes and dis-contented of society. For Taeschner, fityånwere a perfect forum forcaliph al-Nåsir to express his newly revived authority, while at thesame time serving as the caliph who united the Islamic regions.Taeschner’s theories may not be too far from the mark with respectto thinking that caliph al-Nåsir desired to be at the center of allsocial and religious institutions, but there are weak links in the wayin which Taeschner viewed the power relationships of the caliphateand the fut≠wwainstitution. Taeschner’s view is a typical two-tiered model based on power struggles between political and socialinstitutions. In this model the caliphate is the dominant entity andthefut≠wwainstitution is the subjugated entity, and it is the objec-tive of the dominant caliphate to control all parts of the weakerfut≠wwasystem. Taeschner does not factor into his power strugglemodel that the weaker system does not always cave in to the dom-inant system. He does not consider the possibility that in all sys-tems, weak or powerful, there is a negotiation process of power andof space between the two systems.One such scholar who challenged the theories of Taeschner’scaliphate–fut≠wwarelationship was G. Salinger. Salinger pointedout that the main flaw is understanding the Islamic caliphate systemalong the lines of a medieval European system. Salinger asserts that the caliphate was never a feudal system based on contractualrelationships between kings and vassals. He commented thatfut≠wwaguilds were independent organizations and could not have served as an arena for the caliph to assert political power orreinvigorate his own power.28However, in Salinger’s opinion,caliph al-Nåsir’s gradual influence in the fut≠wwais called a “coupd’état.” Due to uncontrollable factionalism, and disorderly publicbehavior, the state feared violent repercussions if it attempted todestroy the fut≠wwa. Instead, Salinger believes that caliph al-Nåsirdecided to penetrate the fityånand transform them from the inside. According to Salinger, the fityånhad reached a point ofpotentially threatening the state, at least in terms of supportinggroups that were anti-state, and al-Nåsir’s annexation of fityånwasessentially a security issue. While Salinger’s argument is credible, itis missing an important dimension to his point, which is that bythe year 1207, the year caliph al-Nåsir declared himself the leaderof all fityångroups and outlawed those groups that did not recog-nize him as the true leader, most fut≠wwaorganizations displayedTHE LIFE OF SHAIKH ‘ABÁHAFS\u0001UMAR AL-SUHRAWARDÛ111011110111011101111111lio24"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"characteristics neither of “uncontrollable factionalism” nor of “dis-orderly public behavior.” In fact the fut≠wwaliterature of this timeclearly reflects more concern about proper codes, behavior andideas, as opposed to ways of breaking into factional groups ordevising methods of disrupting state business.As mentioned earlier, Ibn al-Mi\u0001mar and al-Khartabirti’s worksare the only extant literature regarding fut≠wwaorganizations andprovide significant insight into fut≠wwarituals and structure, aswell as into the ideas of both writers. Little is known of eitherwriter other than that they lived in caliph al-Nåsir’s period, andtheir works directly study fut≠wwagroups. Ibn al-Mi\u0001mar was aHanbal⁄faq⁄hand trained muªaddithin Baghdad. There is lessinformation on al-Khartabirti other than that he was a member of the same fut≠wwagroup as caliph al-Nåsir’s son, al-Malik al-Mu\u0001azzam\u0001Ab≠al-Hassan\u0001Al⁄, to whom he dedicated his work in1216.29Both of these handbooks discuss details of practices andceremonies, which are usually supported by Qur\u0002ånic or ªad⁄thquotations.For instance, al-Khartabirti discusses the transfer of libås al-fut≠wwa, a piece of clothing given to a younger initiate (fata), asclothing of piety or taqwa. To al-Khartabirti, a fatawho wears thelibås al-fut≠wwamust possess excellent qualities; “he must worshipregularly, obey his parents, always speak the truth, pay alms-tax,is generous to those who do mischief against him, and visits sickpeople.”30He continues to elaborate that the libås al-fut≠wwapertains to the real world where one should have the fear of God.He cites the s≠ra al-A\u0002råf, verse 26, to support the fityånuse of thelibås al-fut≠wwaritual.Oh children of Adam! We have bestowed upon you fromon high the knowledge of making garments to cover yournakedness, and as a thing of beauty, but the garment ofGod-consciousness is the best of all.According to al-Khartabirti, wearing the libås al-fut≠wwais onlyfor a select group of individuals who are worthy of such honor,because the cloth consisted of five distinct qualities: truth (‚adiq),faithfulness (amanat), piety (taqwa), worship (ada\u0001as-salwat), andrestraint from committing adultery (tark az-zina).31Al-Khartabirti and Ibn al-Mi\u0001mar are often seen to use ªad⁄thandQur\u0002ånic verses to refer to the piety of the fut≠wwaorganization.Al-Khartabirti speaks of the fut≠wwaas the “tree of salvation,” aTHE LIFE OF SHAIKH ‘ABÁHAFS\u0001UMAR AL-SUHRAWARDÛ11111011111110111011101111111olio25"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"metaphor to demonstrate the permanency of the group that is rootedin earth and has branches up to the heavens.32To al-Khartabirti, thefut≠wwaconnection to the tree is like that of the Qur\u0001ånand this issymbolic of the significant relationship of how the fut≠wwastruc-ture is firmly linked to that of the divine message of God. From s≠råal-Ibråh⁄m, verse 24, al-Khartabirti quotes:Do you not see how Allah sets forth a parable? It is like agood tree, whose root is firm and whose branches reachinto heaven.For Ibn-Mi\u0001mar, the individual fatamembers are responsible tolive up to their allegiance to the fut≠wwaorganizations. To him,fityånwere originally established as an extension of faith whichwas designed to help out the needy and spend one’s wealth on the poor. Since generosity was one of the major requirements forIbn al-Mi\u0001mar, in his discussion of rituals he points out the signif-icance of wearing the libås al-fut≠wwaand drinking a mixture ofsalt and water (shurb al-murada\u0002ah) and as usual he quotes theQur\u0001ånto illustrate the sacredness of the ritual. From s≠råal-Furqån, verse 53:This is palatable and sweet water, and the other is saltishand bitter water.Upon drinking the shurb al-murada\u0002ah, Ibn al-Mi\u0001mar writes thatthe leading shaikh would recite “God has made the drink a symbolof the fut≠wwapact and the covenant with Him. May God cursehim who breaks the pact!”33Ibn al-Mi\u0001mar combines theologicalsigns like the divine convenant with the symbolism of water infut≠wwarites for its members. The symbolism is meant to connectthefatawith the significance of zamzam, the holy well near theKa\u0002ba. Within the description of this initiation process, Ibn al-Mi\u0001mar quotes from the Qur\u0001ån,s≠rå21, verse 30, which statesWe have made alive everything through wateras a way to demonstrate that water has the power to purify heartsand external behavior, and one needs to nourish the body as well aspurify the soul as long as they are members of the fut≠wwagroup.Ibn al-Mi\u0001mar was more concerned with members understandingthe connection between fut≠wwarituals and beliefs, and how everyTHE LIFE OF SHAIKH ‘ABÁHAFS\u0001UMAR AL-SUHRAWARDÛ111011110111011101111111lio26"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"single action is directly supported by the orders of God.

Ibn al-Mi\u0001mar explains that caliph al-Nåsir’sguidance under Shaikh \u0001Abd al-Jabbår, who initiated him into the “Bayt ar-Rahhåsiya”fut≠wwa, understood the importance ofuniting the fityångroups because they were moving further awayfrom the ideals of the fut≠wwa.35It is likely that Ibn al-Mi\u0001mar’s and al-Khartabirti’s extensivework was to prove that fityångroups were completely in harmonywith the Islamic shar⁄\u0002åin order to defend the institution from crit-icism. This validity of fityångroups and the issue of whether theirpractices and beliefs were in compliance with Islamic principles wasstill an important controversy for the \u0001ulamå\u0001in the late thirteenthcentury. For example, one important Hanbal⁄jurist scholar (faqih)who spoke out against fityångroups and all of the rituals that werecreated within the fityånwas Shaikh Ibn-Taym⁄ya (1263–1328).While there is a considerable amount of scholarship on Ibn-Taym⁄ya, it is clear that recent studies show the complexity of histhought as well as the difficulty in labeling him either a reformeror a proponent of a sunn⁄orthodoxy.36In Muhammad UmarMemon’s work on Ibn-Taym⁄ya, he clearly illustrates how certainscholars only focus on the later years of Ibn-Taym⁄ya’s polemicalworks. During the later years of 1321–1326, Ibn-Taym⁄ya wit-nessed a breakdown in Muslim–Christian relations where wide-spread riots fueled popular resentment. Also during this time, Ibn-Taym⁄ya was imprisoned for his contentious polemical writings,such as, “The Necessity of the Straight Path against the People of Hell” (Kitåb iqtidå\u0001as-siråt al-mustaq⁄m mukhålafat ashåb al-jah⁄m).

He rejected fut≠wwarituals like thewearing of the libås al-fut≠wwaand drinking the shurb al-murada\u0002ahwater since he never found evidence for them in eithertheshar⁄\u0002åorsunnåof the Prophet.41He dismissed all fityånclaimsthat these practices were documented by the Prophet’s son-in-law,\u0001Al⁄ibn Ab⁄ ̋ålib. In examining the fityån isnådreports thatsupported their claims of conducting libås al-fut≠wwaandshurbal-murada\u0002ahrituals, Ibn-Taym⁄ya stated that in their chain oftransmitters there were several questionable persons.

But in all of his criticisms it is important torecognize that he did not condemn the institution as a whole andadvocate the dissolving of the fut≠wwainstitution.Another contemporary Hanbal⁄thinker and student of Ibn-Taym⁄ya, Såfi al-D⁄n Idr⁄s ibn Bidq⁄n, was much more uncom-promising against the fut≠wwagroups.44Ibn-Bidq⁄n went furtherthan Ibn-Taym⁄ya by stating that what he witnessed in the fut≠wwagroups was the worst form of bida\u0002. According to him, anyone asso-ciated with the fityånshad totally diverged from the principles oftheshar⁄\u0002åandsunnå.

He ruledhis provinces rigorously and maintained public security. He alsoworked actively toward the destruction of the remnant of Seljukpower that had so long overshadowed the caliphate, and was still potentially the strongest single power in the area. He under-took this by way of alliances. First, he allied himself with theKhwårazmshåh Tekish (1172–1200); the caliph assisted his expe-dition into western Iran, where the last Seljukid was killed in 1194.Thereupon, differences between al-Nåsir and Tekish forced him tobuild alliances in the surrounding regions. The KhwårazmshåhTekish asserted his own control in \u0001Iråq\u0001Ajam⁄and evidentlyexpected the caliph to be subservient to him as he had been to theSeljuks.

But they do not analyze in depth al-Suhraward⁄’s contri-butions to building networking relationships with other compet-ing s≠f⁄orders and the Nizår⁄Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄s, which were extremelysignificant in developing confidence in the caliphate. After theKhwårazmshåh\u0001Alå\u0002ad-d⁄n Tekish defeated Tughril III at Rayy in1194, al-Nåsir invested Tekish with the sultånate of Fars, Khurasanand Turkistan.

Caliph al-Nåsir’s attempts to be the center for Islamic diplomacy and politicswere rooted in creating an environment of religious unity.Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s relationship with the Nizår⁄Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄sIn order to understand the way al-Nåsir was able to cultivate alliesin a short period of time, it is necessary to turn to the Nizår⁄Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄state in Alamut. This is probably al-Nåsir’s most spectacular diplo-matic victory because he turned a historically hostile faction andintegrated the leader of the Nizår⁄Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄state into his party ofalliances. Upon Jalål al-d⁄nÓasan’s advent to being the imåmof the Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄community in Alamut, he decided to increase prac-tices in conformity with the Jamå\u0002⁄-Sunn⁄community. According to the Nizår⁄Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄s the unchangeable truths that were passed on by the prophets to their interpreters (the Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄imåms) werecontained in the bå†inmeanings, and the divinely guided infallibleIsmå\u0001⁄l⁄imåms’ function was to explain the truths to the commu-nity. But in a reformist wave, Óasan decided to take his communityalong with him, ending the hostility that had isolated the Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄s.The Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄s obeyed their imåm in this move, presumably on thebasis of dissimulation, taqiyya.

This is very similar to imåmÓasan’s active role in supporting Nizår⁄intellectual and ecumenicaldiscourse within and outside the Nizår⁄community.Óasan wasresponsible for popularizing the acceptance of a number of Nizår⁄beliefs to the Jama\u0002at-i Sunnicommunity, while at the same timehe attempted to build closer relationships between the two com-munities. One example is Nåsir al-d⁄n al-T≠s⁄(d. 1274), whoformulated the doctrine of satrfor this period.63The doctrine ofsatrexplained imåmÓasan’s reform and created a strongerspiritual connection in the community.

The imåm’s new position was a spiri-tual reality that meant he too possessed an authority in meta-physical and mystical knowledge. The combination of both imåmÓasan’s reformist policies and revisionist doctrines contributed toan interesting coalescence between the Nizår⁄Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄and s≠f⁄orders.In 1256 the Mongols attacked the fortress of Alamut, the centerof the Nizår⁄Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄community, destroyed the Alamut Nizår⁄Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄base, and forced the Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄s to resettle in other regions ofIran, Afghanistan and India.

Abdu\u0002r Rahmånibn al-Jawz⁄was a prolific author and preacher, and had a consid-erable amount of influence with the \u0001Abbåsid caliphs as the Shaikhal-Islåm. Aside from the religious differences between Ibn al-Jawz⁄and Jilån⁄and the latter’s popularity in Baghdad, Shaikh ibn al-Jawz⁄accused al-Suhraward⁄’s teacher of furthering the cause ofphilosophy and heresy. In his works, Naqd al-\u0002Ilm wa\u0001l-\u0002ulamå\u0001andTalb⁄s Ibl⁄s, Ibn al-Jawz⁄condemned non-sunn⁄sects and evenattacked a large number of sunn⁄jurisconsults,shar⁄\u0002å-minded indi-viduals and s≠f⁄s including Ab≠ ̋ålib al-Målik⁄, Qushair⁄and Ab≠Óamid al-Ghazål⁄.7The turning point came for Ibn al-Jawz⁄’s career came whencaliph al-Nåsir (1179–1225) reversed his policy of blind supportfor Ibn Jawz⁄and instituted a more “middle-of-the-road” policyformulated by Shaikh \u0001Ab≠Hafs\u0001Umar al-Suhraward⁄.

Of the ones that survive, \u0002Awårif al-Ma\u0002årif(“Knowledge of the Learned”) wasthe most popular. At the time this work was important because itwas an attempt to reconcile the historical conflicts of ta‚awwuf- andshar⁄\u0002å-obeying individuals by a distinguished government religiousfigure. To later generations of s≠f⁄s it became one of the most closelystudied texts on ta‚awwuf. Posthumously, the Arabic text \u0002Awårifal-Ma\u0002årifwas translated into Persian by \u0001Izzu\u0002d-d⁄n Muhammadbin\u0001Al⁄of Kashån (d. 1352–1353) and entitled Misbahu\u0001l-Hidåyawa Miftahu\u0001l Kifåya. The translator \u0001Izzu\u0002d-d⁄n Muhammad mademinor changes to the translation, such as restructuring the organi-zation of the text and adding his own views on ta‚awwuf. One ofmany areas of concern for Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄was the conceptand origin of the word “s≠f⁄.” In \u0002Awårif al-Ma\u0002årif, he commentson the early influential s≠f⁄thinker Ab≠Nasr al-Sarråj’s under-standing of the way the term “s≠f⁄” had been used in pre-IslamicArabic.8According to Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄, the word was theproduct of a period of political change and unrest. He rejected theidea that “s≠f⁄” etymology was derived from suffa(pure). For schol-ars like al-Sarråj,saffawas the root of \u0001s≠f⁄\u0002and he traced the wordsaffato many incidents of the sunnå, which to them at least madeta‚awwufan integral part of the Prophet’s tradition. However, foral-Suhraward⁄there were many elements of ta‚awwufpractice inthe Prophet’s life; and ta‚awwufaspects were evident in the lives ofthe companions of the Prophet in Madina who were called “thePeople of the Verandah” (aªl as-saffa). Al-Suhraward⁄asserted thatearly s≠f⁄shaikhs after the companions continued the religiouspractices of the companions. But this did not explain the originalmeaning of “s≠f⁄.” Al-Suhraward⁄referred to a class of Khuråsån⁄s≠f⁄s who lived in caves and were called shikaftiyyah(from the wordshikaft, “cave”); this word possibly contributed to the developmentof “s≠f⁄.” Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s description implies that s≠f⁄s ofthat era then adopted a particular mode of life, which was very closeto the lives of Buddhist monks.9He did not explicitly state that thes≠f⁄tradition borrowed elements of Buddhism, but his acknow-ledgment of other religious groups in the region shows that s≠f⁄swere in religious dialog with others who lived according to asceticprinciples.\u0002AWÅRIF AL-MA\u0002ÅRIF111011110111011101111111lio44"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"For Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄, the derivation of the word s≠f⁄orig-inally came from s≠f(wool), meaning those who wore woolengarments to imitate the clothing of the Prophet.

He quoted the Qur\u0002ånic passage of al rasikh≠n f⁄al-\u0002Ilm(“Those firmly rooted in knowledge”) to refer to those people who declare the truth and are insightful enlightened s≠f⁄s.10Al-Suhraward⁄’s idea of knowledge was that it should be a goodcombination of formal education in a madrasaand knowledgegained from the spiritual experiences of prominent s≠f⁄shaikhs. Hestated that certain knowledge cannot be learned in school becausethe prophets left a legacy with spiritual teachers and one needs to acquire this knowledge from them.11This is an example of al-Suhraward⁄’s goal of balancing madrasaor institutional knowledgewith alternative spiritual shaikh-mur⁄ds≠f⁄knowledge. Accordingto al-Suhraward⁄, the understanding of knowledge separated s≠f⁄sinto two categories: the first were those whose mystical insight was built on their spiritual perception; the second consisted of those whose supernatural enlightenment was the result of their ownannihilation of the inner self (fanå\u0001).12Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄quotedShaikh al-Junåyd al-Baghdåd⁄’s statement that what leads tota‚awwufis not reason and intellectual debates, but intense fasting,renunciation of the world, and abstention from even that which islawful.13It is significant to point out that Shaikh al-Junåyd wasprobably one of the first s≠f⁄s to have discussed ritual acts with an esoteric interpretation and Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s elaboration of rituals was a way of connecting to those ideas.

To support his arguments,as a Hanbal⁄jurist, al-Suhraward⁄followed the tradition of usingpassages of the Qur\u0001ån, and ªad⁄thsfrom the six major sunn⁄sources such as al-Bukhår⁄(d. 970), Muslim (d. 875), Ab≠Dåw≠d(d. 889), al-Tirmidh⁄(d. 892), al-Niså\u0002⁄(d. 915), and Ibn Majah (d. 887), and sayings from past eminent s≠f⁄shaikhs.

This demonstrates al-Suhraward⁄’s trainingas a muªad⁄thand his heavy reliance on ªad⁄thsas one of the main patterns to prove legitimacy. Essentially, al-Suhraward⁄basedhis authority on three sources: the sunn⁄,ªad⁄th, and the sayingsof earlier s≠f⁄shaikhs. This order is used in almost every headingbut is not always in the same order. There are a few areas in the text where only one source is used and the three others areneglected.Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s use of simple language, easily flowingsentences that are not difficult to follow, may have opened thedoors for a wider audience to read his treatise. It is fair to assumethat his religious authority in both ta‚awwufandshar⁄\u0002åneeded tobe expressed in layperson’s terminology so that a wider audiencecould comprehend complex theological ideas. Due to the fact thathe may have had a diverse group of people, all of whom were s≠f⁄sor capable of reading his theories, his interpretations of ta‚awwufneeded to be as succinct as possible.14In\u0001Awårif al-Ma\u0002årif, al-Suhraward⁄generally starts with a topic by quoting a ªad⁄thfromthe Prophet or another significant figure, and reserves quoting from the sunnåfor the heart of his argument.

Forinstance, Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄commented on proper etiquette,ådåb, in over thirty-five separate but thematically related areas such as prayer, fasting, speaking to a shaikh, entering a room,approaching a khånaqåh, donating to charity, ways to practice thesunnåof the Prophet, etc. Each theme has a heading and subse-quent headings in the following manner: “The ådåbofta‚awwuf,”“The excellence of ådåb,” “The importance of ådåb,” “The sayingsof s≠f⁄s on ådåb,” “The ådåbof a shaikh,” “The ådåbof disci-ples,” and “The ådåbin a shaikh’s måjlis,” etc. This type of textualorganization reflects a mental structure that weaves together inter-connected themes so that the reader feels that one theme is relatedto the larger web. Al-Suhraward⁄’s treatise consists of more thanhis own personal legal opinions and ta‚awwufprinciples. For hisdisciples, it was the source for interpreting ta‚awwuf, somethingaround which to structure their spiritual and temporal lives, andultimately take them closer to divine union.Under the theme of “The Real Truth of Ta‚awwuf,” al-Suhraward⁄begins with a ªad⁄thand then supports his explanationas it is related to the theme. In this case, the ªad⁄thwill provide animportant authority for his point which is that past s≠f⁄shaikhsalready established that ta‚awwufis connected to taking care ofthe underprivileged and that this is a way to God. There are twoelements: one of social responsibility and another of finding one’splace with God. In the end both elements are intertwined, and byusing the authority of the Prophet, the ªad⁄thfunctions as the prime model for existence. For example, Shaikh Ab≠Zuhr\u0001Attåribn Ab⁄Fazl (rad⁄allåh anhu) told Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄aªad⁄thfrom Abd Allåh ibn \u0001Umar (r) that the Prophet Muhammad (salåallåh\u0002alaih⁄wa sallam)15said that “everything has a key to it, andin this respect the key to heaven is having love and patience towardyour loved ones and the s≠f⁄s (faq⁄r). On the day of judgment, Allåhwill have mercy on us.”16Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄continues hisexplanation by stating:In this way, faq⁄rsare the real truth of ta‚awwuf, and thebasic necessity is assisting them. As R≠m⁄(r) said that“ta‚awwufhad three exclusive fundamentals: (1) to adoptthe poor, (2) be generous and (3) to adopt the abandoned.”\u0002AWÅRIF AL-MA\u0002ÅRIF11111011111110111011101111111olio47"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"When al-Junåyd al-Baghdåd⁄(r) was asked about ta‚aw-wuf, he stated that “ta‚awwufis when you are with Allåhand you cannot live otherwise.” Also, M\u0001ar≠f al-Karkh⁄(r)stated that “truths of ta‚awwufare to adopt the poor andmake the unfortunate feel fortunate.”17Suhraward⁄ta‚awwufis then concerned with its s≠f⁄membershelping poor and abandoned people.

Using these individual figures is notonly a literary technique, but a theological argument that rests onhistorical–religious truths of the tradition. At the same time, it ismore important to acknowledge al-Suhraward⁄’s ability to asso-ciate himself with these figures and the way he affirms his authorityby knowing intricate religious details of these influential persons.For instance, when he is developing the theme of praising s≠f⁄s, heagain uses renowned figures that command a certain amount ofrespect by their names alone.

Al-Suhraward⁄’s sensible qualities of confronting difficult and controversial issues are to present apeaceful and immediate resolution. It is obvious that his approachto dealing with uncomfortable issues within ta‚awwufandshar⁄\u0002å,is part of his Weltanschauungof maintaining a balanced lifestylebetweenta‚awwufpractices and living on earth. From the treatise, al-Suhraward⁄was conscious of ta‚awwuf’sprecarious past with s≠f⁄shaikhs’ claims of being divine manifes-tations.

It was anotherway for al-Suhraward⁄to dismiss s≠f⁄s that were extreme andoutside of the tradition, and an opportunity for him to correct the ways of s≠f⁄shaikhs and disciples. He believed that the bestway to not misunderstand ta‚awwufwas to study with reputableand qualified shaikhs. While he did not propose himself or his owndisciples as the answer, by referring to such a problem he displayedhis sensitivity to the problems of poor guidance by untrained s≠f⁄shaikhs, certainly an important issue in his time.

The long drawn-out debate bys≠f⁄shaikhs over the nature of ta‚awwuf,faq⁄rs,zåªid, and bå†inwas an area which he felt needed firm clarity.

As the Prophet (s) stated: “Amongst my followers,the poor will enter heaven a half day before those followersconcerned with the world.

Shaikh Ab≠Huråyra’s tradition [is] that the Prophet (s)reported that prayer divides the believer in between twoparts. One is when the believer recites “bismillåh urahmånwa raª⁄m” (In the name of God, the Merciful and theCompassionate); then God replies “my servant has calledupon me.” When the believer continues to recite “alham-dulilåh rabil\u0002alam⁄n” (All praise is due to the Lord of theworlds); then God responds “my believer has praised me.”When the believer recites “arahmån wa raªim” (the mostBeneficent, ever-merciful), then God states “my believerhas commended me.” As the believer continues to recite“malik yaumad⁄n” (King of the Day of Judgment), thenGod replies “my believer has placed the responsibilities of all work onto me.” Then the believer recites “iyakana’budo wa iyaka nasta’een” (You alone we worship, andto You alone turn for help) and God states “there is roomin the believer for me.” As the believer states “adanassiratul mustaq⁄m siratul lazina an\u0002umta\u0002alaihim gharilmaghdube\u0002alaihim wa la dhaleen” (Guide us to the paththat is straight, the path of those You have blessed, Not ofthose who have earned Your anger, nor those who havegone astray), God states “all of this is for my believer andwhatever he desires it will be granted.”37Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄quotes this ªad⁄thbecause it is extremelysymbolic and it is directly related to his point of a real dialog withAllåh. Again it is al-Suhraward⁄’s method of reminding his audi-ence that through prayer there is a constant dialog between thedivine and human beings. By using s≠råal-Fåtiªaas the forum forthis dialog, he creates a channel for the believer and links theirprayers, something very intimate and personal, with the divine.This is another example of al-Suhraward⁄functioning as a s≠f⁄shaikh guiding his disciples toward God.\u0002AWÅRIF AL-MA\u0002ÅRIF111011110111011101111111lio58"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Explanations of spirituality (r≠håniyyåt)Pure loveFor Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄, love for Allåh was essential in being abeliever who surrendered everything to the Creator. A s≠f⁄disciplefocused his love with deep passion and his love was unique to allother types of love, a special love (muªabbat-e khås). This speciallove was the purest kind a human being could cultivate because ithad conditions attached to it. The shaikh explained that, unlike inhuman relationships where love for another person is unpredictableand often unkind, for s≠f⁄s love for God is inextricably connectedto Suhraward⁄ta‚awwufand the process of annihilating the self inGod (fanå\u0001fi\u0001illåh). Love for Allåh brings about direct communica-tion, intimate relationships between the s≠f⁄seeker and the divine,and it makes the bond between the s≠f⁄disciple and s≠f⁄shaikhcloser. He stated the following on pure love:Pure love is when everything you want is for the purposeof being with God. Every type of human love is includedin pure love: spiritual love. Love from the heart, love fromthe soul, and love from reasoning, this is why the Prophet(s) stated “Oh Lord I have more love for you than for mylife, belongings, family and friends, the power to hear, andcold water.”38Muªabbat-e khåsis like any other spiritual exercise in Suhraward⁄ta‚awwuf, the s≠f⁄disciple needs to consistently learn the innerdetails of it in order to master the practice.

With the guidance of the s≠f⁄shaikh, thes≠f⁄disciple will be able to achieve union with Allåh, but only afterthe following the footsteps of the holy Prophet. Just as theProphet’s love for Allåh superseded any other human being, no onecould deny his love for humankind. The shaikh stated “When thistype of pure love is practiced toward God, then the blessings areupon all of humanity.”39\u0002AWÅRIF AL-MA\u0002ÅRIF11111011111110111011101111111olio59"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Personal love versus special love Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄discussed different types of love a s≠f⁄canexperience and develop their spiritual education in ta‚awwuf.According to him, love for oneself (m≠ªabbat-ba anå) is self-destructive and leads the s≠f⁄away from proper observance ofta‚awwuf. The highest type of love is the one that is not for theindividual self, but only for attaining beauty of the divine(m≠ªabbat-e jamål). When a s≠f⁄completely surrenders his love tothe divine, then he is able to begin to access elements associatedwith the divine. Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄stated that “The love foroneself is like fire because one’s observations become slanted.”40Inaddition he stated the following:Special love is from personal love because it is here thatthe disciple can develop his love. This special love is fullof smiles and it is channeled toward God. It is thegenerosity of the Divine that gives blessings and favors tothe disciple so that their relationship becomes stronger.When people direct their special love in the proper ways,then they become interested in the things that are associ-ated with divine things. This is because love is charitableand the lover and Beloved become attached to each other.41Knowledge of the spirit and soulThe excellence of reasoningAn important section in al-Suhraward⁄’s treatise that is connectedto his goal of developing an internal and external structure is theone that concerns having his disciples depend on their own intel-lectual abilities to comprehend their ta‚awwuf. Al-Suhraward⁄isinterested in having his disciples actively practice reasoning (\u0001aql)in their ta‚awwufbecause it was important to develop the mind inconjunction with striving toward spiritual enlightenment. Also,since Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s s≠f⁄order stressed being politicallyactive, it is reasonable to think that he wanted his disciples to beintellectually capable of meeting challenges of political activities.Another reason to stress the importance of \u0001aqlinta‚awwufis todistinguish his order from the world-rejecting antinomian s≠f⁄swho, to him, were not intellectually inclined. Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄stated the following on the subject of \u0001aql:\u0002AWÅRIF AL-MA\u0002ÅRIF111011110111011101111111lio60"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Reasoning (\u0001aql) is the job of language.

The Prophet (s)replied that \u0001aqlis the best means to evaluate oneself. Shepursued further and asked, are people not in control oftheir actions? The Prophet (s) responded that obedience toalmighty God involves \u0001aql, and with more \u0001aqlinvolved,then people will apply more righteous actions.

It is important first for s≠f⁄s to understand the hierar-chical structure so that they may proceed to identify what \u0002aqlisnecessary at each step of the ta‚awwufjourney.

Until theill-mannered persons fully immerse themselves in propermanners and all manners are good like that of the Prophet(s), then they will remain ill-mannered. For those peoplewho indulge themselves with the world and in materialism,their appearances will reflect these manners of worldliness.For example, when people do not change their manners,they also do not change and then their manners are copiedfrom elsewhere. Let us remember what the Qur\u0001åntells us:“In God’s creation there can be no changes.”47For Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄,ådåbrepresented many aspects of lawand order for s≠f⁄disciples in the larger society; it was the realpractice of representing the Prophet’s life in this world. The Prophetin every way represented the “perfect human being” (insån al-kamil): he mastered social relationships, political challenges, tribalconflicts, financial stresses, was divinely chosen as the last Prophet– who was the only Prophet to ascend to heaven to dialog withGod – and brought God’s final book of guidance to humanity. Inevery moment of the Prophet’s existence he was being taught byAllåh the proper conduct of behavior as well as being spirituallytrained by God. Each aspect of the Prophet, from his speech(kalåm) to worship (\u0002ibåda) to daily actions (a\u0002mål), is derived fromhis witnessing the divine face (mushåhadat al-wajh) and of God’sessence being manifested (tajall⁄ad-dhåt). As a servant (\u0002abd) toAllåh, the Prophet’s ådåbis fundamental to Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄because it is connected directly to the divine order and to theSuhraward⁄†ar⁄qa. For example, the shaikh quotes a well-knownªadiththat speaks clearly to followers how important ådåbis toGod:And an even better point is that people are against changesto manners and proper etiquette, and this is why theProphet (s) stated to make friends with one’s ådåb.48This is why God created human beings and their ability tocorrect themselves when it is needed.

In the statement,“God created ådåbto give human beings the ability to correct them-selves when it is needed and God reveals Himself to humankindthroughådåb,” again Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄is proving that ådåbwas created from God, and all created things were meant to wit-ness His manifestation (mushåhada).Ådåbis part of God’s creationand s≠f⁄s must respect it and cultivate a love for practicing ådåb.A person needs to understand both morality and im-morality. It is important to keep the soul as pure aspossible and to use \u0002aqlto stay virtuous. Become friends toone’sbå†inandΩåhir, which will assist you in morality andlearning proper etiquette. Proper ådåbcreates properbehavior, and right actions for the individual. Humanbeings were originally pure and it should be their goal toreturn to that pure state. It is God’s will to have humanbeings strive toward a strong morality and not fall into animmoral state of affairs. It is God’s intention to removehuman beings from the fire of misdoing and have themdevelopådåbto keep them virtuous.50The practice of ådåbgoes beyond adhering to proper conduct infront of the shaikh, within the confines of the khånaqåh, or in daily\u0002AWÅRIF AL-MA\u0002ÅRIF111011110111011101111111lio64"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"dealings with people. Here, Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄is discussing theintellectual aspects of understanding related disciplines of ådåb,such as ethics, s≠f⁄liturgy, and ta‚awwuftheosophy. To him, thereis an ådåbtheology for Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s to study and examine sothat they may intellectually understand the Ωåhirandbå†inofethics, liturgy, and ta‚awwuf. An examination into ådåbtheologywould force s≠f⁄s to entirely appreciate intellectually the intercon-nectedness of ådåband other features in Suhraward⁄ta‚awwuf.This is in line with al-Suhraward⁄’s perspective on ta‚awwufthatrequires the s≠f⁄to use reason, intellectual inquiry, and exchangeof debates in accordance to the grander spiritual journey ofta‚awwuf.The excellence of ådåbShaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s arguments for ådåbis to prove to his audi-ence that his strong emphasis on ådåbis historically, religiously,legally, philosophically, and theologically grounded in the Islamictradition. After the section on “ådåbinta‚awwuf,” he continuesto explain the benefits of practicing and adhering to s≠f⁄ådåb. Themain point for al-Suhraward⁄is to demonstrate that ådåbis not anincidental feature to ta‚awwuf, rather s≠f⁄shaikhs have learnedtheir wisdom from Allåh and then this knowledge of ådåbwastransferred to their disciples. For him, this is not a point to over-look as a minor issue and insignificant to the s≠f⁄path. He isinterested in reminding his readers that the theology of ådåbis animportant instructional tool for the shaikh–mur⁄drelationship andto ignore this point is to miss the heart of Suhraward⁄ta‚awwuf.For example, he commented on the excellence of ådåbin thefollowing statement:Almighty God gave respected s≠f⁄shaikhs of the past goodhabits so that they may have virtues in their bå†in(innerdimensions). They were fortunate to have a good trainingto have their souls protected with ådåb. As individualsendowed with ådåbby God, they were able to enrich andtrain their disciples. For some individuals it is not in theirnature to easily grasp ådåband it takes them a long timeto achieve it. Just as disciples learn from their shaikhs andbuild a loving bond for their shaikhs, it is in this way thatone needs to develop a firm training that reflects strongactions. This is why God stated in the Qur\u0001ånins≠rå\u0002AWÅRIF AL-MA\u0002ÅRIF11111011111110111011101111111olio65"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"at-Taªr⁄mverse 6: “Protect yourself and your householdfrom fire.” Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄explains the meaning of this åyåtby applyingan anecdote from Shaikh \u0001Abbås. “Shaikh \u0001Abbås (r) reported thatyou were taught your religion and its ådåb. Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄returns to the authority of the Prophet’s sayings and quotes aªad⁄th: ‘the Prophet (s) reported that my merciful God taught megoodådåb. Then He taught me wisdom in morality. And follow inthe good ådåband give wise virtuous advice.’”51This analysis iscompact with Qur\u0001ånandªad⁄ths, both of which give legitimacyto al-Suhraward⁄’s argument that ådåbis theologically rooted inthe tradition and is being followed in the Suhraward⁄order.Ådåbis a means to gaining mystical knowledge (ma\u0002rifa) andsimultaneously connecting knowledge to the practices of ta‚awwuf.The theology of ådåbbrings together the wisdom of ta‚awwufwiththe actions of the s≠f⁄seeker. For Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄, wisdomcomes in many ways to the s≠f⁄seeker of God, but one clear aspectofådåbis how the new inner wisdom merges the understanding of human actions with encountering the divine. For example, al-Suhraward⁄states the following to support this idea of wisdom andådåb:It is reported by Shaikh Y≠suf ibn H≠ssein (r) that ådåbcomes from understanding knowledge. Knowledge is themeans of learning proper actions (\u0001amal, pl. a\u0002mål). And\u0001amalis the means of learning wisdom. Wisdom is themeans of learning advanced Ωuhdwhere one finds the plea-sure in making a place on the day of judgment and also,in this pleasure one meets the heart of God.52In other sections of ådåb, al-Suhraward⁄confirmed the idea thatådåbwas practiced and preached by the Prophet, and then followedby members of his household. The teachings of ådåbby the Prophetwere not left only for a select few to understand, but rather for theentire community to act upon his ådåbmodel. The shaikh stated,“It is recorded by Ayesha (r) (the wife of the Prophet) that it is the right of the children to receive good names from their parents,so that the children can follow proper ådåband training.”53He repeated the point that ådåbmust be understood in all of itsdifferent forms, inner and outer, and appreciate the theology ofådåbas an intellectual pursuit that unites the s≠f⁄disciple withknowledge of ta‚awwuf.\u0002AWÅRIF AL-MA\u0002ÅRIF111011110111011101111111lio66"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The importance of ådåbOne of Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s crucial points on ådåbis where heconnectedådåbwithshar⁄\u0002å, faith, and the basic Islamic doctrineof affirming the unity of God, tawª⁄d. The doctrine of tawª⁄daffirms the oneness of God and is the single major theologicalfeature of professing Divine unity. For Muslims, every moment andevery level of existence requires the believer to assert tawª⁄dinIslamic spiritual life. Through all of the daily prayers, fasting,charity, social work, pilgrimage, and other faith-related rituals,believers must struggle to submit themselves to God’s supremacyat every conceivable level, that is, the mind, heart, and soul. TheQur\u0001åncommands its believers to work toward establishing a lifeoftawª⁄dand, in order to establish this realization, it describes itas a human struggle. For Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄, to create a realitybased on shar⁄\u0002åand its principal foundation of tawª⁄d,ådåbisthen an essential factor in this construction. For him, this reality isfeasible because Suhraward⁄ta‚awwufunites all of the elements tomake it possible. He commented on tawª⁄dandådåbin thefollowing statement: Shaikh Jalål al-Basr⁄(r) reported that “It is necessary toaffirm divine unity (tawª⁄d) and faith (imån). For thosewho do not have faith, they do not have tawª⁄deither. Itis necessary to have imånin accordance with shar⁄\u0002å, andwhereshar⁄\u0002ådoes not exist, faith and tawª⁄ddo not exist.Shar⁄\u0002årequiresådåb, and this is why, where ådåbis notfound, there is no shar⁄\u0002å, no faith and no tawª⁄d.”54The importance of ådåbto al-Suhraward⁄cannot be underesti-mated in his ta‚awwufbecause it is the underlying layer that joinsshar⁄\u0002å,imån, Qur\u0002ånic knowledge, the sunnåof the Prophet, andthe practice of ta‚awwuf. S≠f⁄s who neglect any single aspect ofådåbwill not receive the benefits of God’s blessings. Al-Suhraward⁄stated, “Shaikh \u0001Abdallåh ibn Mubarak (r) stated that those whoare lazy with their ådåbare punished by being deprived offollowing the sunnåof the Prophet (s), and that those who are care-less of the sunnå, are punished by being deprived of knowledge ofGod.”55Again, real understanding of ådåbmirrors the Prophet’ssunnå, upholds the Qur\u0001ån, the shar⁄\u0002åandfaithwhich in turnconnects them to the union of Allåh. To abuse this and not giveproper attention to ådåbis not to break the chain of God’s blessingsof knowledge upon the s≠f⁄seeker.

He commented with thefollowing statement:It is said that ta‚awwufis about ådåb, therefore, for everylevel of ta‚awwufthere is a particular form of ådåbfor it.For the person who adheres to ådåb, he will learn the pathof excellence. For those who do not practice ådåb, they arefar away from achieving an advance level of ta‚awwuf.56The shaikh focused on ådåbas a reciprocal process of spiritualeducation for s≠f⁄disciples. He based this upon the relationshipsbetween the Prophet and the companions who dedicated their livesto paying attention to the Prophet’s revelations, sayings, andcustoms. According to al-Suhraward⁄, each moment a companionspent with the Prophet, he was being taught proper ådåb. This ådåbwas not the construction of the Prophet (s) – a human product –rather this ådåbcame from Allåh, making it a divine essence. Al-Suhraward⁄stated, “God had even taught the companions of theProphet (s) ådåband were told to speak at the tone of the Prophet(s) and not louder than the Prophet (s).”57It was reported that Thabit ibn Qais ibn Shamas (r) waspartly deaf and would speak in a loud tone. One time inthe presence of the Prophet he was having a conversationand his loud tone would hurt others, and this is why Godrevealed to the Prophet (s) to teach him and others ådåb.58Theådåbof the disciplesAlong side of s≠f⁄shaikhs were disciples who stronglyemphasizedådåb. Even the companions of the Prophetunderstood the significance of ådåb. God tells us in theholyQur\u0001ån: “Oh Believers, there is nothing greater thanGod and his Prophet, fear God because He is hearer anddoer of all things.”59In this section Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄is narrowing ådåbpractices todisciples, especially to those novice s≠f⁄s who contest the import-ance of ådåbwith their shaikh. Again supplying Qur\u0002ånic evidenceto his case, the shaikh insisted that that is an area that cannot bechallenged because the references to ådåbare abundant in the\u0002AWÅRIF AL-MA\u0002ÅRIF111011110111011101111111lio68"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Qur\u0001ån,sunnåandªad⁄thsof the Prophet and in the lives of the companions. For example al-Suhraward⁄stated, “Anotherenlightening moment is when the Prophet (s) was present in a congregation and someone was asking him a question and alsointerrupting his answers, the Prophet (s) told him that this behaviorwas improper.”60The way the disciples used to submit to their shaikhs wasuncompromising; all of their personal belongings andpersonal affairs depended on the wise advice of their s≠f⁄shaikhs. It is reported by \u0001Ab≠Ladurd (r) that he waswalking ahead of \u0001Ab≠Bakr (r) when the Prophet askedhim why he was walking ahead of him, are you better thanthe world and the day of judgment?61These examples are indicative of proper ådåbbeing practicedduring the time of the companions. More so, the evidence of theProphet interjecting his companions’ comments demonstrates thatproperådåbof practicing faith was a natural learning practice. Foral-Suhraward⁄this vividly supports the s≠f⁄shaikhs instructingdisciples of right ådåbduringta‚awwufeducation. When s≠f⁄disci-ples learn irfånfrom their s≠f⁄shaikhs, one cannot separate thismodel from the way the Prophet taught his companions.Theådåbin a shaikh’s majlisShaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s commentary on ådåbin a shaikh’s arena ofreligious guidance, majlis, is very explicit in what and when thedisciple can speak. He compares the ådåbin front of the shaikh tothe blessing from an ocean. If one does not follow the proper ådåbthat is required then the s≠f⁄could lose the daily allowance of bless-ings from the shaikh and will not comprehend real ta‚awwuftheology. Another ådåb⁄instruction was the importance of the s≠f⁄disciple not looking face to face with the shaikh, which reinforcedthe subordinated position of the disciple in the hierarchy. Thesepoints are important to Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s central theme of maintaining a strict, hierarchical and disciplined s≠f⁄order.The instruction on s≠f⁄ådåbwith a shaikh reflects Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s concern for members in the order to follow andcomprehend the reasons for human and divine hierarchy. Theshaikh’smajlisis more than an educational forum for s≠f⁄studentsto learn from the enlightened teacher. It is a not a space like thedialogs and debates of an institutional college learning where\u0002AWÅRIF AL-MA\u0002ÅRIF11111011111110111011101111111olio69"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"students are encouraged to challenge ideas being taught by theinstructor.

Theteachings of the shaikh at his majlisrequire an ådåbof listening tospiritual instruction and of incorporating the s≠f⁄exercises. Theshaikh stated the following commentary:In the same manner, during a majlis, the disciple shouldshow proper ådåb. When sitting in front of the shaikh, thedisciple should not speak a word even if it is nice greet-ings, until proper permission is given by the shaikh. Thepresence of a shaikh to his disciple is like someone who issitting along the shore on a beach waiting for one’s dailyspiritual allowance from God. The shaikh’s wisdom is thepath for spiritual allowance. In this way, the level of thedisciple’s faith and his search for truth is elevated throughthe shaikh. If the disciple decides on his own to speak fromemotions, he reverses a level of understanding and then thedisciple knows that he made a mistake.62In order for the disciple to learn about the state of spiri-tuality, he must establish this by asking questions from hisshaikh. But it is not necessary for the shaikh to ask ques-tions face to face, but whatever method the shaikh decidesis fine. The shaikh adds to the Ωåhirand what correctconversations are needed for this process. Instead ofspeaking face to face, he takes particular persons from hisheart and directs them to the attention of God. And forthem, he asks for mercy and offers special prayers. At thistime, the disciple’s heart and tongue are engaged in aconversation with truth. The needy then receives grace.Through the shaikh’s actions he designates and correctlyevaluates the disciple who is seeking truth, because actionis one type of seed to assist the disciple.

Al-Suhraward⁄’s stress on the physical touchingof objects by s≠f⁄shaikhs reflects his opinions on sacralizingobjects.It is often that a disciple is overwhelmed and intenselyinspired by his shaikh sometimes even causing difficulty tolook at the shaikh. This happened to me when I was inBuhkara and my uncle Shaikh \u0001Ab≠Najim Suhraward⁄(r)entered the house. My entire upper body started toperspire. At the time, I wanted to control my perspiration,but I could not with the entrance of the honorable shaikh.I was later cured by the blessings of my uncle.64One day I was home alone and next to me was a hand-kerchief given by the honorable shaikh as a gift. He askedto tie a turban with that very handkerchief and coinciden-tally at that moment it ripped. That moment brought megreat pain since that same handkerchief touched the feetof the honorable shaikh. I then built a lot of respect andlove for that material in my heart.65Qualities of ådåbShaikh\u0001Ab≠Nasr Sarråj (r) reported that the qualities ofthe Prophet’s (s) ådåbwere pure. He was trustworthy andconscious of being on time. He was very thoughtful andconcerned about everything. Wherever he was, he wasconcerned with ådåb.66According to Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄there are two parts to ådåb,meaning that words and actions are both to be adhered to.

The s≠f⁄attentiontowardådåbneeded to be with full concentration, sincerity, andunderstanding of its related components. For example, knowledgeofta‚awwufis impossible without complete obedience to ådåbtheology. He stated, “Shaikh N≠r⁄stated that ‘Whoever did notspend their time with ådåb, their time will be considered a time of hate.’ Shaikh Dh≠l N≠n Misr⁄(r) reported, ‘so much has beensaid about ådåb, I say that ådåbis about knowing oneself.’”68In another area of this section he commented on this subject asfollows:After obtaining the light of knowledge (n≠r-e\u0002irfån) it isone way of defending the soul (nafs) and it is well said inthe following ªad⁄th: “Those who defend their souls alsodefend God.” This light of knowledge (n≠r-e\u0002irfån) is thelight of the soul that was in ignorance. Knowledge is themeans of building a fort where ådåbis part of it.69Practicing the art of patience – sabrShaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s ideas on patience (sabr) are directlyconnected with ådåbbecause he wanted to illustrate how eachaspect of development requires patience. The ability to controlone’s mental thoughts and physical actions to meet the challengesofådåband improving in ta‚awwufis an important element to spir-itual growth. On this subject, al-Suhraward⁄stated the followingcommentary: “Shaikh Sahil (r) stated that patience is a vast part ofwaiting. Giving to others is the best aspect of sabr.” A quote froms≠råal-Baqara, verse 3, states, “Those who are patient during timesof fear, pain and fighting are virtuous and temperamental.”70It is said that everything has one distinct character.

Knowledge obtained in ta‚awwuf,irfån, does not come easily nor does it come at the time when thes≠f⁄desires it the most. With the practice of righteous ådåb, regularfasting, prayers, dhikr, charity, and adhering to the shar⁄\u0002å, if thes≠f⁄seeker does not have sabrthen all of his efforts to meet Allåhmay not happen. Sabris a critical component in making both theaforementioned meet together. If the disciple does not possess thepatience to control desires to bypass the obstacles of ta‚awwuf,then the s≠f⁄seeker will not be able to contain himself with Allåh.Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄stated, “The importance of patience is toldto us by God when He said that Those who are patient will begiven without any hesitation and degrees.”72Similarly, hecommented the following: For those persons who protect their zåªir⁄andbå†in⁄knowledge learn that it is necessary to have sabr.Bå†in⁄knowledge and sabrare complementary like a body andits spirit and each cannot live without the other. They bothhave light of reasoning and this is why they were createdas one to be united.73Patience from AllåhShaikh al-Suhraward⁄contributed to this enormous s≠f⁄discourseof patience in ta‚awwufpractice. Like earlier s≠f⁄thinkers beforeSuhraward⁄, there was considerable disagreement and debate overthe types of patience and degrees of patience a s≠f⁄needs to sustainto encounter Allåh. Should the s≠f⁄seeker develop a unique typeof patience that is transcendental and allows the s≠f⁄to subsist withGod,baqå\u0001? Other concerns on patience were whether it could beunderstood in human terms and was it all connected with irfånsabr? How can Suhraward⁄s develop a higher realm of patience that\u0002AWÅRIF AL-MA\u0002ÅRIF11111011111110111011101111111olio73"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"is connected with all of their concerns for ådåb,shar⁄\u0002å,Qur\u0001ån,salat,dhikr, charity, and fasting – all of them together and inter-connected. Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄disciples were interested in the cohesiveunderstanding of the different but similar components to ta‚awwufwhile maintaining the integrity of the Qur\u0001ånandsunnåof theProphet. In this climate Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄believed that sabrinAllåh or sabr an-Allåhand sabr with God or sabr ma \u0002Allåhwerevery compatible and that the differences were not worth arguingover. The first, sabr an-Allåh, was mostly tied with the ªålofbaqå\u0001– subsistence with God. While the second, sabr ma \u0002Allåh, wasconnected with stations on the path toward meeting Allåh. Oneexample he provided was the following statement:One time a person asked Shaikh Shibl⁄(r) “Amongst thepatient ones, which type is the best form of sabr?” Heresponded patience in God, sabr fi-Allåh, but the personpersisted asking if patience is for the sake of God, al-sabrAllåh? Again, Shaikh Shibl⁄(r) stated patience with God,sabr ma \u0002Allåh. Again the person was confused and wantedto know which patience was the best. Finally, the Shaikhresponded patience from Allåh,sabr an-Allåh.74Patience is one area that s≠f⁄s claimed gave the most return. Withsabr, one could achieve all that Allåh has in store for the s≠f⁄seeker, but if one does not know which type of patience to employthen he will be lost on the path. For Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄, this wasnot entirely true nor was patience so simple to think that s≠f⁄scan easily be lost in ta‚awwuf. For him, sabr an-Allåhor patiencefrom Allåh was difficult to achieve because it is one of the highestmystical stages where the Prophet resides. The s≠f⁄seeker aspiresto reach Allåh’s glory by annihilating the self in Him; however, for al-Suhraward⁄, in most situations it is the Prophet (s) himselfwho directs the s≠f⁄seeker to the Beloved to ensure a safelyconducted journey. Once the s≠f⁄seeker meets the Prophet (s),either you can stay with the holy Prophet (s) or, depending on theseekers’sabr,ådåb,nafs, heart, and love for Allåh, the Prophet (s)will direct the seeker toward witnessing God’s face, mushåhadatal-wajih. On this account, al-Suhraward⁄commented the followingstatement:It is my understanding that sabr an-Allåh, patience fromAllåh, is the most difficult to reach.

This is the most intense stage of sabrbecause it isfor the sake of God; his spirituality is forever affected bythis experience.75Degrees of sabrIn assessing the differing types and categories of sabr, al-Suhraward⁄added that there are also three degrees of patience forthe s≠f⁄seeker. Each degree illustrates the s≠f⁄’s level of his ownself-knowledge because patience is tied to irfån. The perfect degreeofsabris where the s≠f⁄seeker is exclusively patient with all things:whether it be about the temporal world or the mystical realm, thistype of patience does not alter for any situation. It is the purestkind of patience a s≠f⁄can achieve because it means that the seekerhas perfected his knowledge of patience and can access Allåh’sgrace when he wishes. Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄stated the followingcommentary to support his evidence:It is reported by Shaikh \u0001Ab≠al-Óasan (r) that there arethree types of sabr. First, there are those who are patientwith God, but occasionally they get upset. Second, thereare those who are patient with God and usually neverbecome impatient, but at certain times they complain andfall into a state of discomfort. And third, there are thosewho are entirely patient with God and their sabris totallycompleted. This type of person is not even disturbed duringcatastrophes. This personality is firm in faith and cannotbe changed. As a result, the nature of this person is relatedto the Divine.76Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄points to the sayings of another prominentscholar of Islam, commonly referred to in twelver Sh⁄\u0001⁄Islam as thesixth imåm, for support in sabrtheories. For example, hecommented that “Shaikh Imåm Jåfar al-Sådiq (r) reported that Godgave His Prophet (s) the wisdom of sabrand the form of sabrwasgiven to the Prophet (s). This is due to the fact that sabris not apersonal possession, but it is related with God and godliness.

The dependence-causation modelespecially referred to the wandering Dervishes(Qalandars) whoserenunciatory antinomian existence had qualities like poverty,mendicancy, itinerancy, celibacy, self-mortification and other formsof social deviance.78Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄draws a distinctionbetweenQalandarsand s≠f⁄s, with the former “only concernedwith the tranquillity of their hearts to the point of destroy-ing customs and eliminating all bonds of social interaction.”79This division reflects al-Suhraward⁄’s disapproval with the wayQalandarsneglectedshar⁄\u0002åand demonstrated very little respecttoward ethics, embodying the sunnåof the Prophet, obeying theshar⁄\u0002å, adhering to the principles of the Qur\u0001ånand their generalattitudes toward living on earth. For al-Suhraward⁄, a true s≠f⁄did not differentiate betweenpoverty and wealth and was concerned with neither fear nor theneed for recompense.80Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄, and a host of others≠f⁄shaikhs and scholars, considered people misguided whobelieved that ascetic beliefs absolved them from a need to obeyshar⁄\u0002åand reality (ªaq⁄qå) which were interdependent. Similarly,he spoke against those s≠f⁄s who claimed they had attained theanalogy of the divine and human aspects of Christ’s personality,and believed in a doctrine of incarnation (ªul≠l).

To al-Suhraward⁄, the heart (qalb) acteddifferently from the rest of the human body although it was a partof it. The heart of a true believer (mu\u0001min) was like a pure soul and was illuminated by a shining light; but the heart of the un-believer was dark and made of a lowly substance. The heart of thehypocrite was shrouded in a veil, and a many-faceted heart wasone which was inclined towards both good and evil.84The purifi-cation of the heart was necessary for a pure nafsand the ability forthe s≠f⁄disciple to receive God’s illumination. Al-Suhraward⁄’s ideas on reason are based in that it was innatehuman talent which prompted human beings to acquire differentkinds of knowledge.

This sectionon the s≠f⁄way of life is not unique in that previous s≠f⁄thinkerswrote on this subject. For example, Shaikh Uthman al-Hujwir⁄’sfamous treatise, Kashf al-Maªj≠b, has a section on s≠f⁄living andit appears that Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄desired to make an additionalcontribution to s≠f⁄life in the khånaqåh. This is not surprising sincethekhånaqåhwas a popular s≠f⁄institution during the twelfth andthirteenth centuries. As discussed in the previous chapter, Shaikhal-Suhrawardi was an important advisor for caliph al-Nåsir, whoassisted in acquiring all fut≠wwagroups and patronizing numerouskhånaqåhs. Al-Suhraward⁄stated that the establishment of thekhånaqåhinstitution was a human innovation, but viewed them asjewels of the suffaduring the life of the Prophet. He believed thatthe advantages of establishing khånaqåhswere an important andpositive contribution to society at large. First, they offered boardand lodging to s≠f⁄s who were often without financial resources of any kind. Second, the corporate life of a khånaqåhprovided anopportunity for individual members who shared a close relation-ship to exchange views and experiences. Finally, the proximity oflife in a khånaqåhprovided for a healthy rivalry between s≠f⁄sin perfection of their morals and conduct. Like al-Hujwir⁄, al-Suhraward⁄divided residents of khånaqåhsinto two categories:there are residents and travelers. According to al-Suhraward⁄, thelatter, generally wandering dervishes, should reach the khånaqåhbefore afternoon prayers, and if late, they should spend the night\u0002AWÅRIF AL-MA\u0002ÅRIF11111011111110111011101111111olio79"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"in a mosque.

The first group contained members of thenovice or servant class who were assigned to such duties as waitingon others, which enabled them to become acquainted with thecompany of mystics and to be initiated in humility. Service enablednovices to rise to the second group of mystics who learnt the socialethics of ta‚awwuf. Members of the third category were elderlyadvanced s≠f⁄s, generally living in seclusion, who were entirelydedicated to prayers and mediation. In a khånaqåh, younger disci-ples should live communally in the jamå\u0002at-khånå, allowing olders≠f⁄s to reside privately in their quarters. According to Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄there were two sources of income for a khånaqåh– endowments and begging. The head of the khånaqåhwas theshaikh al-s≠f⁄yya, and the others were ikhwån(brethren). For theshaikh, it was important that residents should obey the khånaqåhstructure by cooperating and taking food in a communal ritual.

To understands≠f⁄creations of sacred identities and how it is connected to theirinner transcendental spiritual experience, one needs to movebeyond Durkheimian functionalist and Marxist structuralist inter-pretations of identities. Religious beliefs are not merely a universalsingle dominant set of ideas and values that have been conceived tomaintain the cohesion of a social system. Critics of the functional-ist and Marxist schools of thought implement a dominant class per-spective which is equally insufficient to the understanding of theimpact of sacred identities that are rooted in religious ideologies.For instance, J.G. Merquior assumes that ideology is a one-wayprocess and that ideologies are articulated by a self-conscious dom-inant class that works in a system of consent and negotiation withthe masses.1This perspective breaks away from the belief that allideologies are essentially monolithic and it has little to do with faithor beliefs, but more to do with consent between the dominant classand the subordinated classes. Antonio Gramsci takes the notion of ideology as a consent andnegotiation process one step further. For him, ideologies are hege-monic and constantly involved in a dialog between social classes.Gramsci asserts that the subjugated class negotiates for an accept-able version of ideology from the dominant class because there areno other alternative voices or ideologies.2Gramsci believed thatinherently this ideology is less meant for the subjugated classes andmore for the dominant classes to understand themselves. There-fore, to Gramsci, ideology is not a vehicle of unanimous legitimacy11111011111110111011101111111olio83"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"beliefs, but an instrument for the appropriation of the rhetoric oflegitimacy and identity of the elites.3Others have developedGramsci’s ideas, like Pierre Bourdieu and James Fernandez,4whosupport the idea of ideology in terms of class struggle, but also viewthe structuring of symbols and the appropriation of symbols as themain elements in the process of social integration and consensus.The problems with these interpretations of ideology is that theyview ideology as a fixed and established set of ideas, statements orattitudes imposed on people who internalize them complacentlywithout any conscious decision-making of their own. These schol-ars make the assumption that societies are single unitary systemsand all behave in the same manner, or that all dominant classeshave the same motivations to maintain their status. Also, that theidentity of the subjugated class is universally the same everywhereat every point in history. Ritual theoriesThe subject of religious ideologies, and a set of ethical values andideas that determine the structural and mental patterns of ritualsand their relationship to identity formation, is significant for the study of the Suhraward⁄order. There are numerous theoreticalapproaches to ritual studies that need to be mentioned to under-stand where s≠f⁄ritual beliefs fit in to formulating a sacredSuhraward⁄identity. Catherine Bell’s work points out that amongscholars of ritual studies and sociologists of religion there has beena historical dichotomy in defining ritual in terms of either thoughtor action, and sometimes both. Bell demonstrates that early studiesin the field defined rituals as thoughtless actions that are habitual,obsessive, purely formal, secondary and the mere physical ex-pression of logically prior ideas.5According to Bell, this historicalanalysis is still influential in current ritual theories that attempt tounderstand cultural meanings, legitimate myths that surroundrituals or suggest that rituals resolve contradictions in society.6On the other hand, Edward Shils believes it is impossible not tohave ritual and beliefs intertwined and yet try to separate thembecause one might not accept the beliefs that are associated withritual activities.7The first ritual pattern distinguishes actions fromany thought and portrays rituals as mechanical practices. Thesecond ritual pattern attempts to integrate thought and action into rituals and believes there are conscious decisions by parti-cipants in the rituals. Émile Durkheim’s work is important to bothSACRED IDENTITIES IN THE SUHRAWARDÛYYA ORDER111011110111011101111111lio84"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"religious beliefs and ritual studies because he links both phenomenatogether. For him, religion consists of beliefs and rituals: beliefsembody representations of the sacred and rituals are the actionsthat represent the sacred object.8Durkheim’s ritual theories high-light a functionalist perspective, where rituals reinforce thecommunity’s beliefs, and the rituals themselves generate and affirmthe ideals of the community. For Durkheim, rituals in a society are“the means by which individual perception and behavior aresocially appropriated or conditioned.”9In this manner Durkheim’sritual model balances a dialectic relationship between the collectiveand individual or specifically between the first and second ritualpatterns.For many scholars Durkheim’s models suggested real problemsin the ways in which theoreticians approached rituals with orwithout the thoughts and actions of the individuals. For example,Marshall Sahlins felt Durkheim’s approach did not adequatelyfactor in the experiences of the individual and all of the complexsocial categories that affiliated with these individuals.10ClaudeLévi-Strauss disagreed with Durkheim’s ritual model for at leasttwo reasons: first, his model did not include the immense import-ance of cultural factors that influence individuals, communities andultimately their rituals; and, second, Durkheim did not view ritualsas external representations of the inner spiritual world. Accordingto Lévi-Strauss, for some individuals who take part in rituals theyreflect the material world whereas for others they are living out anideal world.11One of the main weaknesses for Lévi-Strauss wasthat Durkheim did not completely incorporate the use of symbolsand all of the religious symbolic actions that bring meaning torituals.The early works by Gramsci and Durkheim reflected a con-centration mainly on class tensions, ideology reinforcement andacceptance by the elite, and rituals as sacred representative objects,all of which opened the discourse for further ritual studies. As faras bringing more depth to the understanding of rituals and beliefsthey were incomplete, because these interpretations belonged toeither a mechanistic or functionalist category. One of the foremostscholars in this field, and in the study of religion in general, isClifford Geertz, whose works expand into areas of sociology, ofculture, religion, and myths. The Geertz model advances the theo-retical models for rituals, while at the same time he is more con-cerned with explaining meanings of rituals as cultural phenomena.He makes a distinction between the terms ethos and worldview.SACRED IDENTITIES IN THE SUHRAWARDÛYYA ORDER11111011111110111011101111111olio85"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"For him, ethos is the moral contents of the culture and the com-munity’s understanding of themselves and of the world. Whereasworldview is the cognitive beliefs of existential being which givepeople a sense of the order of existence.12Geertz is a strongadvocate for rituals containing a combination of the thoughts andactions of individuals who participate in rituals. For him ethos andworldviews are either stored, synthesized, or fused in the symbolsthat are arranged in patterns or systems of rituals. Geertz statedthat “any religious ritual no matter how apparently automatic orconventional involves this symbolic fusion of ethos and world-views.”13In his discussion of his symbolic systems and the fusionof ethos and worldviews he states that these are “cultural patternsthat give meaning . . . by shaping themselves to it and shaping it tothemselves.”14For Geertz, rituals dramatize, enact, and materializea system of symbols. By performing the symbolic system, the ritualis integrating two exclusive aspects of symbols, the conceptualworldview and moral ethos. According to Geertz, those rituals thatwork are designed to be forces of change, and create a balance incultural and social systems.15Like Lévi-Strauss, Geertz’s theoriesattempt to address the fundamental contradictions in societythrough the forum of rituals. For these individuals, opposing social forces, whether they be social relations, religious beliefs oreconomic disparities, are all resolved through the thought andaction of rituals. It is their understanding that these social systemsbecome congruent and conflicts become resolved with an orches-trated ritual.Performing theoristsIn response to these traditional ritual theories and categories,another school of thought evolved which emphasized ritual asdrama, theatrical performances intended to be ceremonial plays.Performing theorists like Victor Turner, Ronald Grimes and JackMacAloon believed that traditional ritual theories were moreconsumed with dichotomies of oral and written histories, publicand private expressions, secular and sacred meanings, all of whichremoved the breathing human elements from their pedagogics.16Performing theorists think they are moving beyond the traditionaldefinitions and categories that were used by the structural and func-tional theorists. According to performing theorist Milton Singer, it was necessary to revise and redefine culture as an “abstractcategory” or a subgroup encapsulated in ritual performances.17SACRED IDENTITIES IN THE SUHRAWARDÛYYA ORDER111011110111011101111111lio86"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Singer states that, just like all dramas, rituals similarly have a timespan, a beginning and an end, an organized program of activity, aset number of actors, an audience, and a significant occasion andplace for the performance. According to Singer, these rituals areintended to have two important types of audiences; the first typeof audience belongs to the cultural rituals and are trying to under-stand themselves. The second type of audience member is theobserver-theorist who is just as important as the actors, becausethey do not observe from an outside window but directly contri-bute to the actors’ ability to integrate their performance for bothaudiences. For Singer, rituals are cultural performances and are amethod for the “cultural content of a tradition to be organized andtransmitted on particular occasions through specific media.”18Among the performing theorists there are disagreements over thenature of rituals and their roles as cultural performances. As oneof the scholars in the performing theorist school of thought, Turneradvocated that these cultural performances were representations of the deepest values of the culture. These rituals were “socialdramas” that served as paradigmatic functions to maintain anorganization or community, and each ritual unfolded a particularsocial drama.19For Turner, these social dramas temporarilysuspend time and break rigid social barriers like class, ethnicity,and sectarianism and bring both actors and audience into a singlecommunitas. He is a firm supporter of the thesis that these socialdramas reflect the mental and spiritual attitudes of the actors andof the community. However, Stanley Tambiah takes exception toTurner’s analysis, especially in the area where social dramas createa sense of unity. Tambiah believes that social dramas do not breaksocial barriers but stress the formal social distinctions in society.These social dramas produce more of a distance effect between all of the players, i.e. actors, audience, observer, and authoritymembers. For Tambiah, social dramas are essentially a vehicle toarticulate the attitudes of institutionalized communication, whichseem to reinforce the functionalist theorists.20Tambiah elucidatesrituals as performative dramas: first, rituals involve doing some-thing or being a part of some kind of action; second, rituals areusually conducted on a stage or a constructed area that serves asthe main arena of performance which utilizes numerous mediumsto intensify the experience for the participants; and third, it includes“indexical values” which are symbolic devices, a special site, recita-tion of sacred texts, all of which for Tambiah attest to the socialhierarchy.21SACRED IDENTITIES IN THE SUHRAWARDÛYYA ORDER11111011111110111011101111111olio87"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Unlike Turner and Singer, Tambiah focuses on the opposingforces that are in rituals such as the cultural versus the universal,and form versus content. The diversity of opinions within the per-forming theorists’ school of thought have contributed to ritualstudies, particularly on metaphors of the acts of drama. But stillthere remain methodological problems that have not been resolved.For instance, every ritual is understood as a social drama and isviewed as a performance that contains symbolic acts meant for theaudience and is open to any interpretation. The only criterion forrituals is described in terms of performances; essentially, the modelof ritual activity classifies the criterion for what is or is not ritual.Another deficiency for the performing theorists is that since everyritual activity is a performance, it is difficult to distinguish culturalrituals from dramatic theater or an entertaining sports event. One of the main criticisms of performing theorists is that they donot recognize that cultural and religious rituals have the potentialto connect to another spiritual world. They refuse to accept thatthese rituals are channels to access a separate dimension, such as arequest for intercession. For performing theorists, anything beyondthe obvious characteristics of the actors and audience is open tospeculation, even if the discussion comes from the actors them-selves. On one level they are prepared to explain the symbolicmeanings of ritual activities, but they do not progress to the nextreasonable level of what the symbols mean to those who performthem.The different studies on ritual activities by the functionalists,structuralists, and performing theorists have offered certain theo-retical models, all of which center around the problems of therelationship between thought and action. This basic dichotomy in the field is pertinent as it affects the relationships of the observer-theorist and the actors. This fundamental division between thoughtand action differentiates a thinking subject from an acting object,or as some have concluded a thinking subject from a non-thinkingobject. In the same ritual discourse, rituals are an object to betterunderstand the culture because they integrate the subject’s thoughtand the object’s activities. The issue of whether rituals are a partof conceptual classification or are the source for cultural expres-sions to be integrated through both thought and action is animportant aspect on how theorists construct or deconstruct mean-ings from rituals. The work of Marcel Mauss brings a refreshing balance to thefield of ritual studies by explaining that “social systems are wholes,SACRED IDENTITIES IN THE SUHRAWARDÛYYA ORDER111011110111011101111111lio88"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"where body, soul, society, everything merges.”22Mauss’ “totalsocial phenomena” goes beyond models that are thematic in natureand beyond the systems of institutions that are divided up intoeconomic, political, religious, and other parts. Mauss insists thatone needs to view the smaller elements like rituals as operatingliving parts of the whole.23To return to the original relationshipsbetween rituals and religious ideology, it is therefore critical to view and interpret rituals as part of the whole of religious belief. One can not exist without the other, since each one is in constantdialog, being shaped and restrained by the other element. Ritualsare the thoughts, actions, and spiritual expressions of people whouse multiple forms of mediums to express a specific aspect of theirreligious ideology. It is as important to learn from their symbolicmeanings as it is to understand how the actual participants perceivetheir meanings. Ritual is a living expression or in other words, a language of communication that is part of the whole.24Thisimportant aspect of ritual should not be ignored by observers whofocus on hermeneutical problems and abstract theoretical construc-tions.Characteristics of Suhraward⁄sacred identitiesFor Muslims, the Prophet Muhammad has provided a paradigmfor establishing legal, personal, spiritual and social norms for theirsocieties. In the words of the Qur\u0001ån: he is “a beautiful model”(uswåhasanå) (s≠rå33, verse 21) whose example is to be followedby the faithful. The Qur\u0001ån,s≠rå4, verse 80, states: “To obey theProphet means to obey God. But if any turn away We have notsent you to watch over them.” According to the Qur\u0001ånthe natureof Muhammad’s mission was explained as the following: “We havesent thee as an evidence of Our grace toward all the worlds” (s≠rå21: 107).For the Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s, and in general for most s≠f⁄s, theProphet’s spiritual and mystical status, particularly the account ofhis night journey to heaven (mi\u0002råj), has been subject to much spec-ulation. The love and devotion that is expressed for the Prophet ineither literature or liturgy have commonly been present in s≠f⁄theology. In order to understand the way Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄sexpressed their transcendental experiences and deep devotion to the Prophet, it is important to examine the ta‚awwufpoetry andrituals that bring them closer to the Prophet. The immense love for Muhammad is at the heart of the tradition and it is clear whySACRED IDENTITIES IN THE SUHRAWARDÛYYA ORDER11111011111110111011101111111olio89"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"he is called God’s beloved (habib-Allåh).

In the Qur\u0001ånit states in s≠rå33, verse 56, “SurelyAllåh and His angels bless the Prophet; O you who believe, blesshim and give yourselves up to his guidance in utter self-surrender!” The innumerable poems dedicated to the Prophet were designedto bring about a spiritual and temporal communion with theProphet. Whether these poems are sophisticated compositions ofthe literati or folk songs sung by villagers, the poems are equallyfilled with warm human and spiritual emotions. Frequently in theseverses, Muhammad is addressed as if he were alive standing in frontof the speaker and affectionately listening to his followers as theyseek his help in solving every type of problem, no matter how seem-ingly mundane.25Historical panegyric poetryThe origin of poetry dedicated to praising the Prophet’s life and allof his radiant pious qualities existed during the lifetime of theProphet. According to Óassan ibn Thåbit, the Prophet’s poet, thename of Muhammad is derived from one of the Divine attributes,maªm≠d: “Allåh derived for him, in order to honor him, part of Hisname, so the Lord of the Throne is called maªm≠d, and the Prophetismuhammad.”26The earliest biography of the Prophet was writ-ten by Ibn Ishåq who explains that the Prophet was given the nameal-åmin, the trustworthy one, by childhood friends when they wereimpressed with his admirable qualities.27In a similar manner, fors≠f⁄poets the very name of Muhammad prefigures all the praises,and the blessings from praising the Prophet’s name will be sharedby his followers (ummatan Muhammad⁄) in this world and in thenext. This name has existed from the beginning of time and will for-ever resound in Paradise. The famous panegyric s≠f⁄poet, Ab≠\u0002lMajd Majd≠d Sanå\u0002⁄(d. 1131) states in one section of D⁄wån:On the Throne of the revolving spheres, you see his placeassigned; On the base of the Divine Throne you see hisname!28In addition, s≠f⁄s applied a method of ishtiqåq kab⁄r, the deriva-tion of a certain meaning from each letter of a word, where the actualname Muhammad consists of: the first letter m⁄masmajid(glory),SACRED IDENTITIES IN THE SUHRAWARDÛYYA ORDER111011110111011101111111lio90"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"the second letter haasrahma(mercy), the third letter m⁄masmulk(kingdom) and the final letter dalasdawåm(everlastingness).29The study of the symbolic characteristics of Muhammad’s nameswas undertaken by both the \u0001ulamå\u0001and s≠f⁄s in early Muslimhistory. As early as the ninth century, the s≠f⁄ascetic Mans≠r al-Óallåj was one of the first to elaborate on the mystical meaningsof the letters in the Prophet’s name. For al-Óallåj the Prophet’sQur\u0002ånic names represent more than having similar etymologicalroots with the divine names; but it was the physical shape itselfthat represented the beginning of humanity. He states, “Was notAdam, the prototype of humanity created from the name ofMuhammad? His head is the round letter m⁄m, his hand the ha,his waist again a small m⁄m, and the rest a dål, so the entire humanrace emerges, as it were, from the name of the Prophet.”30Thisconcept stressed that Muhammad’s name was shaped in the formof a human figure to intentionally reflect a total and completequality; first, he was the “seal of the Prophets,” the last Prophet tobe present to humanity and an end to future messengers sent byGod; and second, he was able to complete this cycle of Prophets(nubuwiyyå) by actually being part of that moment when humanitywas first created. This interpretation stressed the importance thatthe shape of Muhammad’s name had mystical meanings for thesacred moment of creation. Accordingly, Prophet Muhammad’sactual presence in creation was the reason for God to assign himthis particular name in order to symbolize his unique quality to linkthese moments in time. The symbolism of Muhammad’s name as representing eternalqualities was further developed by Ibn \u0001Arab⁄(d. 1240) who inter-preted the human forms in the name. Ibn \u0001Arab⁄viewed the lettersin the name “Muhammad” as parts of the human body where thefirst letter m⁄mrepresented the head and consisted of the qualitiesof sight, hearing, and intellect. He states that:The first m⁄mis the head, and that is the world of theSupreme Sovereignty (\u0002ålam al-malak≠t al-a\u0002lå) and of theGreatest Intellect (al-\u0002aql al-akbar). The breast and the armsare under the ªaand this is the Glorious Throne; its numer-ical value is eight, which is the number of the angels whocarry the Throne. The second m⁄mrepresents the stomach,and that is the world of Kingdom (\u0002ålam al-mulk). The hips,the legs, the feet are from the dål, and that is the stable com-position by means of the eternal writ.31SACRED IDENTITIES IN THE SUHRAWARDÛYYA ORDER11111011111110111011101111111olio91"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"For Ibn \u0001Arab⁄the name “Muhammad” takes on human forms toillustrate his human qualities when he was present in the world.But, these human forms are inherently connected to the othereternal world with the divine, where Muhammad resides with thecreator.

In his works in the early thirteenth century there appear for the first time allusions to certain aspects of Prophetology33that became very popular in the following centuries. For example,in his Mus⁄batnåma,\u0001A††år claims that both worlds are createdfrom the two m⁄ms of the name of Muhammad. He asserts that even in the word \u0001ålam, “world,” there is only one m⁄mand the two m⁄ms of Muhammad must refer to both worlds, the existential one and the eternal world.34That is to say \u0001A††år’sinterpretation of Muhammad’s name meant that he had to exist in dual worlds and be a part of both worlds. For \u0001A††år, Muham-mad’s presence in the two worlds represented his uniqueness as aProphet, and it reflected a distinct sacred position in God’suniverse.Almost three centuries later another renowned s≠f⁄poet,\u0001AbdurRaªmån Jåm⁄(d. 1492), continued with this idea but elaborated itin a more complicated reasoning. Jåm⁄understood the Prophetthrough one of his designated names, Aªmad.

Earlier Shaikh \u0001Umar al-Suhraward⁄’s importance of ådåbwas studied in his treatise \u0001Awårifal-Ma\u0002årif, and he often stated that for each s≠f⁄there is a properådåbfor each waqt,ªål, and maqåm.73The Suhraward⁄emphasison strict structure and the complete submission to the silsilå’sådåbprinciples essentially instruct the disciple of his obligations atdifferent times and situations of his s≠f⁄journey.One of the areas of structured behavior was in the ritual ofremembrance (dhikr) which was understood to be a very importantactivity for disciples to spiritually mature and gain first-hand training from the s≠f⁄shaikh. Shaikh Baha\u0002al-d⁄n Zakariyyåadhered to his mentor’s teachings very closely and taught them inhis order in Multan. He insisted that the mur⁄dsfollow the ådåb-idhikras instructed because their obedience to it was related toupholding God’s law or the shar⁄\u0002å. The s≠f⁄seeker of God must beprepared in every way, in all thoughts and in behavior.74This inter-pretation is identical to Shaikh \u0001Umar al-Suhraward⁄’s treatise\u0001Awårif al-Ma\u0002årifunder the heading of proper etiquette. In a simi-lar way Shaikh Zakarriyyåinstructed his disciples for the properådåb-i dhikrin the following manner: first, the s≠f⁄must come tothedhikrarea in a pure mental and physical state, which means thatthe s≠f⁄must perform ablution (wudu) and the clothes worn mustadhere to the sunnåof the Prophet; second, the s≠f⁄sits in his des-ignated prayer position; third, at the time of dhikr, place your handson your lap, empty out your heart of any ill will and close your eyes;fourth, begin by repeating after the s≠f⁄shaikh “There is no Godbut God.”75Shaikh Zakariyyå’sdhikrinstructions explicitly tell the disciplesto “maintain a soft voice and try to keep it as soft as possiblebecause in order to allow God to enter the heart it must be peace-ful and extremely pious.”76After this phase of dhikr, ShaikhZakariyyåinstructs the disciples to break the recitation into smallerparts and concentrate on the section that says ilåh-låh. He explainsthat this focus prepares the disciple to think truly that there is noone but God for the disciple, and all of one’s love needs to bedirected to ilåh-låh. Shaikh Zakariyyåexplains that for every partof the heart the disciple purifies, it creates more space for the loveof God to rest in. According to him, each time a person conductsdhikrit brings the person closer to God and makes the heartprogressively stronger.77Shaikh Zakariyyåexplained that a proper following of ådåb-idhikrand the proper practice of purifying the heart will result inSACRED IDENTITIES IN THE SUHRAWARDÛYYA ORDER111011110111011101111111lio102"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"a limitless amount of love with God. At this point, the mind, heart,body, and soul are united with that of the divine and the s≠f⁄seeker cannot rewind the process of being in total love. Accordingto Shaikh Zakariyyå, the s≠f⁄seeker knows when dhikrtruly affectshim because the new state of “total love” is like fire. He explainedthat God’s essence is so overpowering for the seeker that the onlyway to approach the union is through one of God’s basic elements,fire. When the fire of the s≠f⁄’sdhikrmeets with the fire of the divine, nothing in the universe can extinguish it.78ShaikhZakariyyåsupports these beliefs by quoting ªad⁄thsthat state“those who seek me (God) I will return favors to him.” He continues this thought of dhikrwith the following ªad⁄thtosupport the significance of dhikr, “those servants that rememberme I will keep them close to me and protect them.”79At the moment of union (jam’ al-jam’), the s≠f⁄seeker who isnow a lover (\u0001åshiq) needs to present the proper benedictions toGod in order to be accepted by Him. Shaikh Zakariyyåcomparesthis state to that of entering paradise. He explained that it isimportant to humbly recite the following in its proper order to theBeloved. First, the \u0001åshiqshould recite “Oh Lord protect me with your shelter.” Second, “Oh Lord your are the poles of all theworlds.” Third, “Please Bless me with your kindness.” Fourth,“You are Lord of all Friends of God.” And fifth, “Please Bless mewith your kindness.” With these proper salutations the \u0001åshiqisenabled to sustain the fire of the union.80Another Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄of Ucch, Shaikh Sayyid Båqir ibn SayyidUthmån Bukhår⁄(d. ca. 1687), composed a work called Jawåhir al-\u0002Auliyå\u0001, (“Jewels of the Friends of God”), which dedicates twochapters to the virtues and blessings of God and the powers ofProphet Muhammad’s ninety-nine names.81In his work ShaikhUthmån Bukhår⁄cites the famous s≠f⁄shaikh,\u0001Abd≠l Qådir Jilan⁄,who said “that any person who recites the ninety-nine names onceevery day and every night will be preserved from all kinds of afflic-tion, and his faith will always remain undisturbed.”82ShaikhUthmån Bukhår⁄’s ancestral lineage was from Shaikh Makhd≠mJahåniyån of Ucch (d. 1383), who is reported to have said “thatthe recitation of these names after the dawn prayer will cause allsins, great and small, open and secret, to be forgiven.”83ShaikhUthmån Bukhår⁄continues to demonstrate the importance of theProphet’s ninety-nine names by quoting another s≠f⁄, Sultån SayyidMahmud Nåsir al-d⁄n Bukhår⁄, who is reported to have said “thatwhoever recites them seven times after the noon prayer will neverSACRED IDENTITIES IN THE SUHRAWARDÛYYA ORDER11111011111110111011101111111olio103"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"be harassed by birds or beasts.”84While another unnamed s≠f⁄asserted that their elevenfold recitation after the evening prayerwould increase one’s knowledge, mildness, and ta‚awwuf. ShaikhUthmån Bukhår⁄cites Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s who reported that they had personal revelations from the Prophet or seen him in theirdreams. For instance, Shaikh Makd≠m Jahåniyån is reported tohave met the Prophet personally when he was visiting Madina andwas told that “the greatest reward is when the ninety-nine namesare recited twelve times after the night prayer,” and that the “pre-eternal Muhammad had promised that he would definitely bringthat person to Paradise, and would not enter it without him.”85Like other s≠f⁄orders, Suhraward⁄shaikhs believed that repeti-tion of the Prophet’s holy names conveyed blessings upon the recit-ing persons. The names of the Prophet, which amount toninety-nine, were collected from titles that were attributed to himin the Qur\u0001ån. Some examples are in s≠rå33, verse 45, where theProphet is called a warner (nadh⁄r) to his community; in s≠rå2,verse 119, where the Prophet announces glad tidings (bash⁄r), andins≠rå53, verse 10, where he was sent as a mercy to the worlds(rahamatan lil-alim⁄n). These ninety-nine names represent numer-ous different qualities of the Prophet that allow individuals whorecite his names to interact with him on multiple levels. For s≠f⁄s,names like bå†in,zåªid,umm⁄,wål⁄,aªmad,ªaqq, and \u0001abdallåhaccentuate Prophet Muhammad’s mystical qualities and undeniablysupport the ta‚awwufpath.

Literature for both s≠f⁄orders cross-references each other and often cites their s≠f⁄shaikhsas contemporaries who maintained congenial relationships. Withins≠f⁄literature there are at least three literary types that representrespective orders. First, s≠f⁄literatures that deal with biographicaland anecdotal collections of earlier s≠f⁄shaikhs are called tazkiråt.Oftentazkiråtcontain detailed accounts of the most prominent s≠f⁄shaikhs in the order and include their educational background, theirmystical training, places of travel, and the description of certainvaluable discussions with contemporary thinkers and politicians,their particular interpretation of mystical religious beliefs, teachers,and adherence to the s≠f⁄†ar⁄qa. Second, and considered by s≠f⁄sto be very important sources, are the collections of the religiousopinions of s≠f⁄shaikhs which are called maktubåt. The maktubåtliteratures were usually compiled by either a khal⁄fådesignated bythe s≠f⁄shaikh or were written accounts by a reputable discipleknown for maintaining written records.

Third, the actual conversa-tions by various s≠f⁄shaikhs concerning their order are collected inworks called malf≠Ωåt. These conversations are primarily recordedby the appointed khal⁄faof the silsilå, and cover the shaikh’s methodof leading a s≠f⁄life, his ideas on subjects like dhikr,ådåb,salåt,maqåmåt,ªål,fanå\u0001, and baqå\u0001.Malf≠Ωåtare often organized11111011111110111011101111111olio109"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"chronologically according to the time when the s≠f⁄shaikh allowedhis conversation with his mur⁄dto be recorded, but there is no singlecustomary format for writing malf≠Ωåtliterature. Although mysticaltales are associated with stories in the literature, these s≠f⁄sourcesare still important for learning about the way s≠f⁄shaikhs disputedand defended their own ta‚awwuf. These recollected mysticalstories, which are attributed to specific shaikhs, reflect a certainamount of spiritual hierarchy in the silsilå. These myths preservestories of how the s≠f⁄shaikh would instantaneously heal the sickand feed thousands of hungry persons in his khånaqåhat any givenmoment. Not every s≠f⁄shaikh had these prodigious qualities, andbeing attributed a set of supernatural powers represents the shaikh’splace in two hierarchies. On one level, if the shaikh displayed thephenomenal powers that he had obtained through his mystical expe-riences, it represents his ability to reach the divine in the presentworld. On another level, if a shaikh is attributed a few exceptionalpowers, such as exclusive dialogs with the divine, then he falls intoa higher position within the historical hierarchy of the s≠f⁄silsilå.For disciples, these stories are pertinent to their connection to thes≠f⁄shaikh because they link the s≠f⁄disciple with the achievementsof their s≠f⁄shaikh.2It is not only important which s≠f⁄stories arerecollected in s≠f⁄literature, but the way they are understood,altered, and applied in the Suhraward⁄religious beliefs.3Thetazkiråt,malf≠Ωåt, and makt≠båtliteratures are more thanliterary sources that serve to describe a s≠f⁄shaikh’s genealogy, spiri-tual powers, education, and ta‚awwufpath. It is an importantsource for social and intellectual s≠f⁄history. While scholars like Nicholson, Arberry, Currie and Lapidus have all criticized the validity of the use of s≠f⁄hagiographical literature as a source for s≠f⁄intellectual history, one cannot ignore the richness of these sources for a deeper understanding of those s≠f⁄s who weretrained by leading s≠f⁄shaikhs. If one was only concerned with the “origins” and “truths” of the facts within these texts, then the researcher will definitely encounter contradictory statements.However, the s≠f⁄hagiographers of these works were not trained inhistorical studies that included modern scientific research methods,but more along the lines of recording what they found important torecollect about a particular incident or individual. In this respect,these types of works are extremely significant if one is interested inreconstructing the narratives of the Suhraward⁄order, and the waysin which these narratives became a critical factor in the popularimagination.THE SUHRAWARDÛYYASILSILÅIN MULTAN AND UCCH111011110111011101111111lio110"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Since this genre of literature focuses on individuals who wereinfluential in shaping the philosophical and behavioral structure ofthesilsilå, it also contains partial views against other organizationsor individuals.

On the one hand these views represent the complex multi-relationships between various Muslim communities; and on theother hand they demonstrate how certain views were institutional-ized as part of a Suhraward⁄religious belief system.4Like mostorganizations that experience socio-political changes and all of thedemands of making religious beliefs meaningful, the Suhraward⁄yyaalso needed to adjust their views in most of the areas mentioned tomeet the issues that confronted the silsilå. It is this process of adapt-ing themselves to new environmental challenges that is present inthe literature that suggests several qualities about the Suhraward⁄silsilå. One clear characteristic of the order was its flexibility underthe leadership of Shaikh Jalål al-d⁄n Bukhar⁄to incorporate even-tually a wide range of members from different classes and ethnicregions. Even though this mixing was not favored by a prominentSuhraward⁄shaikh like Baha\u0002al-d⁄n Zakariyyå, it demonstratestheir shift from an exclusive to an inclusive membership policy.5Itexemplifies a desire to lay down roots in the region by accepting thelarger community into the s≠f⁄order.

Onereason why Suhraward⁄sources did not survive is the fact thatMultan was the center of their silsilå, and the city experiencedconstant political and social instability during the Tughluq andLodi periods. As administrations of these sultånates consolidatedtheir control from Delhi, neighboring regions like Multan, Lahore,THE SUHRAWARDÛYYASILSILÅIN MULTAN AND UCCH11111011111110111011101111111olio111"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Sind, Kashmir, and Gujarat became politically peripheral to thecenter. Although these regions remained important economic,military, and political areas for the Delhi Sultånate, s≠f⁄recordsconfirm that members were attracted to government service at thecapital.7Another possible reason why Suhraward⁄sources are not as common is because during the late fifteenth-century Lodiperiod, the Suhraward⁄Multankhånaqåhlost immense financialendowments from the state, which may have caused either a poormaintenance of records or the inability to hire salaried chroniclersin the silsilå. The gradual Tughluq and Lodi political and religiousdomination of the Multan khånaqåhresulted in Suhraward⁄shaikhs losing their independent control of their khånaqåh. Themanagement was primarily under the control of designated stateofficials. These may be the reasons why primary Suhraward⁄tazkiråt,malf≠Ωåt, and makt≠båtmaterials did not survive the late thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. While there is an ampleamount of secondary sources about the lives of Suhraward⁄shaikhs, it would be counterproductive to ignore Chisht⁄literatureas an important source for illustrating common ideologies and rela-tionships between Chisht⁄and Suhraward⁄shaikhs, differences inmystical opinions, shar⁄\u0002åinterpretation, Qur\u0002ånic and ªad⁄thexegesis, and, of course, recollected stories that illustrate the waysin which they were incorporated into each of their respectivesilsilås.

Aibek’ssudden death created a political vacuum and led to a politicalstruggle among the Turkish political elite and slave officers, andconsequently India was divided into four principalities: Lakhanautiwas ruled by Khaligi Måliks, Delhi and various territories were inthe possession of Iltutmish; Sind was governed by Nåsir al-d⁄nQubacha. Sultån Iltutmish’s attempt to unify the empire broughthim into conflict with other military contenders such as Shihåb al-d⁄n who challenged his claims to political rule.Shaikh Zakariyyålived under Qubacha’s rule in Multan butopenly supported Iltutmish’s authority in Delhi. The shaikh con-spired with Sharåf al-d⁄n, the qaziof Multan, to overthrowQubacha’s power and even wrote a letter to Sultån Iltutmish invit-ing him to invade Multan. The letter was intercepted by Qubachawho summoned both Shaikh Zakariyyåand Qåd⁄Sharåf al-d⁄n.Qubacha asked the shaikh, “Have you written this letter?” TheShaikh responded without hesitation, “Yes, I have written this letterand this is my handwriting.” Qubacha continued and asked theshaikh, “Why did you write it?” and Shaikh Zakariyyåreplied,“Whatever I wrote was under divine guidance (al-ªaqq). You dowhatever you can do and what is in your means.”15By this time,Qubacha understood Shaikh Zakariyyå’s ability to assert religiousauthority in Multan, as well as the shaikh’s political relationship inDelhi. To avoid further conflict between the two, Qubacha ordereda grand meal to honor the shaikh. In one way, Qubacha was test-ing the shaikh’s loyalties, because in most instances, Zakariyyåmade it a point not to eat a meal at any one else’s home. ShaikhZakariyyåmade an exception at this time and joined Qubacha inthe meal.16S≠f⁄biographers point to the shaikh’s spiritual author-ity that allowed him to escape allegations of treason, but the factis, like his predecessor, Shaikh Zakariyyåwas both a popular spir-itual and political leader in Multan. His execution or banishmentwould have contributed to tensions in most regions, especially inMultan and in Sind, which would have given Sultån Iltutmish morereason to take control.

But Firishtah reported that Qubacha’s failure toenforce the laws in Multan forced the shaikh to seek politicalsupport from Sultån Iltutmish. The shaikh’s wide popular appealand political alliances were significant for Sultån Iltutmish’s annex-ation of Multan in 1227. Shaikh Zakariyyåwas assigned the officeofShaikh al-Islåm, and Jamal⁄asserts that this office continued inthe shaikh’s family until around 1535.17The Suhraward⁄yyasilsilåunder Sultån IltutmishSultån Shams al-d⁄n Iltutmish had a long history of dealing withs≠f⁄s of the Chisht⁄and Suhraward⁄orders. As a young adult hevisited Shaikh Shihåb al-d⁄n al-Suhraward⁄’skhånaqåhin Baghdadand apparently received his blessings.18His sympathy toward s≠f⁄s is recorded by the historian Minªåj al-d⁄n who stated that apromise was made to a faq⁄rby the sultån to support them for hisentire life.19While Iltutmish was never an official disciple of ShaikhZakariyyå, he clearly supported the Suhraward⁄order and tried toappoint them to as many government positions as possible. Evenas close he was to Shaikh Zakariyyå, there is no evidence as towhether he was officially given the symbolic cloak (khirqa) fromthe Suhraward⁄silsilå.Shaikh Jalål al-d⁄n Tabr⁄z⁄It is recorded by Jamal⁄that when Shaikh Jalål al-d⁄n Tabr⁄z⁄reached Delhi from Baghdad, Sultån Iltutmish went out to receivehim and “no sooner had he seen the shaikh that he got down fromhis horse and ran towards him.”20The sultån brought the shaikhto his palace and honored him as a royal guest. When the Shaikhal-Islåm, Najm al-d⁄n Sughra, found the sultån deeply respectfuland considerate toward Shaikh Tabr⁄z⁄, he grew jealous and slan-dered the shaikh by accusing him of adultery. The sultån summoneda legal proceeding (mahzår) to discuss the charge, and while ShaikhTabr⁄z⁄was acquitted of all charges, the shaikh was so deeply dis-turbed by this incident that he left Delhi for Bengal and stated:THE SUHRAWARDÛYYASILSILÅIN MULTAN AND UCCH11111011111110111011101111111olio119"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"“When I came to Delhi I was pure gold, now I am leaving beingreduced to silver.”21This is another example of fierce competitionbetween s≠f⁄s and \u0002ulamå\u0001to maintain their sole alliances, and toundermine the other’s attempt to become closer to the sultån. Thisanecdote reflects another dimension of s≠f⁄literature, often ignoredin scholarship, which is the use of literary exaggeration to em-phasize the intense malevolence between the parties. Without thepresence of legal evidence needed in Islamic law to accuse a personof adultery, there is a leap of logic in this story. It is difficult to assesswhether the Shaikh al-Islåmof the Delhi Sultånate (Najm al-d⁄nSughra) was able to collect substantial evidence to accuse anotherleading shaikh (Shaikh Tabr⁄z⁄) of adultery. Even if Shaikh Najmal-d⁄n Sughra did not have the factual support to prove his allega-tions to be true, it reflects a profound level of risk that was involvedin slandering another religious figure. Shaikh Sughra’s allegationsthat led to legal proceedings risked his prestigious \u0002ulamå\u0001positionand general status in society. Regardless of the part of the story thatrecords Shaikh Tabr⁄z⁄’s acquittal and eventual departure fromDelhi for Bengal, it illustrates a significant amount of indignationwith Delhi’s\u0002ulamå\u0001politics, especially the tensions in \u0002ulamå\u0001–s≠f⁄relations.Qåd⁄Óam⁄d al-d⁄n Nagaur⁄\u0001Isam⁄reports that the Suhraward⁄scholar Shaikh Zakariyyåwasheld in deep respect by Sultån Iltutmish. He stated that “wheneverhe visited the court, the sultån received him with the utmostcordiality and respect.”22As a member of both communities,\u0002ulamå\u0001and Suhraward⁄yya, Qåd⁄Óam⁄d al-d⁄n Nagaur⁄supportedthe controversial use of s≠f⁄devotional music (samå\u0002) and wouldoften host grand samå\u0002parties at his khånaqåh.Shar⁄\u0002å-mindedscholars like Qåd⁄Sa\u0001d and Qåd⁄\u0001Imåd approached SultånIltutmish to put an end to this religious mockery and asserted that“the entire city has fallen victim to this mischief.” Sultån Iltutmishordered a conference to discuss the legal validity of samå\u0002by leadingscholars in the administration, and when Qåd⁄Óam⁄d al-d⁄nNagaur⁄entered the court, the sultån kissed his hands and madehim sit by his side. When Qåd⁄Nagaur⁄was pressed about thelegality of samå\u0002he stated that “samå\u0002is prohibited for the outer-minded folks, but it is permitted for men who are spirituallyconnected to the God’s universe.” Quick witted as he was, Qåd⁄Nagaur⁄reminded the sultån of the “time when he participated inTHE SUHRAWARDÛYYASILSILÅIN MULTAN AND UCCH111011110111011101111111lio120"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"samå\u0002in Baghdad with prominent s≠f⁄shaikhs and it was theirblessings and reward that gave him the control over Hindustan.”23After recollecting the incident Sultån Iltutmish immediately fell tothe feet of Qåd⁄Nagaur⁄as a sign of humility. After the conference,the sultån accompanied Qåd⁄Nagaur⁄to his khånaqåhto celebratewith a large feast and an all night celebration with samå\u0002. WhileSultån Iltutmish himself did not officially join the Suhraward⁄order, his deepest respect and connection to the Suhraward⁄silsilåwas demonstrated when he later sent his nephew, Sa\u0001d al-d⁄n toQåd⁄Nagaur⁄to be a Suhraward⁄disciple.This s≠f⁄story is illustrative of Suhraward⁄shaikhs like Qåd⁄Nagaur⁄having a direct influence over controversial issues of thetime, and of their keen communicative skills to change the attitudesof the sultån. Whether Sultån Iltutmish immediately prostratedhimself to Qåd⁄Nagaur⁄or shed more insight on the legality ofsamå\u0002is not the heart of the issue, it is the symbolism of the act ofthe most powerful politician submitting himself to Qåd⁄Nagaur⁄.This is significant because it is part of a recollected narrative in s≠f⁄literature and it gives additional spiritual authoritative quali-ties to Qåd⁄Nagaur⁄and to Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s. It demonstrates howSuhraward⁄shaikhs were capable of maintaining the power of thenarratives in the s≠f⁄order despite the validity of the action beingquestionable. It is the presence of these recollected narratives ofparticular Suhraward⁄shaikhs that reinforces their distinct spiritualauthority within the silsilå, their profound influence over politicalpolicies, and unequivocal contributions to the ta‚awwuftradition.Sayyid N≠r al-d⁄n Mubarak Ghaznav⁄Sayyid N≠r al-d⁄n Mubarak Ghaznav⁄(d. 1234), another khal⁄faofShaikh Shihåb al-d⁄n\u0001Umar al-Suhraward⁄, was based in Delhi.Sultån Iltutmish continued his Suhraward⁄patronage andappointed him as Shaikh al-Islåmof Delhi.

His attacks were directed toward the rulers and how theymade themselves superior to the rest of society. Sayyid Ghaznav⁄’sdenunciation of these principles were a direct threat to the polit-ical ideology, the ruling elite, and particularly towards the stabilityof Iltutmish’s administration.Sayyid Ghaznav⁄asked: “What effect, if any, has this admoni-tion had on the life and thought of Iltutmish?” It appears that thefact that the sultån could not live up to the expectations of SayyidGhaznav⁄and these types of behavior personally affected the s≠f⁄shaikh. As Shaikh al-Islåm, he seemed bothered by managing polit-ical organizations and being affiliated with non-Islåmic institutions.He was disturbed that many wanted to learn shar⁄\u0002åtheories, butwere not concerned with the practice of it. The famous historianZia al-d⁄n Baran⁄himself commented on this issue of “un-Islåmic”institutions in his Fatwa-i Jahåndar⁄, where he said, “sovereigntywas never possible without practicing non-Islåmic customs.”24Sayyid Ghaznav⁄was conscious of this contradiction and proposedto the sultån “ways and rules for protecting the faith” (Chår\u0002amald⁄n plahi). These four rules were outlined: first, the sultån shouldtry to uproot the idolaters and the practice of idolatry. Second,immorality should be extirpated from all territories and life shouldbe made impossible for criminals and bad characters. Third, God-fearing, pious, and religious-minded men alone should be employedin government service. And fourth, principles of equity and justiceshould prevail in the empire. The M⁄r-i Delhiinformed SultånIltutmish that if a sultån instituted these four principles he wouldbe popular among the companions of the Prophet and s≠f⁄shaikhs,even if his own morals were not high. “If, on the contrary, he offersdaily one thousand genuflections of prayers, regularly fasts,abstains from things that are prohibited in shar⁄\u0002å, spends the wholeof the treasury in the way of God – but does not enforce the above-mentioned four ordinances – his place cannot be anywhere but inhell.”25It is unclear whether this speech was edited by Baran⁄or was anauthentic sermon by Sayyid Ghaznav⁄. Scholars like Khaliq Nizamifelt that this speech was edited by Baran⁄to fit his own personalteaching and philosophy. According to Nizami, Baran⁄being acourt historian, was interested in preserving a sense of historicalharmony and cohesion for the political leaders of his time. In thisway, Baran⁄did not have to confront the \u0002ulamå\u0001on these issuesduring the Ilbarite regime.THE SUHRAWARDÛYYASILSILÅIN MULTAN AND UCCH111011110111011101111111lio122"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Shaikh Sadr al-d⁄n\u0001ArifShaikh Sadr al-d⁄n\u0001Arif (d. 1286) was the eldest son of ShaikhBaha\u0002al-d⁄n Zakariyyåand succeeded Sayyid Mubarak Ghaznav⁄as the leading shaikh of the Suhraward⁄order in Multan. The mostinteresting public change for the Suhraward⁄order was in Shaikh\u0001Arif’s personal attitudes toward wealth and government service.As a member of the Suhraward⁄family, he despised the accumula-tion of wealth because for him the accumulation of worldly giftswas a distraction from ta‚awwufspirituality. He felt that thesebeliefs were not a contradiction to Suhraward⁄silsilåta‚awwufbecause in the past the acceptance of wealth was conducted byshaikhs who were financial experts in managing the silsilå’sexpenses. Unlike his father who had a strong character to controlhimself from the corruption of wealth, Shaikh Sadr al-d⁄n\u0001Arif feltthat he did not possess such strength not to be absorbed bymoney.26Shaikh\u0001Arif’s claims that wealth would lead him astrayfrom spiritual purity were partly due to the fact that he may haveagreed with the strong criticisms against the Suhraward⁄silsilå’semphasis on wealth.

In his Thatta military cam-paign, the sultån did not pay tribute to even one single Suhraward⁄khånaqåh, but he made it a point to visit all Chisht⁄centers. ShaikhY≠suf Ghirdez was personally offended at the sultån’s disregard fornot visiting Shaikh Baha\u0002al-d⁄n Zakariyyå’s tomb and requested thesultån to pay his respects to the Suhraward⁄khånaqåh. In manyways, this incident is indicative of the loss of influence by shaikhsin the Suhraward⁄silsilå; even at times when they were designatedas the Shaikh al-Islåmthey could not persuade the sultån to givehis total support. The loss of influence by Suhraward⁄shaikhswas not only a crucial displacement of the spiritual and politicalauthority of Shaikh Y≠suf Ghirdez in the region, but it was a grad-ual shift in policy by the state toward other stable s≠f⁄orders, suchas Khwaja Mo\u0002in al-d⁄n Chisht⁄’ssilsilåin Ajmer.

He remarked, “Had I not left these khånaqåhsbehind, I would have become arrogant.”41However, under SultånFiroz Shåh the shaikh became an important religious ally to nego-tiate a peaceful settlement between the government and rebels.Under Sultån Firoz Shåh the regions of Sind and Sammas, and theborders of Gujarat and Punjab, were areas of rebel disturbances.In a second Thatta military campaign by Sultån Firoz, ShaikhBukhår⁄successfully arranged a peace agreement between rebelleaders Jam Juna and Banbhina and the sultån.Shaikh Bukhår⁄too had his share of conflicts with the ministerof Sultån Firoz Shåh, Khån-i Jahån Maqbul.

The Lodi Afghans estab-lished a semi-independent dynasty at Samana under the leadershipof Sultån Shåh Lodi; while the descendants of T⁄m≠r claimed their right over certain portions of Punjab. In Multan, Mughals and Afghans were both contesting for political supremacy. Thiswas a critical phase of political transition, particularly in Multan,and in an attempt to bring more stability to the region the rulingelites elected Shaikh Y≠suf, a descendent of Shaikh Baha\u0002al-d⁄nZakariyyå, as their ruler in 1443. The emergence of a s≠f⁄silsilåasa ruling dynasty was unprecedented in the Indian subcontinent. The forefront of Suhraward⁄political activities is a systematicculmination of a process of subordinating to and even becoming apart of the political enterprise. The election of Shaikh Y≠suf wasdue to the enormous influence the Suhraward⁄shaikhs had exer-cised over Multan and its adjoining territories.

In order to maintain his own authorityand keep the Suhraward⁄silsilåin the center of Multan⁄politics,Shaikh Y≠suf involved himself in a matrimonial alliance with aBaluchi Langa tribe. Shaikh Y≠suf was used by the leader of theLanga tribe, Rai Sahrah, to establish his own dynasty in Multan.When the shaikh refused to take part in sabotaging the DelhiSultånate, he fled to Delhi. Later on Shaikh Y≠suf did form analliance with Rai Sahrah in Multan. With the Suhraward⁄silsilåbecoming a more ephemeral institution in Multan and Ucch, otherregions such as Delhi and Gujarat developed a stronger infrastruc-ture to sustain its success.This section has examined the progression of the Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄order in Multan and Ucch. From the time of Shaikh \u0002Umar al-Suhraward⁄in Baghdad to Shaikh Rukn ud-d⁄n Abu FatªinMultan, the Suhraward⁄silsilåhad undergone a cycle of intensepopularity, strong political affiliations with the central governmentand social institutions, involvement in state affairs, and eventuallya decline of state patronage. The Suhraward⁄s were not quietistic,world-rejectionist s≠f⁄s; instead from the beginning their ta‚awwufembraced what the world had to offer and at the same timecombinedta‚awwufpractices with shar⁄\u0002åand their political activ-ities. At certain times the ta‚awwufof the Suhraward⁄s enabledthem to enjoy the benefits of their close association with the stateby receiving grants, official positions, salaries, and funds to buildtheirkhånaqåhs, and ultimately this s≠f⁄–state relationship allowedthe political leaders to have a certain amount of influence overMultan⁄Suhraward⁄s.The Suhraward⁄political experiences in Multan and Ucch were,in many respects, continuation of the activities and religiousideologies of Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄in Baghdad two generationsearlier. The ways these beliefs were transferred to his disciples in Multan reflect a process of institutionalizing the s≠f⁄order in anew and unknown region. In attempting to settle in new regions by adapting to foreign ethos and cultures, the Suhraward⁄s hadTHE SUHRAWARDÛYYASILSILÅIN MULTAN AND UCCH11111011111110111011101111111olio131"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"undergone a process of assimilation. Multan and Ucch were con-sidered to be new frontiers for Baghdad inhabitants; it meantunderstanding the boundaries that come with culture, religiouspractices, business ethics, and political relationships. In a newculture, or realistically the Indian Frontier, the Suhraward⁄s neededto continue their tradition of building networks and supportsystems not to adapt to the local culture and be portrayed as s≠f⁄swho are in exile.In Baghdad, Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s position as Shaikhål-Islåmallowed him to accomplish a number of critical objectives to consolidate his s≠f⁄order. His successful model was used bySuhraward⁄s to continue their order in Multan and Ucch. To reiter-ate al-Suhraward⁄’s model, first, by cooperating with fut≠wwainsti-tutions he increased his networking system with a group that alreadyincorporated many s≠f⁄ideals in their beliefs and rituals. Second, asa diplomatic representative for caliph al-Nåsir he negotiated closerrelationships between the \u0001Abbasid administration and allies, andeven endeavored toward ending political stalemates through peace-ful resolutions. Third, as a s≠f⁄statesman for caliph al-Nåsir, al-Suhraward⁄worked toward institutionalizing a cohesive relation-ship between the caliph’s rule and anarchistic and anti-state fityångroups. Fourth, there are reasons to believe that Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s cordial relations with the Nizår⁄Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄community,in particular with ImåmÓasan, influenced the direction of a com-mon Suhraward⁄–Ismå\u0001⁄l⁄coalesced tradition. And fifth, Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s reformist attitudes in areas of ta‚awwufand politicswere instrumental in unifying the caliphate and all of the social,religious, and political systems that belonged to it.The process of unifying the caliphate required Shaikh al-Suhra-ward⁄to design and advocate his ta‚awwufbeliefs on a grand scale.According to him, in order for any pious person to enter paradise,they had to live their life as perfectly as possible in this world. Toal-Suhraward⁄this meant strict adherence to God’s law or shar⁄\u0002å,which was equivalent to obeying the authority of caliph. His theoryincluded a necessary relationship between the fut≠wwainstitution,s≠f⁄s and the caliph, and when the first two groups completelyconformed to the leadership of the caliph, that created a perfectlyharmonious society, living according to God’s will. In this idealworld, which to Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄was mandated by divineorder, the caliph needed to be the supreme religious authority bymastering all of the Islamic sciences. With this in mind Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄was the main proponent behind al-Nåsir receiving anTHE SUHRAWARDÛYYASILSILÅIN MULTAN AND UCCH111011110111011101111111lio132"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"ijåzafor transmitting ªadithand becoming a certified legitimatefaqihin all four Jamå\u0002⁄-Sunn⁄legalmadªåbschools.

For al-Suhraward⁄,s≠f⁄s were practicing more than spiritual exercises; but in the largerscheme Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s were attempting to unite with the divine,which required them to uphold the shar⁄\u0002å. According to Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄, in order to be prepared to carry out this exceptionalresponsibility the individual must have his thoughts and actionscontrolled in every moment, at every place. This explained the rea-sons for al-Suhraward⁄’s strong emphasis on observing proper ådåb,worship rituals, dhikrsessions, fasting, paying zakåt, Qur\u0002ånicrecitation,ta‚awwufpractices,sabrprocedures, use of \u0002aql, andcomplete submission to the hierarchy of the Suhraward⁄order.This rigid structure had at least two purposes: first, it maintained adiscipline within his s≠f⁄order that did not allow any room for dis-obedience; second, al-Suhraward⁄’s strategy was designed to prepareSuhraward⁄s≠f⁄s for the moment of return to the divine, that specialtime when s≠f⁄s envision complete tranquillity. Once Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄’s religious beliefs and political activ-ities were established as a precedent for the Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄order,it is clear how successive Suhraward⁄s recollected, implemented,reconstructed, and interpreted Suhraward⁄ta‚awwufin anotherregion and time.

The Suhraward⁄silsilåexperienced important political and authority changes during thistime, especially under the rule of Muhammad ibn Tughluq whomurdered the shaikh al-s≠f⁄yyå, Shaikh Yusuf Hud, and tookcontrol of the s≠f⁄order. The loss of authority by Suhraward⁄shaikhs was in part due to their own internal conflicts of succes-sion and the political aspirations of dominating the khånaqåhbythe Khalji and Tughluq rulers. Unlike Shaikhs al-Suhraward⁄andZakariyyå, who successfully balanced the interests of both the s≠f⁄order and state politics, Shaikhs \u0001Ab≠l Fatª,\u0001Arif, and Hud werepolitically incapable of maintaining the s≠f⁄order’s independencefrom state domination and not compromising their ta‚awwufislam. The combination of inexperienced leadership on the part ofSuhraward⁄shaikhs and massive hegemonic state policies contrib-uted to their decline in Multan. However, for the most part theSuhraward⁄s did not sacrifice their ta‚awwufpractices to politicalactivities; those Suhraward⁄s who felt the s≠f⁄–state relationshipwas too intimate, like Shaikh Sayyid Ghaznav⁄and Shaikh Sadr al-d⁄n\u0001Arif, were able to negotiate political and religious authorityby controlling their khånaqåh.

For some have arguedthat the true differences lie in religious authorities negotiatingpublic approval, defending their authoritative status, and main-taining their position with their constituency.6On one level thesetheories may apply to any power struggle; however, there is littleevidence to support that scenario with the Suhraward⁄s in Multan.The Suhraward⁄yya were facing another theological challenge; thatis, how to enrich the faith of Muslims – s≠f⁄s or non-s≠f⁄s – withta‚awwuf,Qur\u0001ån,sunnå, and shar⁄\u0002åcombined as a total way ofdevotion and surrender to Allåh.Against the criticism of Multan’s\u0002ulamå\u0001, Shaikh Zakariyyåestablished himself as the distinguished khal⁄fåof Shaikh Shihåbal-d⁄n al-Suhraward⁄by claiming religious authority in s≠f⁄theol-ogy, philosophy, shar⁄\u0002å, and in the Islamic sciences. According toAm⁄r Sijz⁄, merchants from Iraq and Khurasan were attracted to the shaikh’s teachings in large numbers and it did not take long before a wide group of travelers from all corners of the Islamic world paid a visit to Zakariyyå.

However, in his documentary records Am⁄r Sijz⁄claims thatthese upper classes were not only followers of the shaikh, but alsocontributed to the khånaqåh’s expenses and to the shaikh’spersonal expenses. While Zakariyyå’s personal accounts are notextant, there is one particular event that shows how he was ableto assist the governor of Multan financially. It is reported thatduring a difficult economic recession in Multan, the governorrequested financial aid from Shaikh Zakariyyå; the shaikh res-ponded with a storehouse of grain and a pot of silver coins for thegovernor, stating that he wanted the governor to have money toaccompany the grain.8Emulating his predecessor, Shaikh Zakariyyå’s political allianceswere straightforward and open to all; he did not conceal his con-tacts with any government official. Shaikh Zakariyyå’s formalalliance with Sultån Shams al-d⁄n Iltutmish gave the sultån his per-sonal support when he annexed the provinces of Multan and Sindfor the Dehli Sultånate. The invasion of Chingaz, which weakenedQubacha, led him to write a letter inviting Iltutmish to defendMultan. After the annexation of Multan and Sind in 1228, Iltutmishinvited Shaikh Zakariyyåto Delhi to be an observer at legal proceedings against his s≠f⁄brother, Jalål al-d⁄n Tabr⁄z⁄.

Shaikh Zakariyyå’s position as a close advi-sor to Sultån Iltutmish enabled him to appoint his disciples to gov-ernment positions and expand his khånaqåhin Multan. During the1247 Mongol conflict with Suli Nuyin, Shaikh Zakariyyåsuccess-fully negotiated an important truce and peaceful resolutions withthe Mongol army representative, Målik Shams al-d⁄n.10Shaikh Baha\u0002al-d⁄n Zakariyyåhad seven sons and a very largenumber of disciples scattered all over Multan and Sind. His son,Shaikh Sadr al-d⁄n\u0001Arif (d. 1285), succeeded him as his khal⁄fåand as sajjadånash⁄n(“keeper of the prayer rug”) in Multan;whereas his primary disciple (mur⁄d), Sayyid Jalål al-d⁄n SurkhBukhår⁄(d. 1291) established a strong Suhraward⁄center in Ucch.Although Suhraward⁄disciples traveled beyond the Punjab andSind provinces, the center of their activities remained in Ucch andMultan.With the Suhraward⁄yya historically affiliating themselves withthe cultural elite, it is common to conclude that the Suhraward⁄yyasilsilåwas an affluent s≠f⁄order. This conclusion is not based onlyon records, since one needs to keep in mind the biases of scholarswho assume that the s≠f⁄way of life means the total withdrawalfrom the world (turk-i dunyå) and not earning any income. Theproblem with this narrow perspective is when the Suhraward⁄yyas≠f⁄order does not fit the definition, these s≠f⁄s automatically fallunder a category of government service s≠f⁄s (shughal kaam). Manycritics often emphasize the construction of the largest khånaqåhin Multan built for Shaikh Zakariyyåas a gift from the DelhiSultånate. One of the leading scholars of Indian s≠f⁄tradition,Khaliq Ahmad Nizami, asserts that Shaikh Zakariyyåwas “prob-ably the richest s≠f⁄shaikh of medieval India,” but no financialstatements or ledgers were preserved to support this claim.11Whatis left in the records are assertions by Jamal⁄stating that there wasan incredible amount of futuh(unsolicited charity) that “flowedinto his khånaqåh.”12Nizami measures the Suhraward⁄orderagainst the practices of the Chisht⁄s, which is valuable to a certainextent in comparing the two silsilås, but his partial statementsreflect a one-sided perspective.

And, again Jamal⁄’s account is used as evidence to illustratethat the Suhraward⁄s were wealthy s≠f⁄s who were more interestedin financial prosperity than the spiritual path. Nizami quotesJamal⁄’s text, “once a box of five hundred gold coins was foundmissing but he (Shaikh Zakariyyå) did not consider the loss to bea serious issue.”15Nizami, like other scholars, assumes there isdichotomous worldview of s≠f⁄s: if one group focuses on financesthen they are world-embracing people who do not fall in the cate-gory of serious minded spiritual seeking s≠f⁄s. However, if a groupof s≠f⁄s mirrors the intense spiritual practices of the Chisht⁄s,then these s≠f⁄s embody the complete spirit of ta‚awwufphilos-ophy. In cross-checking s≠f⁄sources, the pattern of selecting certainpassages and ignoring other accounts to prove an overexaggeratedpoint or to dismiss the validity of other sources is a problem whenone is illustrating shared features of s≠f⁄orders. For example, laterin Jamal⁄’s text the author highlights Shaikh Zakariyyå’s frequentbenevolent contributions to the poor and needy people of Multan.In Jamal⁄’s account, under the heading “On people of God,” theshaikh does not have miserly qualities as described by Nizami. Itis recorded accordingly:It is said that one day Shaikh Zakariyyåwas sitting in hiskhånaqåhand ordered his khad⁄m(s≠f⁄disciple or servant)to get the box of five thousand gold dinars. The khad⁄mwent to the treasury and searched everywhere but couldnot find the treasury box. He went humbly to the shaikhand informed him that the treasury box was nowhere tobe found.

Theses≠f⁄accounts about Suhraward⁄wealth were problematic withChisht⁄perspectives on money. This is why Jamal⁄made allegationsagainst that Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄order regarding their lack of distrib-uting wealth to the needy, because he was using the Chisht⁄practiceof distributing charity as the standard for s≠f⁄social work. The waypoor people were allowed to stay in the Chisht⁄jamå\u0002at khåna,and that a full-time kitchen was maintained for feeding the poor,was their idea of performing a particular social service.17Since theSuhraward⁄yyasilsilådid not fit this definition of social welfare,they are perceived as an order that did not provide social servicesto the larger community. However, Chisht⁄and Suhraward⁄sourcesrecord several occasions when the municipal government ofMultan, governors and administrators, would request ShaikhZakariyyåto assist in resolving their financial burden. The shaikh’sfinancial support not only helped the jobs of civil servants, butavoided a financial collapse of the city of Multan.18In anothersection, it is recorded that once the wål⁄of Multan borrowed somegrain from the shaikh, and when the grain was being removed from the granaries, pitchers full of silver coins were found hiddeninside it.19Shaikh Zakariyyå’s ability to spend his finances in areas of civilservice, municipal governance, and supporting the Suhraward⁄khånaqåhreflected, to some s≠f⁄chroniclers, a certain degree ofcontrolled spending. Even when Shaikh Zakariyyå’s son, Sadr al-d⁄n Arif, was kidnapped for ransom, s≠f⁄chroniclers focused onthe huge ransom that was paid. These accounts hardly praiseSuhraward⁄sililå’s achievements in spiritual teachings, establish-ment of educational institutions, or contributing to regional peace,but instead there is an overemphasis on Suhraward⁄shaikhsspending their personal finances.20In his final will and testament,the shaikh left each of his seven sons seven hundred thousand silvercoins.21AsShaikh al-Islåmfor the Delhi Sultånate, the leadingshaikh for the Suhraward⁄silsilå, and one of the most prominentpublic servants in Multan, it is likely that Shaikh Zakariyyå’swealth was an important factor in establishing the s≠f⁄order inMULTANÛSUHRAWARDÛTAÍAWWUFSPIRITUAL EXERCISES11111011111110111011101111111olio143"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Multan.

Shaikh Zakariyyådefended hisposition against critics by explaining that it was not so much thewealth, but its improper use that was detrimental to spiritualprogress. Opponents of Shaikh Zakariyyå’s ideas would often statethat, “Two opposites cannot meet at one single place.”27In onesituation, Shaikh Zakariyyåattended a court proceeding convenedby Sultån Iltutmish and was questioned by a well-known opponent,ShaikhÓam⁄d al-d⁄n Sawal⁄, about the sources from which heacquired his wealth. The shaikh’s response was: “Wealth is clearlya venomous serpent. But poison does not harm one who knows the antidote.” Again the critic attacked Shaikh Zakariyyåin frontof the sultån by asking, “Where is the necessity of keeping a dirtyvenomous creature and then depending on an antidote for safety.” Shaikh Zakariyyåimmediately replied by stating: “Yours≠f⁄has no beauty or attraction. Our s≠f⁄has immense beauty, andwealth is like a black dot averting the evil effect of jealousglances.”28Shaikh Zakariyyå’s response to Shaikh Sawal⁄’s line ofquestioning reflects Zakariyyå’s consistent need to defend him-self on the subject of accepting financial or land endowments. On the subject of Shaikh Zakariyyå’s views on wealth, there is aninteresting historiographical dichotomy in the writings of variouss≠f⁄hagiographers. For instance, among the well-known Chisht⁄hagiographers like Am⁄r Sijz⁄and M⁄r Kh≠rd, they consistentlyrecollected the “negative qualities or controversial issues” ofShaikh Zakariyyå.

The heart of a true believer (mu\u0001min) was like a pure soul and was illuminated by a shining light.”38Zakariyyåis building upon the lessons he learned from his predecessor by making theheart one of the main points of the Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄path. For him,and Shaikh al-Suhraward⁄, the heart is more than a bodily organthat pumps blood to various parts of the body; it is the main organfor spiritual cleansing, inner awareness, and the primary place fors≠f⁄s to understand the Creator’s presence. Zakariyyåquotes fromal-Suhraward⁄’s text, “for those who are not believers or arehypocrites, their hearts are made from a lowly substance andshrouded in a veil.”39The primary reason Shaikh Zakariyyåplaces a great deal ofemphasis on the heart is because the Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s are an orderthat is heavily rooted in the Qur\u0001ånandªad⁄thsof the Prophet.Primary Suhraward⁄texts,\u0002Awårif al-Ma\u0002årif,Khulasåt al-\u0002Årif⁄nandAl-Awård, strongly advocate that the ta‚awwufpath beginswith proper understanding and cleansing of the heart (†ahåra) andthis is proven with Qur\u0002ånic verses reminding believers that Godgave humankind a heart for knowing God. Every person was givenonly one heart and so one can either use it for or against God’swishes. Suhraward⁄ta‚awwufrepeats verses from the Qur\u0001ånthatremind believers of the constant presence of God in their hearts.For example, in s≠rå33: 51, “God knows what is in your hearts;God is All-Knowing” and again s≠rå8: 24, “Know that God standsbetween a man and his heart” are common quotations in the texts.Shaikh Zakariyyåtaught his disciples that the problems of humanweakness come when they fall to forgetfulness, but it is what is intheir hearts and intentions that matters to God. He quotes froms≠rå33: 5, “There is no fault in you if you make mistakes, but onlyin what your hearts premeditate.”40Shaikh Zakariyyåchooses aspecific verse from the Qur\u0001ånso that s≠f⁄s will understand that theta‚awwufjourney is a long arduous path that requires constantstruggle with purifying the heart in order to encounter God. Thecombination of continued spiritual exercises (dhikr), prayers (salåt)and pure intentions (niyåt) is a definite cure for the ills of the heartand to be on a ta‚awwufpath toward reuniting with God.41MULTANÛSUHRAWARDÛTAÍAWWUFSPIRITUAL EXERCISES11111011111110111011101111111olio149"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Shaikh Zakariyyåaffirms to his audience who are cynical of s≠f⁄religious exercises and beliefs that if they are truly concerned withactively living the life of the true message, then they shouldremember that the heart is not left alone but God inspires it.

To state that God knows the intentions of theheart could mean to the s≠f⁄that one should have a sense of fear ofGod’s knowledge of every single aspect of one’s being. Instead,Zakariyyåquotes from s≠rå4: 63, “God knows what is in theirhearts” to paint a picture where Allåh is waiting for the proper timeto be invited to the heart of the s≠f⁄to disclose His love to the seeker.The invitation comes from Allåh but the s≠f⁄seeker needs to pre-pare for the glorious moment by specific cleansing exercises or†ahåra. Especially in the case where Shaikh Zakariyyåmakes a refer-ence to the jugular vein, warid, from s≠rå50: 16, “We are nearer tohim than the jugular vein” is a reminder that God is present at alltimes around you and actively present within your body.44MULTANÛSUHRAWARDÛTAÍAWWUFSPIRITUAL EXERCISES111011110111011101111111lio150"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"For Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s, Shaikh Zakariyyå’s analysis of Qur\u0002ånicverses connected to the heart (qalb) is an important reminder thatthey are never left alone in this world. The world is not a place forintense ascetic practices where one is alienated from the commu-nity and neglectful of the shar⁄\u0002å. Instead, Shaikh Zakariyyå’steachings provoke his disciples to study the Qur\u0001ånclosely and toadhere to the essential teachings of shar⁄\u0002åby embodying the sunnåof the Prophet. The verses from the Qur\u0001ånwere divine illumina-tions to the Prophet who then recited them to the rest of thecommunity. These verses came from the mouth of the Prophet whosimultaneously contained all aspects of the spiritual message ashumanly possible. Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s are reminded that these versesreferring to the heart maintain an intimate closeness to God (uns)and instill a constant sense of s≠f⁄piety preparing for the momentof divine encounter.45In addition, any invitation by Allåh todisclose Himself into the hearts of s≠f⁄s means that piety must be practiced in everyday living. The requirements of adhering totheådåbof the order and the shaikh, following the sunnåof theProphet, and obeying the shar⁄\u0002å, are the training of outer piety. All aspects of outer pietistic expressions are meant to graduallydevelop the inner piety of love. The “outer love is connected to theinner heart” are often statements in Shaikhs al-Suhraward⁄’s andZakariyyå’s texts.46For Suhraward⁄s the heart is the beginning place to concentrateon purifying their inner essence or nafs.47The heart can be used asa weapon to be self-destructive or it can be trained to remem-ber God (dhikr). When a person decides to choose evil actions(\u0002ammån), then these actions directly affect the heart’s receptivityto future blessings and invitations from God. Shaikh Zakariyyåexpands on numerous Qur\u0002ånic references to hearts being sealed.For example, in s≠rå7: 101, “So God seals the hearts of the un-believers,” in s≠rå2: 7, “God has set a seal on their hearts andhearing.” According to Zakariyyå,verses that state “God has seta seal on their hearts” are not about a predestined life fixed byGod.48Moreover, the sealing of the heart is a consequence of one’sown choosing, of one’s mindful action, and of persistent violationof God’s wishes. To the Suhraward⁄shaikh,s≠rå3: 167 “Sayingwith their mouths that which never was in their hearts” is aQur\u0002ånic example of hearts that were affected from misguidedactions performed by dishonest intentions.49For Shaikh Zakariyyåthese Qur\u0002ånic verses do not convert the believer to an unbeliever without there being a possibility ofMULTANÛSUHRAWARDÛTAÍAWWUFSPIRITUAL EXERCISES11111011111110111011101111111olio151"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"returning to God’s path. On the contrary, one has the ability tocontribute to the development of the heart’s personality by bringingtogether the cognitive and spiritual dimensions of the human ex-perience.

A s≠f⁄seeker cannot bring about a change to theirta‚awwufor even expect spiritual progress if he or she does notunderstand the reasons behind the continual fault-making. TheseQur\u0002ånics≠rås, used by both al-Suhraward⁄and Zakariyyå,areindicative of their own concerns that Suhraward⁄s are theologicallygrounded in Allåh’s instructions for the return. The “word ofGod,” for them, is more than a book of divine guidance given tothe Prophet; there are inner instructional messages that aid the s≠f⁄seeker to reunion (ba†n al-Qur\u0001ån). On one hand, for MuslimsQur\u0002ånic references to the human body are metaphors for pre-serving an ethical and pious life. In some sections of the Qur\u0001ån,the human anatomy is treated as a functional element for the body,such as listening, hearing, weeping, and the circulation of blood.For the most part, human anatomy in the Qur\u0001ånis cited inconjunction with the faith of its believers and to ensure that thereis a complete understanding between the workings of their bodyand the message of the Qur\u0001ån.50The Suhraward⁄reading of theQur\u0001ån, like other s≠f⁄exegeses of the Qur\u0001ån, takes the surfacemeaning as a passage to another area of deeper subtext. The surfacetext and subtext are not sitting on a separate two-tiered ladder withno connection, but they are directly related to the s≠f⁄ta‚awwufpractice and spiritual enlightenment. To al-Suhraward⁄and Zakariyyå, there are necessary stagesrequired to counteract actions that are against the wishes of Godand to cleanse the inner self. First, one needs to begin with sincererepentance (tawba); and second, one needs to completely worktowards satisfactory inner cleansing (mutma\u0002⁄na). It is understoodthat the combination of both steps gradually purifies the heart,which nurtures a new inner compassion that prepares a place forAllåh. Shaikhs al-Suhraward⁄and Zakariyyåboth quote Qur\u0002ånics≠rå57: 22, “We set in the hearts of those who followed him tender-ness and mercy.” Suhraward⁄s≠f⁄s were instructed that remem-brance of Allåh is not an easy task because it requires individuals tomove from a spiritual understanding of compassion to practicalactions of daily mercy. For example, in s≠rå50: 37, “Surely in thatthere is a reminder to him who has a heart” illustrated to Suhraward⁄MULTANÛSUHRAWARDÛTAÍAWWUFSPIRITUAL EXERCISES111011110111011101111111lio152"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"s≠f⁄s that their pious hearts are granted forgiveness and in it thereare signs that lead to Allåh.51The ten principles outlined by Shaikh Zakariyyåwere meant fordisciples to understand the central teachings of the shaikh.

His ideas on training the heart to be invited by God and haveHis presence is supported by Qur\u0002ånic verses. Suhraward⁄s, likeother s≠f⁄thinkers, believed that the Qur\u0001ånhad an outer and innermeaning to each passage. The holy book needed to be both aninstructional spiritual text for the believer and also instill a deeperunderstanding of scripture in returning to Allåh. Against the back-ground of the controversy over the Suhraward⁄order’s acceptanceof worldly materials, the shaikh includes in his ten principles, “Notto be attached to anything excessively.” This conditional statementabout accepting materials is indicative of the shaikh’s sensitivity about keeping the s≠f⁄order in a world of moderation. ShaikhZakariyyå’s model of moderation reinforces for his disciples Suhra-ward⁄ta‚awwufand is associated with balancing life on earth.While the shaikh’s statements are not explicit, implicitly he isobviously linking himself with the lives of the Prophet, the com-panions of the Prophet and eminent s≠f⁄shaikhs of the past, whoalso advocated a life of moderation.Khulasåt al-\u0001Årif⁄nandAl-AwårdtextsShaikh Zakariyyå’s texts, Khulasåt al-\u0002Årif⁄nandAl-Awård,continue the tradition of teaching s≠f⁄disciples of proper ta‚awwufexercises.

In orderfor the s≠f⁄to be received with compassionate love from Allåh, theseeker should have all actions (\u0002a\u0002mål) and thoughts with completeconcentration on tawba. With each moment of life asking forforgiveness, Allåh will also forgive the s≠f⁄seeker.Fanå\u0001, or thestate of annihilating the self, can only be reached by understandingand implementing true tawba. Real repentance for the s≠f⁄seekerbrings on a new consciousness; it means loving others uncondi-tionally and striving for death.85Living as a true s≠f⁄(zaª⁄d): The true s≠f⁄seekers are those whomirror the lives of eminent Suhraward⁄shaikhs who tasted divinelove (dhawq). These elders were the ones who knew what it meantto direct all of their human concerns toward the reunion with God.They were not concerned with worldly and human relationships(tajr⁄d) nor were they interested in the acceptance of others. It wasGod they wanted to please in every moment of their lives. All theydesired was to return to the Creator. True s≠f⁄s were human exam-ples of the word “faqir,” i.e. they embraced poverty as if it wastheir only friend. One must remember the Prophet’s famous ªad⁄ththat stated “poverty is my pride.” S≠f⁄s who do not remember thisin their ta‚awwufare forgetful of the Prophet who leads a life asafaqir, the original s≠f⁄. To become a true s≠f⁄in every possibleway does not happen immediately; it takes a long time to under-stand each and every facet of ta‚awwufand then it takes anotherlifetime to act upon divine knowledge.86Complete trust in Allåh (tawak≠l): This trust is not the same typeof trust one finds in human relationships. Individuals live in asociety and everyday they depend on many elements to live life: forexample, they have friends, parents, employers, family, neighbors,etc. However, complete trust in God means that the s≠f⁄seeker’sheart is connected with Allåh.

The s≠f⁄is capableof detaching from any person or any thing that causes the separa-tion of this union.87Gratification (qanå\u0002åt): This ta‚awwufpractice is for s≠f⁄s whokeep their senses in tune with God’s benevolence. It means that thes≠f⁄seeker maintains at all times the importance of concentratingon God. In particular, the s≠f⁄should direct all energy to obtain-ing divine knowledge or ma\u0002rifaand divine love (muªabat). Forreceiving God’s gratification means that the s≠f⁄’s body and faithare working in unison. This step ensures that the s≠f⁄seeker doesnot get distracted from the ta‚awwufpath. For even a moment ofbeing lost in other pleasures means that the s≠f⁄was weak in beingattentive to God. One cannot display gratification toward Allåh ifyou yourself are not directed toward the Creator.88Purification (ghazalat): The ta‚awwufjourney is the path ofpurification. It is comprehensive, both inner and outer, since it isdedicated to meeting God (ªul≠l). No s≠f⁄will be able to reunitewith Allåh if his inner or outer worlds do not match the require-ments to move up the spiritual stations (maqåmåt) to meet Allåh.There are many books on the subject and Suhraward⁄ta‚awwufisbased on purification exercises set by the holy Prophet (s). Essen-tially, all purification exercises are designed to keep the Creator atthe center of focus. Relationships are not easy to maintain. But aspiritual quest toward Allåh is not difficult, because He is waitingfor the arrival of the s≠f⁄.89Attention (tawajo): For many s≠f⁄scholars and shaikhs, fullattention toward Allåh is understood as one of the most difficultta‚awwufspiritual exercises. This is due to the fact that the s≠f⁄needs to direct all human attention to nothing but Allåh’s presence.Tawajois the heart of ta‚awwuf; if the s≠f⁄cannot master this prac-tice then he will stay a novice (mubtadi\u0001) or remain in the humanrealm with ta‚awwuf(\u0002ålam an-nås≠t).

By being able to pay attention to thedemands of Allåh, whether loving or bitter, the s≠f⁄can meticu-lously develop himself for the challenges that are tied in withreunion.90This means that s≠f⁄s should work toward advancingtheir mystical knowledge (\u0002irfån) in order to be promoted in theMULTANÛSUHRAWARDÛTAÍAWWUFSPIRITUAL EXERCISES11111011111110111011101111111olio167"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"different rankings of the tradition (ahl at-ta‚awwuf).

Wemust keep in mind that sabris not something to talk about with yours≠f⁄guide, and it is crucial that s≠f⁄disciples truly practice it. Oncethey have tasted true patience, only then will the s≠f⁄reach reunion.Sabris extremely important in treating other human beings withcare and love; it is also critical in deserving God’s love in return.91Consent (razå): The s≠f⁄seeker must allow himself to depend onAllåh for all things, especially placing the destiny of the soul withGod. If the seeker desires to make contact with God’s oneness(waªdåt al-waj≠d), then the s≠f⁄needs to move forward towardthis encounter (ªul≠l) with complete consent. Allåh’s truth entailsmysterious meetings and personal challenges for the seeker. No s≠f⁄should think that this meeting could take place without full consentfrom Allåh. All meetings in the ta‚awwufjourney depend onAllåh’s consent.

There isno better way of having Allåh’s love in the heart of the s≠f⁄thanconstant passionate remembrance. For many s≠f⁄shaikhs havestated that those who are capable of performing dhikrall the timewith little sleep should then commit themselves to it.

It cleans the heart and mind from any impurities and replenishes the soul with Allåh’s wishes.It is when the heart changes from being an anatomical organ tobeing the source of nourishment for Allåh’s encounter (ªul≠l).If one believes that dhikris an insignificant spiritual exercise, thenthat person is incorrectly practicing dhikrand will not proceed in the ta‚awwufpath.
