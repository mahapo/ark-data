The comfort of wisdom cannot be measured,- its fruit is pure faith, service, and loving kindness. The author of this book exem-plified these traits with every gesture of his life, and his teaching continues to awaken these traits in those who seek with sincerity and wisdom. Death has a sudden sting to it. Life's dramas are stripped bare of their glitter. The only real consolation is in the wisdom that knows the One of infinite mercy and love, the One power we call God. The spontaneous discourses that comprise this book emanated from a man liberated from mind and desire who fully conquered ignorance. The mean-ings in these teachings can help provide the guidance which awakens the wisdom to really know. May each of us be blessed with the wisdom that knows the presence of God, may we overcome all fears of our own dying, be comforted in knowing that those who have gone before us are in the hands of the Most Merciful, and live each moment with the appreciation of its being a gift. May we live with hearts full of love and the courage to treat all lives with that love.

May each of us come to understand the magnitude of God's grace and realize the miracle of becoming true human beings. M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen (Ral.), may God's infinite love and blessings forever be poured upon him, ceased serving with his body on December 8, 1986. As a fully realized person, he lived that of which he spoke. He treated all lives as his own life and his own life proved the reality that a human being can be annihilated in God. For over forty years, of which we know, he lived in Sri Lanka, where, after having been discovered by pilgrims in the Kataragama forests, he served the wisdom that arises from intimacy with the Divine to people of all races, classes, and religions without distinction. In his ashram in Jaffna, I once observed tears fall from a deer's eyes while he sang a song,- I cannot put a limit on the community of lives which he serves. He spoke Tamil, an ancient Dravidian language of South Asia, and Tamil people call him acjnani, a sage who has attained divine luminous wisdom, and Muslims refer to him as a Sufi.1 Yet, he is beyond any labels, as a father to all lives and at the same time as the humblest of all people. He often referred to himself as a small ant man.2 He did many extraordinary things. For example, by himself he cleared nineteen acres of jungle and created a farm, demonstrating a model for success to very poor villag-ers, and then he gave the farm away to those who worked it. In 1971 he came to America to revive the remembrance of the true human station: \"Man lives within God,- God lives within man.3 God is man's secret,- man is God's secret. God is man's treasury,- man is God's treasury.\" Realizing this state of unity with God who is complete and infinite love4 is the purpose of our lives. Our human potential, that which he called true man, is"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Introduction xi eternal, formless, genderless, beyond race, religion, philoso-phy, and concepts of any kind. It is a plenitude of goodness beyond description. It is the very light of consciousness itself. Within the discovery of this subtle wondrous treasure (nutpamana porul) within oneself is the discovery of heaven. \"You will observe that within yourself that heaven exists. And it is within yourself that your evolutionary birth (pirappu) and your future birth is immanent, and it is such knowledge that you must strive to find out, to know and understand, and this is obligatory on you.\" M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Wisdom oj the Divine, Vol. 2, p. 65. There are prerequisites for entering into these profound experiences to which Bawa Muhaiyaddeen (Ral.) is beckon-ing. For example, he stated in no uncertain terms the precon-dition of universal love: \"Without first having established love for mankind, one cannot establish love of God.\"5 Why a book regarding death? It is a mystery of para-mount impact. Death helps explain the meaning of what we do in our lives. Its finality places our intentions, our thoughts, and our deeds in context. If we reflect on it thor-oughly, the significance of each moment becomes known. We can choose to live in a shallow manner. We can choose to live deeply with sincerity of purpose. We can choose to follow mind and desire,- we can choose to affirm God's presence through compassion, love, kindness, patience, and justice. When the profound value of each moment is mea-sured we can say \"Yes\" to life, affirming God's gift with our entire being. A heart complete with such gratitude can receive the wisdom that penetrates the veils of mystery. When a loved one passes on, we reflect on how their life will be evaluated by the One Judge. If we have any intelligence we will reflect on how our lives must now be analyzed, how we must begin the process of evaluating now. We can remember our own death or we can live pretending"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"xii To Die Before Death it will not happen. This book, is for those who want to see without fear, without veils, without illusions. It is for those who want to affirm God's beneficence and live with hearts of gratitude. This book is for those who want to awaken com-pletely and know the Lord. An aspect of living realization is to allow the attach-ment to everything that changes, everything that dies, to fall away in the absorption of love for God. First is the analysis of who one is and then the letting go, the surrender of all that does not exist eternally.6 This process reveals the imper-ishable aspect of our life, and it is beautiful beyond words and symbols, such as those found in scriptures, art, or even creation.7The kingdom of heaven is inside us and that is part of the \"good news\" each Prophet of God has brought us. When a person finds this incomparable and irresistible treasure, the brilliant beauty of the heart (aham) merges with the countenance8 of the splendor of God's glory (muham). This station of merging can be understood as Muhammad (Sal.).9 At this station the deep meaning of sacred language is revealed. Without in any way diminishing the value of the mercy of God found in the aspects of external guidance found in holy scriptures such as the Bible, Hindu Puranas, the Zend-Avesta, the Torah, and the Qur'an,'°and places of pilgrimage and worship, it is necessary to point out that Sufis use lan-guage in a unique and profoundly charged manner designed to awaken the inner infinite dimensions of life. In order to cause an awakening from the slumber of the limits of mind and desire, words are used to sharply prod us to higher levels of attainment. These are some of the author's previous explanations of key terms found in this book. Sufism: \"Sufism occurs when the T is destroyed\"...Sufis came even before the time of the Rasul (Sal.), at the time of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Introduction xiii Adam (A.S.). When the self has disappeared, when the mind and desire are dispelled, when the self is forgotten, when God is held as one's own life, one's body, when one's actions and behavior and qualities are as God's, that is what is called Sufi. And that state comes gradually, it grows gradually...A Sufi sees only the ideals of wisdom. He becomes the mir-ror.12 His heart becomes the mirror. So he does not see himself. Wisdom is what he sees. Audio cassette: M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, What is Sujism?, November 13, 1983.13 Islam: \"It is for Iman (Certitude) that we use the label Islam and not for anything else. To him in whom Certitude (/man-Faith) is founded with that supreme conviction of the all-pervading Oneness of God, the Supreme Creator, the Omniscient, the Eternal, the Self-Subsisting, without friend or supporter, the Master of all creation, the Lord (Allah), that He alone exists—to him who only sees Him and Him alone with the eye of the heart (Qalb) and is blinded to all other things, who is impervious to all other things, who is strengthened with the determination and radiance of that Certitude (Iman-Faith)...to whatsoever religion he may belong and whomsoever he may be, who possesses such a Qalb (Heart) in which such Certitude (/maw-Faith) is ingrained, it is he who is Islam. The term Islam is applicable only to that particular state of being, an innate quality...It is in essence, the Purest of the Pure—so much like a polished crystal which is free of even an atom of dirt—so much so, that within the radiant Purity of that Certitude (Iman) we find that faculty to see Him, as well as all that is of the Finite and Infinite (kullum yavum) in their Eternal Beauty. This is called Islam.\" M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Wisdom ojthe Divine, Vol. l,p. 72. \"Iman-Islam refers to that state of being when one never hurts nor kills the life of another in any way whatsoever, a state in which neither the hearts nor the lives of other beings"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xiv To Die Before Death are harmed.\" Wisdom oj the Divine, Vol. 3, p. 54. \"And every conceivable life form is a supreme expression of that essential Purity (Parisutbamana) which may also be described by an-other term, Islam,- and without which life in any physical vehicle is not manifest.\" (The term Islam in this sense does not refer to any particular religious group or creed.) M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Wisdom oj the Divine, Vol. 2, p. 9. Qur'an: The Qur'an has descended to that Effulgence of the Essence (Dhat), the Light onto the Light of the Es-sence (Dhat) which is called 'Muhammad'. M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Wisdom oj the Divine, Vol. 3, p. 57. Qur'an is a station of communion with God. See M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Wisdom oj the Divine, Vol. 3, p. 58. See also Golden Words oj a Suji Sheikh, p. 17. Ka'bah: \"[T]he real Ka'bah of the Almighty is the heart (cjalb) of man (insdn).\" M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Wisdom oj the Divine, Vol. 1, p. 10. \"...our Heart (cjalb) is the Ka'bah within us, the Station or Throne where God (Allah) Himself reposes. It is therefore the House of God (Allah) within us.

A burdened horse cannot run swiftly, and surely, it cannot win a race. And such is the difference, the distinction between Hayat or Life and Maut or Death. If we run our own race in this fashion, and eliminate the Ego' or the T factor during our life on earth we say that we have gained tangibly, and we may be said to have 'died before death'.\" M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Wisdom of the Divine, Vol. 1, pp. 40-41. For a person who has realized this Muhammad (Sal.), entered this Ka'bah, read this Quran, and died before death, who is there to be judged in this life or afterwards? What becomes of their existence? How do they express gratitude to and praise of God? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen (Ral.) demonstrated that for one who has realized God, there exists only selfless service. For this reason he lived as a slave to God, serving all lives as his own. This station of serving all lives with the divine qualities contains a secret. \"God is the King to the king, the Most Powerful to the powerful, and He is the Servant to His servants and the Slave to His slaves.\" Yet, Bawa Muhaiyaddeen (Ral.) used to call himself a student and he continually exhorted those around him to always remain students. I asked him one afternoon, \"How can you call yourself a student, having obtained the light of wisdom and being merged in God?\" He answered that if one threw a stone into a still pond the ripples would expand outward. He said that when a man"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xvi To Die Before Death throws his heart (cfalb) completely into the heart (cfalb) of God that learning is then from within the expanding reso-nance of God's compassion. At that moment, and such is the power of words of wisdom, 1 experienced the expansion of the Guide, the Master, seeking God within and through me, and the recog-nition that this seeking is occurring through each life, that all lives are seeking reunion with God. It is this questing deep in each heart and soul that causes the attraction to truth.14 A purpose of our birth, a purpose of creation, is to fulfill this seeking. Coming to know ourselves is fulfilling God's purpose. Two Ahddith are relevant: \"He who knows himself, knows his Lord\",- and, \"I (Allah) was a hidden treasure: I loved (hubb) to be known. Hence, I created the world so that I would be known.\" Our coming to truly understand the full dimensions of our humanity is fulfilling God's loving purpose. The Guide for this knowing is the Light that emerges from the qualities of goodness. This is called Nur Muhammad.15 That which explains the meanings and wonders in this awakened state is the Qutb. This knowing expands within love itself. As we awaken from the dream of ignorance the Light of Knowledge radiates. It radiates through each of our hearts as our wisdom dawns. It knows itself through us. This light and this axis of life are the resonance of God. God seeks God, God comes to know God. He is realizing Himself through each soul which comes to know itself. This is the purpose of this book, to help us know the most important part of our lives, who we really are, the essence of our being, the One Eternal Self, closer than our veins and the only power that sustains us. There is immeasurable peace in knowing our indivisible intimacy with God. Who will not know peace who knows the One of Unbounded Love? It is to know the blessing of this revela-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Introduction xvii tion.- \"O soul at peace, return to thy Lord, well pleased, well-pleasing! Enter thou among My servants! Enter thou My Paradise!\" Quran 89.27-30. The Qutb who guides this knowing cannot perish and his physical presence is not required for us to receive his guidance. A heart melted with caring for all lives as one's own is required. He is the intimate student within the heart. Allah is the Seeker seeking Himself. He is the Knower loving to be known. That will be experienced as eternal Light. Then you will know you do not die. Then you will know what is meant when we speak of the Prophets, the Qutb, Muhaiyaddeen, your true self and the author of this book. Then you will know the relationship each has with God, the perfect never-ending relationship of true love, forgiveness, mercy, kindness, and in surrender, bliss beyond description. Some may know of this. May all of us, with the grace of the beneficent One who has created us, who is blessing us with the beating of our hearts, the gift of this very next breath, may that One who creates, sustains, and absorbs our lives, grant us purity, lives of freedom, and lives of knowing and selfless service that bring comfort to all.

One who has known and realized this state of: Ldilaha, nothing other than God exists,- ill-Allabu, You alone are God. This is Sufi...One who loses himself into nothingness, where the state of the self does not exist, one who knows the station where only God remains as that Solitary Oneness that is God: this is the explanation of Sufi.\" Excerpts from a pamphlet published by and available from The Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship titled \"SUFI.\" 2. \"In all God's creation, I am a very, very small man.

From an interview with Robert Muller, Chancellor of the University of Peace and Former Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations, August 20, 1984 (tape available). Bawa Muhaiyaddeen (Ral.) clearly meant the most universal non-sectarian, all-encompassing love as he stated in the talk in discussing the necessity of ending religious pride, differences, and prejudice: \"Religions are the cause of mur-der, wars, evil, differences, and discrimination. If only man would reflect and say that religion is common to all. All four religions are from the same tree and all that is wanted is the taste of the fruit. It does not matter what name we call it. If man can realize this, there will be no war and no bitterness. My brother, this is the biggest problem that faces the world today. How many murders, how many wars, how many lives are lost in vain in battles of racial and religious differences?\" Also, note as a precondition of true faith the Haditb of Muhammad (Sal.): \"Not one of you will believe until he loves for his brother that which he loves for himself.\" For Bawa Muhaiyaddeen (Ral.) all real love should lead to God's selfless love. \"When we look at love, we see only His love.\" M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen (Ral.), Book oj God's Love, p. 18. 6. \"Everything is perishable except His Face.\" Qur'an 28:88,- \"All that dwells upon earth is perishing, yet still abides the Face of the Lord, majestic, splendid.\" Qur'an 55:26-27."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xx To Die Before Death 7. From the point of wisdom everything is a lesson, a metaphor, an example, God is the only reality. The body and all of creation itself is symbolic, a grand story containing and revealing the mystery of God's wonders such that He may become known. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen (Ral.) has ex-plained that the human form can be represented by 28 symbols (Acbaram in Tamil or the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet depending on which metaphor he is using) each one being an expression of the divine secret. Additionally, he has explained that anatomically, there is a piece of flesh, a node on the right side of the heart, next to the lung called the Bismin kai. It can also be understood as a mystical term referring to the imperishable within the perishable,- it repre-sents the indestructible \"place\" where faith is strengthened and where the dhikr, remembrance of God, is established. In esoteric symbology it is where Jibril (Angel Gabriel) (A.S.) is located, as each major angel is symbolically referred to as an organ. Within it is a point, a power, a place where light dwells. It is God's house where He has placed wisdom, the alij, the cjutbiyyat (the sixth level of consciousness which explains the truth of God), and everything else within it. On the Day of Questioning it is through this point that we are raised up. Clearly, there is a deep mystery in this term. 8. \"Withersoever you turn, there is the Face of God.\" Qur'an 2:115. His immanence is emphasized again in Qur'an, 50:16, \"We are nearer to him (man) than the jugular vein.\" 9. See M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Wisdom oj the Divine, Vol. 3, pp. 53, 55, 59 andM. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, The Guidebook to the True Secret oj the Heart, Vol. 1, p. 221. Clearly the term Muhammad in this context is referring to a state of wisdom. In the text of this book, To Die Before Death: The Suji Way of Life, the author uses the term with parallel meanings, multi-level meanings, sometimes referring only to the state"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Introduction xxi of realization and sometimes referring only to the temporal man. (Sal.) is the abbreviation of Sallallahu 'alaihi 10a sallam, God bless him and grant him peace. Sal. is placed after Muhammad in every instance in this book, in the interest of respect for one of the Holy Prophets of God and in an effort not to interject the editor's interpretation of which aspect the author intended each time the term is used. 10. \"[A]ll these scriptures contain the words of grace given by God to the prophets. That grace is light. If you look at these scriptures on the outside you will see only a book, nothing more. If you look inside the cover, you will find pages, letters, words, sentences, and stories. But if you look deep within, you will find Allah, the words of Allah, the duties of the prophets, the commandments, the power, and the light.\" M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Islam and World Peace, p. 38. 11. \"Noah said: 'O unbelievers, I am not I, I am dead and God is alive.' When the T is dead in the senses of man, The speaker, the hearer, the knower is God. When the T is not T, then the T is the breath of God. To challenge Him is a mistake.\" Jalaladeen Rumi's Mathnawi. In Genesis 5:24 it states that the Prophet Enoch \"walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.\" In much Sufi expression there are different stages otfana', annihilation, and it is often stated that after one is jana' (annihilated) God can make that person bacja' (remaining in permanence) in Himself, in a sense walking with God. Another understand-ing could be the distinction between a sponge being tossed into the ocean becoming saturated with the water and a glass"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"xxii To Die Before Death of water being tossed into the ocean and merging entirely. I believe it is the latter expression Bawa Muhaiyaddeen (Ral.) means regarding fand', since it was that state of inseparable absorption that we observed in his life. He proved the reality of this exalted state. 12. The relationship with a person who has become such a mirror is unique. Tremendous love and devotion is engendered. Yet, it is not for the mirror, the man, but for the beauty of God that they are able to reflect. Truly wise people are able to turn our attention toward God—the One Life within our very lives. 13. This audio tape is available through The Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship, Audio Department, 5820 Overbrook Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19131 as are most of the talks in this book. There are hundreds of discourses by the author available in audio casssette and many on video tape. 14. This attraction to the light of truth is one of the meanings of being a follower of Muhammad (Sal.). Living with pure faith in God can be understood as being in the tribe of Abraham (A.S.). May God's Peace be upon him. Knowing that the entire human family is one, arising from one mother and father is understanding our common heri-tage in Adam and Eve (A.S.). 15.

Just as the smoke and clouds can occlude the earth from seeing its connection to the sky and the sky from seeing its connection to the earth, the clouds of our mind and desire prevent us from seeing the connection between God and the hereafter (akbirah) and our life in this world. These clouds prevent us from seeing the connection that exists between God and us. We fail to see our life-connec-tion. These clouds are the four hundred trillion, ten thousand thoughts of our mind. These viruses, these cells, these clouds come and hide our connection to the future. They hide our connection to God. Religions, races, scriptures, philosophies, desires, attachments, blood ties, differences of colors, the many millions of thoughts, the thoughts of T and 'you', property, livestock, wealth, desire for earth, women, and gold, and the thoughts of my house, my land, my wealth— these are the countless clouds brought about by the mind.

Within each of us, there is a place where God lives. He lives in a place of truth. He dwells in a place within us where we nurture our wisdom, words, actions, and conduct within His qualities. His qualities, actions, and three thousand gracious attributes are within a tiny piece of flesh. Without our realizing it, they exist in a specific region of our heart (cjalb). God lives in that one place. The base desires rule over the rest of the body, but He rules over this divine kingdom. The rest of the body is ruled by cells, viruses, illusion (maya), darkness, and fascinations. Each of these catch hold of and devour the other. As each one is being destroyed, it shouts, \"My God.\" But the cell which is destroying it asks, \"Who is God?\" This is what happens when differences arise between two cells. The clouds of the mind are the cause of these things. A person who transcends his mind will see the sky and the earth as one. He will know their connection. Just as the sky is seen when there are no clouds, the connection between God and man will be clearly seen when the mind is removed. When man can either transcend, control, or conquer the thoughts of mind and desire, the clouds of life that hide his vision will move away. When the clouds clear, the sky and the earth are clearly seen, are they not? Similarly, God, the hereafter, this world, and the truth in this world will be seen by man.

He takes the earth, throws it back into the earth, it joins together, and there is no difference. He takes the earth and puts it into earth. He takes water and puts it into water. He takes the light of the sun and puts it back into light. He takes the cool colors of the moon and puts it into the moon. He takes something which glows in the dark and puts it into other things that glow in the dark. Luminous objects exist in the clouds, and as darkness descends they begin to glow. The moon has this ability also. When the light from the sky falls on the moon and clouds, they glow. That light is cool. The moon and sun both give light, but the sun's light is hot and causes heat and perspiration while the moon's light is cool. If the moon is thrown into the sun, it will lose its power. When the sun emerges, the moon loses its power. When the sun dispels the darkness, the moon loses its power, because its power exists only in darkness. It is the same way when God gives wisdom to a man. As soon as the perfectly pure qualities of wisdom come into him, the world loses its power. Illusion (maya) loses its power, the mind loses its power, attachments lose their power, and selfishness loses its power.

When God's vision, His thoughts, His focus, and the beautiful qualities of patience, contentment, surrender, and praise of God2 are established in man, the qualities of all the cells are changed.

When this kingdom of God is known within us, we realize the truth that God lives within us. We must under-stand this truth. This is the truth, but it can only be realized in the place where no differences are seen. God joins each thing to its appropriate section. He takes what is bad and places it in evil, and He takes what is good and places it in goodness. In this way, that which is bad will destroy other things that are bad. Each of these bad cells will destroy the other. But truth will not destroy anyone or anything. There-fore, truth has to be placed in truth, and good qualities have to be placed in good qualities. These things will cause other things to grow, whereas the bad things will only destroy. God created the world, and it is through the world that He will destroy the world. He created fire, and it is through fire that He will destroy fire. He created air, and it is through air that He will destroy air. He created water, and it is through water that He will destroy water. He will destroy the earth with the earth. He will ruin the sky with the sky. Each cell can destroy another cell.

The mountain of arrogance should be broken down, and the desire that says, \"This is mine, this is mine,\" should be beaten and removed.

He gave us all ninety-nine qualities and kept only one to Himself. He says, \"I gave man all My wealth, but man does not under-stand and comes to Me carrying the burdens of hell. There-fore, I will make that his destiny (nastb).\" So God says, \"You can return with the same things that you brought to Me.\" God places His signature saying, \"This is rightfully yours.\" We create heaven and hell for ourselves. Whatever aspect we develop becomes our own, and the resulting harm or benefits are created by us. Do we take the section of hell and try to destroy hell? No. We should push it aside and move on. There is no need to destroy it, just move on. If a dog comes to bite us, we just move on. We do not stop and try to bite the dog in return. Similarly, when evil follows us, we should tell it to go away and move on. We should not spend time with it. It will shout for a while and then leave.

But when Jibril (g) tried to collect the handful of earth from the four directions, the earth said to him, \"You are not meant to take earth from me, I swear on the name of Allah!\" Next the Angel Mlkall (g), the ruler of water, and then Israfll (g), the ruler of air, were sent to accomplish this task. Each time, the earth gave the same reply, and they, too, could not fulfill the task. Then God sent for the fourth angel, 'Izra'll @. 'Izra'll © had four heads, four faces. One was black and very, very dark, one was a face of fire, one was like milk, and one was a beautiful face of light which was always focused on God.

You must talk to Him. I am just following His orders. If you do not want me to take this earth, speak to Him.\" So saying, 'Izratl (g) collected the fistful of earth from the four directions and placed it at Karbala. The earth collected from the four corners is illusion (maya). It contains the elements of earth, fire, water, and air. God took these four elements, the four religions, the four steps, the four different kinds of prayers, and all the powers within them and compressed them into one handful of earth. In order to create man and to display the power of man, that fistful of earth was placed in the center point of the eighteen thousand universes called Karbala'. What is this place? It is the human body. The central battlefield of the eighteen thousand universes is the inner heart of man (cfalb). This is that one fistful of earth. Human beings have the five letters of earth, fire, water, air, and ether in their heart. They comprise the A-L-H-M-D.2 Dogs have only one letter of Allah's power on the top of their head, and except for that one letter, their entire bodies are impure, hell.

This is the place where destruction occurs, where profits are earned, where creations live their lives and where they die. This is the place where one kills others.

Having created this, God placed within it everything in its entirety—His secrets and His grace as well as satan and ignorance, light and heaven as well as darkness and hell. There is no fighting anywhere else. This is where all the battles occur. Every life, every creation, every man has to fight in this place. The body of man, like that of a dog, grows in desire. Just as a dog grows by eating dirt and feces, the human body also grows from disgusting things. A snake charmer, who was a wise man (munivar), once sang this song: Taking the earth from the pit of dirt, Mixing it with the blood in the womb, This body made by the Master Potter Will be of less use than a piece of a broken pot.

A broken piece of pot can at least be used for something, like heating and mixing herbal medicines, but this body does not even have that much use. \"So dance on, O snake! This body is of no use.\" This is what the wise man once sang. Everything is useless except for this central place where God has placed all His powers, grace, wealth, justice, and truth. But ghosts, demons, jinns, satans, illusion (maya), smells, desires, darkness, and lights also come to that place. Dogs, foxes, cats, mice, elephants, lions, tigers, rhinoceroses, bears, and other animals also come there. That is the battle-field. And when they come, you have to combat them with wisdom and grace, with faith, certitude, and determination (man). With God, stand as God, and fight against them. God has placed all the eighteen thousand universes as well as His secrets and mysteries within that central place. Having created it from that fistful of earth and having given it great value, God made it into His treasury. On one side there is the secret and on the other side is the treasury. If you examine it, you will discover that it is an endless secret, and if you go to take from it, it is a limitless treasury of God, a wealth beyond wealth. It is from this that God created man. The body that the Master Potter created is of less use than a broken piece of a pot, but that central place is a great secret. One will destroy you and the other will nourish you.

I will name you izra'fl, Yaman, the Angel of Death.\" \"Oh, God!\" izra'fl (g) cried out, \"I do not want this job. Everyone will scold me. 1 do not want this job.\" \"Why will they scold you?\" God asked. \"Because 1 will have to leave the child behind and take the mother, I will have to leave the mother and take the child, I will have to leave the wife and take the husband, and 1 will have to leave the older brother and take the younger brother.

I am the One who provides all of this. You should go there, look at his heart, and under-stand what he has within there. You should see what his illness is and what will be the cause of his death. Whatever he has sought is what will cause his death. \"If a snake ought to bite him, then you will take the form of a snake. If a bull ought to butt him, then you will take the form of a bull.

It is easy to take the lives of others, but think about how difficult it will be to bring your own life back to Me. That is the subtlest of mysteries.\" So spoke God to 'Izra'rl ©. We were created in this manner. The cause of our death is created by no one other than ourselves. We seek it out through our own actions. We are the ones who seek hell and we are the ones who seek heaven. It is we who seek the earth, the light, the falsehood, ignorance, or illusion {mayo). None of this is God's fault. Whatever we cultivate will either save us or lead to our death. This plan has been placed within us. If we do not understand this, then the very things we seek in our life will cause our death. If a person raises a snake by giving it milk, then one day, no matter how well he raised it, that snake will cause his death. If a person becomes absorbed in his passion for riding horses, then one day he will fall off the horse and die. If a person enjoys his life riding on a bull, then he will die from being butted by that same bull. If a person is constantly drinking alcohol, then alcohol will cause his death one day. A snake charmer who makes a snake dance now will one day die from that snake. A man who makes an elephant do work will be killed by that elephant. A person who worships demons will be killed by those demons. A person who worships satan will die by satan. A person who uses mantras to perform magic will die because of his mantras.

That Treasure has no arrogance, hastiness, or differ-ences of 'mine' and 'yours'. It does not earn anything for itself. It is One that never acts against its conscience. It is a treasury of justice, the One that inquires and dispenses justice. That is the God of perfection. It only gives and never receives. Everything else that a person creates or raises will behave differently. If he brings up a lion, he will have to feed it with flesh or it will devour him some day. If a person raises an elephant, he will have to feed it with fruits, otherwise it will trample him some day. If a person raises a tiger, he has to feed it with flesh. If he does not feed it, one day it will kill him. If a person raises a snake, he has to feed it with eggs, milk, or rats and still it will kill him. If a person raises a cat, he has to feed it with rats, dried fish, or meat, but the person's death can be caused by either the cat's breath, or its hair, or its saliva. His illness could develop from that. Simi-larly, if a person worships satan, offering him milk and fruits and performing ritual worship (pujds), that very same satan will come and kill him one day.

What they want to do is to somehow catch and devour all of God's creations. They like to suck blood, bodily secretions, and even the foul-smelling secretions from a corpse. They will also suck the blood out of a living being. Some demons will suck the semen out from a human being. Other demons are attracted to the smell of the blood and saliva and they take that. There are demons like this. If you were to raise a dog, for instance, no matter what type of food you may give it, when you touch it or carry it, what will it do? It will vigorously lick your mouth. Why does it place its tongue inside your mouth instead of licking you somewhere else? Because your saliva has germs in it and these germs have a foul smell, the smell of blood. The saliva also has the essence of all the food that you have eaten. These odors are appealing to the sensitive nose of a dog. As soon as the dog smells your mouth, it tries to lick it and taste your saliva. Similarly, whatever possessions of satan you carry in your mind, if you carry the bloody odors of 'mine' and yours', my wealth and your wealth, T and 'you', my house and your house, my race and your race, if your mind carries anything that is created out of the blood, the attachments, or the secretions, satan will perceive that smell. Satan will see those intentions, those qualities, and those blood ties. He will see the world (dunya) and those desires. When he sees these things, he will say, \"These are my possessions,\" and he will come and lick you vigorously. Just as the dog licks your mouth when it smells the odor, if satan detects that smell in you, he will come. He will come and lick if you have any anger, sin, falsehood, vengeance, selfishness, the thoughts of 'mine' and 'yours', my child and your child, or the attach-ments of blood ties. Even if we leave the world, if we had these things in our mind, satan will come and lick us.

It is to do this work that God created the Angel of Death.3 We are the ones who invite the Angel of Death.

This sign or allotted agreement belongs to earth, fire, water, air, and ether. This is the world.

In the same way, God's words, the ocean of 'ilm, of divine knowledge, are given for the freedom, the beauty, and the resplendence of the soul. The taste of that 'ilm is given in so many different ways, through speech, through the breath, and through actions. It nourishes the cage of the soul. It makes the soul young and beautiful and adorns the house in which the soul dwells. That beauty comes from that 'ilm and is seen in one's qualities and actions. We can see the proof of this in each child. We can see it in ourselves and in the other children around us. My love you, my children. You will realize the purity of the words in yourself and see the great value in yourself. That greatness and beauty, that form, and those qualities will be seen in you, yourself. When all the words of your Father come within you and shine, that beauty of your Father's words, actions, and conduct will come also into you. The qualities of patience, contentment, surrender to God, and giving all praise to God (sabiir, shakur, tawakkul 'alallah, al-hamdu lillab) will enter within you."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"44 To Die Before Death Allahu Akbar, God is Great. He is the Father to all of us. Is He not the One who is limitless grace? He gives grace. He is the One who gives His beneficence. He gives to all lives. For goodness He gives eight heavens, and for evil He opens the seven hells. Where each person will go is determined by what he sought in life. When we die, nothing will go with us except the good and the evil we have done. Not our race. Not our religion. Not our caste. There will be no inquiry as to what race we are, what religion we are, or what caste we are. Only one thing will be evident, whether we are male or female. That is all. When death comes, our form will change. It will be made of our qualities. If our qualities in the world were like those of a pig, we will take the form of a pig. If we had the qualities of a donkey, we will take the form, the face, of a donkey. If we lived with the qualities of a horse, a snake, or a dog while we were in this human body, then we will assume that form there. The form that we created through our qualities in this world is the form we are going to take after our bodies are claimed by the earth. It is of those forms that the questions will be asked. These forms of dogs, lions, tigers, and others have tongues hanging out that are one-and-a-half feet long. When the word \"Kurt! (Be!) Arise!\" comes, it is these corpses that are raised up. These are the forms you will see when they are raised up. The form each one takes will be according to the benefit each one sought, the property each one gathered, the capital each one earned, and the intentions each one had. When the day of inquiry comes, they do not ask about your caste. The questions that are asked will be, \"Who is your Rabb (Lord)? What is your tribe? To whose family do you belong?\" \"I am a child of Adam (g).

There will be no place for race, for this religion or that religion. The questions that are asked will be about the One who created us and about the one who was created, Adam, insan, mankind. This is what will be asked, and we have to answer these questions. We cannot say we belong to this group or that group. For everyone, God has placed in heaven Adam, Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Moses, David, Jesus (may the peace of God be upon them all), and finally Muhammad Mustafar-Rasiil <c3, the chosen Messenger. God has sent Idris, Isaac, Joseph, Jonah, Job, Jacob, Salihu, and Solomon (may the peace of God be upon them all). All were sent by the One God, and that One God gave them their stations. We are all one tribe—human beings. We may be black or white or yellow or brown, but we are all one race—human. What people do in the East, they also do in the West. They kiss the same way, they embrace the same way, they bear children the same way. They do exactly the same things. They eat the same way, although they may have different kinds of food, depending upon what is available in their country. The way a child wails there, a child wails here. \"Amo, oh moh! Mow, mee!\" A child makes the same sounds whether in the East or West. There, children sleep, wake up, 2. A further description of these angels and what transpires in the grave was given by M. R.

What we teach them after that in the schools and in other places is the temporary teachings of differences between races and religions. Before they were all one. If they were asked, \"Who is your God? What is your tribe, your family?\" they would have given these same answers, \"We are the children of Adam \\£y, we are of the family of Abraham (jf), and we are the followers of Muhammad ©.\" These are the three answers that will be given. All the prophets are included in this. These are the answers that come when Munkar and Naklr (g) ask the questions.

If this acceptance is complete and carried out in the right manner, that will in itself be the pathway to paradise."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Pathway to Paradise 55 That is the path that leads to heaven. The steadfastness of absolute faith (Man) is what opens the path. With certitude and determination, we must follow the path that opens before us; as we proceed on that path, we will realize His threefold function of creation, protection, and sustenance. If we reach the other shore, we will be sustained. If, when we experience difficulty on the way, we praise Him and focus our intention upon Him, we will be protected. If we cross over to the other shore, all our faults will be for-given and we will be given sustenance. The demons that come to kill us will be destroyed. Precious children, my love you. This is why the kalimah was given, so that we may accept Allah and His prophets and live together as one family. That is its meaning. It means that all praise belongs only to Him and there is no Lord other than God. All creations praise Him. The trees, vines, plants, leaves, and flowers give praise to God alone. The flowers give their fragrance to Him. The leaves perform tasbih, glorifying Him. All fruits with their tastes bow to Him in obeisance and receive even greater tastes. The leaves move in obeisance and acquire a beautiful sheen. The grasses bend in remembrance of God (dhikr) and receive long lives. Jeweled lights of my eyes, my love you. The five ele-ments of earth, fire, water, air, and ether will never be de-stroyed. These elements reappear continuously. We can make fire using a rock. There is fire in the rocks, there is fire in water, there is fire in air, fire in the body, fire in the sky and in the earth. Similarly, water also exists in each of these, as do air and earth. These connections change and the elements return over and over again. They disappear into the earth, and then they emerge from the earth. The water reappears, the air reappears, and the fire reappears. These elements are angels that praise God. Whatever appears in creation is manifested by way of these angels. This is the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"56 To Die Before Death nature of birth. They are born, they change, they are de-stroyed, and then they appear once again. Our base desires (nafs) and our five senses are like this, too. They are born as a result of desire, or as a result of attachments. This is what is called 'reincarnation'. Reincarna-tion applies only to the elements, the senses, and the base desires. What is born will die and what dies can be reborn, but this applies only to the elements, the senses, and desire, not to man. It does not apply to a true human being (insan). I One who is a true human being is born only once, and in the end disappears within God. He appears from and disappears in God. He never dies. True man comes as one of the six kinds of lives, the one that is never born and will never die. This is the soul, the light soul, and whether it goes or stays, it never dies nor is it ever born. It changes. For example, when you switch on the current, light emerges from a bulb. As soon as you switch the current off, the light returns to the battery. Does this mean the light is dead? The light is not dead. It is contained in the body, in the five elements. On the Day of Judgment the light of the soul reemerges. As soon as the body is in the grave, the light changes. It changes and leaves, returning to Allahu. The soul is never born and will never die. It has eternal life (hayat). It is the five elements that die. They will die and be reborn over and over again, assuming four hundred trillion, ten thousand kinds of forms. Earth, fire, water, air, and ether will continue to return but the soul is a light. Of the six kinds of lives, this is the sixth life, the life of a true human being. It is the grace of God and a resplendent light. It has neither birth nor death. Everything else will be born and eventually die. Each will come with a certain taste and when that taste changes it will leave. First a flower becomes an unripe fruit, then it ripens and becomes sweet or bitter or sour. An unripe fruit"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Pathway to Paradise 57 lasts only until it attains the flavor of a ripe fruit. Then it falls to the ground and its seeds grow again. This is the way with everything that appears, develops a taste, and then falls. Desire is like this. Desire enters each thing that is desired in the world, attains fulfillment, then dies and falls, only to reappear and start over again. The grass and the weeds are the same. There are also certain trees which when you cut them down will recover and grow again. But there are some trees that will not grow once they have been cut down. In the same way, any man who has cut the world away from himself will not live within the world. He will neither be born again nor will he grow again. But, the man who has not succeeded in cutting away the world and continues to be enmeshed in the five elements will live in the world and will return over and over and over again to this world. He will be born over and over again, one hundred and five million times, until finally he ends up as a worm in hell. We should reflect on this. We should let go of things that change, and instead change ourselves and progress from one level to the next. That is our work. If we want to travel by bus from the city to our home, we may have to change buses several times. Sometimes we may be able to find a direct bus,- at other times we will have to take several buses. Similarly, in our life we may have to change buses many times in order to reach our destination. However, some buses do go directly. If we can find a good sheikh, a man of wisdom, such a person will be like an express bus that will take us directly, without wasting time on the journey. If we do not find a man of wisdom, we may become caught in the many religions, scriptures, races, philosophies, and the differences of 'mine' and 'yours'. There are several such companies, and if we get on their buses, they will only take us part of the way, up to a certain point. They do not have a license to take us further. So we will have to"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"58 To Die Before Death find another bus from a different company which will take us to yet another point, and we will have to repeat this process over and over again. A bus that goes straight through is very rare, but such a one does exist. If we find such a bus, it will carry us directly across. To do this, you need a sheikh of good wisdom. You have to find such a sheikh. This does not mean that you should go searching for a person with titles and positions. He will not live with titles or honors. There are many, many people who like to give themselves titles such as amir or khatim and say that they are great. He has no such title. Titles are for the military. In armies around the world, the more people you kill the more medals you get. A person might have rows and rows of medals and hats, but what are they for, what do they represent? They are for the number of ships he has sunk, the number of planes he has destroyed, and the number of people he has killed. They are awarded for how many people he has killed, not for how many people he has helped. This is not the kind of title we should search for. Everyone seems to be seeking titles and fame, and it seems that the more sins and evil we commit, the more fame, respect, and titles we are given. Whereas, if we do something good, if we go along the path of goodness, all we get from the world is rejection. But the more the world pushes us away, the more we can withdraw from it, and as we with-draw more and more, we will find peace. Then we can proceed easily. Instead of having to push our way through a crowd slowly and with great difficulty, the crowd will push us away and we can find the path and proceed on our own. Then it will become easier for us to be free of the obstacles of the world and move on. We will not receive any titles. Instead people will continue beating on us. Those beatings will be the medals we receive from the world. When they"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Pathway to Paradise 59 beat us on our backs it gives us strength; it strengthens our backbone. And if this backbone, our certitude and faith, remains strong, we can proceed still further. We should proceed with faith and certitude, not with medals that are attained by killing others. If you trust in medals and wish to acquire great titles and honors, then you should join the army, the navy, or some such organization. Or you can claim to be the leader of a religion, a race, the leader of a philosophy, a king, a military commander, or the ruler of the world, of a city, and so on. If you do this, you will be given more and more titles. But on this path there are no titles. There is nothing here that will strangle us, only things that will set us free. If at some time titles do grab us, they will choke us until we cannot breathe and we will die. Before these titles tighten around us and kill us, we must find the things that will set us free so that we may proceed easily. This is the only way that we can proceed without difficulty. This is the path to the freedom of the soul. There-fore, all of us must proceed on this path, protecting ourselves while giving love to others, and protecting them as we would protect ourselves. We must proceed giving comfort to others, sharing our food with others, sharing our water with others, loving our neighbors as ourselves, and making all mankind our relatives, our brothers and sisters. We must proceed making everyone our loved ones and helping them become those who trust in God, and then go together on this path as the followers of God, as the representatives of God, as the children of the One Father. This is the medal God gives us. It is not really a medal but a model that God makes out of us, a beautiful example. If we can become that model, that will be the medal we earn from Him. We must live as the model of God's beautiful qualities,- we must live as the model of a truly realized human"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"60 To Die Before Death being (insan kamil). Such a person will be the most beautiful in the community of mankind. In his qualities, in his actions, his conduct, his disposition, his love, and his way of embrac-ing other lives, he will be more beautiful than any other being. The exaltedness of a person with such beauty is the medal that God gives. We must obtain that medal. And this is what we must give back, to Him. When our Father asks, \"What have you earned in life?\" we will say, \"This is what I have earned,\" and we will place the medal around His neck. We will take the medal from around our neck and put it on His neck. We must fashion this model within us. If, instead, we seek titles, we will be murderers and wrongdoers, and at one time we will be questioned for this. This sheikh will not come, that sayyid will not come—no one will come there. Who would come there? God's questions are going to come in the grave: \"Who is your Rabb, your Lord? Who is your God?\" \"Allah.\" We have to say, \"Allah.\" \"Who is your Prophet? Whose follower are you?\" \"I am a follower of Muhammad ©.\" \"What is your cjiblah?\" \"The Ka'bah\" \"To whose family do you belong?\" \"I am from the family of Abraham ©.\" \"Whose child are you?\" \"I am the child of Adam©.\" \"Who is your imam?\" \"The Qur'an is my imam. Truth is my imam.\" \"To what group do you belong? Who are your relatives?\" \"I belong to the group called the mu'mins, the ones who are pure, who accept God in purity. Those are the ones I call my relatives.\""},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Pathway to Paradise 61 We cannot mention any other name at that time. These are the questions you are going to be asked. \"As-salamu 'alaikum.\" These are the words we have to say in the grave. This is what they say Munkar and Naklr (g) will ask. I am not dead yet. 1 did not die, give the answers and come back. I died many times, but I came back without being involved with questions,- I came back without being ques-tioned. But questions might be asked at that time. They say, that this is how they will ask. I died,- they didn't ask me these questions. Therefore, because it is said that God said this, I am saying these words. They didn't ask me these questions. They didn't ask me. We have to believe this is true. God said we have to believe. 1 believe. I accept and believe. Therefore, no matter how many titles we have here, nothing will come of it. The truth is accepting His angels, His heavenly beings, accepting the prophets, accepting Him, accepting prayer, praying to He who is One, accepting the cfiblah, accepting the imam—the imam is Truth, the Qur'an. Like this, there will come a time when we have to say each word. But nothing else in the world will come. None of these titles will come. Therefore, what should we search for in this world? We need to search for wisdom and we need to find a father of wisdom. This is what the Rasiilullah <c3 has said. The Qur'an has been given into our own hands. Where is the Qur'an? The Qur'an is the form of man, the siiratul-insan. This form is made out of the twenty-eight Arabic letters, and this form of the Qur'an is referred to as Suratur-Rahman, Suratul-Fatibah, Siiratul-Qur'an, and Siirat Ya Sin. This Qur'an is here. It is the form (siirat) of man. God explains this Qur'an in 6,666 different ways and through countless words and abadith. The entire Qur'an is within the twenty-eight letters. Having provided all these explanations, God said that if all the water in the world was turned into ink and all the wood made into pens, and if you"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"62 To Die Before Death dipped the pens into the ink and wrote about the Quran, you still could not complete writing about it or discovering the entirety of its meaning. Therefore, this is not easy. One who is a human being (insan) is the Quran. Even if all the water in the world were turned into ink, it would be impossible to assess or describe the state of his mind, his wisdom, and his actions. It is impossible to describe it in totality, because he is the Qur'an. It cannot be assessed or evaluated. Within this form of the Qur'an, man has the beautiful radiant form of a perfected being (insan kamil). Only when man understands that inner form known as kamil and insan will he know what this Qur'an truly is. This Qur'an made of these twenty-eight letters was explained through the medium of 6,666 verses to the Rasulullah, the Messenger of God, Prophet Muhammad ©. Man was told, \"Investigate and analyze yourself through these verses. One who knows himself will know his Lord.\" God has said, \"If you know yourself, then you will never face defeat. You will see Me. Once you know yourself, no disaster will ever befall you in this world, or anywhere. You can see Me.\" One who knows himself will see his Leader. Allabu ta'dla Nayan (the Lone One who rules and sustains} exists as the Qur'an. It is to understand this that the verses (dyats) were sent down. God has praised the greatness of insan. In the divine realm of akhirab, God praised man in front of the angels. He placed a radiant light before them all and said, \"Look at this! Is there anyone among you who can accept this light?\" The brilliance of the light swallowed the lights of all the other beings. All the lights said, \"We cannot accept this light.

You alone, O God, can accept this light, not any of us.\" It is at this point that the earth came forward and said, \"I will accept this light.\""},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Pathway to Paradise 63 And God said, \"O earth, you have sought your own ruin. The earth accepted the light, the Qur'an, and that is why it is hidden by the five elements. It is because the earth accepted the light that the Qur'an lies within the body made of earth. The 6,666 explanations are within, and we must understand them. We must understand, \"Who is man? Who is God? What is the world? What is the hereafter (akhirabft What is heaven and what is hell? What is goodness and what is evil? What is right (khair) and what is wrong (sharrfi What is permissible (halal) and what is impermissible (haram)? What is the essence [dhai] and what are the manifestations (sifat)?\" We have come to this world to understand the explanations to these questions. All this is contained within our form (siirat). This is why the Rasul <c3 bas said that it is impossible to measure the depth of the Qur'an, because it is impossible to discover its entire content. If a man cannot even complete this, how can he finish learning the 6,666 inner explanations! In addition to this, Allah has given countless teachings (ahadtth). How can one finish learning these? The Rasul <c3 said, \"I could not have said anything that was not spoken by Allah. My tongue would not have spoken any word that Allah has not spoken. Whether by night or by day, I have not revealed anything that was not given by Allah.\" This is stated in the Qur'an and the ahadtth. Like this, if man transforms himself into the wealth of God (daulat), then what comes from his tongue will be the word of God. But if he transforms himself into the wealth of the earth, the dunya, then the words that come will be the words of the five elements. Those are the only words that will come. The words of man can have two meanings.

God, the unique, unparalleled One who rules and sustains (Allahu ta'ala), is the Great One. He is One of immeasurable grace and incomparable love. He has created man (insan) in a most exalted manner. But you have not understood that your form, your surat, is the Quran. Allah gave the meaning of this, but you have not understood that. This is why the Rasul © said, \"Go even unto China to learn divine knowledge ('ilm).\" If you really want to understand yourself, the Qur'an, and these explanations, find a man of wisdom, because it is only through such a man that you can realize the true value of this. It is through his wisdom that you can understand. A man of wisdom will not have any titles,- he will be hidden somewhere. He would have made himself silent. But a man who has no wisdom will brag and display his titles. A wise one, a true man, will be like a ripe fruit that is hidden by a cluster of leaves, out of sight. There will be some people like this in the world. But there are others who will act as though they know everything. They will parade around proclaiming their titles, \"I am an amir, I am an 'alim, I am a great one. I know everything.\" Some go on pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca. It is said that out of one million people who go on pilgrimage, only one will have truly fulfilled this duty. In times past the voice of God would come and announce the name of the one who had achieved this state of true bajj. Everyone would rush to pay their respects to that person, thinking, \"Maybe we will be blessed and attain peace if we can touch his feet or hands.\" But things are different in modern times. Now, in certain countries, even before going"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Pathway to Paradise 65 on pilgrimage, some people add the word \"Hajjiyar\" to their name and order their name plaques to be made before they return. Hajjiyar is the title for those who have been on hajj, and Hajji Hajjiyar is the title for those who have gone more than once. Even before they leave they ask for these plaques to be made for their door. Then they go on pilgrimage. While there, they use the time to arrange some business deals, and when they return they hang out their \"Hajjiyar\" signs. Many people go to Mecca to receive titles, but a man of wisdom will be different. For him the hajj is a journey to meet God, and when he goes the world will have died within him. He is not dead. The world is dead, his base desires (nafs) are dead, and his attachments are dead. He will make all the sins he has committed die by making supplication (du'a) to Allah. The fifth obligatory duty (jard) of Islam, hajj, or pilgrim-age, is for a person to put to death these things within him. To make all that he has done and all that he has gathered in his life die and to attain eternal life [haydX] is hajj. From then on he no longer possesses the world, the dunya. To go to Allah and receive the radiance of Allah's eternal life is hajj. To obtain the wealth of Allah (daulat) is hajj. To worship only Him, to love only Him, to praise only Him, and to sing only of Him is hajj, because in that state only Allah remains, the world no longer exists. Who is there that has performed that kind of hajj in this day? Nowadays the hajj is used to attain titles and to do business. That is all. But a man of wisdom does not search for titles. He makes the world die within himself, he makes the T die within him, and he makes desire die within him.

Anyone who attains this state will not face the ques-tioning and suffering in the grave. Why? Only as long as the world (dunya) is within him will he be questioned, but once the world dies within him there will be no questions for him. As long as the world is within him, he has death, but if he makes the world die, he has no death. He attains liberation. These are the benefits we must obtain.

Only when this state is formed within us will we earn the right to be the child of our Father. We will be free of all blemishes and evil, and goodness will come to us. Paradise and the world will both be heaven to us. The good qualities will dispel the darkness of the world, making this world heaven and the hereafter (akhirah) more precious.

May we search for the things that He wants us to seek, find them, take them to Him, and make our Father peaceful.

Precious jeweled lights of my eyes, if there is anything wrong, any fault, in what I have now spoken, please forgive me. If I have said anything without understanding, please forgive me. In truth, it is not humiliating to ask for forgive-ness, it is a sign of exaltedness in our life. To think, \"Oh, these are small people, why should I ask forgiveness from them,\" is not an agreeable way of thinking. Forgiveness is an exalted thing, an elevated thing, but its manner is always low and humble. Those things that are low in value, however, will always try to rise up and show you that they are high. But they have no real value. The more you make yourselves humble and ask for forgiveness, the more your true exaltedness is realized. Humility is a sign of exaltedness. The preface oilman-Islam is patience (sabiir), contentment and gratitude (shakiir), having trust in God (tawakkul), and praising Him for everything that happens to us, saying, \"Al-hamdu lillahl\" Therefore, without feeling shame, ask forgiveness whenever necessary. This will be good. Allah, the Lone One who rules and sustains (Allahu ta'ala Nayan) will protect you and me. He is the One who has forbearance. The world and its people do not have much patience.

Then the earth, fire, water, and air cover the anma in the form of flesh and skin. Question: What is the meaning of anma? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: Anma is the essence of the senses. It is the essence of the earth, fire, and water that form the body. In the first month, on the third day after conception, that power known as anma, the essence of the elements, joins with the embryo. Then the embryo starts to move. In the second month, the avi enters into this. That is the pure spirit, or vapor. By the end of the third month the soul is sent within that pure spirit and the embryo's movement increases. Within ninety days, slowly the pure spirit pushes the soul in from above and life becomes evident in the fetus. Thus, at the end of three months, three sections or forces are present—the spirit or essence of the elements, the pure spirit, and the soul. They are commonly spoken of as one thing, but these three are different from one another, and they each enter the embryo at a different time. First comes the essence of the elements, the anma; second comes the pure spirit, the avi, and third comes the soul, the light. By the third month the fetus has reached this point of growth, the soul has been pushed in by the pure spirit and brought down into the embryo. When a man dies these three leave in the same order 79"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"80 To Die Before Death that they came. First there will be a flutter, next a gasp, then the eyes will look up and drop down. These three forces of life leave in these three ways,- they do not leave the body at the same time. First, the essence of the elements, the anma, ceases functioning and dies, starting at the toes and continu-ing up to the heart. It is the anma dying that causes the rattle in the chest. The anma works through air, bile, and phlegm. The avi, the pure spirit, functions with the soul, or riih. When the body is dying, the heat and power of the pure spirit diminishes. First, the anma, or the essence of the ele-ments, dies,- then second, the avi diminishes. When the anma dies, the rattling sound lessens and only movement remains. Then movement lessens and only the heat of the avi remains. Next that heat of the pure spirit diminishes, and then finally the life, the light, the ruh, leaves. The person opens his eyes for a moment and in a flash the light, the life, is gone. So, there are three components of life in man. One is the power of the five elements called anma, the essence of the senses. It works through air, bile, and phlegm which are connected to the elements. The second is the avi, the pure spirit, which works in connection with the soul through heat. And the third is the soul itself, the ruh, which works through the light, the power. Question: Is the soul everywhere in the body or is it just in one place? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: It cannot be described. It is spread everywhere. All three operate everywhere in the body. You can estimate the magnitude or quantity of the anma and avi, but you cannot assess the station of the soul, ruh. One does not know where it dwells. Nobody knows what it is or where it is. The anma, or the essence of the elements, can be as-sessed. It works through air, bile, and phlegm.

Jibnl (g) can be ascertained as the avi and Adam (g) who is the anma can be ascertained, but the soul cannot. You cannot ascertain what it is. It is said that there are sixteen kinds of lives in the body. There is the earth life, fire life, water life, air life, and ether life. Then there is anma, the essence of the elements, avi, the pure vapor, and the soul, or light life. These are the eight heavens or eight stations. Only after understanding these eight can we know where the soul is. The soul has no shadow. God has no shadow, no form, no shape. God is a power. Only the Qutbiyyat Niir, the resplendence of divine wisdom, can understand and know this. It is a light. One light has to go and turn on the other light. When the light of the Qutbiyyat touches the light life, a magnetic power draws them into one another. It is at this point that the soul can be understood. There is a power that draws these two lights together. That is God. These three components are present in every life. The earth lives also have it, animals also have this, water lives have this, and air lives also have these three. Worms, birds, every life has these three sections. Question: Within which of these three are the base desires, the najs? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: They are connected to the anma. The anma is the essence of the body. From the body and the five elements come the base desires, the najs. The essence filtered from these elements is anma. The najs come from the five elements. Question: If one does not succeed in becoming a true man, what happens? Do the najs come back to this world, to the dunya? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: The najs and anma remain behind in the world.

The current is inside the battery, and when we press the switch the light comes on. When we turn the switch off the light goes off, the current returns into the battery and the light is no longer seen. When the switch was on, the current emerged and the light was seen. When the switch was turned off, the light could not be seen, nor the current that produces the light. But we could still see the battery, the bulb, the glass, and the switch. The soul is like this. God's power is within it and works within it. When God's power is switched on, the soul shines. When that power is switched off, the soul goes back to Him. You can still see the earth, the najs, the body, and whatever work the man did while alive, just as you can still see the light, the glass, the switch, the battery, the springs, and the bulb. All of these can be seen, but not the soul. The soul belongs to God. The current, the power that brings forth the light, is not seen, but it is there within the battery. Man can see all the sections of the body. They are all here, but the section of the soul, the riih, is operated by the switch that God has. When He puts it on, the soul comes into being. When He turns it off, the soul returns to Him. It goes back into Him. Everything else remains here, but that soul does not remain. It disappears in God. You cannot equate the light life to the other elemental lives,- they belong to the world and the soul belongs to God. The battery, the aluminum case, the bulb, the glass, the springs, the metal pieces, and the switch are things that are visible. The senses and what we see here are like these parts of the flashlight. It is within these that the soul is kept. When the switch is turned on, it comes. When the switch is turned off, it goes. It cannot be seen. It works through the means of the switch.

Its presence cannot be detected. Within certain places of the earth there is a magnetic current. If an object made of iron, like a knife or an ax, falls on such a spot, the current in the earth will pull on it and hold it fast. It will be stuck to the ground. When you pull on the object, it will not come loose. No one was even aware of the presence of that magnetic force in the earth until the iron object fell upon it. Similarly, the power of the soul is present within the body. When wisdom touches upon the soul, the soul will hold onto it. Then you will know that the soul exists. You will then know that the soul has a force similar to that in a magnet. The soul is spread in the body just like the magnetic power is spread throughout the earth.

On the outside you see its body trembling, and inside all its parts are quivering, every nerve, muscle, and tissue is twitching.

At that time, all the sins and evils you have committed, all the murders that you have committed, will be seen in front of you, like the hallucinations you have from LSD. If you have killed somebody, you will see that before you. If you have caused harm to somebody or if you have scolded somebody, that will come and stand before you.

You were merely a servant carrying out its commands. It is similar to somebody hiring another person to commit a murder. This inner body is the one who is the real culprit, the real murderer.

Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: There is a system, or set of rules, an agreement which governs the existence of whatever appears. This system is present in each embryo and determines when each living thing will blossom, function, and fade. Flowers and fruits are governed by this same system. This is what determines the size each fruit will attain and how long it will last. Likewise, there is an agreement as to how long a preg-nancy will last and how long it will take for an embryo to develop. This is what they say. Everything happens accord-ing to this agreement. For example, some flowers last for four days, some for three days, some for only one day, while others last for a week. There are fruits that ripen in three months and others that ripen in one month. Like that, each seed has a specific agreement. The plant that emerges functions in accordance with that destiny, and its flowers will fade and fall off at the destined time. How-ever, some plants might be beaten and blown by the wind or destroyed by fire or water. According to the seasons, they may be destroyed or broken in different ways. In the same way, man's seed might depart according to the time that is decreed by that agreement, or it might depart by an accident, or as a result of his own actions.

Or the blood may increase, or the fat in the body may become too much. Due to various reasons like this, an accident might occur. Just as flowers and fruits get beaten down by the wind or the rain or destroyed by the heat, man is also like a crop. The whole world is a farm. Creation, that is, whatever has appeared or manifested, is like a cultivated crop. Each cre-ation has an agreement. Some follow the agreement, while others are beaten by the five elements and fall before their time. This is what we call the time limit (kalam). Some seeds are fertilized at night and some seeds are formed in the day. Some flowers bloom by day and some bloom by night. Some flowers give off their fragrance in the daytime, while others smell nice in the night. Some creations can see well in the night, and others can see well in the daytime. There are some creations that can see well both in the daytime and in the night as long as there is some light. Humans can do this, and so can cats. There are, however, some cats that cannot see in the daylight but can see in the night. This is the way it is. There are different varieties in creation, each following the course of the agreement placed in the seed at the time of their appearance. When that agreement is over, then the fruit dies or falls. It either becomes ripe or is spoiled before it ripens. We say that the fruit fell; it was either beaten by the wind or it became ripe, matured, and fell. The same things happen to the physical body of man. However, the inner man is different. There is a portion within man that was never born and will never die. That is a power,- that is the soul. Once you understand this, you will not have any more questions. What happens to the body at the time of death is similar to a person being given chloroform before an opera-tion.

Question: When you know the body is going to die, what is the proper way to die? How do you die in a state of Man (absolute faith, certitude, and determination)? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen-. What dies is the body composed of the five elements: earth, fire, water, air, and ether. Originally the body wrapped around to form a covering for the soul, but now it just dissolves, goes back to the earth, and dissi-pates into its separate components. When it re-forms again, it takes another birth. Adam © is the earth, Mfka'Tl ® is water, 'Izra'Tl © is fire, Israfrl (g) is wind, and the mind is ether] When the body is laid in the ground, each of the elements absorbs what belongs to it. Earth absorbs the part of the body that is earth, water absorbs the water, fire absorbs the fire, and air absorbs the air. The mind which contains the base desires (nafs), the lights, and the glitters is taken by the ether. This is the way the elements take back what is due to them. This is an ongoing process. The elements are separated and absorbed, and then they roll together again to form another body. Then when that body dies, this process is repeated. The body takes form in the elements, is nourished by the ele-ments, and is finally absorbed by the elements. ; Question: What I guess I'm really asking is how do you escape? You know this is going to happen so you have to escape the whole process. 93"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"94 To Die Before Death Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: The elements of the body do not die. They have eternal life, they are immortal. Illusion, or maya, never dies. The senses never die, they also live forever. They transform themselves into the elements and then unite once again to take form as another body. This process is ongoing. This is what happens with the body, but the soul, wisdom, and light are connected to God. They are His property. When the Angel of Death comes, it is as if the person is given chloroform. He is not dead. He can still hear all the sounds that the ears normally hear, the perceptions of feeling and awareness are still present, and the brain is still working. All this continues to function, and the body is aware of what is happening, but the person cannot speak. All the demons and the ghosts will be shouting and crying. All his blood ties who died earlier will call him saying, \"Come, come.\" The father and mother will come. All the spirits of his blood attachments will gather there and call him, \"My son, my master, my father.\" All the connections that were created out of the earth will be around him. The riches, earth, and gold from this world will come. He will be aware of all these things, but he will not be able to open his mouth and speak. He cannot open his eyes and see, due to the effect of the chloroform. Translator: So the body has not died yet? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: No, it is under anesthesia. It stays alive until the questioning in the grave is over. Question: Does Bawa mean by chloroform that they have embalmed him or something? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: No. It is like being under chloroform, due to the injection from the Angel of Death. Until the time he was given that injection, he was shouting, \"Oh, my property!

When the chloroform is given, all those senses are driven out and start dancing outside him. The blood ties and all the functions of the body which were conducted by the five elements stand outside the body and shout. All the things that cry about 'my property', 'my relations' have stopped, and they are now standing around wailing and shouting. The only things that remain within are the seven levels of consciousness: feeling, awareness, intellect, judgment, subtle wisdom, divine ana-lytic wisdom, and divine luminous wisdom or light. They watch the senses that are outside and hear everything that is happening. But the person cannot speak. The powers of speech are lost. Only the light of wisdom still lives. Like this, when the person is taken to the graveyard, he is aware of all that is happening. Once the burial is com-pleted, the two angels, Munkar and Nakfr (g), will come for the questioning. They will say to the person in the grave, \"Wake up!\" The chloroform lasts until this point. Then the person gets up and the questioning begins. The twenty-eight letters of the alphabet in the body speak. Each letter is asked, \"What did you do? What did you do?\" The soul remains in the body until this questioning. Satan created the fire of cremation in order to send a person to hell even before this questioning can happen. Once the body is burned, the questioning is no longer possible. When the body is cremated, it begins to melt. It remains still until the fire reaches the level of the chest, and at that point, the soul makes the body sit up abruptly. That is why it is the practice to place logs on top of the body during cremation to prevent this from happening. When the fire reaches the chest, the soul leaves the body.

This is a temple of God which is formed as an atom within an atom, heart within the heart, the cjalb within the cjalb. It is within what is within. It cannot be destroyed by the five elements. You must understand this. It can never be destroyed. Maya, or illusion, is also something that can never be destroyed. Like the soul, it never dies. Maya is that which belongs to the next birth. It keeps on changing and re-forming and appearing over and over again. But the soul is not something that comes or goes. Once it has become the light, it is the Light.

Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: The function he serves is that of destiny (nasib), that which was destined by God. I have seen him with my own eyes. At one time, two of us were flying on a certain mission to look at something. After a while, I left the other person behind and proceeded alone. Then I saw the Angel 'Izra'fl (g) seated on a dais, which according to my estimate was two hundred and fifty miles high. I could not see his feet. He was very, very tall. Nearby, there was a tree with leaves in clusters of five or six. All the leaves were shining like stars, and the entire place was glowing with their light. A little further on was another place for judgment. As each soul [tub] came along, it was questioned and then some were allowed to go one way and others were directed to go the other way. One group was being led up a very high path to heaven, toward the throne of God {'arsh). The tree was in close proximity to that throne ('arsh). The group going the other way was being sent to hell,- they were proceeding downward. This is one of the wonders I saw. I have described it in the book of mystical experiences.

When 1 looked at him, 1 found that the whole world was within his eyes, every life was within his eyes. 1 could not see the world anywhere else except within his eyes. When I looked at the face of milk, it was a beautiful face. I looked at the face of fire, and it was burning like fire. The black face was very dark, and the fourth face was turned toward the tree. As the souls [ruh) came toward him, he stretched his hand out and grabbed them. There was a huge mountain of souls. I heard some people scream. 'Izra'il (g) was looking at them with his gaze of fire. They were shouting, \"Please don't burn me. It is like fire.\" Others were screaming, \"Oh, they are cutting me up. They are killing me.\" Then I spoke to the Angel of Death. He said, \"Look at my eyes. The whole world is within my eyes. 1 do the work that Allah has given me,- this is why I am called 'Izra'il. I do only the work given to me by Allah. There is no soul [ruh) that can escape my eyes, even if it is hiding under a stone. No one can hide from me. They cannot live any place where I cannot see.\" Then I saw some people with horns on their heads moving about, and their eyes were also like those of 'Izra'il (g). They were grabbing people and pulling them across to a big forest, to the place of judgment where the questioning would take place. There was a platform about five feet high, with a veil, and there was a resplendent light coming through that veil. Someone was there.

The same light that shines here, also shines within each creation. The light represents the light of each individual's soul. Within each person it is the soul, and here it is a light. As soon as a light fades here on this tree, it means that person's allotted food and water (rizcj) in the world is over, and it is time for me to bring him back. So I stretch my hand in his direction and summon him here. 1 have to be looking at this tree every moment to see when a light stops blinking. That is why 1 must keep a constant watch on this tree. \"The souls of jinns are captured by my face of fire. Evil beings are captured with my black face. Those good people who have the benevolence of God, His thoughts, and His remembrance, I receive with my face of milk.

Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: The day of destruction and cjiyamah, the day of reckoning, are both within ourselves. Each man creates his own time of destruction. Each time a man does not use the seed that is within him in the proper manner and instead uses it in a destructive manner, then that is his time of destruction. The way in which a man completes his life determines his qiyamah. His death is his cjiyamah. People talk about some other Day of Reckoning, Qiyamah. They have been saying that for the last fifty million years. It is not like that. Births and deaths have been going on and on all that time. Man's day of reckoning is at the end of his own life. That is the day when the questions will be asked and accounts will be taken. The day each individual dies is his own day of reckoning. He will be questioned and then depending on the answers, the appropriate punishment will be decided. Qiyamah is a word used commonly in everyday speech. The Quran mentions the word cjiyamah, or the day of cjiyamah, and people could interpret it in many ways. How-ever, when the Prophet Muhammad <c3 was asked, \"When will we meet you again?\" he replied, \"You can meet me near the bridge called Siratul-MustacjTm, the Straight Path,- you can meet me at the foot of the scale of justice. This is the scale that weighs good and evil. 1 will stand at the foot of this 103"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"104 To Die Before Death scale, at the spot where good and evil are weighed. This is where your cfiydmah will take place, and you can see me there. When you are able to distinguish between right and wrong, taking only what is right, you will see me at this place, the place from which you understand the difference between good and evil and separate them.\" This is what it means. Your good and evil are not weighed at some distant place where you go after you die. You, yourself, must use your wisdom to separate right from wrong, and at this place where you weigh good and evil with wisdom, you will see the truth. That truth is the scale. It is the Rasul ©. The Rasul ©, the truth, is the pointer on the scale. That is why he said he could be seen there. When the Prophet © was about to leave the world, to be transformed, his followers asked him, \"When will the world end?\" He answered by raising one finger. People interpreted this in various ways. Some said it meant one crore, or ten million years. Others said it meant one yuc)a, or fifty million years. Some said it was one lakh, or one hundred thousand years. Some said it was one thousand years, and others said one hundred years. Still others said it meant one month, one week, or one day. But Abu Bakr @ said, \"Allah is the only One who knows.\" He raised one finger to show that there is only One who knows—that One is Allah. All the calculations the others had made up until that time were brushed away, and the explanation based on 'the One' was accepted. Similarly, the meanings and explanations of the chap-ters (surats) in the Quran that were sent down from the wealth of Allah (daulat) can be known only by one who has that same wealth. Only he can understand their true mean-ing.

If I had gone there and seen it, I would know and I could tell you about it. But, I have not gone there yet, so I can only repeat what has been said. I have already described hell in TJ« Ten Mystical Experi-ettces.' How can I tell you what it is like? 1 did see hell with my own eyes. When I was flying over, I could see each one of the seven hells.

In hell there is a huge roller, like the ones used to flatten stones on paved roads. This roller is two hundred and fifty miles long and the beam by which it is dragged is also the same length. Someone stands next to the beam with a fairly long whip in his hand and forces the people to lie on the ground, like stones strewn on a path. Two hundred to 1.

Then all those who were crushed take form again and are made to lie down and be crushed once more. Then they are heaped onto a fire burning as high as a mountain. I have seen this. I saw different people there: a man who butchered goats, a man who butchered cattle, and a man who weighed and sold the flesh of animals. I asked them what they had done, and they told me.

If we can free ourselves even a little from this worldly hell, we will be freed from that hell. Question: Bawa, suppose one happens to go to hell, can one escape after that? In other words, does one get another chance to escape from hell? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: The point is, my little brother, why are you going to hell? Questioner: Well, in case I slip up or make a mistake. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: If you make a mistake? Consider a gold sovereign. The coin is stamped with a symbol which denotes its purity and value. No one can dispute that. It is pure gold and is worth a great deal. It can be sold for one hundred and forty rupees. Now, if you take this coin to a goldsmith, he might say, \"Well, if you melt this down and make it into a piece of jewelry, it will be much nicer.\" But to do this, he has to add a little copper to make it malleable.

Although it is a beautiful ornament, it can no longer be said to be pure. It has changed. Similarly, it has been said, \"If we miss our opportunity in this life, when will we get another chance? If we miss our opportunity in this birth, when will we get another birth, O Lord?\" This is the human birth, in which we have divine analytic wisdom, the sixth state of consciousness (pahuth arivu). This wisdom enables us to discriminate between what is right and what is wrong. It has been said, \"To be born as a human being with wisdom is an exalted and rare state. To be born as a male is even more rare. And to be born with eyes that see well and ears that hear well is even more rare. It is still rarer to be born a human being with divine qualities (manu-Isan). Even more rare is to be born as a wise person, rarer still is to be born as an illumined poet, and rarer than that is to be born as a king. Rarest of all is to be born as a perfected human being (insan kamil), a true wise man (gnani).\" If a human life dies and is reborn, even once, its value decreases. The sixth level of consciousness and the ability to discriminate is reduced, and in the next birth one will have five levels of consciousness. There are some learned people who only have these five levels. They have studied the religious texts (puranas), and they have Bachelor's or Master's degrees.

They have the powers of earth and have learned about the earth's four hundred trillion, ten thousand energies. They have also studied about the powers of the air and the powers of the base desires [najs) that exist within it. They have studied about creation and the powers of water. They have the fire of anger, arrogance, pride, vengeance, and jealousy. They have held on to the glitters and colors of the moon, the sun, the religions, and the races. These are what they have understood with the five levels of consciousness, so these are the energies (shaktis) that work for them. They do not have the divine analytic wisdom which would enable them to discern and discriminate and realize that there is nothing other than God. They do not realize that God is beyond birth, death, destruction, and appear-ance, that He lacks nothing and has no form, that He is the only One, the One Treasure that exists within forever. They do not realize any of this. They do not have the wisdom that analyzes and explains. However much you may preach to such a person, however much you may teach him, his heart is locked. He does not have the wisdom that can discern and absorb. Like an echo, the sound goes toward him and returns without entering him. The words return without being absorbed, because he is lacking divine analytic wisdom. Even if he is in hell, he does not see it for what it is,- he can only perceive it in accordance with his fifth level of wisdom.

It does not have lust. It does not have anger. It has no hunger, disease, birth, or death. It has no differences of the T and the 'you'. It has none of these, it is in the same state as God.

Those signs are the ram (Aries), bow and arrow (Sagittarius), balance (Libra), virgin (Virgo), scorpion (Scorpio), lion (Leo), or bull (Taurus). But astrology does not apply to a true human being. Question: Bawa, are you saying that you know who is at what level, that you know who has come back with six levels of consciousness, five levels, four levels, and so forth? Do you know who each one is? Can we know this? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: For this you need those eyes and that wisdom,- you need the eye of wisdom. Now, I know.

Bawa has said that if we do not make it in this life, in our first birth, then we will be reborn. And as far as I understand the Islamic scriptures, we die, we go to the grave, we are questioned there, and we wait until the final Day of Judgment when the trumpet is blown. So when is it decided upon that we have to go back to the world and be reborn with lower and lower levels of wisdom, until we finally end up in hell as a worm? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: Yes, I have talked about this a lot. This is one thing you have to understand. It is while you are living in the world, in this very birth, that you undergo all these rebirths—about 105 million rebirths. Every day, you are being reborn. Every new quality is indeed a rebirth. Every new action is a rebirth. You undergo all these births in this very lifetime. Look at a person's face, for example. Sometimes his face is a very angry face, like a tiger's. At another time it is like the dark face of satan. At yet another time a face that is broad and open suddenly becomes contracted and pinched. So many faces develop and appear within the one face. The heart and the face reveal the person's state, whether it be happiness, sorrow, anger, vengeance, and all the other states that a person experiences. Each of these is a form that the person has taken at a particular time. In this way, without his even being aware of it, the person is reborn in different forms within his lifetime. This happens all the time, whether 115"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"116 To Die Before Death he is sleeping or awake, whether he is thinking or dreaming. Every action performed in this birth is either good or evil, right or wrong. When we go to our grave, we will be questioned, and an account of our actions will be taken. Those who did good will receive what is good and those who did evil will receive their punishment. Each person will receive what he has earned. On the Day of Questioning (Qiyamah), the trumpet will be blown by Israffl (g), the angel of air, and everyone will be woken up. When that air is blown by Israffl (g), the person will rise up in the specific form that he has been reborn in according to the changes in his qualities and actions in this world. It is only then that this new form is revealed. He may have the form of a dog, a cat, or a rat, or some other being, and it is in this form that he will finally be asked the ques-tions and have to account for his actions. What is this final questioning? It is an account of everything we take with us. What is heaven? Heaven is what we take with us. What is goodness? Goodness is what we take with us. For every small act of goodness that we take with us, one thousand or even ten thousand beautiful things will be spread out before us there. A single good act is made into so many thousands of acts of goodness. Whatever we have done in this world, good or bad, is magnified and stored for us. Heaven is the place where all our good actions and good thoughts have been multiplied thousands and tens of thousands of times and reserved for us. Precious child, what is the meaning of the saying, \"We must die before death?\" It means that we must make all the evil qualities, all the qualities of satan within us, die before our death. If those qualities die, then the world within us dies. And if the world within us dies, then all the sins, ghosts, demons, and satans contained within it also die.

If all the evil qualities die within us, then we die before death and only Allah's qualities, actions, and conduct will remain. Then there will be no death for us. We will have attained eternal life (bayat). If we attain eternal life, where will we live? We will live in heaven, in God's kingdom. This is how it is, my child. When that day comes, such a person will no longer be in the grave. He will be in heaven, because any place he is will be heaven. He has no death. Wherever he lives, it will be a palace. On the earth he lives in a palace, and in heaven he lives in a palace. When he is buried, he is in a palace. He has a palace on the outside and one on the inside. There is a saying by Tamil wise men (jnanis), \"If I fail in this birth, O God, when will I ever get another chance?\" The explanation of this saying is as follows: This birth is our only birth as a human being with divine analytic wisdom (pahuth arivu). And if we do not succeed in our quest this time, when will we ever obtain such a birth again? Never. If we don't learn what we have come here to learn, we will be subject to many rebirths. Our qualities and wisdom will change. Our actions will change. Our form will change. This is our only birth as a human being, and if we do not change and attain the state of eternal life by dying before death, then we will not obtain God's grace. But if we miss our opportunity in this birth, then all the qualities within divine analytic wisdom will leave us, and all the animal, demonic, and satanic quali-ties will enter us. We will be subject to anger, hastiness, and hatred, and we will undergo many difficulties. The qualities of jealousy and vengeance and the divisive qualities of 'I and you', 'my religion and your religion' will take hold and lead us to some other place. They will change us.

Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: God has said that in the primal begin-ning (athi) the earth was extremely valuable,- everything was contained within it. I have given many explanations about this. At the time of the primal beginning God had not yet created man. He had created earth, fire, water, air, and ether, each with their own inherent value. Because of this, each element became proud. Even though God had created them, each element vainly boasted, \"I am the greatest! Nothing can be compared to me!\" Then God said, \"I must join these five elements to-gether to take away their vanity, and I will use the light of the Niir Muhammad1 to do this. I will create all lives using equal portions of these five elements, bringing them to a state of unity and destroying their pride.\" Having created the jinns, the fairies, the heavenly beings, the earth, the sky, and so on, God then brought forth the light of Niir Muhammad from within Himself.

They will be common to all lives, and they will provide the basis and support for the bodies of all lives. But first, I have to make them united. I must destroy their pride.\" In order to create this unity God brought forth the light known as Nur Muhammad from within Himself and instructed this light to go to each element and make it recite the kalimah—La ilaha ill-Allahu Muhammadur-Rasulullah.There is nothing other than You, O God.

This is called his destiny (nasib). Man has this destiny because his sustenance (Viz*/), his allotted portion, was created before he came into the world. After creating all other lives, God set about creating man, and He intended to make man the most exalted and wisest of all His creations. He gave three states of conscious-ness (feeling, awareness, and intellect) to all other lives, but to man He gave four additional levels of consciousness: judgment, subtle wisdom, divine analytic wisdom, and divine luminous wisdom. These were given to man so that he could be the father, the sheikh, the sayyid, the nurturer, and God's vice-regent to all creations. Man was given the qualities that would enable him to give comfort and peace to others. God called for Angel Jibrfl (g) and said, \"Go to the four corners, the four directions of the world. Collect earth from each corner until you have one fistful of earth and bring it back to me.\" Angel Jibrfl (g) obeyed. The light of Niir Muhammad had already entered earth when the Niir kissed it, and the earth had acquired divine wisdom.

During the time of Nimrod and Pharaoh, he used these powers and caused so much difficulty to the children of Adam (g) in Egypt and Jerusalem. God had to send down the prophets, one by one, to reduce the forces of satan, and finally, through Prophet Muhammad ©, the power to speak through idols was taken away from him.

It is considered an honor and a duty to do this. Four people will dig the grave, others will donate a shroud, perfume, incense, or whatever is needed, and a priest, or kbbe, will say the appropriate prayers. Even the poorest man will be buried this way. There is no recognition of whether the person was rich or poor, the only wish is to see that the body is buried correctly. ( In Muslim countries, there is no charge for burial nor is a coffin used. People will fight for the honor of donating the shroud. And as the body is carried on a bier to the cemetery, everyone will jostle to carry it. If a corpse is found on the road or in a public place, everyone will help bury that per-son. This is true Islam. There is no death tax, there is no burial expense, and everyone unites to bury the person. If this custom existed in all countries, it would be much better. It is really amazing to observe the burial process in some places. There is a charge for the embalming, a charge for the funeral home, a charge for the coffin, a charge for the church, and a charge for the burial. There is even a charge for the minister. The whole thing usually costs four to five thousand dollars. This is truly astonishing! This is satan's work. He has set it up this way so that people will decide to cremate their dead because it is cheaper and easier. Here burial is a big business. Even after you are dead, money has to be paid to take you away. What will happen to the corpse if you don't pay? I don't understand this. This is astonishing. It is the same thing that Pharaoh did in earlier times. Pha-raoh made himself wealthy from the money he collected by taxing the dead. This is what some countries are now doing.

Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: It is not good. The earth, the body, must touch the earth. This is the correct way. Questioner: Not only do they put the body in a casket, but some people erect concrete vaults around it. This is even the law in some states. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: This is only in the West. In the East, in places like India and Ceylon, it does not happen that way. Coffins are not required. Burial is in the earth itself. Question: Well, what can we do? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: There may be state laws, but they also permit one to follow the tenets of one's religion. Let us try to work it out peacefully through these laws. Question: Bawa talks about fire as being of the nature of satan. I want to know if the fire can also have an element of purification. Sometimes I feel the fire burning inside me, and 1 don't know whether to discharge it immediately or whether it is actually having a purifying effect. (This last sentence was translated as: Sometimes he feels that the fire is giving him peace.) Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: How can it bring you peace? Fire burns everything to ashes.

Thus, it is important for us to realize God during our lifetime. Is this because there is no reaching God after death? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen-. That is correct. You must realize whatever has to be realized before you die. Everything you have to search for must be sought while you are still alive. If you are able to merge with God while you are alive, you will never be separated from Him. But if you do not develop that state, you will be separated from Him both while you are alive and after you have died. You cannot accomplish this after you leave. You will only face judgment. Question: Does that mean nothing can be done to help the dead through communication, prayer, or anything else? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: Nothing can be done after one dies. People try to help the dead in various ways. According to the various religious customs, food, clothes, or money are distributed to the poor in the name of those who have died. But these things do not help the dead person. He is judged while he is in the grave itself. His judgment is based on what he has done, not on what others do for him. The wife is judged by what she does and the husband is judged by what he does. There is no way to share any of this. Each indi-vidual is left with what he himself has earned.

This is why you need a truly realized human being, an insan kamil. It is through such a person that you should attain wisdom and good qualities. With these qualities you must search, change yourself, and earn your own rewards. Question: One reaches God through His qualities, but is there a possibility of half-reaching God? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: You do not have to merge with God. If He gives you a place anywhere in His kingdom, that will be sufficient. God has created eight heavens. If, in accor-dance with your search, you can gain a place anywhere in His kingdom, that will be sufficient for you. To merge with God, one has to become God Himself. That is extremely difficult. Question: Does that mean that only a perfected man, an insan kamil, dies within God? What happens to the imperfect man? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: What happens to each person de-pends on what the person has searched for. He will be given a place according to what he has achieved during his life-time. What he gets will depend on his own search. Until a man's last breath, it is possible for him to change and escape. And until man's last breath it is possible for him to be de-ceived by satan. He can turn toward God or toward satan. Both possibilities exist. Question: In psychiatry and in mental institutions, we see a lot of people who have attempted suicide. If a person does commit suicide, what happens to him after he dies? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: It is one's own craziness that leads a person into a mental institution. Originally, man has no craziness. No one is born crazy. Man becomes crazy as a"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Realizing Cod Before Death, Suicide, Accidents 143 result of his own thoughts, bad intentions, desires, or attach-ments. Whatever he craves causes him to become crazy. In different people, craziness is caused by different desires. It can develop into a desire to rule the world, an obsession for women, for men, for wealth, for children, property, posses-sions, for farmland, for cats, dogs, or other animals. Some people become obsessed with acquiring titles, becoming politicians, or with their business and careers. Some become obsessed with harming, torturing, or killing others. It is because a person thinks such thoughts, that he becomes crazy. Man brings about his own craziness. The very things he searches for can cause him to end up in a mental hospital, and if the craziness becomes extreme, he may even commit suicide. Wanting to commit suicide is a craziness in itself. Man brings about his own craziness and ends up in a place appropriate to his state. If a man succeeds in killing himself, he will end up in hell. He could then wander like a ghost, a spirit, or a demon, until his allotted time on earth is completed. Just because a man loses his body does not mean he is dead. There is a limit, a destiny for each person. If he dies before his destined time, he will have to wander as a spirit or ghost in the places in which he dwelt while alive— his house, his farm, his workplace. Only when his ordained time comes will the Angel of Death take his life away. Until then he will adopt the particular form of desire that caused him to commit suicide. I have seen this happen in many places. With my own eyes, I have seen not only the people who have committed suicide, but also the form they took afterward. I will tell you an experience I had. I went to visit some-one in a place called Rozella, in Ceylon. I was walking along a winding mountain road at one o'clock in the morning. It was very dark, and there were no lights.

It looked so real to me. 1 ran to the edge of the mountain and looked over. I could hear crying from down below and saw in the distance a car wrapped around a tree trunk. I climbed down the steep precipice, which was dangerously slippery. 1 had no light and could barely see the car. When I reached the bottom, there was no car, but I could still hear the screaming. I looked up and saw someone standing way up on top of the road, giggling and laughing. So 1 climbed back up the mountain, with much difficulty. When 1 got to the top, the person had disap-peared. 1 turned around and saw a woman hanging by her neck from a tree. She was dressed in a nurse's uniform and was giggling very loudly. 1 saw the couple with her. 1 caught hold of all three of them, and they told me their story. They had been living in a house near there during the riots in 1914. The nurse was looking after this couple. Their car collided with a truck driven by some soldiers from a nearby garrison, and everyone died. As they were relating this story, I could see the car collide and then hit the guard-rail and both vehicles fall into the river. I looked down the mountain again and saw many, many ghosts. These were the ghosts of the soldiers who had died in other accidents at the same place. They were shouting and howling in a terrible way. I ordered them away from the area, and then they left. Even though they had died in 1914, they were still there when I came by in 1925. In Ceylon I have captured countless numbers of ghosts and demons, so that they could not harm human beings.

This is how they behave. People who die before their ordained time, whether they die in an accident, commit suicide, or are murdered, will roam in the form of ghosts and demons until their destined time comes. Then they are taken by the Angel of Death to be judged. Those who commit suicide will roam as demons until their day of destiny arrives. This is not God's work.

Should we donate our organs to science when we die or is that impermissible, haram? Should the body be buried intact? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: God did not say anything like that. The Qur'an does not say any such thing either. Only science tells you to do this. My child, think of all the sins you have committed. If you donate your eyes, will it all be over? Will you be par-doned? Your eyes have committed many sins on their own. The mind has committed many millions of sins. You cannot donate your organs and be absolved from your sins. On the other hand, you could actually cause harm to the recipient. You may want to donate something that the earth will eventually consume. I cannot talk about something J do not know. If I did, it would be considered a fault. However, instead of donating your organs after you are dead, it will be better while you are still alive to help all lives as described in the Qur'an. If you help all lives, give charity, and do your duty toward others now, then there will not be anyone who will need your organs after your death. While we are alive, we are the ones who blind the eyes that can see. We are the ones who ruin the life of a person who is living a good life. It is we who destroy the unity of others.

If we 147"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"1 48 To Die Before Death still have the quality of ruining other lives while we are living, what is the use of donating our organs after we are dead? First, you have to correct your heart and come to rest within God. You must give yourself into the responsibility of God even while you are still alive. If you do not dedicate yourself to God, if you do not surrender to God, what is the use of anything you donate? The Qur'an does not tell you to donate this or that. It does not tell you to tear open the body, kill it, or cut it up. However, it does tell you to treat the dead body like a flower and bury it in the same manner. The body may have suffered a lot and been hurt while alive, but when it is a corpse, it should be washed and cleaned very gently. The nails and the entire body should be cleansed, softly and with care, and prayers should be recited while this is being done. It is only after it is gently cleansed in this manner that we are told to bury it. It is a very subtle matter. The body to be buried has to be treated like a delicate flower. This is what the Quran says. Therefore, you cannot cut up the body and ruin it. Because of the terrible things that people do in arro-gance, many lives are ruined. When man flies in the sky and bombs the ships on the sea destroying many lives, is God responsible for this? No. We cause accidents to happen. When we try to fly beyond God, we get beaten. When one country tries to destroy another, it too will get hurt. When one man tries to attack another, there will be a repercussion. Nothing has been said in the Qur'an about donating organs. But, according to what God has instituted, nothing belongs to us. Everything was created by Him and every-thing belongs to Him. When God created Adam \\Q), He told the earth, \"I will take one fistful of earth on loan and create man. I will make him live on the earth, eat from the earth, and increase in size.

This is why a man's body equals one thousand fistfuls of earth when he dies. If at the end of his life he is too big, he will have diar-rhea and his body will be purged, reducing it to one thou-sand handfuls. If he is too small, he will become bloated until he swells to the exact thousand handfuls. Everything is God's property. Your very life, your body, belongs to Allah. What do you have that belongs to you? What do you have to donate? Perhaps you could donate the clothes you are wearing or the food that you are eating, because they were given to you for the time being. But everything else belongs only to God. Nothing belongs to you. Even your eyes, your mouth, nose, ears, heart, and body, as well as your house, property, and wealth all belong to Allah. You should return them to Him. However, if you want to donate something, it must be done in His name. You must only give charity in the name of Allah, and worship in His name. That will be good. Do everything in the name of Allah. The only thing that really belongs to you is the good and evil you do. When you die, these are the only two possessions that you will take with you and hand over to God. You should realize that these are the only two things that will determine what you attain tomorrow. Therefore, while you are on this earth, you must try to understand what belongs to you. Understand what is good and what is evil. The mind is like a monkey which jumps from tree to tree. Desire is like a dog which cannot be controlled.

With every breath we face death. If there is anyone who does not have to face death, he will be Allah. Allah is the only One who does not die with each breath, with each word, and with each deed. A human being (insan] dies with every breath, every word, and every action. He dies repeatedly and wakes up repeatedly. In whatever he does he dies, falls down, and then gets up. That is the state of man. Allah alone does not die,- everyone else is dying and being reborn with each breath, word, and action. Man repeatedly does both good and bad, saying good words and bad words, and therefore he faces judgment every moment.

The one who is eternal is Allah.

Death is wedded to us; it is our wedding garland hung around our neck. However, if we escape from death, we are divorced. The line on our neck is the chain of death, and when we separate ourselves from death, then we are divorced. We have performed talacj, we have cut away our connection to this world (dunya) and the hereafter (akhirab). We must divorce ourselves from three things—earth, gold, and sensual pleasures. That is why in Arabic, one must say three times, \"Talaij, talacj, talacj, I divorce you, I divorce you, I divorce you.\" We must free ourselves from our desire for earth, gold, and sensual pleasures and then escape. Otherwise, we have many small deaths, and each time we wake up again. But, if we kill our desires, that will be the great death.

In everything that appears, in everything that is created, one portion belongs to the world and will perish, while the other portion belongs to the hereafter (akhirah). A seed is created in this manner, and such is the way of all created things. Everything that has a form contains a portion within it that relates to Allah, to His grace (rahmat), and that will never perish. The coverings will perish, and they are sharr. One is khair, or eternal, the other is sharr, or creation, which perishes. One is the essence (dhat). This is the way with all created things. Question: But the one who is striving for heaven, will he get rivers of milk and meadows of green and gold and things like 155"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"156 To Die Before Death that? Is heaven like that? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: It may be like that, but not in heaven. The river of milk and the river of honey must flow in his inner heart (cjalh). The undiminishing fruit that never per-ishes must blossom in his heart. He must build heaven within his own inner heart. The good qualities within his inner heart are what will serve him on the Day of Reckoning (Qiyamah). A person's good qualities and good thoughts will become the celestial beings who will later perform service (cfismat) to him in the hereafter (akhirah), and their appearance will be that of innocent children. Even while in this world, his qualities must perform service (qismat) to him. If he serves the people in this world with his good qualities, those same good qualities will serve him in the hereafter. Therefore, it is his good qualities which become the powers (wilayat), and that will serve him in the hereafter. But if that river does not flow in one's heart here in this life, then there is no river that flows in heaven. Man's worship ('ibadat) becomes the garlanded swing. Only the fullness and pleni-tude of true prayer will give him these benefits. If he does not achieve that here, he will not find it there.

There are many things like this which have been described. If these rivers do not flow in man's heart here in this lifetime, he will not find them there in the hereafter. These are things I have seen. Questioner: Allah, Subbanahu wa ta'ala, said in the Qur'an, \"After death I will purify some people and take them to heaven.\" An Arab man said yesterday that when referring to the period between death and the day of reckoning (cfiyamah), Allah said, \"Whoever says 'La ilaba ill-Allahu' will enter heaven,\" but He did not say when. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: When a man has complete trust [tawakkul] in Allah, he dies before death. When such a man physically dies and is buried in his grave, he attains the plenitude of eternal life (bayat). That is his day of reckoning (qiyamab). He dies, is placed in the grave (cjabr), and is imme-diately given an eternal life. That is his day of reckoning. For each man this day of death and his day of reckoning are in his own hands, under his own control. There is a later Day of Judgment, but his death (maut) and his reckoning (cfiyamah) are close to one another. Maut, or death, occurs in the world, and then after burial the reckoning, or cjiyamah, occurs in the grave. A man in whom the world has died is a true believer (mu'min), and when such a man is buried, he is given eternal life and taken to heaven. But, if one dies while the world is still within him, then when he is placed in the grave, he is subject to ques-tioning. If through this questioning it is found that he has done wrong, that he has not acquired the wealth of Allah (daulat), then he will remain in that grave until the final Judgment Day. His grave becomes a holding prison where he is kept until the final inquiry on Judgment Day. If one has made the world die within him while in this"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"158 To Die Before Death world itself, then as soon as he is placed in the grave and the mourners walk seven steps away, he is brought back to life immediately, and that moment becomes his day of reckoning (cjiyamah]. The inquiry is immediate. When they wake him in the grave, his light and beauty and the treasure he acquired from Allah will be revealed. He is given eternal life (hayat] and is taken immediately from the grave. This is how it might be. There is another Judgment Day, a final Judgment Day. If a person dies while the world is still within him, then the questioning is in the grave itself, and he is kept there until the final Judgment Day. Everything he says will be written down. Then he will have to remain in that holding prison. I have spoken to many people like this in the grave, people from all four religions. They have told me how it happens. I explained this in the first mystical experience.11 have seen them face to face and spoken with them. In that mystical experience I explain how I fought with satan, and then I provide certain explanations. I stood near a tree and talked with those who came by. As I spoke to them from the foot of the graves, each one would say, \"You have received the wealth of Allah (daulat]. You have left the world behind and you are now close to Allah. Therefore, you lack nothing. Allah's grace (rahmat] functions for you.\" Then they would tell me their story. I continued past the graves of people from all the different religions and finally came to the cem-etery of Islam, or Furcfan. There they said the same thing. People from all religions gathered around me and asked, \"Please beg Allah to set us on the right path, O good one!\" I told them, \"I will ask Allah. I will beg Him to help you. They complained to me, \"It is because of Allah that we 1.

Our numbers are getting smaller because this satan eats us up. Soon there will be no one left.\" I asked, \"Where does he come from?\" And they replied, \"From a twin well. It is from that region that he comes.\" \"I will see that he does not come again,\" I replied. Then I went toward the well. I picked a tall bamboo stalk and sharpened it. The well has two openings. When the shaitan poked his head out, I stabbed him with the stick and sent him right down to the lowest world. That lowest world is the place of the sexual arts (lllas) and illusion, the place from which we are born. It is the place of the arts and sensual pleasures—this was the twin well. There is a well outside and a well inside. The place from which we are born is the twin well. We take form in the inner well and come out. I killed that shaitan right in the well itself. This has been described in the first mystical experience. We say people have died and are in the grave,- these people may have done a measure of good or a measure of bad. Depending on the wealth (daulat) they receive from God in this world, a proportionate amount of nourishment (rizcf) will be sent down to them. Even in the grave, Allah gives them nourishment. Allah does not only give us food here while we are alive, He sends nourishment even to those in the grave. But only if they have attained a certain state do they receive this nourishment. According to the extent of their search, they will be given the appropriate nourishment (rizcf). Allah's kingdom is vast, but He does not forget to supply food even to the toad that lives under a rock. The difficulty is to see Him, but His grace and powers (rahmat and wilayat) are doing duty continually. This we can cer-tainly see and understand, although we may not be able to see Him directly."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"160 To Die Before Death Questioner: There is a hadith that the Rasul © said, \"Those who dwell in heaven will see Allah, Subhanahu wa ta^ala, every morning as if they would see Him with their own physical eyes.

They discussed prayer and worship, and Allah told the Rasul © to tell his followers what they had discussed. The veil was still between them. Then the Rasul © said, \"Allah, I want to see You. I must see You!\" When the entire conversation was over, Allah said, \"Take away this veil and look.\" And the Rasul © saw a mirror, only a mirror. It was of such brilliance, he could see the eighteen thousand universes in it. It was light. When he looked in the mirror he saw himself, he saw only his form, his beauty. He looked like a sixteen-year-old youth with a pointed moustache and a very beautiful, radiant face. It was his own beauty he saw in that mirror. Therefore, what Prophet Muhammad © saw when he went on Mi'raj was his own beauty. The rest of the time, Muhammad <c3 only heard the speech and words that came from God. When one is in that state how does one see Allah? Allah is a mirror. A man sees only himself. If he sees Allah's beauty in himself, if he sees all of Allah's qualities and actions in himself, then Allah is a mirror, a light. When he looks inside that, he will see only his own beauty, the beauty of a sixteen-year-old who is eternally youthful. When he returned from the Mi'raj, Muhammad's © 1.

There is a Day of Judgment when all of creation will be raised up after the whole world is de-stroyed. The animals and the hiiman-animals who were sent to hell in punishment will be raised up in their specific forms. On the appointed day all the beings in hell and heaven are raised up. All the energies, earth, gold, every-thing will be raised up. There is an appointed day for that. We cannot talk about it now. We will talk about it another day. Question: Is there one Judgment Day for everyone or is each one judged when they die? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: When the food and water kept on earth for each individual finishes, he dies and is buried. The day he is placed in his grave is his own day of judgment. He is raised up on that day. Once he is buried, the angels Munkar and Nakir © come down to his grave. Until the body is placed in the grave it is as if that person was given chloroform,- the dead person can still hear everything. At the time of death, the Angel of Death comes. He has a kind of chloroform. As soon as that anesthesia is given, the person's life is finished. The mouth is closed, the eyes are closed, the ears are closed, and the tongue is halted. They are all under the effect of the chloroform. All the nerves stop functioning. There is no outward sound. The person cannot speak. He does not take a breath and he cannot see any-thing.

He cannot speak, he does not breathe, and he cannot see, but everything is being perceived within. Sounds can be heard, but the body cannot speak. Everything that is hap-pening around him, how the mourners are wailing, shouting, and talking, how they are scolding him, how much they are eating, everything can be perceived by the person who died. It is the same during an operation,- the patient under the anesthesia may hear the cutting and the stitching sound. The person who has died also hears everything, but he does not speak, so people think he is just dead. So for the time between a person's death in this world and his burial in the grave, he is under anesthesia. As soon as he is laid in the grave he is given another injection, an antidote, and the effect of the chloroform is taken away. Then he sits up and the two angels, Munkar and Naklr (g), ask him questions. \"Who are you? What did you do? Whose son are you? What are the things that you have done?\" They will ask the eyes, \"What did you see? What did you do?\" Every one of the organs will be questioned. They will ask each of the twenty-eight letters in the body. That is the Quran. That never dies and is eternal (hayat). So the two angels will ask every organ—eyes, nose, ears, teeth, tongue, hands, legs—and inquire into the faults committed by each one of them individually. Each part of the body will answer, and the two angels on either shoulder1 will deliver what they have written. They will provide the evidence and say, \"At this breath he said this. In this time he said this.\" And so on, they will give the evidence. Then the person in the grave is asked to write what the eyes did. There is no paper to write on, so the white burial 1.

Then what do you do? There is no ink. You are told, \"You have your own ink to write with. That is your saliva. Touch your pen to your own saliva and that is the ink for you to write with.\" As soon as everything is written, your cfiyamab (reckoning) is finished. Qiyamab is the time in this world. That is, you appeared and now this is the end of that birth. Your cjiyamah is the end of that cycle, and what is left for you is your grave. Your cycle on earth is finished, and you have to wait until the final Judgment Day in this grave. Until that day, you will be given punishment in the grave according to what you have done. The angels will come, snakes will come, scorpions will come, and you will receive lashes for each thing you did. Every-thing you did before, everything that you did to others, will come back to you in turn. If you had hit somebody before, you will be lashed now. If you did something with your eyes before, you will get that back. You have to accept all that punishment and wait. Until the Day of Judgment, you have to suffer this torture and torment. Judgment Day is when God gives His judgment. Until then, you receive the judgment for whatever you have done. There will be snakes, scorpions, and various reptiles. The day when all lives are raised from the dead is the final Day of Judgment, and until that time this grave is your prison. While there, each person will be given all that he has earned. 2.

Question: If you are born and reborn again in different forms, when it comes to the final day, which of these forms is given judgment? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen: There are seventy-three groups. Out of those seventy-three groups, only one consists of true human beings. The other seventy-two are in the form of animals. They are half-human, half-animal, in the form of beasts and monkeys and other creatures. All of these people have to be born and reborn. They die and go to the super-market, and then they must come back to the world. Like a bull, as soon as they finish plowing, they go to the supermar-ket and then back again. They are recycled back and forth, first plowing, then to the supermarket, and then to the table. This Judgment Day is meant only for the human being. Out of seventy-three groups, those which are half-man and half-beast have to be recycled and reborn again and again. They are beasts, they have their own king, and that king is god for them. If each animal worships his own king as his god, he has to be born again. He is not a human being. If someone worships a demon, it is that demon that is being born again. If you worship various forms of asuras, they have to drink your blood. If you worship dogs, that is an animal and it has to return to the supermarket and come back again. That god has to come back and the person who is worship-ing that god also has to come back. That is how it works. Whatever somebody keeps as a substitute for God, as opposite to Him, and worships, he has to merge with that. If fire is somebody's god, then he has to return to fire in hell. If water is their god, they have to come back to water. If it is air, they have to come back to air. If illusion (maya) is their god, they have to come back to that. Those are the rebirths."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Judgment in the Crave 167 But God's judgment is for man. Judgment is only for the human being. That is a very subtle point. It is so rare, rarest of the rare, to be born as a human being. It is so very rare. And out of these, to be born without blemish and deformity is still rarer. Even more rare is to be born as a male. Even more rare is to be born as one of knowl-edge. Even rarer is to be born a king. And still rarer than that is to be born as agnani, one who has gained divine wisdom. So when you say rare, it is extremely rare, something that is almost impossible to attain. A man who does not need judgment is so very rare to find. That is one group. You are the ones who need to be judged. Isn't there a judgment for us? Are you the one in ten million who does not need to be judged? No, you are not. A judgment is necessary. You are a human being, and I am a human being. You come in this room, and for the short space of time that you are here, you may be a true man. But then after you leave you may act like a demon. Another time you may be a doctor. Another time you stray further and you turn into tnaya (illusion), or you stray further out and you turn into a demon who takes lives. Another time you give in to the base desires (najs) and turn into a dog of desire, or you stray still further and turn into a bloodsucking vampire or a lion. So a judgment is required, isn't it? Only at one short point in time were you a true man. All the other times you were changing into various forms. So a judgment is necessary. If you have turned totally into a true man, then you are God. So why would darkness come to the sun? Question: If we suffer so much in the grave, what more judgment do we need? Bawa Muhaiyaddeen-.

For that you will be kept in that animal form, and you will suffer the same torment you caused others when you were in that form. This goes on for seven years. Another time you were a snake and you caused suffering, and so for a further seven years, you will be given the punishment for what you did as a snake. Then you will not be in a human form, you will be in a snake form. Another time you were in a tiger form, drinking blood and eating flesh. That form will appear and you will have to suffer in that form for seven years. Another time you lived as an elephant, and you will suffer for seven years in that form for what you did. This is what is given according to what was written. For each of the forms that you took in your life, you will have to undergo suffering for seven years. It will take that long to go through all that. If you had remained a true man the whole time, then nothing would happen in the grave. If you did not take all these forms and had remained a true man, then you would be light, you would be God, you would be a representative of God. So there would be no suffering in that grave. You would be a king in all the inner realms in the world. As a king you would perform your duties, protecting and helping others wherever it was needed. Your grave would be a great big mansion, a palace for you, and there would be so many people performing service to you. The heavenly beings would be there, and so much would be done for you.

He is the one who has been endowed with and can realize the wealth of the hereafter (akhirah). The human being is, therefore, a miracu-lous wonder that is deserving of praise in the hereafter. If man can receive that wealth and manifest it even while he is here in this world, then his life will be filled with that praise, and he will be praised by Allah in this present life itself. This state is the unchanging wealth in man's life, and one who has attained this will have earned Allah's grace (rahmat). This wealth belongs to man and man must realize this. If, however, one born as a human being lives without receiv-ing this wealth or realizing this state, that is an even greater wonder. Why? There is life and death (hayat and maut). One who receives Allah's wealth has eternal life, while one who lives as a wondrous being who does not receive this wealth has actually died. He has changed from the state of a human being. Man should realize this with his wisdom. He must realize what the state of true man (insan) should be. He should realize what death is and what eternal life is. This has been explained in the revelations and the warnings given to us by the prophets, and in the wisdom and the determined faith (Tman) imparted to us by them. Death and eternal life are within man's hands at all times. He should understand both and realize that death exists within him at every moment. Every one of the four hundred trillion, ten thousand qualities within him are 185"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"186 To Die Before Death qualities that can cause his death. Through these qualities whatever he searches for in the world, whatever he intends, whatever he gathers, and whatever he hoards only lead to his death. Every breath is a breath of death. Everything he eats, looks at, acts upon, sits on, or thinks about can bring death to him before the blinking of an eye. His desires, his actions, his cravings, his anger, hastiness, impatience, the arrogance of the T, the base desires (najs ammarab), and the qualities of lust, hatred, and miserliness, all point him toward death every second. Attachments, blood ties, and the divisions of T and 'you',- the differences of race, religion, and color,- the love of possessions, property, and livestock,- the separations of my belongings and your belongings, my kingdom and your kingdom, my food and your food—each one of these thoughts warn him of his impending death. A slight change in his breath while sleeping can cause a man to die. If he shouts with great excitement, \"Ha! This is mine!\" that very joy can cause his death. Or if he fails to attain something he yearns for, that sorrow can kill him. If he takes too much or too little of something, he can become ill and die. He can choke on the very water he drinks. If he laughs too hard or if he swallows too much food at once, he can choke and die. Everything man desires and gathers in this world, everything he thinks about and intends, whatever he eats, even what he looks at can be the cause of his death within the blinking of an eye. All the things he desires change continually, but death never changes or leaves him. It can come to him any second, without the slightest warning, whatever he may be doing, whether he is flying in the skies or walking on the earth, when he is sitting or when he is sleeping. But man, not realizing that he is holding death in his hands, holds on to the world, and as a result he suffers every moment of his life. With every breath, in both happi-"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The Wonder That Is Man 187 ness and sorrow, he suffers and cries. Human beings (insan) must realize this. The animals, reptiles, and birds do not do this,- they do not have this quality. They place their trust in God and seek only what is required at any given time (wacft). They conduct their lives without any worry of tomorrow and with the belief that Allah is sufficient. But man has forgotten this state. He has forgotten his impending death, and he has forgotten Allah. Man lets go of Allah's words and His kingdom and treats the world as the ultimate treasure. This is the wonder! There is no other wonder. At all times, man holds on to his inevitable death as his possession and forfeits his true possession which is eternal life. He lets go of life and accepts death. Even though man comes into the world and receives many trea-sures, he considers death to be his most valuable possession. This is a great wonder. There is no wonder greater than this. There are four things a human being (insan) must ponder: First: \"I am one who is subject to death. When I die, will I die as one of true faith (mu'tnin) or as one who does not believe (kajir)? Will I die in a state of darkness or will I die in a state of light?\" Before we die we must understand this with our wisdom. Second-. \"I was formed as a fetus in the earth. I was born in the earth, I ate the things of the earth, and I have grown up with the elements—earth, fire, water, air, ether, or illu-sion (maya). Finally, I will be laid back into the same earth from which I came and become prey to that earth again. On the day of reckoning (tfiyamah) I will be raised up, and when they question me in the grave, will what they write on my behalf be good or bad? Will it be a day of eternal life and light (bayat) or a day of death and darkness (mautp What will they write on my behalf?\" While we are still in this grave"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"188 To Die Before Death called the world, before being laid in the grave of the earth, we must find out the answer to these questions. Third: \"The final Day of Reckoning (Qiyamah) and its results connect me with Allah. On that day called Qiyamah, my time in the grave is over. I will have to rise up with the scroll and speak with Allah. At that time, will the scroll I take with me contain good or bad? And in which hand will I carry this final decree? Will the scroll, containing the good and the bad written on my behalf, be placed in my left hand or my right hand?\" Before we die we must understand this Day of Reckon-ing and know in which hand we will receive the results of this questioning. Worship and service ('ibadat), the remem-brance of God (dhikr), contemplation of God (fikr), prayer, and intending and focusing on God, all these must rise from within us, speak with Allah, and know what He is going to award us. Fourth: \"Finally when the judgment comes, will God give me heaven or hell? What will happen when I place this scroll in Allah's hands, when I meet and speak with Allah face to face for my judgment?\" With wisdom we must understand right from wrong, rise from this grave which is the world, and understand what is going to be written on our behalf. We must understand and write down our final judgment by meeting Allah directly in our worship and service ('ibadat) and in our prayers (vanakkam). We must find out the details of our judgment by dying before our death, and if we can discover the answers to these questions while we are still in this world, then we will attain eternal life. That is the judgment. However, if we fail to obtain these answers while we are here, then we will have to die and go to the grave in the earth. If one understands whether he will die as a true believer or as a non-believer, then he is one who is known as a"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The Wonder That Is Man 189 realized human being (insan kamil), a representative of Allah, a slave of Allah, one who has surrendered to Allah. But if man fails to realize this, he dies within one breath and is reborn in the next breath. He dies in one intention and is reborn in the next intention. He dies with one look and is reborn with the next look. Out of his thoughts and desires, he creates four hundred trillion, ten thousand forms within himself and then worships these as gods. If he has snake-like thoughts, he creates an idol of a snake and worships it. He worships his own thoughts and these idols are his \"thought-gods.\" If he has arrogance, then he creates the form of an elephant and worships that elephant. If he has the deceitful qualities of a rat, he creates a rat form and worships it. He makes every one of these forms and then worships their qualities which are opposite to Allah's. Like this, he experiences one hun-dred and five million deaths and births each day. This is what is called karma. This is why the world is called his grave. Man dies in the grave of this world and is reborn every second because of his thoughts. Only when he gives up these thoughts and lives his life with complete trust in Allah (tawakkul 'alallah) will he escape from that grave and receive the eternal life of the hereafter and the wealth and grace of all the universes (rahmatul-'alamtn). Failure to realize this is the wonder of man! Every second of his life he holds death in his hand, and still he tries to carry the entire world with him. Before the blinking of an eye, before one breath leaves and the next one comes, he tries to grab something else. The wonder is that man, born so exalted, born as a human being (insan), has come to such a state. Instead of seeking wisdom, he tries to hold on to the changing things in the world. This is karma. This is the karma that came with him in his body. Only a man who can cut away this karma can overcome his death and attain the state of eternal life. Every one of us must"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"190 To Die Before Death reflect on this. To die before death—that is the most exalted state. Apart from Allah and truth, everything else man desires and nurtures within himself will eventually kill him. What-ever he is in love with now will cause him sorrow and then kill him. Whatever he places his trust in is the very thing that will kill him tomorrow and take its share. Whatever he fosters in the world, that same thing will kill him. Whatever he desires will kill him and take a share. These are the things that cause him grief, illness, and suffering. They will lead only to his death and his rebirth. But if man holds on solely to Allah, His qualities, actions, and state, His duties and the wealth of His grace, that will be his freedom, his beauty, and his resplendent light. That will be his wealth. That will give him a life free of want and the plenitude of eternal life. A man in such a state will not cause pain to another, and therefore, there is nothing that will want to consume him and take its share of him. Such a one is a true man, a per-fected being (iman kamil). But all the time he does not realize this he is worse than a beast. The animals have at least attained a certain state, they place their trust in God and take their food. This is why Prophet Muhammad, the Rasulullah <c3, said, \"Go even unto China to learn divine knowledge ('ilm).\" Learn wisdom. If one has that wisdom, he becomes a true human being (insan), but if he gives up that wisdom, he is worse than a beast. That is his death. Every thought is his death. This is what every one of my children must think about. We must understand eternal life and death. Amin.

My sheikh is not of this world. He is one of true wealth (daulat), a sheikh connected to the hereafter (akbirab). There-fore, nothing he said will ever fail to occur. All the meanings given by him exist as the truth from the time of creation (awwal) to the time of the hereafter (akbirab). According to his explanations, if we deviate for even one second on the path, if even one toe turns away from where it should be placed, we will fall down. We need dedication, concentration, balance, and wisdom (tbanam, nitbanam, avatbanam, andcfnanam). Dedicating or offering oneself to God in this world is tbanam. To walk on that path we need concentration or nitbanam. The connection between us and God is very, very subtle. It is even subtler than one segment of a strand of hair that has been split into seven. Such is the sharpness of wisdom, a path with an extremely sharp edge. This is the only path that connects us with God. Below this path are the seven hells, the seven canals. These include the canals of birth, karma, sin, illusion (maya), and the sexual arts. The canal of birth is the hell of fire, the vilest hell in which fire rages constantly. Within it burns the fire of hunger, anger, sin, karma, and birth, the fire of pride, arrogance, fanaticism, race, and color, the fire of differences, jealousy, envy, and selfishness, and the fire that arises from one's own posses-sions.

The Messenger of God, the Rasulullah ©, is here and this is where both your good and bad are weighed. Look at these scales. It is the balance known as mizan tras. When you die, two wooden posts are placed at either end of your grave. They are called the mizan boards. The scale, or mizan tras, hangs between the post placed by your head and the post that is placed by your feet. This is the scale that will weigh your life. Perfectly pure faith (Tman) will tilt the scale toward the post at the head. While you are still alive, even before you die, you have this scale of judgment, mizan tras.

The light of Muhammad©, the chosen Messenger (Mustafar-Rasul), exists at the base of this mizdn trds, in the ocean of divine knowledge (babrul-'ilm). You can see him at the place where the balancing or weighing occurs. The outcome depends on what your inner heart has established. If your heart has discarded what is bad, accepted and acted according to what is good, and has experienced the benefits and advantages of doing so; if your heart has acquired and acted according to divine knowledge ('ilm), to the ocean of divine knowledge, to Allah's grace (rahmat), peace, tranquility, His qualities, and His ninety-nine at-tributes,- if you have done all this and have given peace and tranquility to others—then you will dispense justice with God's qualities. It is at this station of justice that you will see the Rasiil ©. This is where Muhammad © exists, at the foot of the mizdn trds. At the time when the Rasiil © had to leave the world and be transformed, he replied to a question asked by his followers, \"You can see me at the foot of the mizdn trds. That is where I will be.\" This scale exists as your inner heart [c\\alb). There is no other scale, only the mizdn trds.

This is Mi'raj.1 The base of the mizan tras is the place from which you will speak to Him. You will also see the Rasul © at this place.

What you experience in your thoughts, desires, and sounds may appear to be the Rasiil <c3, but what actually is this treasure? It is a light from God's power (cfudrat) and grace (rahmatj. You must think about this. It is only when you reflect upon this, that you can attain it. On this path, you have to safeguard this one treasure, you have to walk in this one manner, and you have to strive very hard. Every second, we have to realize that our life has a limit. Our life is like a bubble in the water. When air be-comes trapped within water, the bubbles rise to the surface. The bubbles do not last very long, they burst as soon as they reach the surface. Our life in this world is just like this. If we are hit by a stone, we could lose our life in a second. If we become dizzy and fall, we could die. We can lose our life while drinking water or even as we are eagerly putting food into our mouth. We could die when we are coming, going, standing, drinking, sitting, or sleeping. We do not know at what second we will reach the limit of our life. We should not think that we are going to live forever. You should be ready to leave at any moment.

This is what you must do. First, it is your duty to complete whatever you have to do. You cannot put the shroud of death (kajan) on yourself at the end,- put it on at the beginning. You cannot bury yourself after you have died, prepare your burial before you die. You cannot judge yourself later on, make the judgment on your-self before that. Do not think that judgment day will come later; understand and make your own judgment. Before you die, you should understand what kind of house belongs to you. Understand these matters. With understanding, com-plete the work that has to be done, and having done that work, be ready at all times. Then your journey will be easy. Do not decide to do things later on, saying, \"I'll do it tomorrow\" or \"I'll do it later on.\" That is a way of saying you will not do it. It means that you no longer desire to complete the task and it will not be done. Finish each task at each second, on each day. Just complete it in some way. This is how you will see completion in your life. When you say, \"Later\" or \"Tomorrow,\" it is the same as saying, \"No.\" If you do not finish tasks that have to be done each day, it means that you cannot finish them. You are refusing to do them. Your yearning to do them no longer exists. You should understand this. We should understand this. As long as we do not realize this search and strive for it with every breath, we will not know our house, our own state. What kind of a house do we live in now? This can be understood from our qualities, actions, conduct, our inner heart (tfalb), and mind. This must be understood. I do not know what else to say. I am a crazy man who has come here. Because of my craziness I have stayed here for the last twenty or so years. I thought that other people who are crazy, like me, would come here. I thought, \"If other people contract the same craziness that I have, we could stay together as a group.\" But to the extent that I can see, only"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"204 To Die Before Death about ten or twelve people are acquiring this craziness little by little. When I look at the others, I see that some people had this obsession earlier, but it changed. The intellect took over and they now have an intellectual craziness, not the real obsession that we have. Very few people have the real obsession that I have. However, this total craziness of a fool is developing in a few people. God has provided this expla-nation. He has said, \"One who perceives Me with complete trust will be a fool in this world. He will appear to be com-pletely crazy. Such a person has only one obsession. He is crazy for divine wisdom (jnanam), he is crazy for Me.\" Such a person gives up the experiences of the world and falls into this craziness. Why does he do this? People will tell him, \"Look at everyone else, they have the craziness of the intel-lect, but you have the craziness of a fool.\" Only if one becomes such a fool will God become the physician who supports and assists him. Only God can take care of a person with this obsession. The world, hell, and satan can take care of intellectual craziness. But who can take care of one who has this craziness? Only God can. He is the only physician. The total obsession that I have has developed to a small extent in a few people, but the intellectual craziness has taken over many people. Even those who initially had this total craziness dwindled away as their intellect grew and developed. Some of them have left and others are beginning to leave. If one considers himself to be a wise man, he will not stay with fools. He will say, \"That crazy man is blabbering foolishly,\" and walk away. So-called wise people will run away.

They do this because they believe that when they attain this state of complete craziness, a conclusive cure will be provided. Those who have intellectual craziness will go to several doctors and undergo treatments. They think they are better off than those with one obsession, because they undergo many different treatments and therefore there is a greater likelihood of being cured. It is difficult to search for the One Physician. This is the way things are today. \"God alone is sufficient.\" This is what I was told a hundred or a hundred and fifty years ago. The first words I was told were, \"My son, come here, 1 will give you an expla-nation. You are in the world now. There could be many different kinds of actions or practices in this world. Find ways to escape from these. The fire of hunger exists within man, as well as the fires of arrogance, karma, and illusion (maya), the fires of anger, sin, and fanaticism, the fires of blood ties, racial prejudice, and color prejudice, the fires of selfishness, jealousy, envy, and pride. \"You are journeying through these fires now. You have been sent forth to travel through the world. Since you must walk through these fires you should remember what I am telling you now. 'Be first in line for food.' On Allah's path, this means that in the place where Allah is, in that permis-sible (halal) place, be first in line to receive His nourishment. 'But be last in line for war.' This is the war fought by the six armies of arrogance, karma, and illusion (maya) and the three sons of illusion (taraban, singhan, and suran), along with the six armies of lust, anger, miserliness, attachment, fanaticism, and envy and the five armies of intoxication, craving, theft, murder, and falsehood.

You need to run in the center. Allah's house is there. Run there, to the center of the inner heart (cfalb). When everyone joins the stampede, you should run in the center. This is how it should be done. \"Everyone in the cities, all the armies, all the various fascinations, birth and death will keep running. You need to also run amidst them and conduct your life. When everyone runs, run amidst them. But when a person is running alone, inquire, find out why he is running. Do not join him blindly and run with him. That could be dangerous. When you run alone, ask, inquire, and find the path. Find the place where the true sheikh is, ask him, receive the map, and continue to ask as you go along the path. You have to ask for guidance as you proceed alone on God's path. \"Do not proceed without asking for guidance. And even if you do, do not go in front. If you race ahead saying, 'I, I,' then powerful demons and all the ghosts of the world will be there. They will drink your blood. Do not stay behind either. Many ghosts are there. The base desires, the five elements, blood ties, attachments, property, relations, reli-gions, and races are all gathered there. All these ghosts will catch hold of you. The ghosts of wealth and hunger will come and catch you. If you lag behind, the ghosts will catch hold of you, and if you go in front demons will strike you and suck your blood. \"Therefore, neither lag behind nor go in front.

However, if you fail to see the Rasul © here, then you will not cross this bridge which is sharper than a sword and straighter than wisdom. This is the bridge of judgment which is a grace beyond Allah's grace. You should walk on such a bridge. Once you realize this, the bridge is very broad, and you can walk across it without mishap. The fire and the sounds from below will not pay attention to you or catch you. The sounds will rise up from all four sides, but you will have blocked your ears, and you will proceed listening only to His sounds. If you do not become one of pure faith (mu'min), if you do not see the Rasiil © at the foot of the mizan tras, then all your sounds will call out to you. If you listen to these sounds and turn around, illusion (maya) will pull you down on one side and hell will push you over on the other side. This is the world. \"On this bridge you have to offer yourself to Allah (thanam), surrender to Allah, immerse yourself in Him (baqa'), 3.

You will commune directly with Allah. This is Mi'raj. You will reach Allah and be in complete communion with Him, just as the Rasill © communed with Him. \"You must think about this. Otherwise, the sounds that you carry with you will call out to you from under the bridge. If, however, you have died before this as one of pure faith (mu'min) and have seen the Rasul © at the foot of the mizatt tras, and if the board has been firmly planted, then you will have no further death, no suffering in hell, and no further birth. You have finished dying in that place and you have attained eternal life (hayat). Nothing can touch you now. As one of pure faith you attained eternal life and a form [surai] of light. You will no longer be born again or die again, and hell will have been pushed far away from you. \"This is the path you have to take to cross over to the other side. You have to think about this and act accord-ingly.\" This is what my sheikh told me at that time. \"This is what the world is like. This is what you have to attain. This is what the paths are like. You should inquire and ask for guidance along the way.\" My sheikh told me many such words a long time ago. I remembered them now and so I conveyed them to you. Children, please think about it. You must understand what kind of a path this is. I have told you the type of conduct and behavior you need, and you should conduct yourselves in this way. Sometimes I think, \"What is the use of my coming here?"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Scales of Judgment 209 Of what use has it been? What have I seen after coming here?

Similarly, divine knowledge can be obtained only by tapping Allah,- absolute faith (iman) can be obtained only by tapping the Rasul ©, and wisdom or light can be ob-tained only by tapping the Qutb @). Therefore, to attain divine knowledge ('ilm) you begin by tapping the sheikh. You should start by bringing your inner heart (cjalb) and beating it against the sheikh. You should strike your inner heart against the sheikh and extract either the grace or the meaning from there. Whatever you bring to a sheikh, he will change it and return it to you. Once a beggar came to the Rasul © seeking help from the poverty and many difficulties of his life. The Rasul © told the beggar to give him all the money he had. The beggar gave him one cent.4 The Rasul <c3 received it in one hand, transferred it to the other hand, changed it, and returned it to the Arab, saying, \"This is the wealth of God. Take this wealth and start a business with it.\" And the man became rich. Similarly, the sheikh changes whatever you bring and returns it to you. If you bring base desires, he will say, \"That's fine,\" and return them to you. If you give him goodness, he will exalt it and give it to you. If you bring him baseness, he will magnify that and give it to you. If you bring him goodness and intend that, he will increase it for you; he will fulfill your intention. 4.

He merely increases and returns to you what you brought to him. He will only give you the same intention you brought to him and return it in an increased amount. If it is bad then bad will increase, if it is good then goodness will increase in you. Whatever path you ask for, he will magnify that path for you. Therefore, it is not his fault. Think about this. Think about what you have to beat against in order to learn divine knowledge ('iltn). The Rasul © said, \"Go even unto China to receive divine knowledge.\" One has to ponder why the Rasul © carried the Quran in his hand, gave the Qur'an to you, and yet proceeded to tell you to go even unto China to learn 'iltn. He also said that the wisdom obtained from a discourse of wisdom (hadith) is more subtle and exalted than fifty times (watfts) of prayer. He told people to listen to words of wisdom (hadith). There is a great difference between what you do and what the Rasul © spoke about. You should determine what it is that you have to beat against. In order to revive the life of the soul, one must beat against the sheikh and obtain the life of divine knowledge ('ilm). The sheikh is the one of grace and divine knowledge. You have to strike against that in order to obtain the wealth (daulat). Do not think that you have learned and studied everything. That is of no use. Reflect on this. May God help you. Atntn. Search for your wealth. Seek and understand how to cross the bridge and go to the other side. A man who continues to put out his hand even when it gets slapped is a fool, and the man who beats such a man is also a fool.

Every-thing You do is done with complete clarity. No matter how much we run about searching, only when we finally look with wisdom does everything become clear. As long as we do not have wisdom we cannot under-stand anything that You do,- but with wisdom we can see everything clearly.

When we plant a tree, water it, and fertilize it, it becomes beautiful, and when it is fully grown, the benefits are abun-dant. We experience the sweet taste of its fruits and feel happy. In the same way, we must cultivate and ripen God's ideals within us and give them to Him. Then He will be at peace and we can attain peace. We can realize this taste. We should do this in each aspect of our lives. May all of us reflect, pray to God and His goodness, and bathe in wisdom. All of the children who are within my inner heart ((falb), may God embrace all of us in His heart and fill our lives with great bliss."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"216 To Die Before Death Precious children, there are many things we must reflect upon. Consider the following stories. Once there was a pond with a fence nearby. A chame-leon liked to jump on the fence and sit on one of its posts. There was also a frog that liked to jump onto the fence and warm itself in the heat of the sun. In the pond there were some turtles and other creatures too. One day a man was passing by in his donkey cart. He was complaining, \"My donkey does not move fast enough.\" He thought, \"Maybe if I harness that chameleon and that frog to the cart, they might help the donkey move faster.\" And so he proceeded to catch the chameleon and the frog and hitch them to the cart. If the man had continued with just the donkey, they would have slowly and eventually reached their destination. But now, the frog was trying to pull the cart toward the pond, and the chameleon was pulling it toward the fence. The two of them continued tugging in opposite directions, and it grew very late. The cart had not proceeded on the path at all but had only moved closer to the edge of the pond. Similarly, like the pond in the orchard of wisdom within the inner heart (cfalb) of God's grace (rahmat), count-less things savor the taste of the fruits. Four hundred trillion, ten thousand spiritual qualities, energies (shaktis), and actions are there. They come there for their comfort and happiness, like the frog, the chameleon, and the insects that come to the pond. If we try to adopt their qualities, thinking that they will help us on our journey,- if we let go of the path on which we were travelling and the things we have been carrying thus far, it will never work. If we do not at least make use of our first three levels of consciousness, feeling, awareness, and intellect, if we let go of these and do not"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"To Live As a Human Being 1 \\ 7 establish and realize at least one of these states, and if in-stead we hold onto the monkey mind, desire, and hastiness, thinking we can harness them like a horse for our journey, we will not be able to continue on our way even for a single day. They will pull us here and there, and we will never be able to proceed on the path. It is the mind that we have to discard. We should not trust it. The mind is like the frog that came out of the pond to dry itself in the sun, but as soon as it catches sight of people, it will jump back into the pond. The chameleon came there to eat worms and termites. Once it has eaten all it desires, it too will move away. If we pay attention to these animals, harness them to our cart and think that they will lead us, we will not be able to reach God. We will not be able to search for truth, and therefore, we will never be able to gain access to truth and proceed forward. We should reflect on this. If we take the mind with us and hold on to our desires and thoughts, it will be very difficult to reach the kingdom of God. Jeweled lights of my eyes, there are several freight and passenger trains that travel to and from Philadelphia. The passenger train stops at each station for a minute and drops people off. The freight train stops at the appropriate stations for fifteen minutes to half an hour and delivers boxes of goods. Sometimes, the boxcars carrying the freight are unhitched and left behind at each stop. The train proceeds in this manner leaving each boxcar behind until it arrives at the final destination. In the same way, in our life, we have to detach and leave behind each of the qualities that have hitched on to us. Each action has to be unloaded. We should only unload things at each station and not take on more things to pull."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"218 To Die Before Death There is not enough time to interrupt our work in this wasteful manner. Time moves on. In our life, we have piled up hundreds of thousands of thoughts, fights, quarrels, and differences. It is impossible to tell how many things we have accumulated. Trying to extract and separate these from the ocean of illusion (maya), which is our mind, is like trying to extract all the fish from the ocean. Their number is endless. In our lives, thoughts keep coming and coming to our mind, one after another. Some of the things that arise in the mind could kill us, like the bite of poisonous insects. So many kinds of things, both good and bad, enter the mind. Therefore, we have to con-tinually sift through them, develop what is good, and watch the others closely. Jeweled lights of my eyes, life is extremely subtle. Discovering or realizing this subtlety requires an even greater subtleness. Once this has been realized, implement-ing this awareness through action requires an even greater degree of subtlety. If we realize and understand this subtlety, then it will be easy to proceed. Take for example a rapidly flowing river. It is indeed difficult to cross from one shore to the other, because the current flows so fast. We cannot cross in a boat, because the rapids will dash against it and wash it downstream. We have to find a 'special instructor', one who knows how to swim very well and can train others. Then he can take a heavy rope, fasten it on to this shore, take it across, and tie it firmly to the other shore. Additional ropes can then be added later when necessary. Several kinds of bridges can be constructed in this way, or the ropes can be used to pull a small ferry across. Then we can cross without the aid of anyone,- we can use the rope to pull the boat along ourselves. Earlier, it was"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"To Live As a Human Being 219 difficult. Now, we can easily go to and fro from this shore to the other. In the same way, in this journey of ours, we are going from this world (dunya) to the next world (akbirah). We enter life and then proceed from this life to the hereafter. In order to proceed through life, in order to cross the ocean of illusion (maya) and swim through its waves, we will have to struggle for a while. This is because we first have to discover the great subtlety. We have to discover certain things through a wise being who knows. We have to learn through that wisdom, that clarity, and those qualities. If we do, then it will become easier, and we will be able to carry our bur-dens to the other shore. In this way, each child must try to attain the clarity of wisdom that is necessary to discover and understand the subtlety of life. We should understand this truth, and with that wisdom, we should realize, sift, and separate everything. At all times birth and death are hanging around our neck. They can occur very quickly. Within the blinking of an eye, there is time for either creation or destruction. If a crazy quality enters a man, he could die at once. However, if a good quality of wisdom comes, he could escape death and become one who lives again. Even when we are asleep, if the breath we inhale proceeds along the wrong course, we may die. It is possible that we may lie down and be unable to awaken. It is also possible for one to awaken, leave home, and never return. We do not know at which moment death may occur. We cannot trust death,- it is not certain when it may come. The garland of death hangs around our neck playing with us. Yet, while death is around our neck, we are playing in this world. Death plays with us, and we play in the world thinking that we are going to live for a long time and accomplish so much."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"220 To Die Before Death Jeweled lights of my eyes, if a frog becomes arrogant and tries to catch and devour another frog, it does not stop to think that it should only eat it a little at a time, and if it exceeds this limit, the arrogant frog will die in the attempt. In its defense the frog being eaten will swell up when it is halfway down the arrogant frog's throat, and neither will be able to escape. They will both die. Similarly, we have to understand the world and proceed a little bit at a time. We have to defeat the world and go on, but we should proceed very slowly, gradually understanding one thing after another. If, instead, we say that the world is beautiful and try to grab hold of something and swallow it, we might encounter the same fate as the frog. In other words, two feet might be left sticking out of our mouth as the frog swells up within us. I saw this happen at my farm in Paliayankulam. A big frog attempted to swallow another frog in the well and both died. When I saw it in the morning, the big frog had become so swollen that it weighed five pounds. We had to fish it out of the well and drain all the water. In a similar manner, our thoughts kill us by attempting to swallow us. They are unable to let go of us, and we die in the process. Likewise, we also try to swallow each of our thoughts and die in the attempt. We must reflect on this. Jeweled lights of my eyes, life can be very simple if we hold on to what is wise. Is it not easy for a chameleon to climb a tree? It is very easy. But a man trying to climb a tree has to struggle and work hard. A snake coils itself around the tree and slides upward with ease. But a man cannot climb by sliding around and around the tree,- he has to proceed upward in a fairly direct manner, holding on as he ascends. Therefore, it is more difficult for him."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"To Live As a Human Being 221 Like the snake, the mind will catch hold of life and go around and around in circles, but wisdom will look straight ahead, pay attention, and proceed. In our life we simply have to hold on to what is wise and proceed upward in a direct manner. The monkey of the mind will just dance in circles and laugh at everything it sees. That is why we have to reflect very deeply in our lives. This is how it is, my brother. We should reflect upon each thing in a state of love. Our love should be fragrant. Our every word should bring sweetness to the heart and be tasty to the tongue. Our every gaze should bring peace and happiness to others. We should have the kind of embrace that draws all children to our hearts with love. We have nothing else to give others, only our heart. When we give our hearts, we emit that love. At once people's hunger will cease, and they will be filled with love, compassion, and a beautiful taste. We may not have water or food to give, we may be starving too, but we are not without love and compassion. As soon as we talk to others and give them love and compassion, their tiredness, sadness, and worry will leave them. Then we can offer them some water, and they can drink it and be refreshed. In the same way, if you possess each quality of God, you will be able to give peace to every life. You will not say, \"I don't have!\" Instead you will say, \"There is, there is! The completeness is here. The fullness, the plenitude, is here!\" and you will bring comfort to all inner hearts [<\\a\\hs). Love is that fullness and plenitude. Compassion is a high ideal. Mercy causes the heart of a human being to melt. Therefore, having mercy and compassion toward other lives makes one's own heart melt. A melting heart shows that it is full of love. Each child should think about this. There are so many varieties of fish that live in the"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"222 To Die Before Death ocean. Some have electricity within them, some are very cold, and some are poisonous. Some fish have as much as four or five hundred volts of electric current. If they touch another fish, that fish dies. Like this, there are also many things within us. Electricity is within us and light is also within us. When certain bad things touch us, the electricity will strike them. But some evil things cannot be stopped by the electricity. There are many sections in our hearts. Among these are the qualities of trying to kill others and trying to defeat others. Because of these qualities, we bring sorrow and difficulties to others. However, we have to try to bring peace to all other lives, and to do that we first have to make our own inner heart (c\\alb) peaceful. The four yugas are practically over. This is the Kali yutja.1 Two hundred million years have passed by. During this time several wars have taken place. Each war has oc-curred out of desire for women, politics, positions, and titles, out of desire to capture other kingdoms, land, and wealth. The puranas show that the wars between kingdoms came about in this manner. Men fought and a king became a beggar and a beggar became a king. The world has contin-ued in this way for a long time. These have been written down as puranas. A person was once a king and now he is a purana, an ancient epic. They were written as stories or histories of men and now they are considered to be the stories or history of God. What these stories consist of, however, are battles caused by the desire for titles, attach-ments, wealth, and women. Now they are considered to be battles fought by gods. For two hundred million years, wars have occurred over and over again. There has never been a time without war,-1. In Hinduism, there are four ages or eras of the world, each being shorter, darker, and less righteous than the previous one. The last, the present age, is the Kali yuga."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"To Live As a Human Being 223 there has never been a time when one kingdom is not at-tempting to take over another kingdom. Now there are no more kingdoms, and we have come to the state of democ-racy. From a government by the people, we have come to a government by murder. This has taken over the world and is called socialism. Socialism is governing through murder, through burning, destroying, and killing others. One person after another is killed. Historically, these changes have taken place in two hundred million years. More people have died than are alive in the world today. Millions of people died in wars and their corpses fill the earth. The dead cattle, donkeys, horses, monkeys, and human beings outnumber the living. Very few lives are left, but the wars have not ended. The wars will not end until this yuija comes to an end. What will happen in the next yugctf What will we see at the end of this? Nothing. Man will have destroyed himself. He has already destroyed and devoured so many animals. There is no goodness left. Cities have become jungles and jungles have become cities. Cemeteries have become cities and cities have become cemeteries. Land has become ocean and ocean has become land. Humans have turned to beasts and beasts have become like humans. Monkeys have begun to be dressed in clothes and humans have discarded their clothes and run naked in the woods. Many, many kinds of changes have taken place. Monkeys from the jungle have come into the cities to per-form in the circus and to do other kinds of work, while the human-monkeys have discarded everything and retreated into the woods to find peace. Everything has changed. Everything is different and strange. When we look at this and reflect upon it, we realize how much there is yet to learn. These events are not the real wars,- all the battles are within oneself. What we see around us is not the city, all the cities are within us. This is not"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"224 To Die Before Death heaven,- heaven is within us. This is not hell,- hell is only within us. These are not our relatives,- our relatives are within us in the form of love. The qualities born of compassion are our true relatives. The people around us are not our blood ties. Our true blood ties are the trust, equanimity, and peace that fill compassion and flow out of it. These qualities are what are truly connected to the heart. They are the form of love. We have to look at each aspect of our life in this way. If we open up each thing and look, we will see how much beauty lies there. When a flower opens up, it reveals its fragrance and its beauty. In the same way, when we attain clarity in each situation, the beauty, fragrance, and qualities that arise will bring such bliss. This beauty will be seen in the face. We should look at each enemy or person we dislike in the same way. When we look at a little child, we should see the same beauty. When we look at a very big person, that beauty is there. When we see a youth, that beauty is there. We should ponder and reflect upon each thing. There is no use in talking. Speech is useless. Only the bliss and peace that flows out of the inner heart like the fragrance flows out of the flower, only this will bring peace. Only this is fragrant. This will emerge from the inner heart of every child. If we want to have peace, help others attain peace, and destroy the demons of difficulties and losses in this world, then we ourselves have to attain peace. We have to make our hearts peaceful and then manifest it on the outside. If there is water in the pond, it is easy to drink. But if there is no water in the pond, how can we drink? We will not go there anymore. Similarly, only if peace exists in our hearts will others come and attain peace. They can take from our hearts and benefit from it. If we have not found equanim-ity, peace, and tranquility, how can we give it to others? Like"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"To Live As a Human Being 225 a pond without water, we will have nothing to give. We have to develop compassion, love, benevolence, generosity, and mercy within us and demonstrate it to others. Our inner hearts are very small. God is enormous. He is in everything that moves and everything that does not move. But the place in which He dwells is as small as an atom within an atom, a particle within a particle. As our wisdom grows and increases, our inner heart will become smaller and smaller. As it gets smaller and smaller its light and resplendence will increase. If we become small that light, that perfection, will become big. If we become big, that will become small. This is the way it is. We have to think about this. Precious children, each one of you, please look at your hearts. You should search for the qualities and inherent characteristics of God. That is our wealth. That is our life's wealth, the perfect treasure. We should hold on to this and attain peace. We are struggling like travellers without water in a desert. Today this is the way it is in a heart without love, in a heart without compassion, in a world without mercy. In this hell-like earth, where man lives without unity and peace, we are wandering about searching for truth. A few people are searching for truth and goodness in this world, and because of this search they encounter many difficulties. They en-counter more bad than good, but they have to continue to search for the truth. Precious children, each child must reflect and accept what is good. My love and greetings (salams) to all of you. Please forgive my faults. I may have spoken with or without knowing and with or without realizing. I ask forgiveness for these faults.

The mind, desire, and thoughts are the things that will torture and kill us. The illnesses that will cause us difficulty are living with us. They are pricking us and causing pain. We should re-move these thorns. These are the qualities we retain because of our lack of realization. If we remove these qualities, our illnesses will be cured and we will have peace. We must think about this. Jeweled lights of my eyes, we need patience, content-ment, trust in God, and the ability to praise God in all situations. Patience is very important in our lives. We also need faith, certitude, and proper conduct. Our death will certainly come some day. Some day we will have judgment. Some day, depending on what we have searched for and acquired, we will receive either heaven or hell. We will receive a decision or a judgment. No matter how long we may live, the world we live in does not belong to us; neither does the place we dwell in belong to us. This is merely a school where we have come to study about birth and death, good and evil, heaven and hell, man and God, human beings (insan) and beasts (hayawans), creation and death, beauty and ugliness, and happiness and sorrow. We have to take account of all this and learn. Within this learning, we should understand what is what. We should search within this to understand good and bad, birth and death. We should assess all these things. It is through this learning that we should become people of pure faith (mu'mins) and die before death. We should study hard so that we die as ones with pure faith and not as ignorant satans or as animals. Before the angels Munkar and Naklr (g) ask the questions in the grave, we should have developed the goodness that can give the answers. We should adopt each quality of God, understand it, work at it, cultivate it, and receive the benefit from it."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"To Live As a Human Being 227 Then from these qualities, the answers can be given to the angels who write down the good and the bad that you do.

You will be awakened on the Day of Resurrection, but if we die before death, all the questioning will be over, and we will have understood death and everything else. We should die as ones with pure faith before our physical death, and then we will go to a place where we cannot die. We will put to death the place where we were born and the place where we will die and depart to a place of deathlessness. From this place we will speak to God. The questioning about good and bad will then be completed. We have come here to gather these answers. We emerged from God as light and we came here to the earth as human beings. When we die, we leave as a corpse. When we return to Him, we should be a fragrance,- if we die a physical death, we are just a corpse. We should change this form. We came from there as a light. We came to the earth and changed into Adam, or man. Now we have to become true human beings with wisdom. In our lifetime, we have to transform into beings filled with the grace of God. We have to learn what we came here to learn, we have to extract this learning from the world and leave as people with pure faith (mu'tnins). One who has pure faith is a being of perfect purity and resplendence. When we accomplish this and go there, we will be God's son, a being with resplendent fragrance.

What is true prayer? His actions, His qualities, His conduct, His worship, and His sound should go and pray to Him. That is worship ('ibadat). We must dispel the part that is us, and that which is Him must pray to Him. A flower can only give its own fragrance. Is this not so? The fragrance of a flower is what the flower should give. Only a jasmine can give the fragrance of a jasmine. The fragrance of Allah has to be given only by Allah—that is true prayer. Other than this fragrance, the smell of man and the stench of the base desires cannot reach that state. When the fragrance of the good thoughts of Allah, His ninety-nine powers (wilayat) and three thousand benevolent qualities emanate from our inner heart—that is prayer. That fragrance will reach Him.
