Th is famous Persian mystic was born in Hamadhān in a.h. 490 or 492 (a.d. 1096/1098) and was executed in the same town in 525/1131 on the charge of heresy.1 Hamadhān in northwest Iran, on the route connecting Khurāsān and Baghdād, was a major cultural center in medieval Persia and the home of many scholars. It took pride in having been the home of the philosopher Avicenna (a.d. 980–1037) whom ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt held in high regard. Although no biographical records from the time of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt survive, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s extant works, as well as references to him by later authors, provide some information on his life and thought.2 During his short life he composed books and treatises on a number of subjects ranging from mysticism to mathematics, natural sciences, grammar and semantics, Arabic literature, commentary on the Qurʾān, and the nature of prophecy. Most of these works were written in Arabic, the scholarly language of Islam. Only his works on mysticism survived the Mongol invasion of the thirteenth century. Our knowledge of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s learning and infl uence is limited to what we can deduce from his treatises and personal letters. Th e letters follow the question and answer (masāʾil wa ajwiba) literary tradition of medieval times; they present the questions posed to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt by his associates and disciples. Th e letters provide insight into ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s immediate intellectual milieu and the nature of the issues and debates that concerned its members.1 All translations from other languages to English are mine unless indicated otherwise. Source citations appear where the original text is mentioned and not at the end of the English translation. For English translations by others the citation note is placed at the end of the translated quotation. All transliterations from Arabic and Persian are based on the model provided in the International Journal of Middle East Studies. When transliterating Arabic terms and names, I have followed the Arabic table of sounds, while with Persian words and names I have adhered to the Persian. 2 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt al-Hamadhānī, “Sakwa-l-Garib ʿAni l-ʾawtan ʿila ʿUlamāʾ-l-Buldān,” translated and edited by Mohammed ben Abd el-Jalil in Journal Asiatique (Janvier-Mars, 1930): 4–6."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"introduction2 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt came from a family of renowned shāfi ʿī jurists, and like his father and grandfather before him, he held lectures for his disciples and had a wide following in Hamadhān and among some of the Saljūq court nobles.3 Nevertheless, he did not defi ne himself in terms of any specifi c creed, nor did his views on faith adhere to the orthodox interpretations of Islam and the Qurʾān. He wrote about all religions as diff erent paths that led one to God.4 Enjoying a solid scholarly background in Islamic religious sciences, he took issue with the perspective that interpreted faith through the teachings of the sharīʿa. He explained that sharīʿa promoted “habitude” (ʿādat) and abiding by preconceived notions of the “unseen” (ʿālam al-ghayb).5 Th e complexity of thought and expression encountered in his writing poses a great challenge to the reader and requires careful analysis. Scholarship on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is limited. Th e most famous medieval commentary on his Tamhīdāt (Introductions), written by Mu\fammad al-\u000eusaynī Abū al-Fat\f \u001fadr al-Dīn Walī Akbar \u001fādiq (720–825/1321–1422) known as Khawājah Banda Nawāz Gīsūdarāz, is an elaboration on selected passages of the original text—a common practice among medieval commentators. Gīsūdarāz was a venerated Chishtī shaykh and an exceptional scholar whose views on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt provide insight on how he was received among Indian Muslim mystics. Contemporary scholarship on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is limited but interesting. Most of these works were written aft er the 1930s, when Mohammed ben Abd el-Jalil published ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s defense treatise, Shakwā al-Gharīb ʿan al-Aw\u0007ān ilā ʿUlamāʾal-Buldān (Th e Complaint of a Stranger Exiled from Home to the Scholars of the Lands).6 In 1960s, ʿAfīf ʿUsayrān and ʿAlīnaqī Munzavī edited ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s corpus. Th ese contributions have encouraged scholarship on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. In the following chapters I shall elaborate themes mainly taken from the Tamhīdāt—generally considered ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s magnum opus—and I shall also utilize his other works. Th e Tamhīdāt describes an esoteric kind of “knowing,” which refl ects ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s 3 Th e shāfi ʿī school of jurisprudence is attributed to Al-Shāfi ʿī (a.d. 767–820). His genealogy identifi es him as both a Qurayshī and a relative of the Prophet as attested in his name: Al-Imām Abū ʿAbdallāh Mu\fammad ibn Idrīs ibn al-ʿAbbās ibn ʿUthmān ibn Shāfi ʿ ibn al-Sāʿib ibn ʿUbayd ibn ʿAbd Yazīd ibn Hāshim ibn al-Mu!!alib ibn ʿAbd Manāf ibn Qu\"ayy al-Qurashī. 4 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt al-Hamadhānī, Tamhīdāt, 4th ed., edited by ʿAfīf ʿUsayrān (Tehran: Manūchehrī, 1991), pp. 21–22; henceforth cited as Tamhīdāt.5 Ibid., sec. 419, pp. 320–21.6 Henceforth referred to as Shakwā al-Gharīb."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"introduction3intimations on the unseen. Th e unseen (ghayb) is the mystery of God and His hidden realm. Th is realm is inaccessible to human reason and is thus unknowable. Moreover, attributes concealed within the ghayb are normally hidden from men. God reveals these attributes to men only as He wishes. Th e Qurʾān is one such instance. In ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt the unseen consists of innumerable “worlds” that are experienced intermittently by the wayfarer. Th ese realms become accessible to the wayfarer aft er he has experienced “mystical death” (mawt-i maʿnawī). Mystical death is not synonymous with annihilation (fanāʾ); it is the preliminary stage before fanāʾ. It is the stage when the consciousness of the wayfarer is transcended but not annihilated and is in the consciousness that he perceives to be the consciousness of God. My research demonstrates how, in the work of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, knowledge of the unseen and death are interconnected. My methodology in approaching this theme is based on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s treatment of death in his own writing with a focus on the Tamhīdāt. I consider death and gnosis through an intertextual reading of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s texts. I use secondary references in order to create a context for his views on these subjects. My discussion is organized in six chapters, as follows. In the fi rst chapter, I provide an overview of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s life and discuss works by him and works about him. Most of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s early writings are lost. Th e authorship of some of the texts that are attributed to him is open to dispute, but scholars agree that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is the undisputed author of the Tamhīdāt (Introductions), Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq (Th e Essence of Reality), Maktūbāt (Letters), and Shakwā al-Gharīb ʿan al-Aw\u0007ān ilā ʿUlamāʾ al-Buldān (Th e Complaint of a Stranger Exiled from Home to the Scholars of the Lands). Th ese are the main texts that I have used. In the fi rst chapter I also refer to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s own death and discuss the primary sources that describe his imprisonment and execution. Very little is known about ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s personal life, and information on his death is limited. His defense treatise, Shakwā al-Gharīb, which he composed during his imprisonment in Baghdād, is a valuable resource. Th is document is an apologia that contains information on the author’s life and works, some of which have been lost to us. It also tells us about the charge of heresy that was brought against him. Th e second chapter concerns the discussions that ensued aft er ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s release from prison. His apologia aroused strong reactions"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"introduction4among some of his students and associates who were not able to justify his appeals for freedom. Th ey saw a contradiction between ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s earlier resolve on death and his later plea for freedom and return to his homeland Hamadhān. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt responded to these objections by explaining that the exile and the captivity that the Shakwā al-Gharīb refers to are a metaphoric intimation of the forlorn state of the soul. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt turns to the familiar topoi of homeland and exile that appear in mystical literature in order to explain his physical imprisonment at the hands of his adversaries. His plight is reminiscent of the incarceration of other signifi cant thinkers who used prison as an occasion to contemplate the existential predicament of man. Accordingly, this chapter provides a comparison between ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s defense, Plato’s Apology for Socrates, and the visionary recitals of Avicenna. Th ese works were produced while their authors, who were incarcerated by state authorities, refl ected on the imprison-ment of the soul in the realm of matter. Th e third chapter provides an analysis of death as a state of consciousness, as discussed by ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. In the Tamhīdāt, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that he has experienced death while alive and refers to this condition as “mystical death.” In this context, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s understanding of death is not in accord with Islam’s classical inter-pretation of death. Th e Tamhīdāt is an essential text in my research because it focuses on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s treatment of mystical death and provides an epistemology of the lights that appear to the way -farer aft er he has experienced this kind of death. As I will explain in chapter three, the lights that he sees aft er death represent God’s attributes and are the manifestation of the non-comparable light of God. Although ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt does not explain how he prepares for mystical death, he elaborates on the consciousness that he attains in this state and further describes this consciousness in relation to his visionary experiences. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussions are signifi cant because they depict death as both a personal as well as a cosmological event that is continuous. To invoke death and to rush forth greeting it, as is the case with ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, is an entanglement with one’s own self. Death is an individual experience because it involves no one else but the person who is undergoing the experience. Moreover, death delimits one’s response to the inescapability of the single most inevitable occurrence in life. Death fi nds cosmological dimensions for those who, like ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, believe in the existence of the ghayb and see death as the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"introduction5threshold to it. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt considers death to be a path that takes a person to his or her humanity. In the Tamhīdāt he refers to an out-of-body experience of death, which has brought him in contact with infi nite realms of knowledge. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt claims to have based his insights on personal experience of the realms past death. Accordingly, his writing is fi lled with discussions about this form of death and this kind of gnosis. In the Tamhīdāt, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt sets forth a detailed analysis of the relationship between death, knowledge, and identity. Just as the soul experiences special worldly realms that are called “being in this world” (\u0005u\tūr), it experiences other special realms that are called “realms of the tomb” (a\u0005wāl-i gūr), and “realms of dooms-day” (a\u0005wāl-i qiyāmat). It is through death, in the latter sense, that the soul journeys on into these realms. Mystics who have experienced death while still living in the world of matter come to see realms of the tomb and of doomsday and go beyond these into unforeseen territories. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt discusses death, the unseen, and consciousness by means of an eschatology that has its genesis in a structured dualism. Th e fourth chapter will develop this subject. It will examine ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussion of the spectrum of lights he saw while in the special realm of experience. Th ese lights become discernible as the wayfarer enters the realm of death. Th ey convey God’s attributes of “mercy” and “might” through the lights of Mu\fammad and Satan. Th ese lights and their juxtaposition are among the mysteries that are unveiled to the wayfarer. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt establishes this dualism by means of color metaphors and visions of good and evil. He explains that in the realm of God’s attributes there are two lights: sunlight and moonlight. Sunlight comes from the Prophet Mu\fammad and moon-light from Satan. Sunlight is the “shadow” of God, and moonlight refl ects the light of the sun.7 Th e world of natural elements is a refl ec-tion of this dualistic “shadow play.” Placed against this back ground, man holds a distinct place: he contains both “light” and “shadow.” He is light since he is the depository of the light of God; and he is shadow because, as a human, he is enclosed in the frame of body and fl esh. Th is discussion provides the key to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s perspectives on good and evil; creation, generation, corruption, and death; humanity; and the nature of prophecy.Tamhīdāt, sec. 272–73, pp. 212–13, and sec. 326, p. 248."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"introduction6 Chapter fi ve evaluates the reception of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt among his contemporaries and successors. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussions on the attributes of God and the wayfarer’s position in relation to the lights convey his understanding of death as a process of self-identifi cation. His views on eschatology and the unseen are referred to by mystics aft er him. Rūzbihān Baqlī (a.d. 1128–1209) and Shihāb al-Dīn Suhrawardī (a.d. 1154–1191), who lived close to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s time, aspired to his views on this subject. Najm al-Dīn Rāzī (a.d. 1177–1256) also referred to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s mystical doctrines. However, in general, mystics of the Arab and the Iranian worlds who came aft er ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt were wary of discussing him openly and extensively since the Saljūq state had called him a heretic and ordered his death. Chapter fi ve will evaluate the legacy of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt with special attention to his reception among the early Indian Chishtī scholars. Khawāja Banda Nawāz Gīsūdarāz and his contemporary mystic Masʿūd Bakk are parti cularly important in this discussion. Gīsūdarāz utilized ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s teachings in training his own disciples. In fact, he considered ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt to be so profound and complex that he deemed the novices among his students incapable of approaching his texts or his ideas. Th erefore, Gīsūdarāz forbade his beginning students access to the Tamhīdāt and used this text only in teaching his advanced disciples. Gīsūdarāz’s detailed and elaborate commentary, Shar\u0005-i Tamhīdāt, is intended for such readers among the Chishtīs. Chapter six concerns itself with samāʿ, listening to music in order to connect with the spiritual realms. As a spiritual practice, samāʿ was the subject of controversial debates during the medieval-period. Th ose who vouched for samāʿ considered it an opportunity to approach God. Its opponents, however, emphasized the role of Satan in inciting fancies during samāʿ that led the faithful astray. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his teacher A\fmad Ghazzālī were famous for both their adherence to samāʿ and the literature that they produced on this subject. A\fmad Ghazzālī’s treatise Bawāriq al-Ilmāʿ fī al-Radd ʿAlā Man Yu\u0005arrimu al-Samāʿ (Th e Lightning-Flashes of Indication Concerning the Refutation of Th ose Who Declare Audition Forbidden in General) was received as a classical manifesto in defense of samāʿ.8 Th e early Chishtīs followed the discussions of these mystics in giving shape to their understanding of samāʿ.8 Henceforth referred to as Bawāriq al-Ilmāʿ."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"introduction7 In conclusion, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt argues that the visionary apperception of the unseen calls into question the categorical confi dence we place in the rational processes of cognition, reason, and the individ ual’s articulation of the self in relation to faith. Th e incommensurability of the realities that the mystic observes through death call attention to the individuality of the mystic/wayfarer: namely, the “position” of the wayfarer as he travels the mystical path and his manner of “walking” the path. Th is subject can be approached in diff erent relationships and in the context of the wayfarer’s response to the mysteries that are unveiled to him. Th ese include his perception of the lights that he sees, as well as his understanding and response to the manifestation of God’s attributes. Th e present volume sets forth ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussion on these subjects through his understanding of mystical death and its accompanying mode of perception. Death takes the wayfarer away from his position of certitude in regard to ontological truths to a realm of consciousness where he experiences mysteries of the unseen as new and ever-extending processes. Th e confl uence of his consciousness and these spectacles of protean truths signifi es the mutability of the position of the wayfarer apropos himself in the capacity of a “knowing,” “self-suffi cient” subject. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains his mystical insights in terms of lights whose function, as he declares in the beginning of the Tamhīdāt, is to assert the existence of a hidden truth. He explains that the wayfarer understands the “reality” past “appearance” as he ventures through the gate of mysteries and goes beyond what lies therein: “If you set out, you arrive, and you see.” But the extensions of this reality are beyond comprehension because they are the refl ection of the light of God, which constitutes all of creation and is infi nitely unfolding. And yet, to set one’s self in motion, to go, to arrive, and to see, is indeed a mystery contingent upon a “going” that is a relentless “seeing” and “arriving.” He defi nes these realities as manifestations of the light of God and describes “seeing” as a mode of understanding the unseen (ghayb).

It is divided into three sections (1) Introducing the Writings of ʿAyn al-Qu\tāt (2) ʿAyn al-Qu\tāt’s Life, and (3) ʿAyn al-Qu\tāt’s Philosophical Ideas. In these chapters, ʿUsayrān provides a background on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s works, his teachers as well as his teachings, his mystical unveilings and miracles, and his views on knowledge and its acquisition. ʿUsayrān’s research, which appeared almost thirty years aft er the publication of Shakwā al-Gharīb by Mohammed ben Abd el-Jalil, revitalized the scholarship on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. In the years following the fi rst publication of the Tamhīdāt, ʿUsayrān and his colleague ʿAlīnaqī Munzavī’s work stimulated the development of invaluable scholarship on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. In his work on \u000eusayn ibn Man\"ūr al-\u000eallāj (d. a.d. 922), Louis Massignon (a.d. 1883–1962) refers to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt as the disciple of A\fmad ibn Mu\fammad Ghazzālī (d. a.d. 1126), who was infl uenced by the teachings of \u000eallāj.15 Massignon is most interested in ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s interpretation of Satan. In his classical work En Islam Iranien, Aspects Spirituels et Philosophiques, Henry Corbin (a.d. 1903–78) mentioned ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt in a footnote as the favorite disciple of A\fmad Ghazzālī.16 Corbin and Fritz Meier mention ʿAyn 14 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt al-Hamadhānī, “Tamhīdāt” in Muannafāt-i ʿAyn al-Qu\tāt al-Hamadhānī, edited by ʿAfīf ʿUsayrān (Tehran: Tehran University Press, 1962), pp. 1–528.15 A\fmad Ghazzālī is best known for his treatise Sawāni\u0005, which was edited and published by Helmut Ritter in 1942. His other writings consist of sermons, treatises, and commentaries on the work of his elder brother Mu\fammad, and a treatise on samāʿ, which is discussed at length in the fi nal chapter of this book.

Dabashi argues that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is acutely aware of writing as a staging of ideas and a mode of presenting them. In one of his personal letters, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, mockingly, compares himself to the poets and declares “Th e best poetry is the most untrue and the verbose is the twin of the poets”.21 Although ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt has received attention in recent years, the scholarship on him is still new.

Yāqūt describes ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt as a scholar and man of letters, and refers to his father and grandfather as renowned judges. We know that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was born in Hamadhān but the exact date of his birth is open to dispute. In his writings, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt never refers to himself by his name, ʿAbdallāh, nor does he identify with his family’s city of origin Miyānjī. He calls himself ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. I have not seen any biographer explain the etymology of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s honorary name or explain in what sense this name applies to him since we do not have any evidence that he held the position of a judge. Th is name seems to have some relation to the fact of his genealogy: both his father and grandfather were judges and it could mean he is the eye of the judges or the visionary (eye) who was born to these other judges. Th e nickname itself could mean the source for the judges, or the very eye of the judges, or someone who is above the judges to whom they should look. It could also mean a holy warrior who died for his convictions. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refers to himself by this name and expresses pride in his hometown of Hamadhān. Like Yāqūt, ʿAbd al-Karīm ibn Mu\fammad al-Samʿānī, the author of Kitāb al-Ansāb, refers to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s family under the entry on the city of al-Miyānjī.24 Al-Samʿānī does not mention ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt but talks about his father, Abū Bakr Mu\fammad, and grandfather, ʿAlī ibn al-\u000easan, as learned scholars and judges from Miyānjī. According to al-Samʿānī, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s grandfather was famous not only in his hometown but also in Baghdād where he had studied jurisprudence with a number of renowned scholars.25 Both al-Samʿānī and Yāqūt 23 Mohammed ben Abd el-Jalil, “La šakwā”; in Journal Asiatique (Janvier-Mars, 1930), pp. 6–7; henceforth cited as Abd el-Jalil, La šakwā.

Th e contemporary scholar Mohammed ben Abd el-Jalil makes an observation about the alleged “martyrdom” of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s grandfather. In his footnote on this discussion,29 Abd el-Jalil explains that the word “ustushhida,” which is used by medieval historians in reference to the death of ʿAlī ibn al-\u000easan, does not necessarily convey the sense of dying or being put to death on account of one’s religious convictions. Th e word can refer to any unnatural death that results from accident, depression, or even seasickness. Considering Abd el-Jalil’s observation and the fact that very little is known about ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s family and family relations, it would be wise to be cautious in entertaining the assumption that “martyrdom,” in its familiar sense, was the fate of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s grandfather. Al-Samʿānī describes ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s father as a “handsome judge” who in the company of his father attended lectures by prominent scholars and was introduced to sophisticated teachings at an early age.30 As a parent, Abū Bakr Mu\fammad held an intimate intellectual relationship with his son. He appreciated ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s ideas and held an important place in his life. At one point in the Tamhīdāt, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes his father among his circle of associates at a gathering as follows:I know you have heard this story: one night, my father and I, and a group of the imāms [religious leaders] from our city were at the house of the mystic Muqaddam. We were dancing and Abū Saʿīd Tirmidhī was singing some verses. My father was staring.

In this instance, he and the others were in the state of expansion (bas\u0007) when he had a vision of his son’s deceased teacher A\fmad Ghazzālī. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes his father among the intimate friends of God who share in the gift s of prophetic insight.32 Th ese gift s that he identifi es as the qualities of prophethood come in three categories: (1) exceptional abilities such as reviving the dead (2) visionary knowledge of the aff airs of the doomsday and heaven and hell, and (3) knowledge of the aff airs of the unseen in the state of wakefulness. Th is is the context in which he repeats the story of his father among the dancing mystics as evidence that he is among those who partake of prophetic gift s such as visionary insights in the state of wakefulness.33My father is also such a person. One day, he was standing on his feet as I and a group of the equitables were at the house of mystic Muqaddam. We were dancing and Abū Saʿīd Tarshīzī was singing some verses. My father, wide awake, said: “I saw master A\fmad Ghazzālī dancing with you and his attire was such and such.” He was awake when he said that, not asleep. But I did not see that, nor did the others. What is your reaction if someone said the judge who keeps usurping the wealth of the others and is deceitful, this noble state does not happen to him? Did my father have any doubt about what he saw? Did he have any doubt about this state? At this juncture, he perceived with certainty how Mu\fammad saw Gabriel and the others did not. But, my father saw this once.

Th e ability to have visions of the unseen can apply to anyone among humans, good or bad, as God desires. Th e reference to the deceitful and the corrupt is to explain the gradations to metaphysical abilities and also to emphasize that God’s plans are mysterious. His father is among the select who are comparable to the Prophet when he saw Gabriel. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is said to have had a son named A\fmad but we do not have any further information about his family life.

If in fact A\fmad is his son, these instances indicate that he seemed to have not spent very much time with his family although they all lived in Hamadhān. Rather, he was in the company of his fellow mystics whom, as his letters explain, he addressed in an intimate tone of camaraderie, using proverbs and colloquial language to respond to their equally intimate diction, amidst serious theological discussions. Th ere is no surviving information on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s mother.

Th ey have compared his age at the time of writing the Shakwā al-Gharīb, which the author states as thirty–three years old, with his date of execution.36 We know that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt completed the Shakwā al-Gharīb while he was in prison in Baghdād. He was later released from prison and returned to Hamadhān but he was once again arrested and this time sent to the gallows. It has been assumed that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was executed shortly aft er his release from the Baghdād prison; therefore, it has been presumed that he was born in 492/1098, or thirty–three years earlier than the date of his execution.

Th is statement cannot be confi rmed with certainty on the basis of the limited and contradictory information we have available. However, Munzavī’s observation is sound when he considers the later date (a.d. 1098) to be questionable. First, the discrepancy in the information provided in Majmaʾ al-Ādāb makes it impossible to take for granted the conventionally accepted a.d. 1098 as ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s date of birth. Moreover, aft er ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt had completed the defense treatise at age thirty–three, some time must have passed before this document was received by his designated addressees—whose identity is not revealed—who in turn must have taken some time to agree on his sentence. Added to this is the physical distance between Hamadhān and Baghdād that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt traveled back to his hometown. Considering these factors, it is diffi cult to imagine that he was executed in the same year that he composed his defense treatise. Moreover, there is evidence from the period aft er ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s release from prison in Baghdād, that suggests he had resumed his normal activities and was, for instance, in correspondence with his disciples.

See “La šakwā”, p. 6. His research does not include any reference to the source of this information, although in his research Abd el-Jalil is precise with citing his references. Th erefore, he must have compared ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s date of execution with his age at the time of writing the Shakwā al-Gharīb. Ra\fīm Farmanish, in his analysis of the medieval and the modern sources on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, notes that only one medieval source, Fawā!ī’s Majmaʿ al-Ādāb, mentions ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s date of birth, giving it as 1098/492. See, Ra\fīm Farmanish, Shar\u0005-i A\u0005wāl va Āthār-i ʿAyn al-Qu\tāt (Tehran: Āft āb, 1959), pp. 8–9. ʿUsayrān agrees with Abd el-Jalil and Farmanish on this date. However, ʿAlīnaqī Munzavī, adds a new dimention to the debate on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s date of birth. Munzavī explains that the author of Majmaʿ al-Ādāb had two entries on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s date of birth (490–92/1096–98), but the earlier date was omitted in the edition that ʿUsayrān and Farmanish had consulted.

According to Munzavī, since we know that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt had written Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq at age twenty–four, the reference in this letter is a valid indication that he was thirty–four years old when he wrote the letter.39 On the basis of this evidence, plus the information in Majmaʾ al-Ādāb, Munzavī concludes that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was indeed born in a.d. 1096 and at the time of his execution was thirty–fi ve years old. Th ese discussions demonstrate that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s date of birth cannot be determined with certainty.

Arberry’s translation of this passage is as follows:Any man wishing to check the accuracy of what I have stated, in all that I have remarked both already and hereaft er, may seek out my works, examine their contents, and so scrutinize them as to master and fully to exhaust all the ideas expressed in them.

He names Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq as his last completed work of this period. He also makes reference to the ʿAlāʾī treatise and the Treatise on Aesthetics as projects in progress. Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq was completed in 517/1123. It is a book in one hundred chapters and includes topics on the essence and the attributes of God, prophethood, mysticism, the opening of the inner sight, and the ways of understanding the unseen and the aft erlife. In the introduction to Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that he began working on the question of prophethood at age twenty–one when he was writing Ghāyat al-Ba\u0005th ʿan Maʿnī al-Baʿth (Th e End of Inquiry on the Meaning of the Mission). He was not satisfi ed with this treatise nor did it answer the needs of his disciples for a comprehensive discussion of prophethood.48 Th erefore, he tells us he wrote Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq to compensate for this shortcoming. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt further explains that his discussions in Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq concern a kind of knowledge that is experienced personally and immediately. Th is 46 Arberry, A Sufi Martyr, pp. 70–72.47 He demonstrates his taste for poetry by citing from the one thousand lines of the erotic-mystical verses that he composed in ten days. In the section Shakwā: Defense against Heresy, I will discuss how he considers the taste for poetry as a metaphor for the supra-rational quality of understanding the unseen. 48 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq (Tehran: Tehran University Press, 1961), pp. 3–4."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"chapter one20knowledge is inspirational and cannot be acquired by rational reasoning, although it can be explained by reason, syllogism, and analogy. For example, the realities of the unseen are supra-rational and are disclosed to the prophets while they are in special realms of consciousness. Th e prophets, in turn, communicate these realities to others who are possessed of reason and can understand them. Th e faith in prophethood and the relationship between the prophet and the believers are, thus, diff erent from the prophets’ unmediated and inspired faith in the unseen. In addition to the works that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt lists in the Shakwā al-Gharīb, there are other writings that he does not mention; he does not make any reference to his personal letters, known as the Maktūbāt, nor to the Tamhīdāt. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt omitted these titles, either to avoid complicating his defense by introducing other writings to his hostile judges, or because he preferred to limit his arguments in the defense to sources that his adversaries were familiar with and had used to condemn him.49 In fact, he organized his defense as a response to their evaluation of the ideas that he had expressed in his youth. It seems likely that his treatise on the nature of prophethood, Ghāyat al-Ba\u0005th ʿan Maʿnā al-Baʿth (Th e End of Inquiry on the Meaning of the Mission), was used as a major piece of evidence against him. He explains:May God guard him who turns his ear to me, that I may disclose to him some part of the crimes committed against me by the hands of fate. For a group of contemporary theologians—may God succor them perfectly and ease their way to the best of both worlds; may He remove all rancour from their breasts, and furnish them with rectitude in all their aff airs—have disapproved of me on account of certain phrases published in a treatise which I composed twenty years ago. My purpose in writing it was to explain certain states claimed by the Sufis, the appearance of which depends upon the manifestation of a stage beyond the stage of reason.50By emphasizing that he was very young when he wrote these texts, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was able to defend his writings as immature and open to misinterpretation. At the same time, by bringing his age into focus, he was calling attention to the exceptional intelligence and sophistication that provoked envy and anger among his adversaries.49 Th ere are other texts whose titles do not appear in the Shakwā al-Gharīb but later scholars have attributed them to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. I will refer to those later.50 Shakwā al-Gharīb, pp. 31–2. Cf.

Th ere are a number of manuscripts available of both of these texts. ʿAfīf ʿUsayrān lists seven manuscripts at libraries in Iran, Turkey, and at the British Museum that contain ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s letters.51 ʿUsayrān and Munzavī have edited and printed the Maktūbāt in three volumes. Th e fi rst and the second volumes were fi rst printed in Beirut in 1969 and 1972; the third volume was published in Tehran in 1983. Th e Maktūbāt is the correspondence between ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his disciples and associates. Th ese associates include Saljūq high-ranking administrators ʿAzīz al-Dīn (472–527/1080–1133) and Kāmil al-Dawlah, as well as ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s teacher A\fmad Ghazzālī. Th ese letters are focused on the intellectual discussions they were engaged in, such as the interpretation of the \u0005adīth and the Qurʾān as well as the analysis of the psychological states they experienced on the mystical path. On occasion, there is mention of the political climate under the Saljūqs. Th e majority of the letters are written as responses to the questions that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s disciples asked him; the same arguments are taken up again in the Tamhīdāt. Th e Maktūbāt is a signifi cant resource in learning more about ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s ideas, his relationship with his disciples and associates, and his attitude toward writing as an activity; however, they do not reveal much about the author’s family life.52 ʿAbd al-Ra\fmān Jāmī in Nafa\u0005āt al-Uns min \ba\tarāt al-Quds describes the degree of intimacy between ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his teacher, A\fmad Ghazzālī, by saying that they wrote many letters to each other.53 It is clear that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s letters were treated as documents of learning that could be studied during his time and aft er he was gone: the letters were duplicated, disseminated among designated readers, and fi led for future reference. In a letter responding to a recipient who is concerned about not having received a specifi c letter in the past, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains: “I send the writings to my son A\fmad—may God protect him—I do not know whom he sends them to.

In the letter above, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refers to the person in charge as “my son A\fmad.” Th is person’s identity and his relationship with the author are unclear. While some have speculated that he is ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s son, others disagree on the ground that his son would had been too young to be put in charge of this responsibility. Some have argued that this person could be A\fmad the son of Kāmil al-Dawlah, one of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s associates.55 A\fmad could be any of his disciples who was competent to carry out this important responsibility. Th e mere fact that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refers to this person as “my son” is not proof of any relationship between them except one of aff ection and respect. In most of his writings, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt addresses the reader using terms of endearment—a common practice in his period. Th e fact remains that the letters were treated systematically as an essential part of his teaching and scholarship. Th e TamhīdātWe know that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt completed the Tamhīdāt prior to the writing of Shakwā al-Gharīb. He indicates the date of the completion of Tamhīdāt to be on the ninth of Rajab, which coincided with the ādīnih (Friday) celebration. ʿAfīf ʿUsayrān explains that 521/1127 is the only year ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt could be referring to because that is the only year between the completion of Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq (517/1123) and the writing of Shakwā al-Gharīb (525/1130) when ādīnih falls on the ninth of Rajab. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt abruptly ends the Tamhīdāt on that evening when he is visited by Shaykh Abū ʿAlī ʿĀmilī, who relates to him a dream he had concerning ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt.56 In this dream, the two of them are on their way to see the Prophet Mu\fammad and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is carrying the Tamhīdāt. Th e Prophet examines the book and asks ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt to leave it with him and not to disclose any more secrets. Aft er hearing Shaykh Abū ʿAlī’s dream, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt decides to bring the Tamhīdāt to an end immediately, that is on the 54 Maktūbāt, vol. 1, letter 46, sec. 605, p. 363.55 Maktūbāt, 3: 109.

Mystical secrets, as the term implies, are supposed to be kept secret. In ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s writing, the necessity of withholding information from the reader is a subject that he oft en talks about. Th ree years later he wrote his defense treatise while under arrest. However, in the Shakwā al-Gharīb he makes no reference to the Tamhīdāt. Had he listed the Tamhīdāt in the defense, he would un doubtedly have lost any chance of release from prison. Th e Tamhīdāt is considered ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s most signifi cant work because it is the most comprehensive. It consists of ten chapters on topics of mysticism and describes the wayfarer’s visionary experiences and states of mind at diff erent stages of the person’s development. Th e Tamhīdāt’s ten chapters are:Introducing the First Principle: Th e Diff erence between Acquired Knowledge and Knowledge by ProximityIntroducing the Second Principle: Th e Conditions for the Wayfarer on the Path of GodIntroducing the Th ird Principle: Humans Are Created in Th ree TypesIntroducing the Fourth Principle: Know Yourself in Order to Know GodIntroducing the Fift h Principle: Describing the Five Pillars of IslamIntroducing the Sixth Principle: Reality and the States of LoveIntroducing the Seventh Principle: Th e Reality of the Heart and the SoulIntroducing the Eighth Principle: Mysteries of the Qurʾān and the Secret of the Creation of ManIntroducing the Ninth Principle: An Explanation of the Reality of Faith and FaithlessnessIntroducing the Tenth Principle: Th e Essence and the Reality of the Earth and the Sky Is the Light of Mu\fammad and the Light of SatanTh e fi rst chapter, “Th e Diff erence between Acquired Knowledge and Knowledge by Proximity,” declares the overall focus of the Tamhīdāt, while the following chapters demonstrate how the author has organized the subject of knowledge into diff erent categories. Th e kind of knowledge that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is concerned with, “knowledge by proximity,” manifests itself in its relationship with diff erent levels of reality the presence of which may or may not be acknowledged and perceived by the individual. Th ese realities, as I shall explain in the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"chapter one24following chapters, are not necessarily visible to us, but become discernible as the individual is ready to perceive them. Th e discussions in the Tamhīdāt proceed with a systematic analysis of human nature and its typology.57 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that just as there are diff erent kinds of realities that are perceived at diff erent levels of awareness, there are diff erent kinds of human beings with diff erent aptitudes for perceiving these realities. In this manner, the discussions in the Tamhīdāt advance with a focus on both man and the cosmos. Th e fi nal chapter is on the qualities and expressions of the light of Mu\fammad and the light of Satan. In this discussion, the familiar questions of good and evil, and the right and wrong of the sharīʿa (Islamic law) are disputed. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt argues for a perception of these lights as manifestations of God’s attributes and as expressions of diff erent degrees of awareness. Awareness on a cosmological scale implies insight into the hidden intents of God. On a human level, the awareness of these lights involves the individual’s recognition of the self and his own position on the mystical path apropos the presence of God. Th e wayfarer fi nds access to the realities of the unseen through a death experience that the author calls mystical death. In the Tamhīdāt, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt presents these subjects by elaborating on the insights he has gained in regard to the realities of the unseen (ghayb). Th ese observations defi ne his perception of faith and the Qurʾān, the nature of prophethood, God’s attributes of love and separation, the stages of love, and the reality of death. Th e most important medieval commentary on a work by ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is by Khawājah Banda Nawāz Gīsūdarāz, who analyzed the major themes in the Tamhīdāt. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was an important scholar for the early Chishtī religious leaders and was discussed and written about by the Chishtī scholars who preceded Gīsūdarāz as well as his contemporaries. But these works were not as focused and as comprehensive as his. In the commentary, Gīsūdarāz provided an outline of the discussions in the Tamhīdāt and elaborated ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s approach to mystical unveilings. Th e fi nal chapters of the present study will examine in more detail Gīsūdarāz and his contribution to the scholarship of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and the subject of samāʿ.57 Ibid., pp. 39–56."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"$Ayn al-Qu*t’s Life, Heritage, and Heresy25Works Attributed to ʿAyn al-Qu\tāt Scholars are in agreement that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is the author of the Tamhīdāt, Maktūbāt, Shakwā al-Gharīb ʿan al-Aw\u0007ān ilā ʿUlamāʾ al-Buldān and Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, but there is disagreement as to whether the other texts attributed to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt are defi nitively his. In the following, I refer to these disputed texts. Shar\u0005-i Kalimāt-i Bābā \u000bāhir-i ʿUryān (A Description of the Sayings of Bābā Xāhir ʿUryān) is a lexicon of mystical terminology. ʿUsayrān argues that its plain diction and brief explanations are uncharacteristic of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s sophisticated writing style. Had he composed this work in his youth, ʿUsayrān explains, he would have mentioned it in the Shakwā al-Gharīb along with his other writings from that period.58 Javād Maq\"ūd, the editor of Shar\u0005-i Kalimāt-i Bābā \u000bāhir-i ʿUryān, and ʿAlīnaqī Munzavī support this perspective.59 As Maq\"ūd explains, at one point in the text the author says that he is not from Hamadhān but had merely passed through it once.60 Another disputed work is Yazdān Shinākht (Th e Treatise on Understanding God), which concerns itself with subjects in Islamic theological philosophy. It was initially attributed to Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī (d. a.d. 1191) and was fi rst published in Iran in 1937 under his name.61 Th e Lawāyi\u0005 (Th e Decrees), a treatise on love, is erroneously attributed to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. Ra\fīm Farmanish, the editor of the manuscript, describes the text as ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s homage to his mentor A\fmad Ghazzālī.62 A\fmad Munzavī disputes this attribution and identifi es Warkānī as the author.63 Farmanish, bases his argument on the thematic and stylistic qualities of the manuscript and its arrangement in a compilation, which consists of selections from the Sawāni\u0005, parts of the Tamhīdāt, and a treatise on Greek wisdom.64 According to Farmanish, the inclusion of these independent manuscripts in one collection demonstrates that the compiler selected 58 Ibid., pp. 35–36.59 Maktūbāt, 3: 35–36.60 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt al-Hamadhānī, “Shar\u0005-i Kalimāt-i Bābā \u000bāhir-i ʿUryān,” in Javād Maq\"ūd, Shar\u0005-i A\u0005wāl wa Athār wa Dūbaytīhā-yi Bābā \u000bāhir-i ʿUryān (Tehran: Anjuman-i Āthār-i Millī, 1975), p. 258. 61 Tamhīdāt, p. 37.62 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt al-Hamadhānī, Lawāyi\u0005, 2d ed., edited by Ra\fīm Farmanish (Tehran: Manūchihrī, 1958), introduction, pp. j, d.63 Maktūbāt, 3: 36.64 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt al-Hamadhānī, Lawāyi\u0005, pp. d, h."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"chapter one26them based on a connection he drew between the authors. He further explains that the Lawāyi\u0005 must have been written aft er the death of A\fmad Ghazzālī (a.d. 1126) because the author remembers him as a deceased shaykh.65 Th is would mean that if ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt were the author he would have completed the treatise sometime in the last fi ve years of his life. I contend that there is suffi cient evidence to argue against the attribution of the manuscript to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. Essentially, the Lawāyi\u0005 lacks the intensity that is experienced in the writing of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, especially in the latter years of his life. Th e highly Arabized style of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is recognizable through his constant interjection of verses from the Qurʾān, the \u0005adith, and high Arab literature, in his Persian sentences. Th is type of writing produces a hybrid style that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt compensates for by providing the Persian rendition of the Arabic immediately following the original. In contrast, the Lawāyi\u0005 refers to Arabic phrases far less frequently and rather cites Arabic poetry in between the prose sections; uses words that do not belong in ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s vocabulary; and leaves out words and terms of address that are characteristic of his diction. It is sound to say that the author of the Lawāyi\u0005 was highly infl uenced by Ghazzālī and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and wrote the Lawāyi\u0005 in a style of his own as a response to both authors. In the mid 1970s Bruce Lawrence provided a study of the Lawāyi\u0005, which he introduced as a treatise by the famous Chishtī leader, Qā\u0002ī \u000eamīd al-Dīn Nāgawrī (d. a.d. 1244).66 Lawrence was obviously unaware of the edited manuscript that Farmanish published in 1958. He was, however, referring to the same treatise for I compared the quotations that appear in his study with the Lawāyi\u0005 and determined that he was writing about the same treatise and not another source under this title. Lawrence believed that the manuscript had survived in fragments that appeared in some medieval sources.67 He based his study on medieval bibliographical sources and also *iyāʾ al-Dīn Baranī’s (d. a.d. 1357) Tārīkh Fīrūzshāhī, which identifi ed Nāgawrī as the author and described the Lawāyi\u0005 as a popular mystical treatise that the early Chishtī leaders used in training their disciples. Th is seems to be a plausible conclusion considering the early Chishtī scholars studied the works of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his teacher A\fmad Ghazzālī and aspired to them in formulating their mystical discussions 65 Ibid., p. d.66 Bruce B.

Th e editor of the manuscript, Ra\fīm Farmanish, justifi es this omission by arguing that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt had composed this work shortly before his death and could not have mentioned it in his earlier writings.69 Whereas ʿUsayrān dismisses this work from the list of the writings by ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, ʿAlīnaqī Munzavī considers it misleading to attribute the work to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. Following Kashf al-\u0012unūn, Munzavī attributes this treatise to Tāj al-Dīn Ma\fmūd ibn Khudādād Hamdhānī Ishnawī, who was from Herat and died about thirty years aft er ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. Munzavī provides an annotated bibliography on the contemporary research on Ghāyat al-Imkān fī Dirāyat al-Makān and its disputed authorship.70 Indeed, it is unlikely that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt composed this treatise. Whereas in ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s other writings one always hears echoes of recurring topics, this treatise concerns a theme—the perception of time and space apropos God’s unity and omnipresence—that is not a dominant focus in his writings. Moreover, this text is written primarily in simple Persian prose, while ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s writing style is fi lled with nuance and is mainly in Arabic.68 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt al-Hamadhānī, Lawāyi\u0005, pp. 25, 28.69 Ibid., introduction, pp. b–j.70 Maktūbāt, 3: 36.

A careful analysis of ʿImād al-Dīn’s history and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s defense, the Shakwā al-Gharīb, will shed light on some of the questions that surround his death. Th e accounts by ʿImād al-Dīn and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt have defi ned the focus for the subsequent discussions on his execution. Th ese sources have considered his death either in a political framework, in his association with the members of the court nobility who were no longer in the position of power, or in the context of his mystical views that were branded as heretical. In the Shakwā al-Gharīb, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that his adversaries, who are envious of him, had distorted his words in order to convict him. He explained his views and presented his case in the context of the scholarship he had produced. ʿImād al-Dīn’s historiography, on the other hand, points to the court intrigues and liaisons that lead to the arrest and execution of many individuals, including ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and the author’s own relatives. At the time of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s death, ʿImād al-Dīn, the acclaimed historian of the Saljūq era, was six years old. Members of his immediate family had fi rsthand knowledge of the execution because several of them were intimate friends and followers of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and considered him a just successor to Abū \u000eāmid Mu\fammad Ghazzālī (a.d. 1058–1111), the great theologian-scholar of eleventh-century Saljūq Iran, the author of Mishkāt al-Anwār (Th e Niche of Lights), and the elder brother of A\fmad Ghazzālī (ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s mentor).78 ʿImād al-Dīn’s uncles were part of the intimate circle of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s followers. Th ey are mentioned at several places in ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s letters,79 and in the Tamhīdāt he refers to his correspondence with them.80 ʿImād al-Dīn’s family, the Ālūh, were high-ranking nobles in the court and the administration of Sultan Ma\fmūd.81 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was associated with the court through them as well as other powerful friends. ʿImād al-Dīn’s account, cited below, states that his uncle ʿAzīz al-Dīn’s downfall from power was linked to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s arrest and execution. It is noteworthy that ʿImād al-Dīn begins his narrative on 78 ʿImād al-Dīn, Tārīkh Dawlat Āl Saljūq, p. 141.79 Maktūbāt, 3: 92–93.

His uncle ʿAzīz al-Dīn had been a vizir who declined to continue in that offi ce and became a court advisor to Ma\fmūd. He was ousted in 525/1131 and was executed two years later.82 Th e year of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s execution, 525/1131, witnessed the purging and the execution of a few important statesmen, including ʿAzīz al-Dīn.83 Th ese events aff ected ʿImād al-Dīn’s entire family, who were banished from their hometown, I\"fahān, and forced into exile.84 In his introduction to Kharīdat al-Qar wa Jarīdat al-ʿAr fī Dhikr Fu\talāʾ Ahl Fārs, the editor provides a synoptic background on ʿImād al-Dīn’s family history and explains:85 Th e death of his uncle in Tikrīt was the consequence of political struggles and the confusions that appeared at that time. These difficult circumstances had consequences for the whole family and the youth [ʿImād al-Dīn] witnessed all of these events while he was still young and green.According to ʿImād al-Dīn, Sultan Ma\fmūd’s vizir Qavām al-Dīn Nā\"ir ibn ʿAlī Abī al-Qāsim al-Dargazīnī (d. 527/1133) was responsible 82 Ibn Athīr, Al-Kāmil fī al-Tārīkh (Beirut: Dār \u001fādir, 1965-67), pp. 669–70. Ibn Athīr does not mention ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt but refers to ʿAzīz al-Dīn’s imprisonment and execution in Tikrīt. Th is information appears in the same place as the author reports the end of Ma\fmūd and the rule of his son Malak Dawūd. He records that Ma\fmūd’s vizir Abū al-Qāsim al-Anasābādhī was wary about certain noble members of the government including, Abū Na\"r A\fmad ibn \u000eāmid al-Mustawfī, Anūshtakīn (known as Shīrgīr), his son ʿUmar, and ʿAzīz al-Dīn. Th e latter was arrested and sent to the Mujāhid al-Dīn Bihrūz in Tikrīt. Th ere he was executed. Anūshtakīn and his son, who was a prime minister to Ma\fmūd, were executed in Jamādī al-Ākhar. In the Shawwāl of the same year, a.h. 525, Ma\fmūd fell ill and died in Hamadhān. At the time of his death, he was about twenty seven years old and had reigned for twelve years, nine months and twenty days. His son’s ascendancy to the throne was met with resistance in Hamdhān and the Jibāl. Aft er the unrest subsided, the vizir, Abū al-Qāsim al-Unsābādhī, moved to Rayy to the court of Sultan Sanjar.Ibn Athīr identifi es the vizir Dargazīnī as Anasābādī.

Another source from this period, Tārīkh Dawlat Āl Saljūq, cites a former court vizir, Nūshīrawān Khālid, who explains that he resigned his post as Ma\fmūd’s vizir in Baghdād aft er one year and one month, because he could not cope with the corruption and the rivalry that permeated the court.87 Dargazīnī played a signifi cant role in instigating corruption and court intrigues. Nūshīrawān further explains that aft er his resignation, al-Dargazīnī resumed his post and became the legitimate vizir, for that setting.88 Al-Dargazīnī came from a humble background but managed to become the vizir to sultans Sanjar, Ma\fmūd, and Xughrul.89 Th e motives for al-Dargazīnī’s antagonism toward ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt are not clear. Nor is it certain who were the judges in charge of his case, whom ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt calls “the learned men of knowledge” in the Shakwā al-Gharīb, whom he addresses in his defense treatise, and whom he beseeches in his plea for freedom.90 Instead of shedding light on his 86 Louis Massignon, La Passion de Husayn Ibn Mansûr Hallâj, vol. 2 (Paris: Gallimard, 1975), p. 176.

Th is was the context in which the author referred to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and praised him for his superior knowledge and intelligence. At the same time, ʿImād al-Dīn’s discussion on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt touched on subjects that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt brought up in his defense treatise, the Shakwā al-Gharīb. Both authors referred to the adversaries’ envy toward ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and their intentional misinterpretation and distortion of his ideas. It was not clear whether ʿImād al-Dīn was recording what is considered common knowledge among those familiar with this case, or whether he was repeating what ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explained in the Shakwā al-Gharīb. Unlike the Shakwā al-Gharīb, ʿImād al-Dīn’s discussion pointed toward court intrigues, oustings, manipulations and assassinations. His account focused on the princess, the vizirs, and other infl uential personalities who characterized that epoch.

His heart, consumed by the fi re of separation, burns with yearning for his friends and brothers; the burning pangs of love blaze in his bowels, and the marks thereof appear ever more clearly with the passing days. His only companions are the stars, to which he whispers with fl ooding tears:What, prison bars and iron chains, And yearning’s fl ames, and exile pains,And sundering far from those I love?What mighty anguish these must prove!91 ʿImad al-Dīn al-I\"fahānī, Kharīdat al-Qar, 3: 137–38."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"chapter one34Abū’l-Maʿālī ʿAbdallāh ibn Abī Bakr Mu\fammad ibn ʿAlī ibn al-\u000easan ibn ʿAlī originally from Miyānjī, residing in Hamadhān, was the successful, close companion of my martyred uncle ʿAzīz al-Dīn, may God bless his soul.

After al-Ghazzālī no one ever shone like him in his excellence. He produced writings in the Arabic language in a style all his own: writings that gave meaning to the Truth. In his interpretations he followed the way of the people of the path [mystics], and he acquired the ability to explain it [meaning of the Truth] in the language of mysticism. He spread the scent of his perfume in knowledge, and the hearts absorbed the stream of his excellence. His fame spread in both the diffi cult and the easy times, and going to him was like a pilgrimage, and visiting him was an opportunity that was taken as an auspicious blessing.

Th e works that evaluate this period do not provide a defi nitive answer to this question. ʿAzīz al-Dīn was arrested in the same year (525/1131) soon aft er ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s execution.

Al-Rāwandī describes the dowry of Mahmalak Khātūn as a treasure that was carried on the back of elephants from Khurāsān to Ma\fmūd in Iraq.96 Aft er the death of Mahmalak Khātūn, Sanjar wedded his other daughter, Sitī Khātūn, to his young nephew. When she also passed away, Sanjar requested the return of their gold and jewelry. Ma\fmūd did not want to return the jewelry. Al-Dargazīnī, who was looking for an opportunity to remove ʿAzīz al-Dīn from the court, told Ma\fmūd it was best to imprison ʿAzīz al-Dīn, who knew about the jewelry and would tell Sanjar’s delegate about it. Ma\fmūd agreed and ʿAzīz al-Dīn was sent to prison in Tikrīt. Sanjar’s delegate arrived and, contrary to their expectations, did not ask for ʿAzīz al-Dīn’s testimony on this matter.

Eventually, al-Dargazīnī, who had obtained a few signed blank decrees from Sanjar, carried out the execution of ʿAzīz al-Dīn at Tikrīt in 527/1133. Th e new ruler, Xughrul, who was not interested in the powerful agents of the former ruler, and was already suspicious of al-Dargazīnī’s diplomatic relationship with the shīʿis, issued the death sentence for al-Dargazīnī. He was executed only forty days aft er ʿAzīz al-Dīn.97 Considering the rivalry among the Saljūq princes and the shift ing fronts they established in seeking power, it is normal that they were suspicious of everyone around them.98 For instance, ʿImād al-Dīn’s villain, al-Dargazīnī, was one of their loyal servants who was engaged with the shīʿis in order to secure his Saljūq patrons a superior position apropos the Caliph. But the new ruler Xughrul sent him to the gallows under suspicion of collaborating with the dissident shīʿis. In the fi nal analysis, ʿImād al-Dīn’s history fails to provide a convincing explanation for ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s execution and his relationship with the purges that took place between 525/1131 and 527/1133. In recent years, ʿAlīnaqī Munzavī has off ered a new perspective on this period and the place of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt in it.99 Munzavī interprets ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s sporadic anti-Turkish statements that appear in his writings as the indication that he belonged to an anti-Saljūq political circle, which included his friends and associates. Th ese associates include Saljūq high-ranking administrators ʿAzīz al-Dīn and Kāmil al-Dawlah.100 He argues that they supported gnostic views that were at odds with the Saljūqs’ orthodox sunnī beliefs. 97 ʿImad al-Dīn, Kharīdat al-Qar, 1: 44.98 A number of sources have discussed extensively the political milieu of Saljūq rule, its signifi cant individuals, their relationship with each other and with the Caliph. Th e political complexities of the Saljūq rule involve two main factors (1) the dispute among Sanjar and his nephews over sovereignty and (2) their desire to break away from the authority of the Caliph in Baghdād. Th ese factors determine their overall political attitude. See, ʿImad al-Dīn, Tārīkh Dawlat Āl Saljūq, and Kharīdat al-Qar, vols. 1–4.

According to Munzavī, the Saljūqs were self-conscious about their Turkish heritage as their rule was simultaneously monitored by two non-Turkish forces: the Caliph, an Arab, and their Persian subjects.

However, it seems implausible that any anti-Turkish sentiment could produce such havoc and fi erce reaction from Ma\fmūd and Xughrul aft er him. Moreover, ʿAzīz al-Dīn and the other statesmen who were arrested and executed at the time were already part of the Saljūq administration and had served in the system for decades. ʿAzīz al-Dīn, for instance, was executed in his very late 50s. Th e information from this era does not give us any clear answers on the purges in the Saljūq court or ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s relation to them. It is possible that al-Dargazīnī was indeed a vicious, wicked, envious character. Perhaps he so loathed men superior to himself that he was secretly contriving the death of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his prestigious friends and carried out his wish at the right moment. It is possible that the Saljūq rulers fell prey to his plots against other statesmen who were considered potential enemies in their divided dynasty. It is also possible that Ma\fmūd was blinded by greed and in an attempt to keep the wealth of his deceased wives, the two daughters of Sanjar, approved the arrest of ʿAzīz al-Dīn. Perhaps ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his friends, the Ālūh of I\"fahān among them, detested the Saljūq Turks and provoked them. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was anticipating arrest and execution long before it happened. He foretells his execution on numerous occasions in his personal correspondence as well as in his treatises. Moreover, he asserts his desire for death with longing, with a curious nostalgia for it. He longs to be rid of this death called living. In the Tamhīdāt, for instance, he refers to his preparedness for death as he talks about his ability to produce wonders (karāmāt). He explains that in the city they call him a sorcerer because they neither understand his connection to the unseen (ghayb) nor his karāmāt.101 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt continues his discussion on others’ perception of him, his karāmāt, and his desire for death, by referring to a letter from his friend Kāmil al-Dawla. It reads as follows:102Kāmil al-Dawla wa al-Dīn has written that in the city they say ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt claims he is God. And they issue fatwa asking for my death (appeal to the sacred laws for my death). O friend, if they ask you to fatwa for my death, do it.

Skinned alive, he was then put on the gallows. When detached, he was wrapped in a straw mat soaked in oil, and was set on fi re. He had himself predicted this end in a quatrain: “We ask God for death and martyrdom .... We ask for fi re, oil, and straw.” He was executed on the evening of Wednesday 7 Jumādā II of the year 525 (May 7, 525 a.h.). Al-Subkī adds that as ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was approaching the gallows he recited this verse of the Qurʾān (the end of the verse xxvi): “And the one who commits injustice will know what is in reserve for him.”ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s writings indicate that he was a provocative personality. His bold discussion on death and the unseen and his boastful allusions to his karāmāt are testaments to how he could be perceived as a threat. Moreover, his unrelenting scrutiny of the givens of faith, as well as his superb intelligence and growing popularity, provoked much envy and caused treachery toward him among his adversaries. In some of his personal letters, he scorned the ruling elite and the political culture of his time. He complained about an ambiance that fostered hypocrisy and scholarly pretense.107 Whereas some of his commentators see ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s personality and his mystical views as the justifi cation for 103 Qurʾān: 7: 180.104 Hidāyat, Riyā\t al-ʿĀrifīn, p.109.105 Tamhīdāt, sec. 329, pp. 251–52.106 Abd el-Jalil, “Sakwa-l-Garīb”, p. 18.107 Maktūbāt, 1: 243–44."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"$Ayn al-Qu*t’s Life, Heritage, and Heresy39his execution, some have considered the political scene of the Saljūq rule as the key to unraveling the mystery of his death. However, that history is too evasive to provide satisfactory answers. Like Munzavī, Hamid Dabashi in his 1999 study of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, views the Saljūq political climate as the key to understanding ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s arrest and execution.108 Dabashi takes issue with the perspective that evaluates his execution as a consequence of his reckless attitude toward life: an attitude that was based on his desire for death.109 Moreover, he argues against the perspective that compares ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt with \u000eusayn ibn Man\"ūr al-\u000eallāj. He sees ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt as an intellectual at a specifi c juncture in history. Dabashi’s project describes the political and the intellectual history of this period and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s place in it. However, as he describes the complex history of the Saljūq court, Dabashi ultimately explains: “Th e danger ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt poses for the religious and political powers and for which danger he is brutally eliminated, is that he dares to counter-imagine the received faith.”110 Th is perspective, reluctantly, leads the reader to the Shakwā al-Gharīb where ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt defends himself against the charges of heresy. ʿUsayrān, in the introduction to his edition of the Shakwā al-Gharīb, declares this text as the most authentic document on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s conviction and eventual death.111 ʿUsayrān explains, there are only a few defi nitive pieces of information on his conviction. He identifi es them to be (1) the Shakwā al-Gharīb and the information it contains (2) al-Dargazīnī’s central role in the arrest and execution of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, and (3) the date of the execution. Aside from these, ʿUsayrān explains, no one can know what had exactly happened. 108 Dabashi, Truth and Narrative, pp. 97–99.109 Dabashi takes issue with the scholars who compare ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt with \u000eallāj, arguing that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt foretold his own execution and was resolved on it. ʿUsayrān, Arberry and Lewisohn examine the similarities between him and \u000eallāj and argue that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt aspired to \u000eallāj in respect to his mystical doctrines and also his longing for death.

He outlines the charges against him as follows: (1) his views on God as the all-encompassing Being with limited knowledge of the particulars (2) his views on prophecy as a stage past the stage of reason and the stage of sainthood, and (3) his views on the role of the spiritual leader (imām) in the life of the believer. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt presents his case arguing that his adversaries have distorted his views. He explains and supports his ideas by referring to the sayings of the Prophet, Abū Bakr, and ʿAlī, as well as prominent scholars of theology and mysticism. He calls attention to the intended meaning of certain terminology that the mystics use in their writings, and asks the reader to pay heed to the specialized use of these technical terms. He explains that scholars, in all branches of knowledge, have communicated their ideas with each other by using technical vocabulary that is specifi c to their fi eld.

For example, they accused him of sharing the views of the shīʿi Ismāʿīlīs. Th e Ismāʿīlīs were identifi ed as the advocates of an esoteric knowledge of God and the Qurʾān; they considered the recipient of this knowledge as God’s viceroy on earth and the only suitable person to lead the Muslim community.114 Th e rhetorics of this stance fell on the Caliph whose rule as the legitimate sovereign of God in the Islamic 112 Ibid., pp. 44–50.113 Ibid., p. 51.

Moreover, Ismāʿīlīs had already produced a dynasty (the tenth-century Fā!imid dynasty in Egypt) that claimed governance over the entire Islamic world. Consequently, shīʿism as a whole was viewed by the Caliph and his subject rulers, the Saljūqs—being the most devout among them—as a threat and an adversary. In the Iran of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, this situation had intensifi ed aft er the capture of the Alamūt a few years before the birth of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt.115 In the Shakwā al-Gharīb, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt disclaims any association between himself and the Ismāʿīlīs. He argues this point in the discussion on knowledge by proximity (al-ʿilm al-ladunnī) and the discussion on “sin” and “infallibility.” He declares that the quality of the relationship between the disciple and the teacher and the kind of knowledge they share are but a few instances that articulate his pronounced distinction from the Ismāʿīlīs. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is outraged that his adversaries have intentionally blurred the distinction between him and the Ismāʿīlīs in an attempt to create a case against him. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt lived at a volatile time when being an original thinker was dangerous. At the time, associating one’s views with the dissident shīʿi movements was a viable excuse for arrest and persecution—as mentioned earlier, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s notorious enemy, al-Dargazīnī was also sent to the gallows for his suspicious relationship with the Ismāʿīlīs. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that the role of the spiritual leader (imām) in the life of the novice is to protect him from going astray in his seeking aft er the truth.116 He then quotes from the tradition (\u0005adith) Shīʿī esotericism found its fullest development in Ismāʿīlism, by far the most representative of the Shīʿī sects designated with the term Bā!iniyya; referring to those who give primacy to the inner, esoteric, or Bā!!inī meaning behind the literal wording of all religious texts and formulations.115 Alamūt is the name of the fortress near the town of Qazvīn in the northwestern Alburz mountain region of Iran. It was captured by the followers of \u000easan \u001fabbā\f (d. a.d. 1124) in a.d. 1090 and fell in a.d. 1256 during the Mongol invasion of Iran in the 13th century.

A sound Tradition (\u0005adīth) informs us that God’s Messenger (God bless him) said, “Whoever dies without an imām, dies the death of a pagan.” Abū Yazīd al-Bis!āmī said, “If a man has no master, his imam is Satan.”"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"chapter one42and the great masters of Islamic mysticism who all talk about this subject.

Instead, he declares his own dissociation from the shīʿi Ismāʿīlīs who advocate following the infallible leader as a requirement in attaining knowledge of God. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt further explains the distinction between the Ismāʿīlīs and himself by explaining that his arguments abide by the methodology of rational speculation, which is not relevant to the Ismāʿīlīs’ teachings. Th e latter consider the Prophet and the infallible leader (imām) as the source for the understanding of religious doctrines.117 Th e other charge against ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is his discussion of God’s omniscient knowledge. Th e all-encompassing relationship of God to the creation means His knowledge embraces all of creation. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is not advocating a pantheistic view of God. To say that everything comes from God’s omnipotence does not mean that God is multiple.118 In the chapter, On Faith in God and His Attributes, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt expands on the omniscient and the omnipresent nature of God by emphasizing that all of creation, even its smallest particles, are subject to His eternal knowledge.119 In Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq he talks extensively about the unity of God and His knowledge of the details (juzʾīyāt) and argues that while there are distinctions and inequalities ʿAmr b. Sanān al-Manbijī, one of the great Sufi shaykhs, said, “A man who has not been to school with a master, such a man is an imposter.” Th e sufi expositors of the true reality are unanimous in declaring that he who has no shaykh is without religion. Th is was what I meant to say in the chapters in question. My adversary, however, had chosen to interpret my words as being in line with the doctrine of the Ismāʿīlīs, understanding me to subscribe to the belief in the infallible Imām.117 Shakwā al-Gharīb, pp. 35–36.118 Ibid., p. 52. Cf. Arberry, A Sufi Martyr, p. 54:Th e sense of these words is exactly the same as what I conveyed in a section of the aforesaid treatise. I wrote, ‘Th e truth is that God is the Multiple and the All, and that what is beside Him is the single and the part’. Th e meaning is that all existing things, in relation to the grandeur of His Essence, are as the part to the whole, the single to the multiple; since all existing things are but a drop from the ocean of His omnipotence. I did not mean by that that God was multiple in His parts—high exalted is God indeed above being open to division.119 Shakwā al-Gharīb, p. 69. Cf. Arberry, A Sufi Martyr, p. 84:Nought escapes from His eternal knowledge, not so much as the weight of an atom, such as a grain of dust; indeed, His knowledge of what is under His earth is as His knowledge of what is above in heaven.

It is human reason that fails to comprehend the extensions of the knowledge of God, which is eternal and incomprehensible in temporal and spacial frames of reference.122 Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq explains that the temporal nature of creation subjugates our mind to the degree that we are deluded into comparing the omniscient and the omnipresent attributes of God with the limited cognitive qualities of man. Consequently, some ask how can God have knowledge of the particulars, not knowing that the eternal knowledge of God is unaff ected by the transient quality of temporal knowledge.123 God’s encompassing knowledge is incomprehensible to man because man is only exposed to the expressions of this knowledge in the world. Naturally, God’s relationship with this world and His knowledge of the particulars remain beyond our reach. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that when creation is looked upon through the perspective of reason it is perceived in a hierarchical order in respect to time, status, and qualities. Th e relationship of God to creation is not determined by any stratum because God is omnipresent and in an equal relationship to all of creation. Moreover, God’s knowledge of the particulars is independent of the creatures’ knowledge of Him.124 Th e nature of prophethood is an example of the kind of knowledge that human reason cannot appropriate.

Th is discussion in the Tamhīdāt is comprehensive and conveys faith in the prophethood as faith in the unseen (ghayb). Th is argument does not imply that the believer (the one possessed of reason) can have direct knowledge of the unseen. Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq approaches the same issues in a less esoteric style. Th ere he explains:126Perhaps you would ask: what is the path that one with reason must traverse in order to fi nd a fi rm stance in faith in prophethood? I would say: the path of one who does not have any taste for poetry until he receives his objective by association with those who have this talent. And there are many who do not have the taste for poetry and do not understand the diff erence between poetry and prose but attest to this aptitude among others. And their merit is in understanding this diff erence [between themselves and those who have the gift of poetry] and this is due to the frequency of their association with those who were not deprived of this aptitude. And they became fi rm believers in the unseen.He explains that the aptitude for poetry is a metaphor for understanding one’s own strengths and limitations in acquiring diff erent kinds of knowledge. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussion is inspired by a similar comparison in Ghazzālī’s Mishkāt al-Anwār when the author describes the distinction between ordinary people and the prophets and friends of God.127 Like ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, Ghazzālī explains that beyond the stage of reason is the prophetic stage, which is incomprehensible by those who do not have access to it. Th e prophetic stage is similar to the inspirational state that we associate with poetry. In the prophetic stage, the prophets and some wayfarers observe “fl ashes” of the unseen, mysteries of heaven and earth and other divine (rabbānī) mysteries. Th is kind of knowledge is not available to all, just as the taste for poetry, which is a kind of feeling and perception, is reserved for some.128 Th is is an appropriate analogy considering ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, 125 Shakwā al-Gharīb, pp. 70–72.126 Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, p. 31.127 Abū \u000eāmid Mu\fammad Ghazzālī, Th e Niche of Lights (Mishkāt al-Anwār), translated by David Buchman (Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1998), pp. 37–38; henceforth cited as Abū \u000eāmid Mu\fammad Ghazzālī, Th e Niche of Lights.128 Ibid., pp. 37–39."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"$Ayn al-Qu*t’s Life, Heritage, and Heresy45whose diction is replete with verse and metaphor.

Th e arrangement and orchestration of these arguments produce the complex and rhetorical text of the Shakwā al-Gharīb, which can be read on diff erent levels as an apologia and a metaphor for one’s longing for the homeland. 129 Shakwā al-Gharīb, pp. 33–34.

What I claim is rather that the inner nature of prophcey indicates a stage beyond the stage of sainthood, and that sainthood indicates a stage beyond the stage of reason, as I have pointed out above. Th e nature of a thing is one thing, and the means of realizing it is another: it is possible for a man possessed of reason to reach by way of reason belief in the existence of a stage which he has not yet attained personally.

He justifi es Shakwā al-Gharīb as an inspirational piece and explains that the prison in Baghdād inspired him to write about the existential predicament of the soul in exile from the homeland and trapped in the prison-house of the body. He reiterates that Shakwā al-Gharīb transcends the actual confi nes of his imprisonment in Baghdād, functioning as a metaphor that summons the adept to aspire to the mystical path as the way out of this prison. Th e present chapter concerns itself with the issue of exile, imprisonment, and the return journey home. Shakwā al-Gharīb belongs in the genre of the medieval prison-writings that are an intimation of the tribulations of the soul in the material realm. But it also functions as a platform for the author to defend himself before his captors and claim his right to be released from prison. In its capacity as a mystical treatise, which is fi lled with allusions to the existential agonies of humankind, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt treats a theme that was previously investigated at length in Plato’s Apology for Socrates and the visionary recitals of Avicenna. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and these other authors shared a similar fate in their relationship with the state authorities: they were accused of off ense against society and put into prison. In turn, they used their incarceration as an opportunity to speak about the soul in the body. Th e writings of Plato on Socrates’ trial and eventual death, the visionary recitals of Avicenna, and ʿAyn 131 “Letter 98,” in Maktūbāt, 2: 355–63.

Th e forlorn state of the soul in exile from its homeland where it basked in the glory of God, is a major theme that is discussed extensively in Islamic mystical literature of medieval Iran. Prominent writers and scholars who wrote on this subject include Sanāʾī Ghaznawī (d. a.d. 1131) the author of Sayr al-ʿlbād ilā al-Maʿād (Th e Journey of the Servants to the Place of Return), Abū \u000eāmid and A\fmad Ghazzālī, Farīd al-Dīn A!!ār (d. a.d. 1220) the author of Man\u0007īq al-\u000bayr (Th e Conference of Birds), and the celebrated Rūmī (d. a.d. 1273). Th e latter stand out as popular authors worldwide. Rūmī’s famous Nay Nāmih (Tale of the Reed) is a poem that artists and writers still admire. A!!ār’s allegorical tale about the journey of a fl ock of birds in search of the fabulous bird sīmūrq (griffi n) comes to end with the realization that their destination and the beloved were never far from them, but rather within their own heart. Th e journey off ers this invaluable knowledge, which must be arrived at by the individual wayfarer. Th e Conference of Birds has been studied extensively over the years and been translated into other languages. Another important work in this category is the treatise Qiat al-Ghurba al-Gharbīya (Th e Tale of Occidental Exile) by Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī al-Maqtūl (d. a.d. 1191).132 Th is text is a confl uence of autobiography and allegory. Suhrawardī ventures to remedy a shortcoming in the mystical treatises of the Muslim master of Peripatetic philosophy, Avicenna. He fashions his allegory aft er Avicenna’s visionary accounts of the spiritual journey for self-discovery: Risālat \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān (Recital of \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān), Risālat al-\u000bayr (Recital of the Bird), and Risālat Salāmān wa Absāl (Recital of Salāmān and Absāl). ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s Shakwā al-Gharīb is not an allegory, but a complex narrative that propels the plot with metaphors and intimations. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that his captivity away from his homeland Hamadhān is the major metaphor under consideration. Th e text adopts a discursive narrative structure, which is autobiographical and 132 Shihāb al-Dīn Abū al-Futū\f Ya\fyā ibn \u000eabash ibn Amīrak al-Suhrawardī (a.d. 1154–91), was the initiator of the philosophical school named the philosophy of Illumination.

Th e rhetorical nature of the defense convinces ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt to be selective about presenting and withholding evidence in order to advance his arguments strategically and tactfully. For instance, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt does not mention some of his major writings. Consequently, when in “Letter 98” he refers to the metaphorical nature of his defense, he must be specifi cally recalling the beginning sections of the Shakwā al-Gharīb where he laments his imprisonment in Baghdād and beseeches his captors for release. It is logical that the personal tone of the defense in the beginning is extended into a biographical discussion concerning the author’s work on mysticism as a scholarly discipline. In this manner, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt combines his appeal for release from the Baghdād prison with his discussion on his life achievements and his sense of alienation from this world. Th ese subjects, juxtaposed against each other, constitute the plot of the Shakwā al-Gharīb.

Had he read the text more carefully, he would have observed its subtle treatment of mystical meanings. Instead, his critic rushed to judgment and accused ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt of being impatient for release from prison. He further accused ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt of being verbose and rhetorical in his longing for Hamadhān. Th ese objections are based on his interpretation of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s loft y use of the literary idiom. In the Shakwā al-Gharīb, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt uses an erudite style in describing his loneliness and alienation (ghurba). He invokes verses by celebrated Arab poets such as Abū Tammām134 and Bashshār ibn Burd135 who likewise shared his connection with Hamadhān or suff ered harm at the hand of foes. Th ese poets refl ect on separation and loneliness, and thus bear witness to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s affl iction and bring solace to him. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is a superb writer who consistently demonstrates unparalleled authorial command over his subject. In the case of Shakwā al-Gharīb, he is intent on exhibiting the breath and depth of his learning and his intellectual scholarship as proof that the envious treachery of his enemies was provoked by his exceptional intelligence.136 I did not want to leave a few points unattended, may God out of His graciousness keep us against errors. First: you were astonished by the description of the longing for the homeland; had you studied these chapters in their entirety you would not have found room for this objection. In a similar vein, Balāl al-\u000eabashī, may God be pleased with him, and the Prophet, praise be upon him, yearned for the mountains and the streams of Mecca. Th is is what we understand from the apparent qualities. In addition, your objection that in my diction, I was verbose and rhetorical rather than unrestricted, is exactly true; your words speak my heart. Indeed, the best poetry is the most untrue and the verbose is the twin of the poets. Th at is why I renounced both of them and admitted that the perfection of both of these craft s is that which is adorned with deceit. When the wayfarer understands the harm in lying, he will cease doing it. Th at is all!134 Abū Tammām \u000eabīb ibn Aws (a.d. 804–45) is the famous Arab panegyrist. He stayed in Hamadhān on his way back from Nayshāpūr where he composed his famous anthology, \bamāsa. 135 Bashshār ibn Burd (a.d. 714–84) was an Iraqi poet of Persian descent. His family was from eastern Iran. Praised as a court poet, he was accomplished in diff erent genres of poetry. His elegies won him wide renown.

Th is observation is extended into the universal condition of the soul who is in exile in this realm of material existence. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that the literary qualities of the Shakwā al-Gharīb might make him comparable to poets, writers, and rhetoricians. However, in contrast to them, the eloquence of his diction and his skillful use of the high literary culture are not intended to fabricate alluring deceits. His obviously literary manner of expression is intended to communicate a truth that can be imparted only through poetic language and imagery. In the Shakwā al-Gharīb, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt uses the emotive, fl owery language of poetry because it is less remote from the realities of the spiritual realms that are translated as signs and symbols on the material plain. In the same way, the places that he evokes, Hamadhān and Mecca among them, are reminiscent of an spiritual geography that is invisible to the corporeal sight. Finally, the truth that he alludes to is the longing of the soul for its true homeland, and the freedom that he seeks extends to the condition of the soul that is exiled from the homeland.137 Dear friend! Be aware! Do not treat lightly the words of the lovers. “There is, in their stories, instruction for men endowed with understanding.” Behold, they are talking about Jacob. Do you think “And his eyes became white with sorrow. And he fell into silent melancholy” is because of his separation from Joseph or for something else? If he was suff ering this pain on account of Joseph, then since it is permissible for the prophets to suff er such a pain, the entire world is justifi ed in its longing for the friend. “How great is my grief for Joseph!”138 Th is sigh means a diff erent world of meaning for the Lord of love. In fact, that pain was not on behalf of Joseph. Joseph was a sign for another aff air. Th erefore, objections are not admissible. One should look at Alwand and Mawashān, and the tales of the lovers, with appreciation. Th is pain and complaint are not entirely about Hamadhān; they are about something else. Prison, is separation from the beloved; release, is fi nding the beloved.ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that in Shakwā al-Gharīb, the mountains and the prairies of Hamadhān—Alwand and Mawashān—are metaphors 137 Ibid., sec. 557.138 Qurʾān, 12: 84."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"longing for the homeland51for the spiritual plains where harm and treachery have never set foot.

In contrast to the dismal pit that we call life, the spiritual quality of the place that he calls home redeems the soul. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt imagines that these climes can make anyone, even a man’s foes, rejoice so greatly that hostility is taken out of their minds.Me thinks I see the Iraqi caravan arriving at Hamadhan, and setting down their loads on the slopes of Mawashan.

Arriving at Hamadhān and the spiritual plain that it stands for, these travellers jump with joy and astonishment.

And if in the eternal Qurʾān he takes a vow on these two mountains, the Fig and the Olive (al-tīn wa al-zaytūn),141 that vow is not on the earth and stones. Alas, no one except lovers can understand the mysteries of love.Th e Qurʾānic verse, al-tīn, points to four sacred symbols: the fi g, the olive, mount Sinai, and Mecca. Th e fi g represents man who, like the fruit, can be full of delight and sweetness or with corruption. Th e olive refers to the Mount of Olives, where the Gospel unfolds. Sinai is the locus for the message of Moses. Th is city of security, which the Prophet Mu\fammad refers to, is Mecca or the site of the revelation. Th ese locations signify the prophetic mission and its validity. Th ey allude to elements that belong to this world and this humanity but extend beyond them and connect with the other realms of reality. Th e fi g is a parable for the nature of man.

He wishes to return to his homeland because on the soul level he does not belong to the corporeal world and desires to return to his eternal home. He also wishes to be released from the Baghdād prison and go back to Hamadhān, where as a child he was suckled and adored by those who love him. Hamadhān is a place like Mecca, the Mount of Olives, and Sinai, where ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, as another inspired man, hears the call of God and follows the path of mysticism. Pondering his present predicament, he remembers his separation from the homeland and from his home.

Th e stranger (al-gharīb) is one who is aware of his state of exile: a condition that he becomes sentient of through mystical practice and visionary perception of the unseen. Although the imprisonment of this young scholar in the dungeons of Baghdād is the occasion and the inspiration for Shakwā al-Gharīb, in his letter of response to his critic ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt maintains that his apologia is a testimonial on exile and a complaint against the separation of the soul from its homeland.Reaching the Homeland, Apologia of Plato and Avicennan RecitalsAs is the case with Shakwā al-Gharīb, the Apology of Plato (427–347 b.c.) and the Recital of \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān by Avicenna (a.d. 980–1037) were composed when their narrators were being attacked by state authori ties.143 Prison and trial inspired these authors to write some of the most important treatises on the exile of the soul and its homecoming. Plato and Avicenna had a formative infl uence on medieval Islamic thought in general and on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s intellectual milieu in particular. Needless to say, these thinkers were considered archetypal paradigms of knowledge and wisdom for the scholars of the medieval world at large. Th ey were especially important for thinkers like the Ghazzālī brothers and Suhrawardī al-Maqtūl, the founder of the Illuminationist school, who belonged to the same twelft h-century 143 Abū ʿAlī al-\u000eusayn ibn ʿAbdallāh ibn Sīnā was born in Afshana near Bukhārā and died in Hamadhān. His philosophical views were infl uenced by Aristotle, al-Fārābī, and Plotinus. Avicenna was a vizir in the court of ʿAlāʾ al-Dawla in Hamadhān, where he served a prison term for political reasons. He composed the visionary recitals \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān, Salāmān and Absāl, and the Recital of the Birds, during this time."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"chapter two54intellectual and spiritual milieu that represented ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. Suhrawardī’s intuitive philosophy of Illu mina tion relied on the teachings of the ancient philosopher/demiurge Hermes Trismegistus and Plato. Hermes and Plato described their direct experience of God and the divine realm as a form of death whereby the soul separates from the body and sees the divine light.144 Gradually, Suhrawardī gave prominence to Plato over others like Aristotle and the ancient Zoroastrian sages of Persia who had exerted infl uence upon his thinking. Suhrawardī described the Illuminationist philosophy as the restoration of the heritage of Plato.145 Plato’s renown among Muslim medieval scholars, which reached its apex in the teachings of Suhrawardī, was his ability to conjoin the intuitive and the discursive aspects of gnosis. Th e dialogues of Plato and the allegorical treatises of Avicenna on the subject of the exile of the soul and the interpretation of death as the vehicle for reaching the homeland, resonate with the arguments of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. He was familiar with Plato, if not directly, through the writings of Ghazzālī, and with Avicenna directly through his texts. He refers to Avicenna in several places in his writings. In the Tamhīdāt, he praises Avicenna for his discussions on eschatology and the issue of the resurrection of the soul. Th e Tamhīdāt distinguishes Avicenna as the teacher who partook of the truth and recklessly summoned the others toward the “path of pathlessness” (rāh-i bī rāh-ī).146 Upon this path visionary insight off sets the existing norms of religious belief because the truth that Avicenna points to is in variance with notional Islam. Remembering Avicenna inspires ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt to recite the following verses:147On the path of love, unbelief and heresy (tarsāʾī) are betterIn the vicinity of your tavern, infamy is better;Wearing the zunnār instead of the habit of unity, is betterInsanity, insanity, insanity, is better.He identifi es with Avicenna’s brave approach to knowledge and regards it as a new paradigm in philosophical thought. It is sound to say that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussion at this stage in his life demonstrates 144 John Walbridge, Th e Wisdom of the Mystic East: Suhrawardī and Platonic Orientalism (New York: State University of New York Press, 2001), pp. 48–49.145 Ibid., p. 63. 146 Tamhīdāt, sec. 463, p. 350.147 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"longing for the homeland55his departure from the anti-philosophy stance of Abū \u000eāmid Ghazzālī. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is approaching the visionary philosopher as one who is in immediate contact with the truth that is disclosed to him at the highest stage of reason, which borders the terrain of visionary insight. He turns to the reader and asks: “Do you hear well what is being said? Oh, you philosopher, what do you say? Are these words not the words of philosophy? Whatever is not like these words of philosophy, is entirely vain and void.”148 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s praise for the visionary philosopher is in accord with Suhrawardī who founded his philosophy of Illumination on the basis of the Platonic visionary perception of the Ideas. Plato’s teachings on the condition of the soul in this world and the liberating qualities of death have been studied and discussed through the centuries. In the dialogues, Plato provides lively descriptions of Socrates in the meditative state as he departs this world and joins the realm of Ideas. In the Symposium, for instance, Socrates is shown in a state of trance that lasts a day and a night. Suhrawardī’s magnum opus, \bikmat al-Ishrāq (Th e Philosophy of Illumination), refers to Plato in the context of his discussion on death and self-identifi cation with the divine. Suhrawardī explains:149 Th e most exalted angel is the angel of death. It sheds the managing light from the darkness. Even though, the light is not devoid of the remainder of the relation with the body, it emerges into the world of light and becomes suspended among the Controlling Lights. Th e suspended light sees all of the illuminated veils in their relation to the majesty of the Encompassing, the Self-Constituted—the Light of lights that appears translucent. At this point it seems as though it has become a subject within the Encompassing Light. Th is is an exalted station. Plato talks about it in relation to his soul as does Hermes, and other great philosophers also, based on their inner experience. And this is what the author of this religion [Mu\fammad], and a company of those who leave the body from the realm of Nāsūt [the world of bodily manifestation] have spoken of. All layers of the spheres are brimming with these aff airs and all things are proportionate before It. To It belongs the revealing of the unseen world, known to no other but It. Whoever has not observed these stations in his self must not object to the pillars of philosophy. For, doing so is imperfection, ignorance, and falsehood. Whoever serves God with sincerity and dies transcending the darkness, 148 Ibid., sec. 464, p. 350.149 Mu\fammad S.

More of a Platonist than a Muslim, Suhrawardī compares Plato with the Prophet Mu\fammad, who left the body and the world of bodily manifestations and observed spiritual realities. Th e visionaries to whom Suhrawardī is referring were able to leave their bodies while they were alive and were able to see the creation as a spectrum of lights and emanations. Th e culmination of this experience was to acquire knowledge of the truth, which was ultimately found within the self. Ziai analyzes this subject in the context of the dream-vision that Suhrawardī has with Aristotle.Aristotle, the “master of philosophy” and “one who comes to the aid of souls”, appears to Suhrawardī, who asks a question concerning knowledge (masʾalat al-ʿilm), how it is obtained, what it is made of and how it is recognized. Aristotle’s response is: “return to your soul (or self).” Self-knowledge is a fundamental component of the Illuminationist theory of knowledge. Knowledge as perception (idrāk) of the soul is essential and self-constituted, because an individual is cognizant of his essence by means of that essence itself. Self-consciousness and the concept of “I”—the self-as-self, or its ipseity, its selfhood—are the grounds of knowledge. What is ultimately gained through the initial consciousness of one’s essence is a way to knowledge, called the “science based on presence and vision” (al-ʿilm al-\u0005u\tūrī al-shuhūdī). For Suhrawardī, this is a higher type of knowledge than that obtained by the Peripatetic philosophers, who rely on union with the Active Intellect.150 Th e departure from the confi nes of the body through mystical death, enables the wayfarer to see the unseen as an interplay of lights. A few decades earlier than Suhrawardī, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt provides an epistemology of lights to describe life in its varied dimensions. He explains that he had acquired these insights through mystical death. Th is esoteric kind of knowledge is the inspiration for the defense that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, a Muslim mystic, and Socrates, a Greek philosopher, present to the authorities and the judges in charge of their 150 Hossein Ziai, “Shihāb al-Dīn Suhrawardī: Founder of the Illuminationist School,” in History of Islamic Philosophy, edited by Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Oliver Leaman (London: Routledge, 2001), pp. 453–54."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"longing for the homeland57imprisonment. In the following, I will review Plato’s trilogy on death where it concerns similar subjects in ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. Socrates on the Way of DeathSocrates uses his defense at the Athenian court as an occasion to discuss the true nature of the soul and its exile in the world of matter. He identifi es himself as a philosopher and a “practitioner of death” whose primary concerns in the trial include his individual identity, the credibility of the opponents’ rhetoric, and the opinion of the audience/jury in relation to truth.151 Socrates defeats the court’s ruling by declaring himself a lover of wisdom whose faith and destiny have always guided him in his practice of death/philosophy.152 Alan Segal’s observation is sound when he explains that for Socrates the life of the philosopher consists of seeking aft er death in order to separate the soul from the body. He explains: “Death, therefore, is part of the goal of philosophy because it removes us from the biggest source of distraction to the philosophical enterprise.”153 Th e distraction that Socratres is referring to is the body, which keeps the soul isolated from itself in the darkness of ignorance. Th e texts that focus specifi cally on the trial and death of Socrates—Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, and Phaedo—allude to a realm that is arrived at by means of death or a state of consciousness that is similar to death. Th e soul yearns for this realm and strives toward it through anamnestic refl ection and by experiencing the infl uence this recollection exerts on the acquisition of learning. K. Guthrie, the famous historian of Greek philosophy, argues that Plato was infl uenced by Pythagorean doctrines, which supported the view that the soul belongs to the world of eternal forms and has a memory of those forms. He explains:151 Plato, “Apology,” in Great Dialogues of Plato, translated by W.H.D. Rouse, edited by Eric H. Warmington and Philip G. Rouse (New York: Mentor, 1984), p. 423. In the Apology, Socrates, who has been accused of impiety and is condemned to death, refl ects on his proximity to death and to the citizens of Athens. Th is is how he distinguishes between the rhetorics of his adversaries and the truth.152 Ibid, p. 485.153 Alan F.

But because we have already had a direct vision of the true realities, it is possible for the feeble and imperfect refl ections of them on earth to remind us of what we have once known, but forgotten owing to the soul’s contamination with the material dross of the body.154 Socrates’ identity as an inspired thinker is inseparable from the philosophic discourse whose approach to existence derives from the vantage point of death.155 Philosophy for Socrates is not an abstract structure in the heavens, detached and removed from this life; nor is death to him a mystery. In fact, he leaves the court advising the judges to keep “good hopes toward death,” since the virtuous man need not worry about what befalls him either in this world of shadows or in the realm of true Beings.156 Death frees the soul from the body and allows it entrance into the realm of Ideas. Th e philosopher is so preoccupied with the question of death and enlightenment through death that he sees himself more dead than “alive.” Th is is an issue that Socrates turns to in Phaedo,157 where, in his private discussion with his circle of friends, he draws a detailed picture of the house of Hades, its geography, and the fate of the souls.158 Th ese intimations testify that Socrates has taken part in divine visions and has succeeded in remembering them in his corporeal existence. He has passed through the cycle of death and rebirth many times and retains those remembrances. Consequently, the philosopher has developed an acute sensitivity to death whence he has come and to which he shall return. Th is is how the Apology is not concerned with saving the philosopher from harm and banishment. 154 W.K.C.

Th is dialogue sets the stage for the following works on the trial and death of Socrates, Apology, Crito, and Phaedo.156 “Apology,” Great Dialogues of Plato, p. 446.157 Segal, Life aft er Death, p. 225.158 “Phaedo,” Great Dialogues of Plato, pp. 512–18."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"longing for the homeland59Rather it concerns the truth (al-\u0005aqq) that he has attained in special realms of consciousness. Moreover, it concerns his right to think thoughts that are inspired by death—unwelcome as they may be for the state and its authorities. Th e crux of the argument in the Apology and in the trilogy on death, is in accord with what Massignon calls the classical goals of Hellenistic philosophy: “Th e purifi cation of the soul through knowledge of the truth, and the formula for the political balance of the ideal state.”159 Plato asserts that the philosopher exists in this world to profess while still alive the knowledge that he attains through death. Th is teaching resonates with that of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt who discusses the praxis of death as the cornerstone of his mystical views. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and Plato attest a knowledge beyond death that is considered provocative and off ensive by the authorities in charge of the political and the intellectual state. Plato is accused of heresy and corrupting the youth with his inquisitive chatter, and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is branded as eccentric and heretical. Th ey both triumph by remaining steadfast to the visions of the spiritual realms that they have visited through death.Avicenna’s Escape from the Prison of the BodyIt is most likely that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s familiarity with Plato was indirect and through the writings of Ghazzālī and Avicenna. Whereas Ghazzālī’s scrutiny into philosophy with the intent of refuting it was so profound that some of his readers mistook him as a philosopher, Avicenna’s knowledge of Greek philosophy and logic was an essential element of his legacy. Avicenna’s work was studied by both the followers of Aristotle, the Peripatetics, and the mystic scholars and the Illuminationist philosophers who interpreted his work as visionary philosophy. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s reference to Avicenna, discussed in detail in the Conclusion, indicates that he had studied the text of the A\t\u0005awiya, which perceived the hereaft er (maʿād) beyond the conventional category of resurrection and defi ned it as a place where one has come from and will return to.160 Th e A\t\u0005awiya is organized into seven chapters that analyze diff erent views on eschatology and the 159 Louis Massignon, Th e Passion of al-Hallāj: Mystic and Martyr of Islam, vol. 1, translated by Herbert Mason (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1982), p. 197.160 Avicenna, Risālat al-A\t\u0005awiya fī Amr al-Maʿād, 1st ed., edited by Sulaymān Dunyā (Egypt: Dār al-Fikr al-ʿArabī, 1949), p. 36; henceforth cited as A\t\u0005awiya."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"chapter two60undying ipseity of humankind. Avicenna describes the states of diff erent ranks of men aft er death and the realization of the second creation. He uses this outline to demonstrate that maʿād is a transition from one state of being into another and not a summoning of the dead on a designated day to stand judgement. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains the source of these views to have been Avicenna’s perception of the celestial emanations. He considers these insights beyond the understanding of reason and explains that Avicenna cannot be conveniently described under the categorical defi nition of “philosopher.” Th e eschatology that is discussed in the A\t\u0005awiya is founded on visions that defy the boundaries of rational comprehension. Th ese kinds of insights upset the understandings of conventional faith to the degree that the one who claims them is branded as heretical and insane.161But I am saying that Shaykh Abū Saʿīd had not yet tasted these words. If he had experienced them, just as Avicenna and others who were scorned by the strangers had, he also would have been taunted and humiliated in public. May the one who claims such an understanding die a hundred thousand times for that person who has so rent the veils and pointed to the direction-less path! My inner self, at this point, quotes these verses to me. It says, “Reinforce and translate the meaning of Avicenna’s condemnation.” Hearken:On the path of love, unbelief and heresy (tarsāʾī) are betterIn the vicinity of your tavern, infamy is better;Wearing the zunnār instead of the habit of unity, is betterInsanity, insanity, insanity, is better.ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt praised Avicenna for his understanding of mystical concepts and justifi ed his use of metaphor and ambiguous terminology in conveying their meanings. For instance, in the Tamhīdāt ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refers to Avicenna in the context of the discussion of the reality of the heart and the spirit.162 He remarks that Avicenna’s use of the term “eternal” as an attribute of the four elements (earth, wind, water, fi re) is perplexing to the uninitiated because Avicenna was not referring to the corruptible elements of the terrestrial world but was alluding to the eternal elements of the world of the spirit. Th e latter are the archetypes that we perceive in the terrestrial world as perishable material forms. Although it is impossible to translate such realities 161 Tamhīdāt, sec. 464, pp. 349–50.162 Ibid., sec. 223, p. 167."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"longing for the homeland61into language, we can approach them through symbols, metaphors, and allegories. For instance, the four elements of the terrestrial realm serve as symbols for the elements in a reality that is eternal. Avicenna borrows terrestrial images in order to communicate the abstract forms that belong in the celestial spheres. A similar analogy is at work in the Shakwā al-Gharīb where allusions to Hamadhān and its plains serve as metaphors for the plains of the celestial homeland. Although Avicenna’s discussions stand for his unique interpretation of the cosmos and the scheme of the creation in relation to the active Intellect, his views are signifi cant in understanding the background to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussions. Similar to Shakwā al-Gharīb, Avicenna’s prison treatise the Recital of \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān elaborates the exile of the soul from the homeland. Avicenna, unlike Plato and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, does not employ a fi rst-person autobiographical narrative voice; however, his narrative is ultimately autobiographical in the sense that it conveys the quintessence of his philosophy and cosmogony. Corbin explains that in his mystical trilogy, Recital of \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān, Recital of the Bird, and Recital of Salāmān and Absāl, Avicenna depicts himself in the cosmos that he had discussed in his scientifi c and philosophical works: “By substituting a dramaturgy for cosmology, the recitals guarantee the genuineness of this universe; it is veritably the place of a personally lived adventure.”163 Avicenna composed the Recital of \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān during his incarceration in Hamadhān164 where he was arrested and imprisoned in a.d. 1023 on the charge of treason against the new Būyid prince, Samāʾ al-Dawla.165 He was imprisoned for establishing contact with the ruler of I\"fahān, ʿAlāʾ al-Dawla, an enemy to the Būyids. He spent four months in the Fardajān fortress and was released by ʿAlāʾ al-Dawla when the latter attacked Hamadhān. Shortly aft er his release, Avicenna fl ed Hamadhān in the company of his brother, two male servants, and his student/biographer and faithful friend Abū ʿUbayd ʿAbdal-Wā\fid Jūzjānī. Th ey fl ed the city disguised as sufi s to join the court of ʿAlāʾ al-Dawla in I\"fahān as the protégés of the prince. Corbin explains that 163 Henry Corbin, Avicenna and the Visionary Recital, translated by Willard R.

Th e unknown author of this translation is probably Jūzjānī. Th e translation includes a commentary on the original text, and it is likely that the commentary is based on Avicenna’s direct discussions with his students.166 In his analysis of \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān, Corbin relies on this commentary as a valuable primary source. Th e Recital of \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān is an edifying discussion on the nature of the universe. It is a discussion on metaphysics and the ten Intelligences, which govern the spheres beyond the terrestrial. Avicenna describes the Intelligences, their emanations, and the state of the soul in relation to them. Th e genesis of the soul and the ninth Intelligence is the tenth Intelligence or the active Intelligence. Th e latter is emanated directly from the First Being or the First Principle (al-Mubdaʿ al-Awwal). Th e ten Intelligences constitute a spectrum of lights whose totality is separate from the First Being and the emanations that are in closer proximity to God. Avicenna describes the Intelligences as a hierarchy of emanations that each produce and originate the next Intelligence. In this manner, the Intelligences are separate one from the other and are also linked as metaphysical lights with diff erent degrees of luminosity. Each Intelligence manifests this hierarchy according to its own position in proximity to the tenth Intelligence. And each expresses this relationship in the form that it assumes. Th e latter is manifested in the metaphysical geography and the inhabitants of the clime that the Intelligence represents. Th e human soul occupies an exalted place in this pleroma because it emanates from the tenth Intelligence.167 Th erefore, the human soul has a kinship and an innate affi nity with the principal emanation of this cosmos. Th is relationship is comparable to that of a child and its father. Th e child longs to return to the homeland but is lost and confused in the murky world of matter. Th rough the Recital of \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān the soul descries the worlds between the terrestrial sphere and the homeland and provides a roadmap for the return journey. Th e soul’s return to the homeland begins with its separation from the body and continues with its journey through the spheres of the Intelligences toward the Orient. Accordingly, “orientation” and “self-166 Corbin, Avicenna and the Visionary Recital, p. 129. Corbin mentions the three Arabic commentatires on the text. Ibid., pp. 127–28.167 Ibid., p. 46."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"longing for the homeland63knowledge” are integral themes in the recital. Avicenna’s Orient is a non-corporeal destination that transcends spatial and temporal dimensions. Th e Orient is an epiphany in which the soul sees itself as an emanation of the active Intelligence. In order to arrive there, initially, the soul needs to know itself in isolation from the body and the senses. Th en it needs to learn about the other Intelligences and their climes that it will cross on its way home toward the active Intelligence whence it has come. Each Intelligence has its own sphere, which it governs. Th ese domains constitute the stages that lead the human soul back to the homeland and beyond that toward the First Being. Th e metaphysical geography of these worlds is drawn in the discussion between the two main characters in the recital: the guide, \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān, aft er whom the recital is named, and the narrator. Th e latter is the fi rst-person narrator who could be viewed as the author, Avicenna himself. Th e two hold a dialogue of teacher and disciple as would Avicenna and his students. \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān, the harbinger and the guide from the realm of the tenth Intelligence, meets the narrator and informs him about the unseen realms that constitute the journey. Th e narrator, acting as the intermediary between the guide and the reader, relates \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān’s teachings to us. \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān (Living, Son of Wakeful), as his name suggests, has the vivacity and beauty of youth at the same time while displaying gravity that accompanies old age. He has an ageless beauty and a wisdom that comes with experience. Th ese characteristics are manifest in his external appearance and demeanor as well as in his intellectual vigor and sagacity. In the Avicennan cosmogony, \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān represents the active Intelligence. Goichon explains:Th e name given to the work is then easily explained. \bayy b. Ya\u0015\u0014ān is the proper name of the active Intellect; “Living”, since Ibn Sīnā places perfection in life in intelligence and action, “son of the Wakeful One”, because he emanates from the penultimate pure Intelligence which knows neither sleep nor inattention. Th e active Intellect is also, through knowledge surpassing the perceptible world, the soul’s guide toward its prime Principle, the Being that shines forth over all others.168Corbin defi nes \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān as the guide and the representative from the active Intelligence. He has direct knowledge of the worlds that unfold beyond the terrestrial realm, because he comes from the 168 A.M. Goichon,“\u000eayy b. Ya~ān,” Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Brill Online.

He explains that his father, the active Intelligence, has taught him all kinds of knowledge and has shown him how to travel throughout the universe. Subsequently, he has acquired a comprehensive knowledge of the universe.169 Goichon aptly summarizes the knowledge under discussion as the Avicennan theory of forms according to which the fabric of the universe is composed of the material and the intelligible forms. Th e forms are lights that in the terrestrial world are mixed with matter. In the case of intelligible forms there are degrees in the purity of the forms because their lights can be mixed with the celestial matter. \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān’s discussion on the sphere of celestial matter, for instance, explains that it is similar to the terrestrial clime in receiving its light through emanation from a higher plain and in being populated by “strangers” who have come there from distant places.170 Th ese strangers, similar to human souls, must fi nd their way back to the source. However, the diff erence between the matter of the terrestrial world and that of the celestial sphere is that terrestrial forms, or souls, are separable from their matter, or bodies, whereas the forms of the heavens are not separable from their celestial matter.171 Th e knowledge of the forms is metaphysical. It can be perceived by those humans whose souls are freed from the body and the confusion that is caused by the faculties and by sense perception.172 Th e Persian commentary on \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān explains that care for the body can preoccupy the soul and divert its attention away from its true purpose. Th e commentary identifi es the irascible faculty, the concupiscent faculty, and the imaginative faculty, as obstacles that hinder the soul from acquiring wisdom and knowledge of God and His angels.173 Th e teachings of \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān and his description of the forms that are not visible to the physical eye can be understood by the soul when it is freed from these confi nes. Th is can happen in death, during sleep, or in special states of consciousness induced by the wayfarer. Accordingly, the narrator, and \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān, and the event of their encounter belong in a realm outside time, space, and sensory perception. Th e meeting with \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān is an event that can 169 Henry Corbin, Avicenna and the Visionary Recital, p. 138.170 Ibid., p. 143.171 Ibid., p. 334.172 Goichon,“\u000eayy b.

Th e meeting is the overture to the story as follows:Th e Master Says: “Once when I had taken up residence in my city, I chanced to go out with my companions to one of the pleasure places that lie about the same city. Now, as we were coming and going, making a circle, suddenly in the distance appeared a Sage. He was beautiful; his person shone with a divine glory. Certainly he had tasted of years; long duration had passed over him. Yet there was seen in him only the freshness proper to young men; no weakness bowed his bearing; no fault injured the grace of his stature. In short, no sign of old age was to be found in him, save the imposing gravity of old Sages.”174Corbin, relying on the Persian commentary of the original Arabic text, explains that the narrator represents the soul that is freed from the body, while the companions whom he identifi es as his friends are the faculties of the sensory perception. Th ese companions, his anxieties, fears, passions, and lusts, do not exercise any power over him, nor do they divert his attention from his pursuit of wisdom, because he has tamed and befriended these unruly consorts and is now taking them along to the “pleasure places about the city.” In the same vein, the city and the pleasure places are states of consciousness, which Corbin interprets as the natural dwelling of the soul aft er it has escaped the body and the dominion of the senses. When the narrator says that he took residence in his city, he means he was able to detach his soul from the prison of the body. Th is state of detachment from the body is being at home in the citadel of his natural habitat.175 Th e soul then goes on an excursion to the pleasure places or to the places where it meditates and seeks a higher manifestation of knowledge.176 As a result, he meets \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān, whose teachings direct him toward the homeland or the Orient of celestial lights as his next destination. Th e Orient is the realm of pure forms of light, in contrast to the Occident, whose limits are the realm of pure matter.177 Th e recital ends with \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān inviting the narrator to join him on the journey to the homeland and even past that station. He explains:174 Ibid., pp. 284–85.175 Ibid., p. 283.176 Ibid., p. 286.177 Ibid., p. 44."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"chapter two66“Sometimes certain solitaries among men emigrate toward Him.

Now, if thou wilt, follow me, come with me toward Him. Peace.”178According to the Avicennan cosmogony, the Father is the Intelligence that emanates the human souls. He is the source but not the ultimate destination. Th erefore, \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān’s invitation at the end of the recital points to the homeland as the next stage of an endless journey. Th e invitation by \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān confi rms that gnosis is a personal praxis and a mode of perception that is incommunicable through discursive reasoning. In fact, \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān explains that speaking about these subjects with the narrator has made him eager to take his leave and resume his travels. He explains that there are other “solitaries” like the narrator who can go on the journey. Th e solitaries of his discussion are those human beings whose souls are capable of receiving gnosis. Th ese persons know how to separate their souls from their bodies in order to arrive at a state of mystical death. When they are in this state, they resemble the adept of the Recital who fi nds himself “at home in his city.” Th is is the juncture at which the solitaries would meet a guide like \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān who takes them on to the next stage.

Th en with utter reluctance they sent me to a diff erent station where I stayed for yet more time.Th e appearance of the divine guides to the mystics and the prophets is a subject that is discussed in all spiritual traditions. Islam enjoys a rich heritage in this regard. Th e Qurʾān speaks about the Prophet and a divine guide who fi rst appears to him in the Cave of \u000eirāʾ and calls him to prophethood as follows:30–Th e Chosen One was in the Cave of \u000eirāʾ. For two years and more he had prayed there and adored his Creator and wondered at the mystery of man with his corruptible fl esh, just growing out of a clot and the soul in him reaching out to knowledge sublime, new and ever new, taught by the bounty of Allah, and leading to that which man himself knoweth not. And now, behold! A dazzling vision of beauty and light overpowered his senses, and he heard the word “Iqraʾ!”31–“Iqraʾ!” which being interpreted may mean “Read!” or “Proclaim!” or “Recite!” Th e unlettered Prophet was puzzled; he could not read. Th e Angel seemed to press him to his breast in a close embrace, and cry rang clear “Iqraʾ!” And so it happened three times; until the first overpowering sensation yielded to a collected grasp of the words which made clear his Mission; its Author, Allah, the Creator, its subject, Man, Allah’s wondrous handiwork, capable, by Grace, of rising to heights sublime; and the instrument of that mission, the sanctifi ed Pen, and the sanctifi ed Book, the Gift of Allah, which men might read, or write, or study, or treasure in their souls.32–Th e veil was lift ed from the Chosen One’s eyes, and his soul for a moment was fi lled with divine ecstasy ... When this passed, and he returned to the world of Time, and Circumstance and this world of Sense, he felt like one whose eyes had seen a light of dazzling beauty, and felt dazed on his return to common sights. The darkness now seemed tenfold dark; the solitude seemed tenfold empty; the mount of \u000eirāʾ, henceforth known as the Mount of Light, the mere shell of an intense memory. Was it a dream?

Time and space loose their grip on his senses, his eyes gain a new vision, and he experiences a kind of knowledge and a kind of pleasure that were previously unforeseen. He is given a knowledge that he cannot describe in ordinary terms. Th e transformative qualities of this knowledge defy the rules of science and justify miraculous deeds. And when he comes back, the unbearable darkness of the world of matter makes him more aware of his alienation from it. Th e Prophet is so shaken by this experience that for a moment he becomes fully cognizant of his human vulnerabilities and seeks refuge from both worlds in the embrace of his beloved wife. Th e divine messenger, commonly identifi ed as the angel Gabriel, reappears a few more times in the Qurʾān. In al-Takwīr (Th e Folding Up), an early Meccan revelation that appears in the writings of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, the Prophet is seen in the company of the angel.182 Th eir meeting takes place against the background of the sūra which describes the collapse of the world as we know it, the individual responsibility of each soul for its own growth, the revelation as spiritual guidance toward this end, and the validity of the Prophet’s message through the attestation of the divine messenger.183 Th e sūra explains that the revelation is conveyed to the Prophet not by evil spirits but through a divine messenger about whom it says “Without doubt he saw him in the clear horizon.”184 Al-Najm (Th e Star), another instance, reaffi rms the truth of the Prophet’s teachings through his divine guide. Th e angel Gabriel is said to have appeared to him in might and majesty, on the highest reaches of the horizon when “He approached and came closer; / And was a distance of about two bow-lengths or (even) near-er; / So did (Allah) convey the inspiration to His Servant—(Conveyed) what He (meant) to Convey.”185 Th ese Qurʾānic references and the account of the nocturnal ascension of the Prophet to heaven, are at the heart of the Islamic mystical discussions concerning altered realms of being.

Th e meeting provides insight on the soul and its capacities for acquiring knowledge of God. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussion on the reality of the soul and its journey toward the homeland aspires to the Islamic mystical and philosophical tradition but it does not abide by the Avicennan hierarchy of the Intelligences and the emanations that gravitate toward the active Intelligence. According to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, a non-personal God is equally close to all of the creatures and His emanations are equally available to all.186 We are the ones who determine our proximity to this God. He justifi es the shortcoming in the Avicennan model by explaining that the creation seems hierarchical to us because our human perspective is informed by the spatial and the temporal categories of meaning and is thus subjected to our processes of cognition through rational reasoning. Th e consciousness of this altered reality is so unfamiliar to us that we inevitably revert to our limited understanding in comprehending it. Avicenna is an exceptional philosopher because he takes his visionary insights to the furthest limits of rational reasoning as is expressed in the hierarchy of emanations. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt further explains that regardless of our human constraints, the omnipresent knowledge of God permeates through all of the creation on an equal basis. God has created thousands upon thousands of non-corporeal worlds. Th ese worlds are so numerous that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt asks himself why did God create our world, which bears the inhibitions of matter.187 Th e soul is from the immaterial realm of God’s command. Th at is the realm of kūn (be). Th e soul is created, but not subjected to the spatial and temporal dimensions of meaning. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that the man who greets his soul is aware that he is in this world on his own accord. Th is notwithstanding, he is homesick for his origins where he longs to return.188Indeed I cry because of my exile:Th e eyes of the stranger always cry,Th e day I left my landI was wrong186 Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, sec. 15, pp. 23–24.187 Maktūbāt, vol. 1, sec. 120, p. 88.188 Maktūbāt, “Letter 98,” sec. 561."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"chapter two70I wonder why I left My homeland where my love isO friend! I cannot talk about how this forced separation is the consequence of my voluntary departure.

Th is desire fi nds its genesis in God’s intention for manifesting the creation. According to a famous hadīth qudsī, God told the prophet David that He was a hidden treasure and produced the creation in order to be known through His creation. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt says, the desire to know and to be known is at the root of the creation and involves both God and man.189 Th e journey of the soul takes place against this background. Th e soul departs from its homeland, the realm of God’s command, and comes into this world in order to know God in the material world where the passions reign. During the course of its journey, the soul matures through its dealings with these forces and accosts a higher level of gnosis. Th e Tamhīdāt explains that the soul is here on behalf of God in order to cast a metaphoric glance on the body and the material creation.190 Th e soul sees the creation as a manifestation of God’s attributes and observes the creation as a metaphor for the reality of God. Itself part of this creation, the soul’s mode of perception is distinct from the reality of seeing. Th e latter can only occur through the perspective of God. In regards to the wayfarer, this mode of perception can be experienced at the junctures when the adept and the path merge with each other at diff erent stages of the journey. Th ese activities comprise the substance of a dramatic, arduous, and wondrous journey. Th e imprisonment of the soul in the body and its eventual escape and enlightenment are discussed in the teachings of Plato, Avicenna, and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, all of whom use metaphorical language in describing special realms of consciousness where the soul connects to other dimensions of reality. An important issue that our authors leave unclear is how the soul separates from the body and initiates its 189 Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, p. 19.190 Tamhīdāt, sec. 219, pp. 163–64."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"longing for the homeland71subsequent progress into the unseen. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refers to this crucial juncture using the word “event.” He relates the term as the instance when the inner sight is opened and mystical death takes place. Plato occasionally portrays Socrates in a state of trance, contemplating the Ideas in his inspiring solitude. Suhrawardī, as discussed earlier, relates this habit of Socrates to a stage of death. Avicenna omits any discussion of the issue in the Recital of \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān, although he refers to it in the Recital of the Bird and the Recital of Salāmān and Absāl. In the Recital of \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān, Avicenna begins the narrative aft er the soul has departed from the body and is ready to meet the guide in the pleasure places around the city and brings the discussion to an end with \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān’s invitation to the adept to follow him to the homeland. In this manner, the plot of the recital evades any discussion on how the soul has arrived at the place where it meets \u000eayy ibn Yaq~ān. Th is void gives rise to an interesting discussion by Shihāb al-Dīn Suhrawardī who composes Qiat al-Ghurba al-Gharbīya (Th e Tale of the Occidental Exile) in response.191 Suhrawardī, Tale of the Occidental ExileQiat al-Ghurba al-Gharbīya is an allegory for the descent of the soul into the world of matter and its departure from this realm. Th e exile of the story is the narrator/protagonist who describes his voluntary departure from the spiritual realm. He explains that he and his brother left their homeland in the Orient, Transoxania, seeking a fl ock of birds at the shore of the fathomless, green ocean (sā\u0005il al-lujja al-kha\trāʾ). Th is sea is located in the Occident, the Northern Africa of the story. Th e Persian commentary identifi es the narrator as the soul and his brother as the speculative faculty, which stands independent of the body and has an innate understanding of God. Th e soul and its companion descend from the supernal realm (ʿālam al-ʿalawī) in order to visit the world of sense perception and gain gnosis through it. Th is 191 Suhrawardī , “Qiat al-Ghurba al-Gharbīya,” in Henry Corbin, Oeuvres Philosophiques et Mystiques de Shihabaddin Yahya Sohrawardi, (Opera Metaphysica et Mystica 2) (Tehran: Institute Franco-Iranien; Paris: Librairie D’Amerique et D’orient, 1952), pp. 274–97; henceforth cited as Suhrawardī , Qiat al-Ghurba al-Gharbīya.

Th e plight of these travellers is reminiscent of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt who claims responsibility for his decision to leave the homeland and laments his departure as he says.192 It is signifi cant to note that the travellers in the story of Suhrawardī do not intend to descend into this realm but are acting as visitors. Th e travellers, planning a brief visitation to the shores of this realm, wish to acquaint themselves with those souls who belong to this shore but are in fl ight away from it. Th ese bird-like souls are the wayfarers—similar to Socrates, the narrator in the Recital of \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt in his fl ights into the unseen, and Suhrawardī himself—who have separated from the body and are in the stage between matter and spirit. Th e protagonist in Suhrawardī’s tale wants to meet and greet these kinds of souls and to acquire knowledge of sense perception from them. He does not intend to fall into the world of matter but is eventually ensnared by it and soon forgets his true identity. He and his companion become captives at the village of Qayrawān, whose inhabitants are at war with one another.193 Qayrawān represents the confl icted world of matter whose fabric of existence—earth, wind, water, and fi re—is in constant agitation and turmoil. Th e travelers are held captive by the inhabitants of this foreign land and undergo trials and tribulations. Th ey are imprisoned in the dark dungeon of a tall tower. Th e dungeon and the tower represent the “dungeon” of the body that is situated in the “tower” of the world. Th e prison of Suhrawardī’s exile is described as the pit of a well that is fi lled with wave upon wave of darkness. Th e overwhelming darkness is a metaphor for the blinding darkness of the world of matter that keeps the soul hidden from view. Darkness as such is juxtaposed against the homeland, where the domain of the Father, who is light upon light (nūrun ʿala nūrin), is characterized by layers of light illuminating the observer and the observed. In spite of these impediments, the exiled protagonist succeeds in fi nding his way back to his homeland. He fl ees out of the darkness through a small opening at the mouth of the dungeon. Th is escape opens onto a castle under a beautiful sky. Th is setting is the portal onto another world where, similar to the city in Avicenna’s \bayy ibn 192 Maktūbāt, “Letter 98,” sec. 561.193 Qurʾān, 4: 75."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"longing for the homeland73Yaq\u0014ān, the protagonist meets his guide. Aft er visiting the castle, Suhrawardī’s travelers eventually meet their guide the hoopoe who takes them to the homeland. Th e travelers can ascend out of the dungeon at night, but in the morning, when awake, they fall back into the well of their captivity. Suhrawardī explains:194Th ey told us: “Th ere is no harm if you go up to the top of the castle freed from the chain; but at dawn you must fall into the bottom of the pit.”195 And in the depths of the well, there was darkness upon darkness such that if we extended our hands we could not see them.196 We were submerged in the bottom of the well except in the moments of the evening when we could climb up the castle, looking through the void through a small opening.Th is explains that the periodic departures of the soul in the direction of the homeland take place during sleep when the senses are dormant. Sleep is compared to death, which marks the ultimate separation of the soul from the body. Th e Qurʾān attests this in several sūras. Al-Zumar (Crowds), for instance, speaks of the mysteries of the return (muʿād) to God.197 It says that God takes the souls of men at the time of death and keeps them from returning to life. As for those whose hour has not arrived yet, God takes their souls during their sleep and sends them back to their bodies for a specifi c duration of time. During this time, the soul prepares for visions of God as it undertakes its homeward adventures. Th e discussion on the separation of the soul from the body and its journey to the homeland is the focus of Suhrawardī’s Qiat al-Ghurba al-Gharbīya and the occasion for his reply to Avicenna. A signifi cant moment in the narrative occurs in its opening when Suhrawardī explains that his reason for composing the text is to respond to Avicenna’s failure in the Recital of \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān to develop the concept al-\u0007āmma al-kubrā (the Great Event) or al-\u0007awr al-aʿ\u0014am (the Exalted State). Th e Great Event is an eschatological term referring to the day of judgement and to an apocalyptic state of revelation. Al-\u0007awr al-aʿ\u0014am, Suhrawardī explains, is the mystery that underlies the stages of mysticism and the quality of those to whom revelations are granted. 194 Suhrawardī, Qiat al-Ghurba al-Gharbīya, pp. 278–79. 195 Qurʾān, 12: 10, 15. 196 Ibid., 24: 40. 197 Ibid., 39: 42."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"chapter two74Qiat al-Ghurba al-Gharbīya attempts to describe this state as the soul separates from the body.198But when I saw the story of \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān I found it to be devoid of intimations and allusions that refer to the Exalted State199—and this, in spite of wonders of spiritual sayings and profound allusions that it contains. The Great Event is treasured in the revealed books and deposited in the symbols of the philosophers. It is hidden in the story of Salāmān and Absāl which the author of \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān has composed. And it is a secret upon which are arranged the stages of the gnostics and those to whom revelations are granted. But it was not referred to in the epistle \bayy ibn Yaq\u0014ān except in the end of the book where it was said: “Sometimes, certain solitaries from mankind immigrated toward Him,” to the end of the passage. So I decided to mention something about it, for my brethren, in the form of a story that I have named Th e Tale of Occidental Exile. I beseech God to aid me in what I endeavor.Th e Qurʾān refers to al-\u0007āmma al-kubrā as the day when one remembers his deeds and witnesses fear and hope in full view.200 Th e apocalypse is the place of memory and action, life and death, where one’s being, acts, and thoughts are before one’s sight. Heaven and hell set the soul ablaze with memory, and the heart of the mystic refl ects his faith. Th e Doomsday of the wayfarer is a form of self-knowledge that is unveiled in his heart. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt provides elaborate discussions on al-\u0007āmma al-kubrā, which he calls the “event,” and describes as the visionary perception of oneself and the apocalypse. Th e following chapter will concern itself with ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussion of this subject.198 Suhrawardī, Qiat al-Ghurba al-Gharbīya, pp. 275–76.199 Qurʾān, 79: 34–36.200 Ibid.Th erefore, when there comes / Th e great, overwhelming (Event) / Th e Day when Man / Shall remember (all) / Th at he strove for / And Hell-Fire shall be / Placed in full view / For (all) to see."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen75CHAPTER THREEDEATH AND VISIONS OF THE UNSEENIn his works ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt displays a keen focus on death, which determines his approach to life and mysticism, and distinguishes him as an original thinker. For ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, death is the event that takes us to our humanity. He explains that man is the coming together of the fl esh and the light of God.201 It is in death, when the soul has departed from the body, that the true identity of man, the light inside (ʾanāʾīyatuhu) shines on him.202 In ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, the eff ect of death (not “dying”) calls into question the categorical confi dence we place in the rational processes of cognition, reason, and the individual’s articulation of the self in relation to faith. In this context, death is not so much a dissolution of the self as a rupture with defi nitions and an introduction to newer —yet still relative—realms of knowledge. Th erefore, death is a process and an activity that shapes the mystic’s consciousness and identity. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt considers an exalted death-experience (mawt-i maʿnawī) as the path to true consciousness of the One and of self-identity. Th is death brings the wayfarer in contact with a spectrum of lights. Accordingly, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains his acquired knowledge in terms of an epistemology of lights—a detailed analysis of these lights is the subject of the next chapter. Th e present discussion will focus on death as transcendence in the works of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and other formative authors in his milieu.To Die Like Th isʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refl ects on death in various contexts. He sees death as a transition in the life of man and not the termination of his humanity. For him, death is a realm of consciousness that is experienced by the soul. Just as the soul experiences special worldly realms that are called 201 He sets forth a detailed analysis of the relationship between death, knowledge, and identity in his major works, Tamhīdāt and Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq. 202 Tamhīdāt, sec. 192, pp. 141–42. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that one carries within himself seventy thousand attributes, which are revealed to the common man through death and to the wayfarer at the appropriate mystical stations."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"chapter three76“being in this world,” it enters other special realms, among them, the realms of the tomb, the realms of Doomsday, and others.203 It is through death that the soul journeys on into these realms. Th ose mystics who have experienced death while still living in the world of matter go past these realms into unforeseen territories that are beyond thought and imagination and acquire knowledge by proximity to God (al-ʿilm al-ladunnī). In a personal letter he describes the extensions of this kind of knowledge as follows:204Past this is a world (ʿālam) wherein one cognition (idrāk) incorporates infi nite understandings. And each of those understandings is like the cognition of the world of reason that incorporates the branches of knowledge into which fi nitude has no way. Past this world is another world wherein units (ā\u0005ād) of apperceptions (mudrakāt) incorporate infi nite branches of knowledge, such that each one of these units is like the understandings of the world that is past reason. And that is the fourth world of the tangible cognition (al-idrāk al-\u0005issī) —such as phantasy (wahm) and imagination (khayāl) which are two of the fi ne inner faculties (\u0005awass-i ba\u0007in). We take everything from the first [world] and the intelligibles (maʿqūlāt) from the second. And I have arrived at up to four worlds and those understandings are mine. And I have faith through analytical assertion and not intuition, that past this are several thousand worlds beyond human imagination and the understanding of mankind.It is impossible to imagine the compass of this cognition, let alone to describe it in language and words; but ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt embarks on a discursive and speculative analysis by presenting his visions as analytical observations rather than personal ventures. Th e discussion on color photisms, for instance, delineates the contrasting but complimentary lights of Mu\fammad and Satan and leads the reader past the personal details of the visionary journey into the cosmogonic and eschatological signifi cance of these lights. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt relates the cognition of the unseen as a mode of perception that, unlike the perception of the sensory realm of experience, does not adhere to the relationship between the knowing, appropriating subject and the signifi ed object of his perception. Th e onlooker is self-conscious of his inability to understand the unseen where visions and events are characterized with paradoxical and symbolic properties. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt 203 Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, p. 79.204 Maktūbāt, vol. 1, letter 25, sec. 347–48, pp. 215–16."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen77communicates this abstraction in his writing even when he is giving detail. He considers his writing as the medium for the analytical assertion of the unseen. His writing, both in the sense of the written works and writing as an activity, depicts and makes apprehensible the realms past death and confi rms their coexistence with the temporal now. Th e opening lines of a personal letter establish the interconnectedness of the writing and the tangible unseen in the present moment of the letter-writing.205 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt assumes a reportorial tone in order to emphasize the objective reality of the circumstances, both visionary and pragmatic. Th erefore, he identifi es the location and the date where the letter is being composed. Th is is not a common practice for him, but in this instance he intends to emphasize the palpability of the terrestrial present at hand. Th is is juxtaposed against the immediacy of the eternity, which opens before him in the body of the visionary experience. He is writing the letter to his friend Ardshīr at whose house ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is staying while he is away. Th e date is the evening of the fi ft eenth day of the month of Rama\tān. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that as he was writing the letter, he entered the canopies of the unseen (ghayb) and saw that the inhabitants of that clime were crying the proclamation: “From the opposites learn a lesson, O you man of insight.” Furthermore, he sees a solitary man with a pony that is tied to a camel. Th e man’s black hair betokens his sadness and is in sharp contrast to the white color of the pony, which represents healthy life. Th e camel is a symbol for mankind’s intoxication with the love of God. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt interprets this striking vision as an allegory for the saying “the believer is like a camel.” Th is reference is to the \u0005adīth that compares the believer to a camel that is always drunk with the love of God who looks aft er His camel: “Th e believer is like a camel who is easily led wherever he is taken.”206 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt proceeds by relating this \u0005adīth to the Qurʾān when it says “He is the One who has created you / and of you are the unbelievers, and some that are the believers.”207 Th e rest of the letter expounds the analysis of the imagery in the vision and in the scripture.

Th e variety of the colors and the peoples can startle one with fear and apprehension. He then concludes the vision with a verse from the Qurʾān: “And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variations in your languages and your colours / verily in that are signs for those who know.”208 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt reiterates that the journey is visionary and not corporeal and identifi es diff erent turning points on the path through wine imagery. Th e wayfarer understands his relationship with himself and his proximity to God as he is intoxicated with glimpses of God. He becomes aware that God does not allow those who still think in terms of “I” and “thou” closer, and the wayfarer will have to learn how to abandon his/her consciousness of the self in order to accost Him. Th e heart, which is the intermediary between the world of matter and the spiritual realm, is the gateway that the wayfarer passes through in approaching this other realm. Th e heart is where the seeker measures his own capacity for receiving the knowledge of the unseen. As the seat of his emotions and the abode of God, the heart signifi es man’s identity, which is mediated through his passions, his sensory perceptions, his love and disdain for the other creatures, and his love and ignorance of the divine. Th e wayfarer comes in contact with his heart and with altered modes of consciousness as he attains the highest reaches of reason and approaches the preliminary stages of gnosis (maʿrifa).209 At this stage, he witnesses realities that are incomprehensible by reason. For instance, he perceives that faith and faithlessness are the same. Moreover, he perceives that the knowledge that he thinks he possesses is illusive and does not hold any value even in comparison to the illiterate and the ignorant. Th at is the case because this knowledge has been based on the realities of the corporeal realm of existence, which are faint manifestations of the attributes of God.210 Th is realization signifi es the juncture when reason sees the infi nite possibilities of perception and also its own insuffi ciency in interpreting them. Each seeker comes to grips with this consciousness according to one’s aptitude for understanding the limits of reason. One’s salvation 208 Ibid., 30: 22.209 Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, sec. 29, pp. 35–36.210 Maktūbāt, vol. 1, letter 25, sec. 339–40, pp. 210–11."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen79from the limitations of one’s own humanity and the limitations of rational faculties is to venture (himma) to question this acquired knowledge and strive for more at every stage of the path. Th is is how the wayfarer traverses one realm in the heart and in the unseen and becomes cognizant of the next one. Notwithstanding the intuitive and the supra-rational quality of these perceptions, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt asserts that he can confi rm these observations through analytical discourse. He is referring to the analytical and the discursive quality of his scholarly corpus that mainly concerns the nature of prophecy, the esoteric meaning of the Qurʾān, the relative nature of religion and faith, and the signifi cance of color and light photisms in defi ning his cosmogony and eschatology. Th e knowledge past reason is a spectrum similar to light; it illuminates what is still not in sight. In his writing, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt conveys this knowledge through the symbolism of light and shadow and good and evil. In personal correspondence he explains how an individual perceives this kind of knowledge.211O brave man! Just as it is impossible to contain the world of the prophets and the saints in the world of an embryo, thou knowest that the knowledge of the other world fi ts not in the patience (\u0005awalah) of reason and diff erentiation (tamyīz). And they call this faith of the unseen world (ghayb). As the sight of the heart gains light, it knows with certainty that a thing, still afar, awaits one on the path: a thing that he shall arrive at. It is at this station that one comes to distinguish the world wherein there is no limit to the Infi nite Units. At this stage, the infi nity of the traversed world seems to him confi ned. I cannot put into words the wonders that are manifest there.Seeing these wonders is facilitated by the gradual opening of the “inner sight” (infi tā\u0005 ʿayn al-baīra). Th e inner sight receives the illuminations of the unseen to the degree that the wayfarer is able to withstand their intensity. As he grows accustomed to these illuminations, his love for the beauty of the pre-eternal presence grows more intense. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt writes about this subject as he warns the reader that he is using words such as “accustomed” and “love” by necessity because language is inadequate in describing these meanings.212 He explains that insight (baīrat) attains pre-eternal truths through intuition (\u0005ads). At this stage, the act of perception as well as the perceived are still mediated. Th e relationship between insight (baīrat) and the 211 Ibid., sec. 343, p. 213.212 Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, sec. 2, p. 30."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"chapter three80obtained truths is established through sense perception (al-idrāk al-\u0005issī). Th is understanding involves traversing an infi nite distance that has no terminus. Paradoxically, this distance consists of stages whose fi nitude becomes apparent only when any given stage is mastered by the wayfarer. Th e knowledge of such fi nitude is obtained when the inner sight, or vision, “sees” types of truth. Consequently, one realizes there are more objects (non-corporeal as they may be) awaiting on the path.Th e Reality of DeathTh e reality of death is an early unveiling on the path by means of which ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt sees death as transcendence. Th is experience convinces him to refute the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead on the day of judgement, which is anticipated to take place at a specifi c and punctual juncture in linear time. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s observation is in accord with the views of Avicenna on the subject. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains:213My dear, whoever says that man is merely the body and it will crumble and perish in the grave, and calls the soul an accident and nothing other than that—as is the case with some rationalist theologians (mutakallimūn) who say that on the day of judgement God will recreate the body—and whoever considers the resurrection of the dead in this manner, his belief equals heresy. If mankind perished with death, why at the time of his death did Mu\"!afā, peace be upon him, say: “Rather, the ultimate friend, the purest life, and the perfection of completeness” ? And when he said: “Th e grave is an orchard in the gardens of the paradise or a pit in the voids of the fi re.” Or when to his daughter, may God be content with her, and she laughed, he said: “Indeed you are going to hasten aft er me”?214 Alas, why did Balāl the Abyssinian say at the moment of his death: “Tomorrow we will join the most beloved, Mu\fammad and his companions”? Hearken to this meaning whole from God: “Do not account those who die on the path of God dead, rather, they are alive before their Lord.” Why did Mu\"!afā, peace be upon him, elsewhere say: “Th e friends of God do not die but move from one world into another”?213 Tamhīdāt, sec. 216, p. 161.214 It is noteworthy that “hasten” (israʿ), which is derived from the root s-r-ʿ, resonates the causative form of the verb meaning “to make haste” (isrāʿ). Th is word in the oldest interpretations of the ascension (miʿrāj) was used to refer to his nocturnal journey to heaven. Th e angel Gabriel appeared to the Prophet and told him to make haste for the journey is at hand. Here, death is made analogous with the ascension."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen81In his discussion of death, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt makes a distinction between the death of the body and the death of the heart. Th e body inevitably disintegrates, but the heart is the humanity (basharīya) of man, which transcends corporeal time and space and survives death. If we understand the corporeal frame to be the heart, then we are mistaken, for the heart does not die, because it refl ects the image of God or the light that He bestowed on man at the time of the creation:215 Th e heart is the mirror in which the aff ections and the altercations between the lover and the beloved are refl ected.216 Th ese exchanges lead to the gradual opening of the “inner sight” (infi tā\u0005 ʿayn al-baīra) and the coming to light of one’s identity. Th is process occurs through death, when the heart is freed from the body and ready to join the beloved. In this manner, death facilitates the opening of the inner sight and the perception of the unseen (ghayb). Death itself becomes apprehensible by means of this process and is assimilated into the unveilings (mukāshafāt). Th erefore, death is a process of identifi cation and not an absolute and fi nal event. In the Tamhīdāt he describes his experience of a “mystical death” (mawt-i maʿnawī), which brought him in contact with infi nite realms of knowledge.217 In one instance he says:218O friend, that world is all life upon life; and this world is all death entwined with death. Unless you pass through death you will not reach life: “But verily the Home in the Hearaft er—that is life.”219 In another place He [God through Jesus] says: “He who was not born twice will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.”220 He says: the wayfarer must be born twice. He should once be born through his mother, so that he can see himself and this perishing world. And he should once be born of himself, so that he can see God and that everlasting world. If you want to hear this more completely, listen to how God informs of a people who say: Our Lord! Twice hast Th ou made us without life, and twice hast Th ou given us life!221 But know that there is a death above the death 215 Tamhīdāt, sec. 217–19, pp. 162–64.216 Th is situation is analogous with Ghazzālī’s observations concerning “love,” whereby, the “lover” of God could transcend his own “time” and join with the “beloved” in His realm where a diff erent concept of “time” dawns on the wayfarer.217 Tamhīdāt, sec. 219, p. 164.218 Ibid., sec. 418–20, pp. 319–21.219 Qurʾān, 29: 64.220 John 3: 3: KJV. “Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”221 Qurʾān, 40: 11. In a footnote to this verse, Yūsuf ʿAlī, the translator, explains that God created man out of clay when he was dead. Th en He brought him to life on this earth.

If you want to know more about the mystical life and death hear what Mu\"!afā said in his prayers: “O God, I am alive through you and die through you.” He says: God, I am alive through you and die through you. Do you at all understand what living and dying through him is?Alas, this is a state that is known by those who gaze at the beautiful witness (shāhid bāzān) and know how it is to be alive with the witness and what it means to be dead without him. Th e witness and the witnessed reveal the meaning of life and death to the true shāhid bāzān.I realize that these words do not exist in your world of habit. Th e world of habit is that of the [Islamic] law, and abiding by the law is abiding by habitude. Unless you give up habitude and abandon it, you cannot traverse the truth.

What can be said about the union? Alas “Th ere is no knowing except by seeing;” how can one who is not ensnared by love and by the witness know of this? If you want to know this more clearly, for us death is heresy and life is Islam and unity.“On the night of the ascension I saw my lord as a young man.” My friend, this is but the vision and the states of the teacher with the disciple. “Pay heed, the beardless youth has a complexion like that of God” is how the teacher trains the disciple and how he alarms him about this station of witnessing. As I said, shāhid bāzān know this death and life. To them, death is separation and exile, and life is meeting and ecstasy. What can one say about union? I regret “Th e description is no match for seeing it yourself.” What do those who are free from love and gazing upon the witness know!? If you wish to understand this more clearly: for us death is heresy and life is Islam and unitarianism.Mystical death is a visionary event that can take place during sleep or through spiritual wayfaring in wakefulness. It can be initiated through divine interference, as is the case with the Prophet and the angel Gabriel, when the divine guide takes the wayfarer out of his body into the heaven. Or it can be initiated by the wayfarer through his meditations, vigils, and supplications when he opens his heart to the"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen83unseen and calls out to God to allow him closer to His thresholds. In the case of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, his fi rst visions concern the mysteries of the Doomsday and the beauty and majesty of the divine attributes. He experiences the non-corporeal realities that are closer to the emanations of God and consequently feels more alive in this death than he has ever felt in living. He further perceives that dying is an occurrence that also takes place in the unseen as the wayfarer is ready to make a transition from one state of gnosis to the next one away from his self and closer to God.Travelling the Earth and the Sky Looking for the BelovedTh e passage above, from the Tamhīdāt, refers to the ascension (miʿrāj) of the Prophet who said: “On the night of the ascension I saw my lord as a young man.” ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt adds: “My friend, this is but the vision and the state of the teacher with the disciple.” Th e ascension, also known as the nocturnal journey (isrāʾ), is alluded to in the Qurʾān and discussed at length in the Islamic literature concerning this subject.222 Th ere are two major interpretations of the journey: one sees it as a corporeal passage, the other as a visionary transcendence.223 Th e oldest accounts, which are closest to the time of the Prophet, record it as a journey in body and fl esh from Mecca to Jerusalem in a brief portion of the night. Th e journey is described to have been so swift that when the Prophet returned his bed was still warm, and the jar of water by his bedside that had tumbled over at the time of his departure was still dripping water. It is said that the Prophet was sleeping in Mecca when he was wakened by the angel Gabriel, who took him to the holy city mounted on the back of the fabulous beast Burāq.224 Th ere he joined the other prophets of the Abrahamic tradition, Ibrahim, Moses, and 222 Qurʾān, 17: 1. “Glory to Allah who did take His Servant for a journey by night from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque, whose precincts We did bless—in order that We might show him some of Our Signs: for He is the one Who heareth and seeth (all things).”223 B.

Th e other reading of the ascension sees it as a visionary and incorporeal journey by means of which the Prophet is shown the holy city of Jerusalem. Th ese discussions defi ne the nocturnal journey either as a physical and spatial or a spiritual and visionary crossing. In her study of the life of the Prophet, Annemarie Schimmel remarks that the durationless instant that is witnessed in the advent of the nocturnal journey is a dominant motif in mystical literature at large. She is discussing the instant (waqt/ das Nu) as a mystical state in which the wayfarer traverses huge distances, and lives one or many lives in a manner that is incommensurate to our temporal and spatial dimensions. During his nocturnal journey, the Prophet came in contact with the nunc aeternum, which is beyond the “created, serial time.”226 Schimmel explains that for visionary mystics in the tradition of Ibn al-ʿArabī, waqt refers to the events of a visionary mode of experience that can be identifi ed as an eternal now as the wayfarer has a glimpse of the pre-eternal consciousness of God. Th ese mystics consider the ascension a visionary experience because God is omnipresent and the notion of physical transport to His abode is too crass to justify the encounter with His ever present eternity.227 Th e diff erences between Ibn al-ʿArabī and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt notwithstanding, the writings of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt support the visionary quality of the passage and identify the passenger to be the soul, not the man in the fl esh. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt takes the argument further and compares the pivotal transitions in the unseen, from one realm onto the next, with the experience of living and dying in the corporeal realm. Th at is why he takes the Prophet as witness and says: “But know that there is a death above the death of the body and understand that there is another life aside from the life of the body. If you want to know more about the mystical life and death hear what Mu\"!afā said in his prayers: ‘O God, 225 Th is is the journey during which the Prophet is instructed about the requirements for the Muslim ritual prayers. It is signifi cant that in leading the earlier prophets in prayer he is simultaneously exercising a newly learned lesson and practicing his role as the latest and the last Prophet whose mission is to complete the teachings of the others. Th is mission distinguishes him as the leader among his peers.226 Annemarie Schimmel, And Muhammad is His Messenger: Th e Veneration of the Prophet in Islamic Piety (Chapel Hill: Th e University of North Carolina Press, 1985), p. 161.227 Ibid., p. 165."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen85I am alive through you and die through you.’ He says: God, I am alive through you and die through you.

Citing Hujwīrī’s Kashf al-Ma\u0005jūb li-Arbāb al-Qulūb (Th e Unveiling of the Concealed for the People of the Heart), Zaehner explains:Th e kernel of the episode he calls the miʿrāj is the saying recorded by Sarrāj in which Abū Yazīd says that he ‘became a bird’, and aft er fl ying through all eternal modes of existence and seeing the tree of Oneness, he realized it was all ‘deceit’. ... Th is is how Hujwīrī’s account runs:My inmost soul (sirr) was rapt into the heavens, but it looked at nothing [on the way]. Heaven and hell were displayed to it, but it paid no attention to anything; and it was drawn up beyond [all] contingent beings and all that veiled him from its sight. And I became a bird and fl ew continuously in the atmosphere of [God’s] essence (hūwiyyat) until I overlooked the broad plain of oneness in which I saw the tree of eternity without beginning. When I looked [upon it all], all of it was I. I said: ‘O Lord God, so long as a sense of “I” remains, there is no way from me to thee, nor have I any means of passing beyond the selfh ood of self. What shall I do? [Th en] the command came [saying]: ‘O Abū Yazīd, thou canst not escape from thy consciousness of being a “thou” except by following our beloved; wipe thine eye with the dust of his feet as with a collyrium and never cease to follow aft er him.Th is, says Hūjwīrī, is known as the miʿrāj of Abū Yazīd.229Abū Yazīd is cited frequently in the writings of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, whose accounts on the transformation of his consciousness are more abstract compared to the personal and picturesque visions of Abū Yazīd and others like Rūzbihān al-Baqlī. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is one of these falcons who soar to the heavens and see that not only the corporeal world but also the heavens are ultimately illusive because they are manifestations of the attributes of the divine. Th e wayfarer learns that God’s essence is other than the visions that he has experienced so far, which have gauged his awareness of his self in distinction from God. Th is subject is treated in the discussion on God’s essence and attributes, which 228 Tamhīdāt, sec. 418, pp. 319–20.229 R.C.

He argues that distance and nearness are of mankind to God and not vice-versa because God is equally close to all of the creation at all times. In fact, all of the creation consists of varied degrees of luminosity or opacity, which form a spectrum of lights in relation to God as the Light of lights. In the fi nal analysis, these manifestations, whether in the corporal or the spiritual realms, are illusive because they are still far from the essence of God. Th at is why Abū Yazīd admits: “When I looked [upon it all], all of it was I. I said: ‘O Lord God, so long as a sense of “I” remains, there is no way from me to thee, nor have I any means of passing beyond the selfh ood of self. What shall I do?” Th e wayfarer perceives the overpowering grip of his self-identity and the self-contained identity of these realms, as he reaches the fringes of his own understanding and the limits of the world whose knowledge he has acquired. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt wishes to leave one realm in the unseen for the next. In order to escape this web of illusions in search of the truth, he dies to himself and is born into the realm that takes him closer to union with God. Th erefore, his miʿrāj consists of a series of lives and deaths in the unseen that defi ne and defy his ipseity in relation to God. Th e fi nal pages of the Tamhīdāt conclude the spiritual quest of the author as follows:230Alas, gnosis does not have any end and we shall not reach an end. But of course we wish to arrive at an end, but we shall not. We neither have knowledge nor are ignorant, neither have seeking nor abandoning, neither have benefi t nor are useless, neither are intoxicated nor sober, neither are together with ourself nor with him.

Mystical death is the baptism of the soul in the illuminations of God. Th e Tamhīdāt compares this death with the “second birth” that is vouchsafed by Christ. It cites Christ when he said, “He who is not born twice will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.”231 Th e prophet Jesus identifi ed the fi rst birth to be the physical birth into this world in order to see oneself in this transient realm, which God loves so much to have given to it “... His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”232 Th e second birth is out of one’s self in order to see God and the world of the spirit. Th ese births are focused on the corporeal side of existence and the dichotomy between the body and the spirit: the Fall, sin, body of Christ, and the salvation. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt identifi es with the teachings of Christ but diff erentiates mystical death as the preoccupation with life on the spiritual plain and the event that allows for living and dying in the unseen worlds. According to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, the spiritual teacher plays a critical role in leading the disciple to the unseen of his mystical quest because the teacher has come in contact with these realms and knows the route of the journey. Th erefore, he pays homage to his teacher A\fmad Ghazzālī whose views on God’s attribute of beauty take ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt closer to the unseen realms.233 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that mystical death and the opening of the eye of insight are the vehicles that take him where he perceives the manifestations of God’s beauty. Th is beauty is the texture of the world that opens before his sight and takes him to a more profound understanding of Heaven and Hell and the 231 John 3: 3.232 Ibid., 3: 16.233 Ni~ām al-Dīn A\fmad ibn Mu\fammad \u001fiddīqī al-\u000eusainī, Karāmāt al-Awlīyāʾ, MS 123, Catalogue no. 505, Biographies, Persian (Salar Jung Museum Library, Hyderabad), p. 331. Th is hagiography explains that Sul!ān Malik Shāh Saljūqī was a follower of Khawāja A\fmad and had brought his son, Sanjar, to study with him. Sanjar was very beautiful. One day, A\fmad drew him nigh and kissed him. Th ose who were present told the king about this. Th e king asked his son if he was kissed only on one cheek or on both cheeks. Sanjar said that he was kissed once. Malik Shāh said that means you will reign over half of the earth. Had you been kissed on both sides would had meant that you were to become the ruler of the whole world."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"chapter three88lights of Mu\fammad and Satan. On the corporeal plain of existence, the divine beauty is refl ected in the face of the beloved and the witness (shāhid) whose ensnaring allures elate and devastate the lover. Th is beauty ravishes his soul with the longing for the divine. Th e Prophet makes us wary of this beauty as he says: “Pay heed, the beardless youth has a complexion like that of God.” Th e witness is a youth who is met in mystical literature as a dominant topos. Th e prophet Joseph is the archetypal representation of the beauty that is manifest in the witness. Poets and authors have aspired to the beauty of Joseph and his trials and tribulations of love and exile, which end with his triumphant return to his natal land and to his father. Th e scripture draws the climactic conclusion of the story from the theme of seeing and blindness as Joseph delights in his father, and Jacob reclaims his sight in beholding the beauty of his beloved son. In the same vein, the beauty of the witness, as his name reveals, is a metaphorical niche, an abode, and a country where the lover and the beloved make a dwelling of love and rejoice in the intimacy they share. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt defi nes this beauty as a bliss and a heaven that he has visited.234But the beloveds of God—the most exalted—have a heaven besides this paradise [of the general belief]. Mu\"!afā—God’s praise be upon him—described this paradise saying that “on the night of ascension God told me: I promised my sincere servants what the eye does not see and the ear does not hear and what does not cross the heart of humanity.” When His friends see Him, they are in heaven. And when they are without Him, they see themselves in hell.Paradise and Hell are analogous with sight and blindness, gnosis and ignorance. Th e kind of seeing that is wrought through mystical death is a walk toward the paradise that is to be sought within the heart where the beauty of God can come into view. An extrinsic manifestation of that countenance is the beautiful face of the witness. A\fmad Ghazzālī was among the early mystics who expounded on the Platonic idea of contemplating beauty as a mystical praxis. Ghazzālī trained his disciples to gaze upon and contemplate the beauty of the witness (shāhīd) in preparation for the encounter with the beauty of God. His Sawāni\u0005 al-ʿUshshāq is best described as a spiritual psychology of love. Ghazzālī, an extraordinary dramatist of the soul, enacts the altercations between the lover and the beloved at the level of human attractions. He sails through the turbulent human erotic passions and longings 234 Tamhīdāt, sec. 381, p. 291."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen89and elaborates on how the wayfarer is perplexed and enlightened by beauty as he matures in love. Th e lover gains self-knowledge and gradually understands that his yearning for love is a symptom of his desire for the eternal beloved. He learns that the beautiful subject of his aff ection stands for the beauty that God bestowed on mankind when He created Adam in His own image. Th e lover’s tantalizing relationship with the beloved leads him where he is submerged in the unfathomable depths of his own heart. As he is sinking into the sea that is his own heart, he has glimpses of God who appears and disappears in and out of view. Th is beauty motivates him to advance into the uncharted waters of this sea and fi nd a better understanding of beauty, love, the beloved, passion, separation, and union. Th e teachings of Ghazzālī had a formative infl uence on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, who identifi ed the fi rst visions of the unseen as transcendence into the beauty of God. Accordingly, he described mystical death as the portal to the testimonial monism (wa\u0005dat al-shuhūd) in contrast to the unity of being (wa\u0005dat al-wujūd). As was discussed before, he sees God equally close to all of the creation, but the creation at varied distances from Him. Th e beauty that he sees in the creation and in the divine realm of attributes manifest ways of approaching God. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt pays homage to his spiritual teachers and also introduces himself to be an inspiring mentor for his own followers. He compares the teacher with the Prophet, for both have seen the unseen and are knowledgeable about the path. Furthermore, they communicate their knowledge to the disciple as revelatory reality. Th e introductory pages of Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, a major treatise from ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s early twenties, describe the inspiration for writing the text to have been the experience of the opening of the inner sight. Th e author identifi es A\fmad Ghazzālī as the person who facilitated this life-altering mystical experience and guided him in understanding it. Th e meeting is deemed so signifi cant that it overshadows the main subject: the opening of the eye of insight. Th e attention that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt pays to Ghazzālī highlights the importance of the teacher on the spiritual path. In numerous places in his writing, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt speaks about his teachers and guides both in the visible and the invisible worlds. His famous saying is that whoever does not have a teacher is being instructed by Satan. In some of his letters, he boasts about his own qualities as a teacher and says that in a brief period of time he can prepare any disciple for the most exalted mystical unveilings. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s vital link with his deceased mentors is a signifi cant focus in"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"chapter three90his life. For instance, he begins one of his letters on the relationship between life and death with the powerful image of his visit to the tomb of Shaykh Fata\fa. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt tells the interlocutor that he was inspired to write the letter earlier that day while he was performing the ritual prayer at the tomb of Fata\fa.235 In fact, visiting the tomb of this deceased Shaykh was a practice that he adopted under the tutelage of Baraka (Barakāt). He visited these burials as one would the shrine of a saint on a pilgrimage. Th ese visitations inspired him with original insight into death and confi rmed the relationship between ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and the deceased masters who guided him irrespective of physical distances. His writing is replete with references to these teachers and other spiritual guides, including angels and the Prophet Mu\fammad. Th ese connections confi rm that enlightenment, intuition, the gradual opening of the eye of insight, and mystical death are fostered and developed through the interactions between the disciple and the teacher. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt writes about the discussions that he and his scholarly community held on the Qurʾān and the \u0005adīth, and the visionary experiences that they shared. In the Tamhīdāt, he sounds like a teacher who has the brightest of his students in mind as his true readers. In fact, the seriousness of his teachings persuaded Khawāja Banda Nawāz Gīsūdarāz, the Chishtī master of Deccan, to prohibit the novice among his students from having any access to the Tamhīdāt. Th is text was studied exclusively by the advanced initiates among the disciples of Gīsūdarāz. Th e elevated meanings that it contains include meditation on the esoteric meanings of the Qurʾān as an essential mystical practice. His writing is replete with Qurʾānic verses, which navigate the wayfarer on the path. Occasionally, he reminds the reader to recite certain verses or prayers for producing specifi c results. For instance, the second chapter in the Tamhīdāt, “Introducing the Second Principle: Th e Conditions for the Wayfarer on the Path of God,” off ers the following prayer inscribed at the head of the Secret Tablet in heaven (al-law\u0005 al-ma\u0005fū\u0014):236 O my God, I call upon Th ee by Th y name, the hidden, the treasured. Th e revealed peace, the sacred holy, the purity and the pure.

Indeed Thou art praiseworthy and glorious.Reciting this prayer will elicit spiritual openings in the soul because it evokes the existing connection between God and all of the creation. Th is prayer is unveiled to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt in his visions of the unseen. It is a testament that God is hidden but not hiding and as near and as far as the voice that beseeches Him. Th e lord who is beseeched is the personal God of the narrator who invokes Him in an aff ectionate voice as “my God.” Th e narrator’s intimate knowledge of God could well be the reason why ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt declares that the Prophet is the only one worthy of reciting this prayer. Th e speaker identifi es his God as the being of all of the creation who is at the same time distinct, beyond, and above the creation, time, and space: “O being, O existent, O spirit, the Being before all of being and the Being aft er all being. O One who gives being to all of being.” Th e God who is conjured, “the hidden, the treasured,” as His name shows, is revealed in being and at the same time concealed from it: His being permeates through the texture of all being. Th e act of uttering the name of this God and appealing to His omniscience and omnipresence asserts the connection between the eternal and the temporal. Th is connection is most audible in the voice of the beseecher as he calls to the God who brought him to existence by saying “Be.” He calls out to the God who he knows is so near that all he has to do is reach out his hand and greet Him. His supplication 237 Th is line is in Hebrew but transliterated in Arabic. Ehyeh asher ehye adōnā ēbʾōt, (Exodus, 3:14).238 Qurʾān, 9: 129."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"chapter three92confi rms God’s justifi cation for creating the world when He explained: “I was a hidden treasure. I would fain be known. So I created man.” Comparing God to a hidden treasure is a parable in the Bible.239 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was informed about Christianity and Judaism, which he makes mention of in this prayer as well. Th e inclusion of the other faiths into an interpretation of Islam, which conceives God to be the great manifestation in all of the creation, is characteristic of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. In an economy of words, he brings together diff erent faiths and diff erent people in this supplication to God. Th e prayer embodies the following line in the original Hebrew that is transliterated in Arabic alphabet: “O Being of being. Lord of the armies.” ʿAfīf ʿUsayrān notes the Hebrew origin of this line.240 In the French translation of the Tamhīdāt, Christiane Tortel also refers to this line and argues that the present supplication is in reference to the Old Testament’s Book of Exodus and Samuel. He argues that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was using the Hebrew sources that he was introduced to through his contacts with the Jewish rabbis whose community at the time constituted ten percent of the population of Hamadhān.241 At this juncture in the prayer, the lord is referred to as the lord of the armies or sabaoth.242 Th is word comes from the Hebrew tsebhāʾōthʾ, and means armies or hosts and occurs twice in the Bible in the Lord of Sabaoth.243 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt follows this sentence with the Arabic “O mighty, O lord of the boundless army.” In this manner, he summons the people of diff erent religions and creeds as the followers of the Being of all beings. His non-sectarian approach to faith brought him in contact with Jewish and other non-Muslim peoples and texts that he could access in his time. He concludes the discussion on this prayer with the assertion that the legitimate reciter of this prayer is the Prophet Mu\fammad while the rest of us are subordinate to him.244 239 Matthew, 13:44. “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a fi eld; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that fi eld.”240 Tamhīdāt, p. 38n6.241 ʿAyn al-Quzât Hamadâni, Les Tentations Métaphysiques, translated by Christiane Tortel (Paris: Les Deux Océans, 1992), p. 70n1.242 Th is observation is based on a personal conversation I had with Professor Farhat Ziadeh in Seattle, Washington, on 10/24/2007.243 For a discussion on the etymology of this term by Valerius Maximus and its relationship with the cult of Jupiter Sabazius, see Peter Schafer, Judeophobia: Attitudes Toward the Jews in the Ancient World. 2d ed.

Moreover, the Prophet is the beloved of God and the archetypal teacher among men. Th erefore, he is the most qualifi ed to read the sacred writings in the unseen. By analogy, other spiritual teachers on the material plain, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his own mentors among them, are the authorities on the teachings of the unseen and the spiritual advancement of their disciples.Conjuring DeathTh e inscription on the Secret Tablet is among the many mysteries that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes in his writing. Yet, he does not reveal any intimate secrets about the spiritual practices that he and his circle engaged in so as to enter the special realms of consciousness, which he identifi es as mystical death and the opening of the eye of insight. In other words, he does not discuss how he was able to enter the unseen or what spiritual practices he and his friends followed in their seclusions (khalwa) and vigils. Th e meeting between ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and Ghazzālī, for instance, is characterized with inquiries as to what could have happened between them that initiated the subsequent Gestalt in the consciousness of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. His silence on the pragmatic properties of mystical death and the opening of the inner sight is uncharacteristic of him, lavishly eff usive as he usually is when discussing the secrets of the unseen. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s profuse descriptions are such that he is admonished by the Prophet, who appears to him and his intimates.245 Th erefore, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s refraining from disclosing the details of the meeting with Ghazzālī and his silence on the character of the esoteric exercises that he and his disciples performed raise questions about the origin of these practices. Discussion of death as a mystical practice is not exclusive to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. Th ere are other mystics who describe comparable out-of-body and near-death experiences and provide guidelines on how these states can be reached.

Among them, certain individuals are met who meditate their exodus from the body and the realm of material existence with the intention not to come back.246 Th e teachings of these traditions clearly outline certain meditations, mantras, and yoga practices that cause the inner sight to open and the death experience to occur. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his circle engaged in esoteric practices that are not explicable in an Islamic context. In one place in the Tamhīdāt, he describes a gathering of initiates at the house of a fellow mystic where the assembly takes part in dance and samāʿ. In their ecstasy and intoxication they have visions and perform wondrous acts, including causing one to die and another to rise from the dead.247 One in the assembly is so moved by the proceedings that he declares his desire for instantaneous death. It is not specifi ed if he is asking for his self to die or he wishes to die and leave this world permanently. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt invokes death and causes this person to die on the spot. His command illustrates that he is able to release the soul of the disciple from his body by, for instance, touching him or even casting a glance in his direction. Consequently, the disciple dies to his self, which is not identical to physical death. His death can also mean that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt lift ed the veils that conceal the unseen and showed marvels to the disciple that he was not physically and spiritually capable of enduring; therefore, he became absent from himself to the degree that he died. A similar account is related of Abū Yazīd al-Bis!āmī, who once cast a glance at a disciple and caused him to perish. When he was asked about this death, Abū Yazīd explained that his glance unveiled secrets that the disciple was incapable of witnessing.248 Th ese incidents depict the connection of these shaykhs with the spiritual realms whose force and intensity are incompatible with our human capacity for understanding and are consequently unbearable. In the journey of death, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his associates were constant visitors to these perilous terrains. Th e command that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt exercised over the corporeal realm is proof that the physical constraints of his humanity 246 Th is kind of death, also called mahasamādhi, is based on the consious decision of the individual to exit the body. Dharmic traditions and Tibetan Buddhism are famous for its practice through yoga and meditation. Th is death is fi nal but in contrast to suicide, it denotes the yogi or the spiritual master’s enlightened decision to manifest his/her own exit out of the material world.247 Tamhīdāt, sec. 328, pp. 250–51.248 A!!ār, Farīd al-Dīn.

His consciousness, which transcends matter and joins the subtle spiritual realms, perceives that all of creation is ultimately non-corporeal and our attachment to the body and matter is but a delusion. Th is gnosis enables him to base his mystical arguments on the knowledge that everything is light.249Alas, if I say what light is you would not bear it and the worlds will be turned upside down. But I will not withhold it, and I will say it by means of allusion. Hearken: “God is the light of the heaven and the earth”250 means that He is the origin of “the heaven and the earth.” Th e essence of the being of the earth and the sky is His light. Did not \u000eusayn-i Man\"ūr tell you that “God is the origin of all the creatures?” His being is the source and the substance of all the creatures. It means “ God and His light are the source of the lights.”God is manifest as light in all of creation, which is but diff erent gradations of light. Th is perspective binds all of creation directly and securely to God. As the prayer on the Secret Tablet attests, God permeates all of creation and is the substance and the vehicle for the connection between diff erent manifestations. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt admits that he is revealing secrets that are supposed to be kept hidden because human beings do not have the capacity to know them and still remain obedient to the all-merciful and forgiving God. At one place in the Tamhīdāt, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt relates that his colleague Shaykh Siyāwash, visited and informed him that the Prophet appeared in his dream and admonished ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt for his impatience in reaching union with God.251 Th is is an extraordinary vision since the Prophet is said to appear only to the most select among the believers. Th e appearance of the Prophet in a person’s dream is considered to be not fancy but reality because Satan cannot disguise himself as the Prophet.252 Th is is a theme oft en mentioned in Islamic texts. We learn from al-Qushayrī that: “Some say there are meanings in sleep that are not available in wakefulness. Among them is seeing the Prophet, may peace be upon him, the companions, and the righteous of the past, in sleep and not in wakefulness; and also seeing 249 Tamhīdāt, sec. 338, p. 257.250 Qurʾān, 24: 35.251 Tamhīdāt, sec. 304, p. 234.252 ʿAbū al-Qāsim al-Qushayrī, Al-Risāla al-Qushayrīya, edited by ʿAbdal-\u000ealīm Ma\fmūd and Ma\fmūd ibn al-Sharīf (Cairo: Dār al-Shaʿb, 1973), p. 526; henceforth cited as Al-Qushayrī, Al-Risāla al-Qushayrīya."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"chapter three96the Truth in sleep. Th is is a great attribute.”253 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that upon hearing the dream of Sīyāwash, he sank into himself, brooding over the message of the Prophet. As he came back, he saw the Prophet before him, who said, “Shaykh Sīyāwash could not tolerate seeing me in wakefulness, consequently, I appeared to him in his dream.” In contrast, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt in his physical body and in a state of wakefulness could withstand the presence of the Prophet. Th is is another instance that demonstrates ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s ability to withstand the realities of the unseen. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt complains that some people interpret his abilities as acts of thaumaturgy.Magical WondersSuch instances describe the stupefying quality of the visions and the events that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his circle shared and explain why some regarded their activities as acts of sorcery. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt admits that he is at times so startled with the unveilings that his state might appear as that of an incarnationist (\u0005ulūlī). He rejects that his soul is overcome by any divine visitors and says the following:254Alas, I do not know what I am saying! At this station directions are obliterated. Any thing that the soul turns to becomes its prayer direction. “Withersoever ye turn, there is Allah’s countenance”255 is where there is neither night nor day. How can the soul seize time for the fi ve prayers? “Th ere is neither day nor night with my Lord” is this meaning. Pity on the charlatans of the age, the ignorant pseudo-scholars, the immature juveniles who count this path as incarnation! May my life be shed as sacrifi ce on the ground beneath the strides of such an incarnation!Th e suspicion of being an incarnationist and a sorcerer existed despite his renown as an exceptional scholar of Islam who belonged to a family of judges. When he refers to the skeptics, he does not explain who exactly they are. We know that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was in contact with persons from diff erent walks of life and was equally at ease with the Muslim and the non-Muslim, the noble and the common, and the scholarly intellectual and the visionary mystic. His intimates and associates included the notables of Hamadhān, government offi cials and dignitaries, fellow initiates, scholars, and shaykhs who were not 253 Ibid., 529.254 Tamhīdāt, sec. 119, p. 83.255 Qurʾān, 2: 115."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen97necessarily famous or well educated. His shaykh, Baraka, for instance, had a limited knowledge of Arabic and was not even fl uent in his native dialect of Hamadhān.256 Nonetheless, his intuitive knowledge of the Qurʾān was so superior that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt attributes his own learning on this subject to the years that he spent in his tutelage. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s personal correspondence off ers an understanding of his community and the extent of his public exposure to the elite and the common in Hamadhān. Consequently, when he expresses dismay that he is suspected of engaging in sorcery, the community at large, which includes his friends and foes, comes to mind. Many Muslim mystics of the medieval period were accused of sorcery. \u000eallāj and Suhrawardī al-Maqtūl are famous examples among those who were reputed to perform white magic in order to impress the validity of their spiritual authority upon others. \u000eallāj was said to have acquired this art in India. Some even said that he went to India specifi cally to learn white magic. Massignon enumerates diff erent medieval accounts on this subject, including the famous tale of the “Rope Trick.” Th e version given in the Kitāb al-ʿUyūn off ers interesting detail. A friend of \u000eallāj who accompanied him on a visit to Mecca, explains that aft er their pilgrimage \u000eallāj decided to stay behind and to not return to Iraq. He advised this friend “If you want to return with them, go ahead! As for me, I feel inclined to go from here to India.”257 Th e narrator decided to accompany him to India. He relates the following about \u000eallāj in India.Once there, he asked information about a certain woman, went to fi nd her, and chatted with her. She arranged to meet him the next day; and the next day, she left with him for the sea coast, with a rope twisted and tied in knots, like a veritable ladder. Once there, the woman said some words, and she climbed up this rope—she placed her foot on the rope, and she climbed, so much that she disappeared from our sight. And \u000eallāj, returning to me, said ‘Th is is why I came to India—to meet this woman.’”258Suhrawardī is recorded to have performed wonders that were interpreted as sorcery.

We told the Shaykh: ‘Master, we need a sheep from among these in order to eat.’ He said: ‘I have ten dirhams take them and buy a sheep with them.’ Th e Turkman was there and we bought a sheep from him. Th en we walked a little but one of his companions caught up with us and said: ‘Return this sheep and get a smaller one because he did not know about the exchange. Th is sheep is worth more than the price that it is sold for.’ We got into arguing with him. When the Shaykh found out, he told us: ‘Take the sheep and walk away. I will stay with him and make him content.’ We set off and the Shaykh stayed, speaking with him deft ly and amicably. As we went some distance away, the Shaykh left him and followed us. Th e Turkman kept aft er him, calling out and protesting but he did not pay any attention to him. As he did not speak with him, he [the Turkman] grabbed on to him with anger and grasped his left hand saying: ‘Where are you going and leaving me?’ Lo and behold, the arm of the Shaykh detached from his shoulder and remained in the hand of the Turkman, with blood streaming. Th e Turkman was astounded and petrifi ed by this aff air. He dropped the arm in fear. Th e Shaykh returned, took this arm with his right hand, and joined us. The Turkman headed back looking at him until he disappeared from view. When the Shaykh reached us, we saw in his right hand just a handkerchief and nothing else. Many stories such as this are said about him. God only knows about their validity.Sorcery was one of the accusations that embellished the charge of heresy against Suhrawardī. Th e other charges, similar to those against Socrates, were corrupting religion and corrupting the young.260 In the case of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, he came to his own defense and expressed regret that people suspected his extraordinary connection with the unseen as thaumaturgical acts of illusion and magic. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was able to join the spiritual realms and alter and aff ect the composition of matter at that level. Accordingly, he could conjure life and death upon others, or converse with the Prophet, whose presence caused 259 Ibn Khallikān, Wafīāt al-Aʿyān wa Anbāʾu Abnāʿ al-Zamān, vol.6, edited by I\fsān ʿAbbās (Beirut: Dār \u001fādir, 1961), pp. 269–70.260 Hossein Ziai, “Shihāb al-Dīn Suhrawardī: Founder of the Illuminationsit School,” in History of Islamic Philosophy, edited by Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Oliver Leaman (London: Routledge, 2001), p. 435."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen99ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s companion Shaykh Siyāwash, who was another holy man of God, to burn.261 In this account, Mu\fammad manifests the light and the fi re, which in ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt represent God’s attributes of beauty and majesty. In the present instance, he expresses himself as the emissary of these attributes. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is represented as the confi dent who is capable and worthy of beholding the fi re in Mu\fammad’s light without being harmed or hindered. By these lights, the Prophet reminds him of the message that he related through Shaykh Siyāwash about the veils that separate the creatures, including himself, from the divine. He reiterates the value of patience in accosting the thresholds of God. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt summarizes Mu\fammad’s message through Siyāwash: “Tell our ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt to wait for a while; even we are not yet settled in the divine dwellings. Acquiesce to awaiting until the time comes for us to have all nearness without distance, and all union without separation.”262 Th is vision is in accord with the account of the miʿrāj (ascension) of Abū Yazīd al-Bis!āmī, whom ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt recalls at several places in this section of the Tamhīdāt (Introducing the Ninth Principle: An Explanation of the Reality of Faith and Faithlessness). Abū Yazīd also beholds the light and the fi re of the Prophet as he comes in contact with him aft er he has held extensive conversations with God on the true identity of the lover and the beloved. Al-Sahlajī’s (d. a.d. 1082 or 1083) account of Abū Yazīd’s miʿrāj thus renders the encounter with the Prophet: “No soul of a prophet did I pass but that I greeted it and gave it my peace except the soul of Mu\fammad.

Hence until you have crossed the valley of ‘Th ere is no god but God’, you cannot attain to the valley of ‘Muhammad is the Messenger of God’.265He further explains that both valleys are one but are not perceived as such because the wayfarer sees them according to his or her own limitations. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes his special ability to partake of these mysteries, which the people interpret as thaumaturgical acts. When he mentions that people misinterpret his powers, he does not explain whether these people are his adversaries in the government or the towns people of Hamadhān. His friend Kāmil al-Dawla, an offi cial in the Saljūq bureaucracy, warns him of rumors and accusations against him.266 Considering that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his intimates held their majālīs (gatherings) in the privacy of their homes or hospices, as is evidenced in his letters and his other writings, the reference to the common people raises the suspicion that he did not conceal his ability to execute wondrous acts from the public, either intentionally or involuntarily. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was introspective and astute but also reckless and impatient: characteristics that are paramount in Siyāwash’s dream of the Prophet when he cautions ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt not to reveal any more secrets. It is plausible that his wonder-making (karāmāt), similar to Suhrawardī’s, was a part of his life that involved the public and went beyond the confi nes of his students and fellow associates. He would have done that intentionally in order to show signs verifying his sayings, involuntarily as he was absent from himself, or perhaps unconsciously to exercise his youthful desire for recognition and validation.264 Ibid.265 Ibid.266 Tamhīdāt, sec. 329, p. 251."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen101Th e China of the HeartʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s unconventional personality and his controversial arguments on the nature of prophecy, Satan, death, and heresy, were issues of special scrutiny for his adversaries. Th ese views belonged in the Islamic mystical tradition and were informed by the teachings of \u000eallāj according to whom the true believer questioned faith categorically in his/her quest for the “transcendence of duality” and union with God.267 \u000eallāj was an advocate for infi delity, which he defi ned in terms of a restlessness on the part of the knowing wayfarer who considered all of his previous certitudes and declarations of faith as attestations to the dualism that separated him from God. In this context, idolatry and infi delity were one’s assumption that he had attained knowledge of God. Th e wayfarer’s questioning walk toward God, which the notional religion defi ned as infi delity, was his way of staying on course in his move toward union with God. \u000eallāj described faith, infi delity, knowledge, ignorance, and duality and its transcendence, as a confl uence whose entirety was a manifestation of God.268 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt aspired to the teachings of \u000eallāj and regarded Satan highly as the lover who negated the command of God and was thus proclaimed an infi del.269 Th is is how Satan was cast on the path of scrutinizing his fateful infi delity and contemplating the inscrutable ways of God. Th is dynamic quest inspired the wayfarer to abandon religious law and become an infi del and a madman so that he could navigate his way through confusion and self-deception. Th erefore, the non-Muslim and the idol-worshipper were not heretical on account of their belief. Th ey were idolaters because they believed in one manifestation of God as the destination of their faith. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt argued that all of existence was subjected to idolatry because of its intrinsic distance from the unity of God. In this midst, the wayfarer was distinguished as the knowing idolater who rose against himself every step of the way, transcending duality. He exercised this ordeal through annihilation and subsistence.270 Th is spiral cycle of dualistic 267 Carl Ernst, Words of Ecstasy in Sufi sm, (New York: State University of New York Press, 1985), p. 64.268 Ibid., p. 65. 269 Ibid., pp. 78-79.

Considering the quality of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussions on this subject, one can deduce that he was receptive to non-Islamic spiritual traditions that provided him with greater access to the unseen. As mentioned earlier, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refrained from explaining how he was able to cross over into the realm of death. It is likely that his silence is to conceal the non-Islamic roots of the exercises that he practiced. His writings imply that some of his spiritual practices were attributed to the “heathen” of the East. Th e discussion on traditional Islam and the fi ve pillars of the religion provides him the opportunity to speak about what lies beyond the Muslim religious norms, rituals, and givens of faith. Th ese discussions are set forth in the fi ft h chapter of the Tamhīdāt, “Describing the Five Pillars of Islam.” Th e preceding and the following chapters are entitled “Know Yourself in Order to Know God,” and “Reality and the States of Love.” ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that the profession of faith, ritual prayer, fasting, alms tax, and pilgrimage to Mecca, are exoteric aspects of Islam. He argues, it is true that all Muslims should abide by them, but the mystic learns to perceive these duties as symbolic expressions of a visceral seeking aft er God. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt interprets the pillars of Islam not in light of piety and heresy or reward and punishment, but in the context of the journey through the heart to the China (īn) of the quest. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt employs the word China as a topos for a spiritual geography that depicts a transfused state of consciousness. He begins the chapter on the fi ve pillars of Islam by quoting the Prophet who said that God commands Muslims to seek the knowledge of God and even go as far as China to attain it.271 Th is is the second time that China is mentioned in the Tamhīdāt. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt uses China (īn) as an intentionally ambiguous term which refers to the land China, the Qurʾānic chapter “\u001fād,” and the ocean of knowledge that is identifi ed by the letter ād, the fourteenth letter of the Arabic alphabet. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt works with these layers of meaning as he leads the wayfarer on the pilgrimage to the kaʿba of the heart. Th e purpose of the journey is twofold: to become aware that one carries the image of God within himself and that one is capable of fi nding God in one’s heart. Th e wayfarer fi nds his way to his heart as an exile fi nds the way back to his homeland. His return journey is analogous to the Prophet’s 271 Tamhīdāt, sec. 88, pp. 64–65."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen103homecoming to his natal land Mecca, whence he was sent into exile earlier in his life. In vernacular Persian, China and its environs (chīn wa māchīn) is used as an idiom denoting a milestone or an exotic venture; however, it is diffi cult to believe that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is using this word merely as such because it is not part of his diction. In the Tamhīdāt, China is used in three instances and only when he writes about where the knowledge of God can be sought. Th e fi rst reference is in the beginning of the Tamhīdāt when ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt classifi es four kinds of knowledge: human, angelic, creatural, and divine. Th e last of these is found in China, the route to which is through the heart of the wayfarer. Th is destination comes into view as the wayfarer gains self-knowledge. Initially, he ponders his heart through his thoughts, intentions, desires, and apprehensions. Th en, visions of the unseen are revealed to him and he gauges the capacities of his heart in facing these hidden meanings. In this manner, he perceives the knowledge of God that is invested in his heart. Th e last time that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refers to China is when he identifi es it as the prayer direction (kaʿba) of the heart.272 He describes this place by turning to an early Meccan revelation, al-Balad (Th e City), of the Qurʾān:273    /    I do call to witness this city / And thou art a freeman of this city.Mecca is the natal land of the Prophet where he enjoyed the freedom and the right of a full citizen.

He was attacked by his Quraysh kins and countrymen, was ostracized, and cast away to a place that he merely called the city (Madīna). Th is exile came to an end when he was able to fi nd a safe voyage back to his homeland. By juxtaposing China with Mecca, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt reconstructs a decisive moment in the historical memory of Islam in order to explain the esoteric meaning of Mecca, the kaʿba, and the trials of the path. 272 Ibid., cf. sec. 113, p. 80.273 Qurʾān, 90: 1–2."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"chapter three104Th e center of action in this narrative consists of the Prophet, who is exiled from Mecca, and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s wayfarer who strives to reach the citadel of his heart.

Th e China of his heart, like the China of popular culture, is where images of idols, deities, goddesses, and false beloveds rival the image of the true one. Like the Prophet who claimed the kaʿba, the wayfarer is free to claim the city within his heart even at the risk of being chased away by his own kins and tribesmen. Th e wayfarer is entangled with his self and his subjectivity: his confi dents and his adversaries. Th ese false, but real, companions of his heart distract him from his true father, just as Mu\fammad’s Quraysh tribesmen were surrogates for the father that he as an orphan did not have. Th e China of his heart is where the beloved is hidden among these idols. Unless the house is cleared of these images, the face of the beloved will not become visible. As ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains, there is an ocean that fl ows through the China of the heart.

Th e sixth imām, Jaʿfar al-\u001fādīq (a.d. 702–65), whose esoteric commentary on the Qurʾān was a principal reference for the mystics, described the ocean ād as the ocean of gnosis that takes the wayfarer to the fi rmament (ʿarsh) and to the throne of God (kursī).275 In Shar\u0005-i Sha\u0007\u0005īyyāt (An Exegesis of Ecstatic Sayings), Rūzbihān Baqlī (a.d. 1128–1209 ) explains that the letter ād is the sight of the intelligences and the souls when they look upon the eternity. Th ese mysteries are perceived by the intelligences and conveyed to the souls who manifest them as apparitions (ashbā\u0005).276 In ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussion, the ocean ād is an atemporal and aspatial place of no-place where there is neither day nor night, nor 274 Ibid., 11: 7.He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days—and His Th rone was over the Waters—that He might try you, which of you is best in conduct.

Th is is the region where eternal emanations illuminate the fi rst creation of God, the light of Mu\fammad. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt summons the reader to the shores of this ocean with the following verse from the Qurʾān, “   ” (Sād, by the Qurʾān, full of dhikr).278 This overture to the sūra highlights the importance of remembrance (dhikr) in taking the wayfarer to the threshold of the beloved. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refers to a verse that begins with an abbreviated letter (muqa\u0007\u0007aʿ) that accentuates the significance of the breath, and in a single letter of the alphabet (ād, the fourteenth letter of the Arabic alphabet) connects the human to the divine as dhikr or a mantra is expected to do. The ād of the Qurʾān and the īn (China) of the \u0005adīth in ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussion are joined in the heart of the wayfarer through the stream of remembrance. In this context, China is introduced as a place of serenity where all the clutter, false images, attachments, and distractions, are cleared, so that the visage of the beloved can come into view. The wayfarer ultimately makes a dwelling in his heart where he conjures this image through the mantra. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussion on China suggests that he is camouflaging an actual reference to the territories of the “heathen,” the yogis, Brahmans, astronomers, and shamans who lived east of Hamadhān, Bukhārā, and Khawārazm. His allusion is disguised in the garb of a popular idiom, which stands for the distant, the exotic, and the arduous. In his discussion, China as a geographic referent, even as a figure of speech, parallels Mecca and stands for a spiritual path to God.Faith and HeresyA major discussion in the scholarship on Islamic mysticism concerns its relationship with the Indian and the Buddhist spiritual traditions and its philosophical and practical borrowings from them. Th e case of one of the earliest Muslim mystics, Abū Yazīd al-Bis!āmī, gave rise to 277 Tamhīdāt, sec. 113, p. 80. Cf. Ibid, sec. 119, p. 83. 278 Qurʾān, 38: 1, in Tamhīdāt, sec. 88, pp. 64–65."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"chapter three106much debate. Nicholson, the famous orientalist of the turn of the twentieth century, argued that al-Bis!āmī was indebted to his Indian teacher Abū ʿAlī al-Sindī for his major discussions, specially on the subject of annihilation (fanāʾ). In the following years, this observation was supported by some and refuted by the others. Zaehner explained that al-Sindī was a convert to Islam about whom Abū Yazīd says: “I used to keep company with Abū ʿAlī al-Sindī and I used to show him how to perform the obligatory duties of Islam, and in exchange he would give me instruction in the divine unity (taw\u0005īd) and in the ultimate truths (\u0005aqāʾīq).”279 In the realm of practical rituals, Muslim mystics are said to have learned certain practices from their counterparts in the East. Th ey chanted mantras, used the rosary, followed a restricted diet, and practiced meditation, seclusion, and yoga. Th e Muslim people of medieval Persia and its elite scholars, specifi cally, knew about the spiritual traditions of the Brahmans and the Buddhists of greater Iran and the Indian sub-continent. Th e history of the cultural, religious, and commercial exchanges between these people goes back to the pre-Islamic times of the Parthians, Soqdians, and the prophet Mānī. Th ere is an abundance of historical and cultural material tracing the life of these communities, Muslim converts or not, in the Bukhārā of Avicenna and Khawārazm of Abū al-Ray\fān Mu\fammad ibn A\fmad al-Bīrūnī (a.d. 973–1048/1050). Avicenna’s Risālat al-A\t\u0005awiya fī Amr al-Maʿād (Th e A\u0002\fawiya Treatise on the Subject of Resurrection), and Bīrūnī’s Tārīkh al-Hind (Al-Beruni’s India) speak extensively on the subject of the transmigration of the soul, reincarnation, and the spiritual traditions and practices of the Hindu and the Buddhist peoples in the Indian subcontinent. Th e journey of Man\"ūr ibn \u000eallāj to India in search of spiritual wonders was widely discussed during his lifetime and for generations to come. Medieval historiography and mystical literature are replete with references to one of the archetypal early Muslim mystics, Prince Ibrāhīm ibn Adham (d. a.d. 777) who like Buddha renounced his courtly life in search of enlightenment and is called the Muslim Buddha. Ignac Goldziher, among others, argues for Buddhist infl uence on Islamic mysticism and its popular culture. He refers to the legend of Ibrāhīm ibn Adham as follows:It is plainly decisive of our question that the legend of one of the most eminent patriarchs of Sufi sm has the lineaments of the biography of the 279 Zaehner, Hindu and Muslim Mysticism, pp. 93–94."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen107Buddha. I have in mind the legend of the holy Ibrāhīm ibn Adham (d. ca. 160/162 = 776/778). Various legends propose various immediate motives for his fl ight from the world, but all versions serve a single theme: Ibrāhīm, the son of a king from Balkh—summoned, according to some reporters, by a divine voice; prompted, according to others, by contemplating the modest and carefree life of a poor man he observes from his palace window—casts aside his princely cloak and exchanges it for beggar’s clothes, leaves his palace, severs all ties to this world—even to wife and child—goes to the desert, and there leads a wanderer’s life.280In ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s time, a detailed treatise on the life and the teachings of Buddha (al-Budd) was composed by the renowned author of al-Milal wa al-Ni\u0005al (Th e Religions and the Sects), Abū al-Fat\f Mu\fammad ibn ʿAbdal-Karīm ibn A\fmad al-Shahrastānī (a.d. 1076–1153), known as Tādj al-Dīn (the Crown of the Religion). Th is Muslim heresiographer remarked that the ethics of Buddhist path are very similar to those of the sufi s.281 Shahrastānī was thirty years older than ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and outlived him by twenty–two years. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt knew about Shahrastānī and his work either directly or through his teacher A\fmad Ghazzālī, whose brother Mu\fammad was a friend of Shahrastānī’s teacher in Shāfi ʿī jurisprudence, Qā\u0002ī Abū al-Mu~aff ar A\fmad ibn Mu\fammad al-Khwafī (d. a.d. 1106).282 Th e discussion on faith and heresy is crucial for ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, who was known for his unswerving focus on transcending the limits of knowledge and the boundaries of any faith, even Islam.283 It is natural that he is open to other religions, sects, and creeds and to their spiritual traditions. In his writing, he refers to the people of the book (Muslims, Jews and Christians), and although he does not identify Buddhist monks and the Brahmans, he speaks about the zanādiqa, the majūs, and the dualists. In his era, these terms included not only the Zoroastrians but also the Manichaeans, the dualists in general, Sabians, Buddhists, Hindus, and the atheists. Identifying the teachings of the monks and the Brahmans as an inspiration for his own spiritual practices had to be avoided, because any overt association between his 280 Ignaz Goldziher, Introduction to Islamic Th eology and Law, translated by Andras and Ruth Hamori, (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1981), p. 143. 281 David Scott, “Buddhism and Islam: Past to Present Encounters and Interfaith Lessons,” in Numen, 42: 2 (1995): 145. 282 G.

Th e following is one of several examples in his writings that demonstrate his close affi nity with the other spiritual traditions.284Alas, these meanings dawn on someone who has gone beyond seventy some various religions. One who has not yet seen one religion entirely is far from this discussion. Wait until these words light upon you that the Jews and the Christians said: “Indeed the lights issue from the essence of the Lord.” Th ey say: “Its light is issued” comes from Him. “God is the source of the creatures” means this. The Magi ( fire worshippers) said, deity is dual: one Yazdān and that is light; the other, Ahriman and that is darkness. Light is the commander of devotion, and darkness the commander of sins. Light is the promise of day, and darkness the resurrection of night. Kufr comes from one and belief from the other. Th e heretics and the physicists said that the fi rmament is the creator of the world. Th ey consider the elements to be eternal. Th e form of these intricacies has deprived them from the truth.He argues that all belief systems, monistic or not, share in common the understanding that light is the source of all the creation. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes this light as the illuminations of God’s essence that are trickled into the world of attributes. In this context, kafr / kifr / kufr, meaning concealing / darkness of the night / infi delity, which are deduced from the three letter Arabic root “k - f - r,” describe disbelief as concealment of the truth, the absence of light, and the inability to see. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was a genuine thinker who kept his mind and heart open to diverse systems of thought. Th e complex quality of his writing clearly demonstrates the breath and depth of his learning and cultural infl uences. His predilection for the other faiths did not stand at odds with how he articulated himself as a Muslim and how he relied on the teachings of the Prophet and the Qurʾān. Against this background, he speaks about a God who issues through all of the creation regardless of how He is perceived. Th e seeker ultimately fi nds this abstract but intimate god through stages in his own heart. Th rough death, the content of the heart is the consciousness that transcends the physical realm into other dimensions of being. Th ese arguments are found among the non-Muslim sages who appear in his writing. Just as ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was informed about the rabbinic and the apostolic teachings, he knew about the teachings of the Buddhist monks through oral and written accounts that were in circulation during his time.

Th e case of a later mystic ʿAlāʾ al-Dawla al-Simnānī (a.d. 1261–1336) provides valuable insight on the intricate quality of the hybrid culture at the court of his Mongol patron Arghūn (r. a.d. 1284–92) who was known for his fi rm Buddhist beliefs and his antagonism toward Islam. Simnānī was a zealous Muslim from the same region in Iran as Ghazzālī and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. He belonged to a noble family of land-owners and court administrators. As a young man of twenty–six, while he was in the service of Arghūn, he left his court without leave in order to travel to Baghdād and meet a famous mystic, Nūr al-Dīn Isfarāʾinī. His escape was interrupted as Arghūn, who was fond of him, sent troops to Hamadhān and brought him back.285 Aft er his forced return, Arghūn ordered him to enter a debate with a Buddhist monk “... but Simnānī defeated the Buddhist by demonstrating that he was ignorant of the true meaning of Buddha’s teachings.”286 Th eir match points to the blended quality of the religious culture of Simnānī’s era whence a devout Muslim scholar emerged with such an in-depth knowledge of Buddhism that he could challenge a monk. In this context, it is signifi cant to add that Simnānī was motivated to travel to Baghdād in order to meet the Shaykh of his Muslim prayer companion. Simnānī fi rst learned about this teacher by observing his friend as he followed his methodology of repeating a certain mantra (dhikr).287 When Simnānī repeated the dhikr, he was transported into a state unlike any that he had experienced before. Th e mantra was repeated regularly along with energy-control techniques 285 Jamal J. Elias, Th e Th rone Carrier of God: Th e Life and Th ought of ʿAlāʾ Ad-Dawla As-Simnānī (New York: State University of New York Press, 1995), pp. 25-26. 286 Ibid., p. 26. 287 Ibid., 24. His prayer companion, \u000eanawayh was a student of Isfarāʾinī.\u000eanawayh stated that his shaykh had taught him the practice and he did not dare alter it. Th en he explained the signifi cance of moving his head:With the lā ilāha (Th ere is no god) I negate everything besides God, and with the illaʾllāh (except Allāh) I affi rm the love of God in the heart. I move so that the energy of the dhikr reaches the pineal [physical] heart which is located in the fl ank of the human body. As a result, the transparency (shaff āfī) which lies between this [physical] heart and the real [mystical] heart becomes actualized, and the light of faith casts a ray from the real heart upon the human body.Upon hearing this, Simnānī beseched \u000eanawayh to teach this dhikr. ...

Th is practice resonated closely with Simnānī who regardless of his scorn for his Buddhist challenger, had an affi nity for such spiritual exercises that were prevalent among the Buddhist members of his community. In addition to the cultural memories that comprised the rich history of the interactions among the Muslims and the Buddhists of Iran and its neighboring regions, tales about India and its fabulous traditions were current in ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s Hamadhān. Situated in the Jibāl, this city was a major metropolis on the Silk Route to Baghdād and Rūm and off ered lodging for merchants and travellers from China and the Indian subcontinent. Th e most famous medieval text on India and its religious traditions is Tārīkh al-Hind (Al-Beruni’s India) of al-Bīrūnī (a.d. 973–1048/1050), the renowned scientist and anthropologist of medieval Islam. Al-Bīrūnī conducted research for this work in the course of several travels to India as a member of Sultan Ma\fmūd Ghaznawī’s entourage during his India expedition campaigns. Tārīkh al-Hind was fi nally completed in a.d. 1030 as an encyclopedic compilation on India. Th e text included detailed discussions on the topography and inhabitants of India, its traditions, sciences, and the Brahmans and the other sects and their religious traditions. Al-Bīrūnī provided extensive information on the art of meditation and the yogic life. His observations on India were supported through the written and oral sources that he obtained during his research there. Th e chapter entitled About What is Due to the Bodies of the Dead and of the Living (i.e., About Burying and Suicide), speaks about Socrates in the Phaedo and Crito, Galens, the Alexandrian Neoplatonist Johannes Grammaticus, the Zoroastrians, Mani, the Hindus, and the Buddha.288 Th ese references demonstrate the breadth and depth of the knowledge that comprised the intellectual sensibility of his era. Al-Bīrūnī appealed to these sources in the search for the meaning of life and death: his approach underscored the signifi cance of India and its non-Islamic traditions in this quest. It has been argued that al-Bīrūnī’s work on India was not widely read during his time.289 Lack of familiarity with this work could not 288 Abū al-Ray\fān Mu\fammad ibn A\fmad al-Bīrūnī, Al-Beruni’s India: An Account of the Religion, Philosophy, Literature, Geography, Chronology, Astronomy, Customs, Laws, and Astrology of India About a.d. 1030, translated by Eduard Sachau (Delhi: S.

Th e celebrated scholar of Hamadhān, Avicenna was informed about al-Bīrūnī’s work. Th e two had known each other and were in contact, although their relationship was contentious. Th ey were about the same age (Avicenna was seven years younger) and shared many similar interests in medicine, philosophy, and the natural and the astral universe. Earlier in their lives, they both had been protégés of Man\"ūr ibn Nū\f al-Sāmānid of Bukhārā. Th ey lived in the same region and moved in the same scholarly circles. Th ey had mutual friends and colleagues such as Abū Sahl ʿIsā ibn Ya\fyā al-Masī\fī al-Jurjānī, the famous Christian physician who collaborated closely with al-Bīrūnī and accompanied Avicenna on his escape from Ma\fmūd’s conquest of the Khwarazmid territories. Th is resulted in the capture of al-Bīrūnī and his eventual recruitment as the astrologer of the Ghaznawī court.290 Th is background demonstrates that Avicenna and al-Bīrūnī were informed about each others’ lives and works. Th eir correspondence (al-Asʾilah wa al-Ajwibah) chronicles the involved and competitive quality of their association. Th is is considered the most important scholarly correspondence of al-Bīrūnī during his lifetime.291 He poses eighteen questions to Avicenna: eight on Aristotle’s al-Samāʾ wa al-ʿĀlam (De Caelo) and eight questions concerning natural sciences.292 Avicenna, considered the Muslim master of Peripatetic philosophy and the foremost authority on Aristotle, responds to these questions and is in turn challenged by al-Bīrūnī. Th eir scholarly interactions were more extensive than these questions and answers and reveal that others in their intellectual milieu participated in the development of Commemoration of Abu’l Rayhan al-Biruni and Jalal al-Din al-Rumi, edited by Peter J.

His assignment to this task sheds light on some of the disputes and disagreements that existed between his master and al-Bīrūnī. Th is background is signifi cant as it demonstrates that al-Bīrūnī was a familiar fi gure in the discourse that involved Avicennan scholarship. Although, al-Asʾilah wa al-Ajwibah is focused on the natural sciences, Aristotle, and the Peripatetic philosophy, the in-depth and involved quality of this exchange is proof that Avicenna and al-Bīrūnī, along with their disciples, were well informed about each other’s research and projects. Accordingly, al-Bīrūnī’s work on India was available to a large scholarly circle, at least among his Iranian colleagues. Th e learned grandfather of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt lived during the time of al-Bīrūnī and Avicenna, who was celebrated as the acclaimed prodigy of Hamadhān. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt himself was an avid reader of Avicenna and undoubtedly knew about the exchanges between him and al-Bīrūnī. Considering ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s intellectual and spiritual curiosity, even if the others were not interested in al-Bīrūnī’s work on Yogasutra and the spiritual practices of India, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt would not have been among them. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt would have known about this work either on the merits of the author or through his relationship with Avicenna. Th at he did not mention al-Bīrūnī or his fi ndings on Indian spirituality in his own writing is for the obvious reason that he was already suspected of being a heretic and any such references would have identifi ed him as a heathen. Th e recent publications of Carl Ernst on the surviving yoga instructional materials in the medieval Muslim world argue that the popular consensus among the Persian-speaking people was that Indian and Persian mystical traditions were closely linked and Persian mystics were inspired by the spiritual traditions of their Indian fellow wayfarers. Ernst calls attention to the surviving Persian manuscript copies of the Treatise on the Human Body (Risāla-i Wujūdiyya), also titled the Treatise on the Nature of Yoga (Risala-i Sarmaya-i Jūg).294 Th e manuscripts were widely circulated in the major languages of 293 Ibid., p. k. Ya\fyā Mahdawī is cited in the introduction to the edited Arabic text, explaining that the surviving information on the correspondence between Avicenna and al-Bīrūnī argues for several contacts between them. 294 Carl Ernst, “Two Versions of a Persian Text on Yoga and Cosmology: Attributed to Shaykh Muʿin al-Din Chishti,” Elixir 2 (2006): 69–76."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen113Islam: Persian, Turkish, and Arabic. Th e large number of these manuscripts indicates the scope of their dissemination throughout the region among the mystical communities of South Asia and the Middle East. Th e manual on hatha yoga, describes the signifi cance of breath control in reaching enlightenment. Th e text traces the movement of the breath into the physical and the spiritual organs of the body and the chakra centers and off ers a defi nition of man as the microcosm. Enlightenment is attained by means of establishing a parallel correspondence between one’s body parts and the constellations and the cosmological order of the universe. Th e yoga instructions are intended to highlight the signifi cance of the breath and the connectedness of the body and the spirit. As Ernst explains, the manuscript identifi es the author as Shaykh Muʾīn al-Dīn Chishtī (d. a.d. 1236) the founder of the Chishtī order. He explains: Why should such a collection of teachings with Indic psycho-physical practices be attributed to Muʿin al-Din Chishti? In one sense, this pseudoepigraphic attribution is an indication of the seriousness with which Indian Sufi s approached the practices of yoga. In other words, these teachings were important enough that they should have been part of the teaching of the greatest Sufi master in Chishti tradition. Th is attribution is paralleled by the phenomenon we see in the circulation of the most important Arabic work on hatha yoga, Th e Pool of Nectar, which in many manuscripts is attributed to the great Andalusian Sufi master Shaykh Muhyi al-Din Ibn ʿArabī (d. 1240). From a strictly historical perspective, neither attribution can really be sustained; but it is striking to see that people felt that this should have been the case.295Muʾīn al-Dīn Chishtī is recorded as the author in these manuscript copies, which were produced in the seventeenth century, long aft er his time.296 Ernst explains that Muʾīn al-Dīn’s hagiographies depict him in intimate settings with his non-Muslim Indian associates; he is shown in “thaumaturgic contests with the yogi Ajaipal.” Th is notwithstanding, Ernst explains that it is unlikely that Muʾīn al-Dīn is the author of this treatise for the obvious reason that authorship was not permissible among the early Chishtīs.297 He concludes that it was the popular culture that determined this attribution. Th e Persian rendition from Hindi of the oral and the written yoga materials, as evidenced in this manuscript, adhered to the consensus that a renowned Muslim mystic 295 Ibid., p. 70. 296 Ibid., p. 69.297 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"chapter three114scholar from India off ered these valuable and esoteric teachings toward enlightenment.298 Th e ultimate goal was to induce an out-of-body or near-death experience through which the consciousness is separated from the body. Th ese exercises faciliated access to the visionary perception of the unseen. Such teachings and exercises would have proved instrumental for ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt who induced in himself the spiritual state that he called mystical death.Mystical Death and the UnseenʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that when mystical death occurs, Doomsday is revealed to the wayfarer. Although the details of this experience are not disclosed, the rest of the Tamhīdāt is devoted to this type of death, and the discussions there revolve around it—in numerous places ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains his mystical knowledge in terms of death and its ensuing opening of the inner sight (infi tā\u0005 ʿayn al-baīra). According to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, the mystic who arrives at this station acquires a kind of inspirational knowledge or knowledge by proximity (al-ʿilm al-ladunnī). ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is referring to an esoteric perception through death whose acquisition involves intimate and personal properties. As personal and intimate as this experience can be, it has been described by other mystics, Muslim and non-Muslim, for centuries. In Islamic mysticism, Najm al-Dīn A\fmad al-Khīwaqī, surnamed Kubrā (d. a.d. 1221), sees death as the shortest and the most eff ective means of acquiring knowledge of the real. He explains that both death and mysticism involve the separation of the soul from the body. Death is the absolute liberation of the soul from the crass dominance of the body, and mysticism its intermittent breaks from it. In fact, mysticism is the art of extracting the light of the soul from the darkness of the natural elements, which Kubrā identifi es as earth, wind, fi re, and water. As the mystic is separated from his body, he is able to perceive 298 Ibid., p. 70. Ernst compares the two Persian manuscripts and concludes that the inconsistencies in these texts testify to the oral quality of the transmission of the yogic material.Th e general impression is of texts that are basically transcriptions of oral teachings given at diff erent times and places by disciples who may have had a more or less sure grasp of the contents."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen115other dimensions of being.299 Like ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, Kubrā argues that the wayfarer can induce death in himself while he is still alive on the material plain of existence. Some of the most captivating passages in the Fawāīʾi\u0005 al-Jamāl wa-Fawāti\u0005 al-Jalāl (Perfumes of Beauty and the Preambles of Majesty) concern this discussion. In one passage, Kubrā describes how he passed through several stations toward the station of ikhlās (intimacy). In this walk, he was confronted with an orb-shaped presence that blocked his passage. Kubrā intuitively perceived that the only way through is by means of death.300 Th is realization was, in eff ect, his assent to pass through the gate of death. He involuntarily proceeded through this veil and at this juncture, experienced death as terror (hayba).301 As he transcended this intense trembling, he arrived at one of the stations of divine mercy. He believed this place to be heaven and the shaykh whom he met there the personifi cation of this heaven. He also saw an assembly of dark-eyed maidens who took him behind the veils into all but one chamber. He saw himself wrapped in his burial shroud, free from the heaviness of the earth, fl oating between the sky and the earth. As he descended to the ground, the maidens sat him on a throne. Th en the shaykh approached him and reminded him that he was on ascension to the thresholds of his Lord. Th is understanding fi lled him with the love of God and the certainty of faith. It is noteworthy that Kubrā provides information on how this death process occurs. He identifi es remembrance (dhikr), seclusion (khalwa), and the shaykh (both the manifest and the hidden), as the primary mediums. Th e aim of remembrance is to become consumed by the words of the Qurʾān to the degree that the heart of the mystic, and not his tongue, would repeat the dhikr on its own accord. Sometimes, the mystic can actually hear his heart chanting the dhikr. According to Kubrā, Qurʾānic verses navigate the wayfarer into his heart and hence to the realm of mystical wisdom. Th e wayfarer steps into seclusion with longing for closer proximity to God. He is resolved on leaving behind vain desires like seeing the fl ashes of the unseen, experiencing colors, or gaining repute among his peers.302 He goes into seclusion as though he is stepping into his own grave without any possibility of coming back. Th ere, he attempts to depart from the world of sense 299 Meier, Die Fawāʾi\u0005, sec. 12–13, pp. 5–6.300 Ibid., sec. 117–18, p. 56. 301 Ibid., sec. 119, pp. 56-57. 302 Ibid., sec. 124, p. 59."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"chapter three116perception by fi rst scrutinizing the depths of his own humanity, by greeting his personal demons, and then averting all the fancy and temptation that distract him from the contemplation of God. His shaykh assists him with this venture, guiding him, and protecting him against the perils and confusions of the path. Th e latter are the creatures and the forces in the unseen that can lead him astray. Needless to say, Satan is the one who orchestrates these assaults and even personally appears to the wayfarer with the intent to bemuse himself and deceive the wayfarer. Th e shaykh knows the path and knows when it is time for the disciple to come out of his seclusion.303 Kubrā explains that the wayfarer observes his own transformations as he is separating from his body. He sees that he is at the bottom of a well and the well is descending fast below him or that he is ascending the well toward its opening. Sometimes he sees himself as a voyager on a sea, sailing past shores with hamlets and villages. Th e darkness of the well and the villages on the shore stand for his carnal spirits and that which he is leaving behind. His pensive gaze at the forlorn dwellings and abodes of his past depict the journeying soul in an air of excitement and nostalgia. Th e soul is set free and yet has his old habitat, the body and the security of forms, in his periphery as he is afl oat in a collapsing vortex. Th ese visions defi ne death as a movement away from the security of the body onto a free fall into the unforeseen. Similar visions are recorded in Suhrawardī’s Qiat al-Ghurba al-Gharbīya (Th e Tale of the Occidental Exile). Suhrawardī’s wayfarer learns that he can ascend the well of his imprisonment when night falls and the senses are dormant either in sleep or in the quiet of vigil and supplication.304 Sometimes, he witnesses fl ashes of light and has visitations by the harbingers from the homeland. All along, Qurʾānic verses illuminate his path and direct him to the next station. Th e Qurʾān, the substance of dhikr, functions as a cord that connects him to God and keeps him abreast with his true aim and destination. Suhrawardī off ers specifi c verses as a roadmap that he has followed in fi nding his way on the path of mystical wisdom. Th ese verses have helped him understand the meaning of the events that have befallen him and have directed him to the next stage. Th e Qurʾānic references attest to the relationship that exists between this text, as an expression of spiritual realities, and the realm of material existence where man can venture to pursue these truths. In this discussion, a signifi cant sūra 303 Ibid., sec. 161–64, pp. 79–81. 304 Suhrawardī, Qiat al-Ghurba al-Gharbīya, sec. 5–8."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen117is al-Naml (Th e Ant), which chronicles Solomn’s knowledge of mystical wisdom including his gift for understanding the language of the animals. In al-Naml, the hoopoe is the link between Solomon and the sun-worshiping heathens whom he delivers to the light of monotheistic faith. In Qiat al-Ghurba al-Gharbīya, the conspicuous hoopoe visits the narrator, just as it visited King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, and delivers a letter from his Father to him.305 Th e letter admonishes him for his amnesia about his origins and invites him to embark on the journey home. Th e journey, in eff ect, is the journey of recalling his true identity and reclaiming it. In order to go back, the hoopoe informs the prisoner that he has to board a ship and set sail on a turbulent sea that proves to be fraught with ventures of self-discovery, death, and elation.306 Th e main theme of Suhrawardī’s visionary treatise is the journey toward a state that the Qurʾān describes as al-\u0007āmma al-kubrā (the Great Event) or al-\u0007awr al-aʿ\u0014am (the Exalted State).

Suhrawardī and Kubrā mention a signifi cant beacon on the path to be a green light that in the Qiat al-Ghurba al-Gharbīya identifi es the shores of the fathomless green sea, and in Kubrā describes a light that issues from the heart. For these authors and for ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, the heart is the shore or the link between the physical and the spiritual. Th e wayfarer who reaches his heart is made aware that death is in reach and his soul is going to embark of knowledge by proximity to God. Fritz Meier, in his comprehensive study of Kubrā, Die Fawāīʾi\u0005 al-\famāl wa-Fawāti\u0005 al-\falāl des Nağm ad-Dīn al-Kubrā, explains that Kubrā considers the paths to God to be innumerable, the most exalted being that of “willful death” (der Weg des “willentlichen Todes”, d. h. des Aufgebens des Eigenwillens im Willen Gottes). Th is is the path of executing the surrender of one’s will to the will of God to the degree of conjuring death upon one’s self.316 Meier explains this subject as follows:317 In Uūl al-ʿAshara, Kubrā remarks that (adopting an apparently wide-spread dictum) the paths to God are as numerous as the breathing of living beings. However, these can be reduced to three main paths. Th e fi rst is through frequent performance of ritual exercises such as prayer, fasting, reading of the Qurʾān, pilgrimage, holy war, etc., which are merely “external actions.” Th e second is through spiritual battle and exercises, that is, the path of asceticism for the purpose of changing the character, purifying the soul, cleansing the heart, and adorning the spirit, which are exclusively “internal actions.” Th e fi rst path almost never leads to the goal, the second only seldom. Th e shortest one is the third one, the path of “wilful death,” i.e., the giving up of the individual will to the will of God. It is based on the fulfi llment of the ten basic conditions: repentance, asceticism, trust in God, modesty, solitude, permanent thinking of God, confession of unity, patience, self-observance, contentment, each of which he discusses individually. 315 Ibid., 11: 43. 316 Meier, Die Fawāʾi\u0005, p. 93. 317 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen119Although one’s own striving is not denied by this, but rather subordinated to the thought of giving up the individual will, it becomes fully clear that Kubrā is indeed ascetic, but beyond that he is a mystic of consciousness; he preaches a special internal attitude, and indeed the giving up of any resistance toward God.Th e mystic places himself in a paradoxical situation: he willfully gives up his own will to the will of God.318 Th is kind of “willing” involves self-transmutation and the surrender of all attachments to the body at the risk of never returning to it. Th e wayfarer who is set on the journey proceeds into the unseen (ghayb) further and further away from the fl esh. According to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, the unseen is the mystery of God and the hidden realm of realities that are in His vicinity (al-ladunnī). Th ese realities are inaccessible to reason and thus unknowable through language and thought. Moreover, the mysteries of the ghayb are hidden from men; God reveals these mysteries to men only as He wishes. Th e Qurʾān, for instance, is a revelation of some of these divine mysteries and an instance of the coming together of these intrinsic illuminations and the external realities.319 In ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt the unseen consists of innumerable worlds. Th e mystic comes in touch with these worlds and experiences their realities through death. Knowledge of the ghayb is the mystery that is known to God and whomever He wishes to enlighten.320 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that knowledge by proximity is revealed to the intimates of God (awliyāʾ) because they are friends of God and enjoy a special proximity to Him. In the Tamhīdāt he defi nes these people among the most select of men.321 Th ey are distinct from the prophets and do not perform miracles, but are in touch with the ghayb and gift ed with the ability to produce 318 Cf.

For ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt the friends of God are in touch with the same mysteries as the prophets. Th e prophets are distinguished from the awliyāʾ by virtue of their mission: to teach and to guide the masses. In fact, the status of the friends of God is so high that the Prophet Mu\fammad describes their position in respect to God as that of his own. It is in this connection that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refers to the Prophet Mu\fammad in order to emphasize the elevated status of the awliyāʾ.322 Th is group is not for an instance devoid of observation and presence. Have you not heard this \u0005adith: “I know people who have the same status with God as I do. Th ey are neither prophets nor martyrs, but the prophets and the martyrs envy them for their place with God. Th ey love each other by God’s spirit.” He said: “Th ey revealed a people to me from my community whose station by God—the most Exalted—is like my station. Th ey are not prophets or martyrs, but the prophets and the martyrs envy their position and station and desire that. Th ey love each other for the sake of God.”Miracles and karāmāt are signs indicating the supra-rational nature of the realities in the ghayb. In his discussion on the special abilities of the friends of God, the eleventh-century Iranian Muslim scholar Abū al-Qāsim al-Qushayrī describes these karāmāt as a testament to the realities of the unseen. Human reason, he further explains, is incapable of understanding these realities.323 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt elaborates this point in diff erent contexts, and most specifi cally in his discussion on knowledge by proximity (al-ʿilm al-ladunnī). He, of course, declares that he himself is endowed with this knowledge and is in touch with the unseen. He asserts with confi dence that whoever wishes to hear unmediated secrets of the divine, should seek them from ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt.324 Moreover, he expresses concern that he is disclosing secrets from the ghayb that he must not reveal. In fact, he ends the Tamhīdāt in the middle of a discussion on the realities of the ghayb because he is told by the Prophet not to disclose any more secrets.325 Th e Qurʾān refers to ghayb and ghayba in thirty–six verses where ghayba is defi ned as the unseen whose mysteries are hidden from men.

Abū al-Qāsim al-Qushayrī, in his treatise on mysticism al-Risāla al-Qushayrīya, explains ghayba as the state when the heart of the mystic is absent from this world and is fi lled with the realities in the unseen.329 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes the unseen and the place of the heart in relation to it through mystical death and the relationship between the “body” and the “soul.” He explains, the soul is neither connected with nor disconnected from the body and from this world.330 In a similar manner, God is neither connected to the world nor disconnected from it, and by analogy this is the case with the unseen. Th e transitional state of the soul and the cosmos allows the fl uctuation between the visible world of matter and the unseen that 326 Qurʾān, 27: 65. 327 Ibid., 7: 188. 328 Ibid., 3: 179. 329 Al-Qushayrī, Al-Risāla al-Qushayrīya, p. 141. 330 Tamhīdāt, sec. 212, pp. 157–58."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"chapter three122only becomes apparent aft er death. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt complements his discussion with the following verse:331Th e Truth is hidden within the soul and the soul within the heart,O you, the hidden within hidden within hidden within the hiddenSuch an obvious mystery with sign and expressionO you, the world within a world within a world within the world.Turning to the Prophet Mu\fammad, he describes the soul of man as a spiritual body.Th e souls are a troop among the troops of God. Th ey are not like the angels; they have heads and hands and feet and they eat food. Have you ever heard that the soul has hands and feet and eats food? If you want to know perfectly, listen to the striver who said: “Indeed in the body of man is a creature among the creatures of God, who has the appearance of man but is not human.” He said: in the body of man there is a creature and a visage like man; it has the appearance of man, but is not human and is not from the world of the frame and humanity; it is from the world of “Praise to God the best Creator.”332Khawāja Banda Nawāz Gīsūdarāz explains that the inner sight is one of the fi ve subtle organs whose locus is the heart. Once the inner sight is opened, the wayfarer would conceive the mystery of the soul. He would see that upon awakening from death, each soul invokes the attributes that the person has cultivated in it. Th e attributes are defi ned as metaphors that are comprehensible to us and to our imagination. For instance, goodness and compassion are expressed as images of beauty, running water, or a garden. Lust and gluttony are manifested as a goat, whereas vile and wickedness show themselves as reptiles. Th is is the reason that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt uses the metaphor of man with his limbs to refer to the soul.333 He means to say that our humanity is not the body and the limbs that we see. Rather, there is another body within us called the soul. Th e soul is among the most beautiful creations of God. Th e soul is from the realm of God.334 It now resides in the body, but it belongs to the other realm.

In mystical death, the soul has left the world of matter but it is not disconnected from the body. Th e un-disconnected soul is the anchor that brings the wayfarer back into the body; it is also the vehicle that takes the wayfarer away from the fl esh. Th e function of the soul as the agent of departure and return justifi es the act of “willfully giving up one’s will” in “death” (as discussed by Najm al-Dīn al-Kubrā). Namely, the decision on the part of the wayfarer to let his soul extend away from his body stands in confl ict with the “thought-less-ness” that relieves the soul from the confi nes of the body. At this juncture, the wayfarer is still grounded in his body since he is willfully unmooring his soul for the journey. Yet this transcendence requires an abandoning of reason and of any thought processes, including “willing,” in order to allow the fl ight of the soul away from the fl esh into the realm of death. In the Tamhīdāt, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes this situation in a morbid depiction of his own body awaiting the return of his soul. Here, on this side, his corpse-like body is the spectre of inquiries and concerns; while on the other side, his otherworldly hosts are hesitant about taking him deeper into the unknown.335Alas, in this heavenly garden I described, this wretch was held for a month—so that people thought me dead. Th en with utter reluctance they sent me to a diff erent station where I stayed for yet more time. In this second stage, a sin was born of me in consequence of which you will some day see, I shall be killed.In the passage above, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes his absence (ghayba) from this world. He says that he was in a garden where he spent a month before he was taken to another station. In the Tamhīdāt, he does not elaborate on this place or the details of his journey. However, it is clear that he is referring to the same place-of-noplace that ʿAbū \u000eāmid Mu\fammad Ghazzālī in his discussion on the unseen also calls the garden.336 Ghazzālī explains that as some of the “prophetic lights” (al-anwār al-nabawīya) appear in the heart of the wayfarer, his physical senses lose their command on his consciousness. At this point, the wayfarer can connect to the supra-rational realities that are conveyed by these lights. By joining the reality beyond the world of matter, he sees what others see only in sleep as they are dreaming. Th e 335 Tamhīdāt, sec. 301, pp. 231–32.336 Abū \u000eāmid Mu\fammad Ghazzālī, Th e Niche of Lights, p. 35."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"chapter three124wayfarer goes past observing these realities in the capacity of a spectator, and becomes a participant in the events that unfold around him. He understands himself and other things through a new perception. He understands that he has crossed over into the unseen through his faith, because it is faith that draws one to a world named “the garden”.337 Th is understanding is reached as the wayfarer begins partaking of the mystery. Th e garden becomes manifest in the relationship between the wayfarer and the unseen in his assertion that it is his faith that has guided him to break away from the world of matter and his own body. In the Tamhīdāt, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s reference to the garden is an allusion to the same concept in Ghazzālī. Notwithstanding the Islamic context of the present discussion, the Tibetan Buddhist monks have testifi ed to experiencing similar “events” during their out-of-body journeys. Th e Tibetans have, for centuries, discussed the subject of the “death journey” in a similar process of identity, vision, and discovery. Th ey have considered this subject within the context of the reincarnation of the soul and have developed sophisticated teachings in this area: the source for these teachings has been the fi ndings made by those monks who have “exercised” death and departed from this world into the other. Th ese voyagers have gone on the death journey and returned with a memory of the unseen.338 Th eir excursions into death are the substance of their teachings, just as ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s insights are a consequence of his death experience. Th e teachings of the Tibetan monks on death are meant to prepare and to empower one to greet death consciously.339 According to these 337 Ibid. 338 Padma Sambhava, Tibetan Book of the Dead, translated by Robert A.F.

Th ese teachings are meant to protect the consciousness against the fear and the anxiety of death and to direct the consciousness toward enlightenment. Preparing for death through the knowledge of the Bardo states helps the consciousness against being traumatized when it faces the lights and the deities of the intermediary realm. On the contrary, entering death prepared for these challenges, helps the consciousness to move in the direction of Buddhahood.

Needless to say, his experience was interrupted with his resuscitation.344 Jung’s interest in the Th e Tibetan Book of the Dead, which had made its fi rst appearance in Europe in the late 1920s, predates his near-death-experience by almost twenty years.345 While many individuals, like Jung, have reported instances of near-death or out-of-body experiences, according to the teachings of Th e Tibetan Book of the Dead, trained voyagers have been able consciously to transcend the 340 Sambhava, Tibetan Book of the Dead, p. xxi.

It is itself a subsection of a larger work called Th e Profound Teaching of Th e Natural Liberation Th rough Contemplating the Mild and the Fierce Buddha Deities.” 341 It was discovered in the fourteenth century by Karma Lingpa. Th e American anthropologist Walter Yeeling Evans-Wentz (1878–1965) learned of this text in the 1920s while he was staying in India. He became the fi rst western scholar to translate Bardo Th ödol into English and introduce it to the West; it was published in London in 1927. Evans-Wentz called this text Th e Tibetan Book of the Dead. 342 Karma-glin-pa, Th e Tibetan Book of the Dead: or, Th e Aft er-Death Experiences on the Bardo Plane, According to Lāma Kazi Dawa-Samdup’s English Rendering, 3rd ed., translated by Walter Yeeling Evans-Wentz (London: Oxford Univeristy Press, 1957), pp. xxxv-lii; henceforth cited as Th e Aft er-Death Experiences.343 Carl G.

During his near-death-experience Jung had realized that his doctor was going to die soon.

Th e Tibetan Book of the Dead is a compilation of teachings and prayers that are based on the accounts of these voyagers who experienced the realms between death and reincarnation (bardo states) consciously and were able to remember their insights. Th e teachings of Th e Tibetan Book of the Dead describe the process of dying and explain how through meditation, prayer, and teaching, the confusion one experiences aft er death can be minimized or avoided. In the bardo state between death and reincarnation, one’s consciousness encounters diff erent kinds of lights and deities, which are its own projection. Th is projection is not subjective, i.e., fantastical, but an expression of the creative power of the consciousness that creates a reality outside itself in which it can become frozen and distracted from liberation. Consider the following prayer:Hey! Now when the reality between dawns upon me,I will let go of the hallucinations of instinctive terror,Enter the recognition of all objects as my mind’s own visions,And understand this as the pattern of perception in the between;Come to this moment, arrived at this most critical cessation,I will not fear my own visions of deities mild and fi erce!346Tibetan teachings on dying and death are instructions and prayers to prepare one for understanding this process. For the Tibetans, these teachings constitute an important part of their lives; they practice these prayers and meditations regularly. A lama reads segments from the Bardo Th ödol to the dying person and continues reciting from the book aft er he or she has died for sometimes up to forty nine days. Tibetans believe that one’s consciousness will be reincarnated at some time during this period. Reciting by the corpse is based on the belief that the subtle consciousness of the deceased may still be lingering by or in his or her body. Th ese prayers and teachings are recited in order to caution his or her consciousness about the perils of the new journey. Th e practice is meant to assist the deceased in recognizing his or her consciousness as a clear light that will appear to him or her. Th e deceased must concentrate on joining this light.Hey! Noble one, you named So-and-so! Now the time has come for you to seek the way. Just as your breath stops, the objective clear light of 346 Sambhava, Th e Tibetan Book of the Dead, p. 132."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen127the fi rst between will dawn as previously described to you by your teacher. Your outer breath stops and you experience reality stark and void like space, your immaculate naked awareness dawning clear and void without horizon or center. At that instant, you yourself must recognize it as yourself, you must stay with that experience. I will describe it again to you at that moment.347Th ese instructions are read over the corpse of the dead person and are addressed to his or her consciousness that has left the body and is observing it, feeling compassion for it. Th e consciousness is encouraged to abandon its attachment to the body, to turn away from it, and to go toward the clear light. Th e consciousness needs to recognize its own basic nature as the clear light and to recognize that the deities it sees in the death-bardo are its own projections. If it does not recognize this light, it will see wrathful deities, who are also its own projections, and it will fall prey to the confusion of the bardo. Consequently, it will become frozen in fear and will choose its next reincarnation unwisely. Th ese prayers help the consciousness of the dead person access higher stages of awareness and to evolve. In accordance with this, Tibetan teachings describe an eschatology of the lights that dawn upon the consciousness in the aft erlife. Th e monks who have faced these lights in the special realms of consciousness have seen them, not all at once, but through a gradual process. Th e unveiling of these lights corresponds to diff erent stages of perception as well as the spiritual maturity of the wayfarer who has experienced them. Hence, the wayfarer sees death as a form of illumination. An interesting comparison can be made with Plato’s discussions that conceive death as a source of knowledge and illumination. Plato’s discussions are based on his own meditations on this subject as well as reports of persons who experienced near-death-journeys.348 In Book Ten of the Republic, Plato refers to Er, the son of Armenius, who was killed in battle but at his funeral on the twelft h day aft er his death came back to life. Er described how his soul departed from his body and journeyed into the other world and saw mysteries of the aft erlife. Th ere, he was bidden to observe and to hearken to all that was passing around him because he was going to be sent back to tell mankind 347 Ibid., p. 122.348 Lee W.

When one of them is set free and able to leave the cave, he is fi rst dazzled by the sun and then astounded by the contrast between what he sees and what he used to conceive as living. Th e emancipated prisoner represents the philosopher who, contemplating beauty, approaches the vision of the “forms.” His fl ight of imagination facilitates his escape from the cave of ignorance. He sees what lies beyond the play of shadows; yet he is suspended between knowledge and ignorance, since he remains a voyager on an incessantly illuminating journey: each and every glimpse of light is a revelation denouncing the vision he had previously held to be true. His position in relation to the sun, his distance from the cave, and his angle of vision are metaphors for his position and perspective in relation to reality and the eff ect his perspective has on that reality. Plato concludes that the prison-house is the visible world of shadows and images, the light of the fi re is the sun, and the journey of the unchained man is the ascent of the soul into the world of the intellect.351 349 Plato, Th e Republic: Th e Complete and Unabridged Jowett Translation, translated by Benjamin Jowett (New York: Vintage Classics, 1991), pp. 388–97; henceforth cited as Plato, Th e Republic. Th e vision of Er, son of Armenius, begins as follows:Well, I said, I will tell you a tale; not one of the tales which Odysseus tells to the hero Alcinous, yet this too is a tale of a hero, Er the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth. He was slain in battle, and ten days aft erwards, when the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state of corruption, his body was found unaff ected by decay, and carried away home to be buried. And on the twelft h day, as he was lying on the funeral pyre, he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the other world. He said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey with a great company, and that they came to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth; they were near together, and over against them were two other epenings in the heaven above. ... 350 Ibid., pp. 253–57. Th e metaphor of the cave begins as follows:And now, I said, let me show in a fi gure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened: —Behold! human beings living in an underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads. Above and behind them a fi re is blazing at a distance, and between the fi re and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the puppets. 351 Ibid., p. 257."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen129 Conceiving death in light imagery is present in world religions. In the examples presented here, however, the understanding of death is associated with the accounts of individuals who related to others their personal fi ndings on this matter. In a similar manner, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes death as the passage into the realm of visionary experience. Th is death is diff erent from death of the body because it is not involuntary. In other words, the mystic who has intentionally and deliberately renounced life as we know it moves toward mystical death. Th e latter signifi es the separation of the consciousness from the body and its joining with the divine consciousness. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains, this is an esoteric state that is incomprehensible to those who have not experienced it.352I realize that these words do not exist in your world of habit. Th e world of habit is that of the [Islamic] law, and abiding by the law is abiding by habitude. Unless you give up habitude and abandon it, you cannot traverse the truth. If you can dare, give in to these verses and see what they say:Alas, that this law is the religion of recklessness Our religion is heresy and zandaqaFaith and faithlessness are the face of that ravishing idolFaith and faithlessness on our path are both unityDeath is separation and life is meeting and rapture. What can be said about the union? Alas “Th ere is no knowing except by seeing”; how can one who is not ensnared by love and by the witness know of this? If you want to know this more clearly, for us death is heresy and life is Islam and unity.Th e wayfarer interacts with the unseen and experiences visions that leave him doubting his religious convictions. He perceives everything to be the expressions of the same reality or the visage of God. Th e personal dimension of mystical death does not reduce these visions to the subjective projection of one’s mind. Th ese visions are a coming together of all of being whence good and evil and fi delity and heresy emerge as one. Th e individual wayfarer perceives this reality in accordance with his or her own capacity for its integration and translation. Rudolf Otto is a modern scholar of religion who speaks of similar conceptions of faith in Das Heilige (Th e Idea of the Holy). Otto’s study considers religion and faith as expressions of coming in 352 Tamhīdāt, sec. 419, pp. 320–21."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"chapter three130contact with the divine. Otto looks at the “feelings” and the “states” of mind that the individual can experience once he sees himself connected with the divine. Otto understands the divine to be an objective reality independent of the individual who experiences a “numinous feeling” toward it. In this context, the word “feeling” conveys a mode of consciousness and awareness of the presence of the divine. Th e latter is a reality that is felt, that is there to be acknowledged. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes his faith as the result of a mode of seeing the mysteries of the ghayb. He describes this kind of seeing as a mode of perceiving a reality that exists independent of one’s consciousness. Th e consciousness of a wayfarer is specifi c to him and defi ned in relation to him. Th erefore, what he sees is neither separate from him nor a fi gment of his imagination. For instance, in the passage above, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refers to the visions he had in the realm of God’s attributes and in his familiar paradoxical diction describes mystical death as a deviation from the givens of religion, toward a new kind of exercising faith. Th e latter fi nds its genesis in the visions the wayfarer has while he is in this special realm of experience. As will be discussed in the following chapter, the visions aft er death involve Mu\fammad and Satan, who are described by ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt as light and diff erent degrees of visibility. It is in this context that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt defi nes the reality of Satan as separation from the beloved, and the reality of Mu\fammad as close proximity to the beloved. Satan, who disobeyed the command of God and was condemned to separation, is associated with the wayfarer who through mystical death is engaged in renouncing his own self in order to accost the beloved. In this context, mystical death conveys a range of relationships with personal and cosmological signifi cations. Another example of the association between the individual and the cosmological realities is the relationship between the Qurʾān and the wayfarer. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt associates mystical death with the Qurʾān by comparing verses from the Qurʾān with stages of visionary discovery through death. He represents the Qurʾān as an articulation of the mysteries of the unseen (ghayb), and describes death as a form of immediate and unmediated comprehension of the Qurʾānic truths. Th e wayfarer who has conjured death upon himself understands these truths just as he understands death. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that mystical death is the fi rst state that the wayfarer experiences as he is approaching the unseen (ghayb). As the wayfarer greets this death, his own Doomsday appears before him. He defi nes the Doomsday as an individual and personal experience and"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"death and visions of the unseen131not a communal cataclysmic event destined to take place at a designated juncture in time. Th e Doomsday is an essential part of the transcendence that the wayfarer undergoes. Moreover, it is individual because it unveils the contents of one’s heart and all that one has invested in it. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt turns to the Qurʾānic sūra, al-ʿĀdiyāt (Th ose Who Run), to explain this point. 353     /     /       Does he not know when that which is in the graves is scattered abroad /And that which is (locked up) in (human) breasts is made manifest / Th at their Lord had been well-acquainted with them, (even to) that Day?Describing his own experience of mystical death, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that at this stage he was shown the prophets and their nations. Th e prophets each had two lights and their nations one, but Mu\fammad was all light and his followers had two lights.354 Mu\fammad is distinguished from others because his light is from the light of God, which is above and beyond light.355 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt further explains that Jesus, also, shared a special affi nity with God, which is why Christians call him “the son of God.” Notwithstanding this, Mu\fammad is “more light” than any of His prophets and the closest to Him. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s attitude toward Mu\fammad and the Qurʾān brings to mind the medieval commentator of the Tamhīdāt, Khawājah Gīsūdarāz, who says ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt saw everything as light and emphasizes that he perceived Mu\fammad and the Qurʾān as light. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt asserts that the wayfarer who is able to experience the mystical death and the unseen resembles the prophets (yushbihūn al-anbiyāʾ).356 Such a man is chosen by God to contemplate the ascension of the heart (miʿrāj-i qalb) because the heart is the mirror in which God beholds Himself and also where the wayfarer partakes of His light. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt turns to the Qurʾān, which says: 357      /   353 Qurʾān, 100: 9–11. 354 Tamhīdāt, sec. 422, pp. 322–23. 355 Ibid., sec. 423, p. 323. 356 Ibid., sec. 70, p. 51. 357 Qurʾān, 104: 6–7."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"chapter three132(It is) the fi re of (the wrath of) Allah kindled (to a blaze) / Th at which doth mount (right) to the hearts.He explains the beginning of mystical death as follows: a fl ame from the fi re of this love (God’s majesty) kindles and its ray reaches the wayfarer. Th e humanity (basharīya) of the wayfarer, that is a challenge to his escape into death, is scourged by the light of this fi re. In this manner, the wayfarer is freed to roam the terrains of death and the mysteries that the Qurʾān alludes to are disclosed to him. Th ese mysteries include the verse, “Every soul shall have a taste of death”358 that in diff erent contexts in the Qurʾān is followed by the promise or the warning of the eventual return of all to God. Th e wayfarer conceives the essence of this promise and thus sets out upon the path of death where he realizes the transient nature of life as he has known it thus far. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt defi nes mystical death as a mode of seeing mysteries with the inner sight. Th e opening of the inner sight—discussed in the following chapter—is a process that is refi ned and vivifi ed as the wayfarer goes through the realms of death. Upon his return to this side, in the world of matter, the wayfarer who has experienced seeing with the inner sight is able to distinguish between the “reality” and the “appear ance.”358 Ibid., 3: 185, 21: 35, 29: 57."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"appearance and reality133CHAPTER FOURAPPEARANCE AND REALITYTh e wayfarer who reaches the station of mystical death comes to see himself in a new light and therefore comports himself in the hue of this light. His perspective, his understanding of himself, and his “walk,” involve an eschatology and a rhetoric that elevate him above the institutions and the authorities that defi ne faith for the community of believers. Th is eschatology and rhetoric correspond to the wayfarer’s stance in his relationship with himself and his manner of asserting his self-identity. According to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, a person who reaches the station of mystical death and experiences mysteries of the unseen is like the prophets inspired by love and ecstasy and can surrender to the will of God.359 Th e fi rst mystery that is unveiled to the wayfarer is the realm of God’s attributes. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt defi nes God’s attributes as the lights of Mu\fammad and Satan. Th e wayfarer who experiences these realities, like the prophets, is among God’s select human beings. Th e following discussion will demonstrate how these themes are elaborated in ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s writing. It will refer to the teachings of A\fmad and Abū \u000eāmid Mu\fammad Ghazzālī as well as other mystics who describe a personal understanding of God through an epistemology and a psychology of lights and the opening of the inner sight. Everything is Light || Light is EverythingIn the state of mystical death the consciousness of the wayfarer is transformed, but he can still recognize this transformed consciousness as his own. Th is is not the case in annihilation (fanāʾ), when the wayfarer is accosting the presence of God. At this stage, his consciousness is replaced with the consciousness of the Divine. Fanāʾ is the state of consciousness that is ascribed to the realm of God’s essence or the realm past the realm of attributes. It is an advanced spiritual state that is not attainable by all who have passed through 359 Tamhīdāt, sec. 69, pp. 50–51."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"chapter four134mystical death. In this state, the consciousness of the wayfarer is transformed to the extent that he conceives himself to be God. Fanāʾ itself has diff erent gradations. For instance, the process of understanding the unity of God (taw\u0005īd), that reaches its zenith through fanāʾ, begins with glimpses of taw\u0005īd while the wayfarer is still observing God’s attributes. Th rough fanāʾ, the wayfarer experiences an identity-shift , and he sees himself as God. In other words, while mystical death and the opening of the inner sight are preliminary stages in the transformation of the consciousness, a most immediate understanding of the unity of God (taw\u0005īd) can occur at the more advanced stage of fanāʾ. In both cases of mawt-i maʿnavī (mystical death) and fanāʾ (annihilation), the transformed consciousness is defi ned as a mode of seeing. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt discusses these points at diff erent places in his writing.360Th en the beginning of unity is revealed to him. Th is distinguishes him from the rest because “Of the people there are some who say: ‘We believe in Allah and the last day.’ But they do not (really) believe.”361 His name is registered among those who “Have the assurance of the hereaft er.”362 Because he is beyond those who “believe in the unseen,”363 he has reached the world of certitude. Certitude is found in observation, and faith is found in absence and separation.Th e wayfarer who arrives at this station is not among those who “believe” in the unseen through the teachings of the Qurʾān or the prophets. His faith is beyond belief as it is commonly understood; his faith is based on his experience of the realities of the unseen. He has obtained his faith in a special realm of consciousness that is indescribable in words. Th e Qurʾānic verses that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is referring to, al-Baqarah (2: 3–8), describe the “believers” as those who are steadfast in religious duties. Th e wayfarer on the death journey is beyond performing ceremonial acts of piety. Moreover, his personal belief in the unseen involves levels of signifi cation that are indefi nable through words or teachings. For instance, the wayfarer sees and understands the unity of God through Him. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes this kind of belief as a state of mind and a realm of consciousness that he calls the “world of certitude” (ʿālam-i yaqīn). Th e wayfarer can reach this stage only if God desires it.360 Ibid., sec. 71, p. 52. 361 Qurʾān, 2: 8. 362 Ibid., 2: 4. 363 Ibid., 2: 3."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"appearance and reality135 Th e unveilings of the unseen occur as diff erent lights become discernible to the wayfarer. He sees these lights in a dualistic relationship.364 Th e dualism in ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s mysticism is seen in his interpretation of the cosmos as the refl ection of the contrasting lights of Mu\fammad and Satan and man’s understanding of the reality and the appearance. Th is dualistic cosmogony justifi es monotheistic faith by juxtaposing the light of Mu\fammad with the dark light of Satan and contrasting the enlightened with the ignorant. In this context, time and space are described as limitless extensions of luminosity in contrast to horror. Man and his destiny are explained against this contrasting background and in relation to these lights. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that the creation itself, as a manifestation of God, has a dual quality. Th e creation has an appearance that is visible to the eye. It also has a reality that is the light of God and can be perceived with the inner sight through mystical death. One who is used to the kind of understanding that is informed by the visible world of matter cannot readily perceive the light of God in the creation. Such a person sees Mu\fammad as the body and the fl esh and Satan as the fallen angel who instigates sin.365 Yet, the reality of Mu\fammad and Satan is their lights that appear alongside each other and illuminate the realm of God’s attributes. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt further explains that God’s essence can neither be named nor qualifi ed but can be expressed as light. In this relationship, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt defi nes God as the all-encompassing, non-comparable light whose emanations manifest diff erent degrees of luminosity. Th ese emanations constitute all of creation and make it visible. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that in Arabic the verb khalaqa (create) has diff erent meanings, such as “to produce” or “to determine”; however, in the context of this discussion it means to “manifest” and to make visible.366 Th e fi nal chapter of the Tamhīdat, “Th e Lights of Mu\fammad and Satan Are the Reality and the Essence of the Earth and the Sky,” elaborates on this point. Th e title of the chapter is from the “Light” verse in the Qurʾān.367 In this chapter, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that God is the source of all other lights that appear in creation, but is distinct 364 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s mysticism fi nds its genesis in a complex dualism that is informed by the teachings of Abū \u000eāmid Mu\fammad and A\fmad Ghazzālī. 365 Tamhīdāt, sec. 217, p. 162. 366 Ibid., sec. 348, p. 265. 367 Qurʾān, 24: 35. “God is the Light of the Heaven and the Earth”"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"chapter four136from them.368 Th e non-comparable light of God escapes defi nition, whereas the other lights can be named, as, for instance, the light of the sun or the stars or the light of fi re. Th ese lights are metaphorical in relation to the reality of the light of God. An example of these metaphorical lights is the light of the day and the dark of the night, which in their contrasting juxtaposition reveal and conceal the light of God. In this relationship, God is predicated as light, while His essence remains undefi nable. Th us, the dualism in ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s epistemology of lights points toward an understanding of God’s unity (taw\u0005īd), which is exposed to the wayfarer in the state of mystical death and is experienced by him through annihilation (fanāʾ). Apperception of the unseen through light is a process of cognition that diff erent Muslim mystics have referred to in their writings and as they have discussed their personal lives. In Shar\u0005-i Sha\u0007\u0005īyyāt (An Exegesis of Ecstatic Sayings), for instance, Rūzbihān Baqlī (a.d. 1128–1209) elaborates on the fi ndings of a large number of mystics who have discussed their experience of the unseen. Notwithstanding the individuality and the distinct quality of this experience among the wayfarers, these mystics are refl ecting on the same beloved as they see Him—a point that A\fmad Ghazzālī in the Sawāni\u0005 alludes to as diff erent shades of the same color.369 At the same time, they are responding to a common intellectual tradition that adheres to an esoteric reading of the \u0005adīth and the Qurʾān. Th is tradition, going back to the time of the Prophet himself, conceived God in light imagery.

Thus alluding to Satan, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt introduces him into the discussion and explains that God is light and all of creation is the emanation of the lights that God has bestowed on Mu\fammad and on Satan.372 In his discussion on the light of God, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refers to Abū \u000eāmid Mu\fammad Ghazzālī and his Mishkāt al-Anwār (Th e Niche of Lights).373 Ghazzālī was a protégé of the famous Saljūq vizir Ni~ām al-Mulk (a.d. 1017-92) and a venerated professor at the Ni~āmiyya school of Baghdād. Aft er a long career of defending reason against esoteric interpretations of Islam, later in his life, he became sceptical of human reason in its providing satisfactory answers on the issue of faith. He now argued that true knowledge of God is revealed in the heart of the believer by God as He desires to call the believer closer. Th e heart refers to the feelings and the intentions of the individual. When his heart is fi lled with subtle spiritual emotions, this light may appear there.374 At that point, his soul perceives the light. Ghazzālī 370 Qurʾān, 24: 35. 371 Ibid., 44: 8, 59: 22–23. 372 I will come back to this topic in the section Th e Opaque Light of Separation, which concerns the teachings of A\fmad Ghazzālī and his infl uence on his disciple, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. 373 Tamhīdāt, p. 68. ʿAfīf ʿUsayrān argues that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was introduced to philosophy through the writings of ʿAbū \u000eāmīd Mu\fammad Ghazzālī. He further explains that a comparative analysis of Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq and the Tamhīdāt, which he composed about ten years later, demonstrates that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s views on the aft er-life and the aff airs of heaven and hell were distinct from those of ʿAbū \u000eāmīd. 374 Ghazzālī’s Mishkāt al-Anwār provides an epistemological and psychological study of the lights that appear in the heart of the wayfarer and inform him of the"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"chapter four138explained, this kind of cognition is beyond words and reason. When Ghazzālī reached a spiritual crisis, he found his way out of this crisis, as he explains, through “a light that God cast into my breast.” Th is experience of the opening of the “heart” and the shining of the light therein rescued him from his crisis. Although Ghazzālī never explained what this light was, he affi rmed the inability of reason to provide a comprehensive knowledge of the truth.375 He now vouched for an unmediated and intrinsic (bā\u0007inī) perception of God as the basis of faith. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt pays homage to Ghazzālī and praises him for aptly describing the light of God as the true light and the agent that makes everything else, including the darkness, visible.376 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that according to Ghazzālī’s defi nition God is the “real” light that brings everything else into being by making it visible.377Alas, \bujat al-Islām378 Abū \u000eāmid Mu\fammad Ghazzālī—may God be pleased with him—describes it so well! He gave an example of this light and said: “Th e light means that by which the things become visible.” Th is means, light is that without which things cannot be seen, and the darkness becomes manifest with light. If this is the meaning of light, then the real light is attributed to God and [the term light] is applied to other lights metaphorically. All the creatures of the world were non-existent and came into being by His light and His might and will. Th erefore, because the being of the sky and the earth is by His might and will, “God is the light of the heaven and the earth”379 is none other than He. Is it ever possible to see a particle in the dark? Nay. The appearance and the unveiling of the particles are contingent on the rising of the sun. If there were no sunrise, the particles could not be seen and would appear non-existent. If there were no sunrise there would be no “God is the light of the heaven and the earth,” nor would the particles ever exist: “When thy Lord drew forth from the children of Adam from their loins.”380unseen. David Buchman, the translator of Th e Niche of Lights, provides an excellent bibliography on this text, pp. 56–57. 375 Ghazzālī’s critique of reason as such is the subject of Th e Incoherence of the Philosphers (Tahāfut al-Falāsifa). 376 Tamhīdāt, sec. 336, pp. 255–56. 377 Ibid. 378 Th is title means the “Proof of Islam” and is applied to the individuals who have produced defi nitive scholarship on the truths of Islam and the Qurʾān. 379 Qurʾān, 24: 35. 380 Ibid., 7: 172."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"appearance and reality139Th is passage from the Tamhīdāt appears in the beginning of the chapter, “God Is the Light of the Heaven and the Earth,” named aft er the fi rst line of the “Light” verse. In this chapter, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt initiates his discussion by appealing to Ghazzālī. In fact, the chapter title is a response to Ghazzālī’s project in Mishkāt al-Anwār (Th e Niche of Light)—his title is also a borrowing from the “Light” verse—that Ghazzālī explains is the interpretation of the Qurʾānic verse “God is the light of the heaven and the earth.” Ghazzālī’s argument is to show that God is the real light in contrast to the rest of the creation, which is the manifestation of that light. In other words, God is the reality and everything else is the appearance. He explains, refl ections of the light of God extend into infi nite degrees of luminosity that are metaphors for the real light. Th e sensory world of matter (al-ʿālam al-\u0005issī) refl ects this light at a lower degree of luminosity. Th is world is visible to everyone while the world of dominion (al-ʿālam al-malakūt) is hidden from many. Th e visible world is a similitude of the other world and the arena for fi nding the way to it.381 Th ese parallel worlds are diff erent spectrums of the light of God and are connected as such.382 Th is is the interpretation of the verse, “God is the Light of the Heaven and the Earth.” As one is approaching the unseen, fl ashes from its lights appear in one’s heart. One’s soul perceives these lights gradually. Th e metaphor of the niche, the lamp, the glass, the olive, and the tree stand for diff erent stages of apprehending these lights.383Th e Light of Mu\u0005ammad and the Opening of the HeartSignifi cance of light among Muslim mystics is not confi ned to the “Light” verse or other light imagery in the Qurʾān. In the \u0005adīth, Mu\fammad is seen as the archetypal Prophet and the prime recipient of the light of God. Mu\fammadan Light (al-nūr al-Mu\u0005ammadī) is considered by some Muslim mystics, like \u000eallāj and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, as a fundamental principle in the act of creation. Th is light, they argue, derives from pre-existence and is an agent in setting the universe in motion.384 Th e manifestation of this light in the life of Mu\fammad, in 381 Abū \u000eāmid Mu\fammad Ghazzālī, Th e Niche of Lights, p. 27. 382 Ibid., pp. 25–26. 383 Al-\u000eallāj, “\u000bāsīn al-Sirāj,” in Kitāb al-\u000bawāsīn, edited by Louis Massignon (Paris: Librairie Paul Geuthner, 1913), pp. 179–80. 384 Louis Massignon, Th e Passion of al-Hallāj: vol. 1, pp. 131–32."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"chapter four140his human form, can be traced to his childhood. It was reported in tradition that when Mu\fammad was a small boy, he had an encounter with Gabriel who made his heart pure in order for him to receive the knowledge of God.385Gabriel on a certain day came to the prophet of God, peace be upon him, while he was playing with the lads, and took him and threw him on the ground and opened [his breast] in order to reveal his heart and took out the heart.

Al-Tustarī’s method of interpreting the Qurʾān is modeled aft er that of the sixth shīʿi imām, Jaʿfar al-\u001fādiq (d. a.d. 765) who canonized the intrinsic (bā\u0007inīyya) interpretation of the Qurʾān.388 Interpreting the Qurʾān and the \u0005adīth in esoteric terms was a formative infl uence on Islamic mysticism.

In his commentary on the Qurʾān, Tafsīr al-Qurʾān, al-Tustarī refers to the “Light” verse, quoted above, explaining that God in His oneness is as light and has manifested Himself in pre-existence in the light of Mu\fammad.389 Al-Tustarī further explains his position by asserting that the Mu\fammadan light comes from the source of unity and oneness itself. In the realm of multiplicities, this light is revealed in the body of Mu\fammad, who is perceived as the congealing of the light in the fl esh, as the harbinger of truth, and as the man who comports himself in that light. Th e affi nity between God and Mu\fammad is intimate and fi erce: their relationship involves not only Mu\fammad’s consciousness but also his fl esh. Th e physicality of their intimacy, the “cutting open” of his breast, removing the “share” of Satan from it, as well as expressions of God’s aff ection for Mu\fammad, are just a few examples. Th e signifi cance of Mu\fammad and the Mu\fammadan light is discussed in detail by al-Tustarī’s disciple, the tenth-century mystic-martyr, al-\u000eallāj. In his Kitāb al-\u000bawāsīn, he describes Mu\fammad as follows:3902) He opened his heart, and elevated his rank, made his command mandatory, and caused his full moon to appear; his full moon rose from the clouds of Yamāma and his sun dawned in the direction of Tihāma, and his lamp shone in the mine of generosity.Bowering argues that al-Tustarī is highly infl uenced by the shīʿī leader. Th e following is Bowering’s discussion on this subject as recorded by Sulamī in \baqāʾiq al-Tafsīr:Tustari’s method of Qurʾanic interpretation apparently follows the precedent set by Gafar As-Sadiq (d. a.d.765), who is also on record with a statement concerning a four point pattern of Qurʾanic exegesis; but actually, in his commentary on the Quran, applies two ways of interpretation, a literal (zahir) and a spiritual (batin) way, and stresses the hidden meaning (batin) of Qurʾanic verses. Gafar As-Sadiq’s pattern can also be understood as a dual two-point pattern: on the one hand composed of ʿibarah, the literal expression of a verse, and isharah, its allegorical allusion, and on the other hand including lataʾif, the mystical subtleties, and haqaʾiq, the spiritual realities. While the pair of ʿibarah and isharah is related to the distinction between common man (ʿawamm) and mystic man (khwass), the lataʾif and haqaʾiq are perceived in analogy with the saints (auliyaʾ) and the prophets (anbiyaʾ).389 Ibid., pp. 149–52.390 Al-\u000eallāj “\u000bāsīn al-Sirāj,” in Kitāb al-\u000bawāsīn, pp. 10–11."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"chapter four1423) He did not inform except through his insight, and he did not command his sunna except by the truth of his conduct; he was present and he caused [others] to become present; he saw and informed; he was guided and determined.4) No one saw him as he truly was except for [ʿAbū Bakr] al-Siddīq, because he was in accordance with him and accompanied him that there might remain no separation between them. 5) Gnostics who knew him described him ignorantly. “And those to whom we brought the book, they know it as they know their own sons. And there is a sect who keeps silent about the truth, although they know it.” 6) Th e lights of prophecy project from his light; and their lights appear out of his light. And in all the lights there is none more luminous, more evident, and more ancient with regard to ancientness, except the Author of Generosity.Th e Prophet Mu\fammad is the manifestation of the truth (al-\u0005aqq) and an expression of God’s ipseity.391 Th erefore, he could say “I am the truth” (ana al-\u0005aqq), but he refrained from saying it because that would had been blasphemy; God is the only one who can proclaim Himself as the truth. Th e truth in Mu\fammad is manifested in his teachings and in his way of life (sunna). In order for the truth to become visible, it has to be seen, understood, and confi rmed (adaqa) by one who accepts it.392 Such a person is, in eff ect, an intimate of God, since he can partake of the Mu\fammadan light. In the passage cited above, ʿAbū Bakr al-\u001fiddīq, who accompanied Mu\fammad in his nocturnal hijrah (migration to Madīna), is named as an example of such an intimate. \u000eallāj’s reference to ʿAbū Bakr is to underscore his spiritual kinship with Mu\fammad and his light. It is in this context that \u000eallāj alludes to their exile and their solitude (ghurba) in the cave of the hijra where they meditated on God in their shared seclusion.393 Th eir intimate recognition of one another as kindred spirits is a trope for the intimacy between Mu\fammad and other prophets. Mu\fammadan light is the source of emanation for the lights of other prophets. Mystics like \u000eallāj, Abū ʿAbdallāh Mu\fammad ibn ʿAlī \u000eakīm Tirmidhī (d. a.d. 936/938), A\fmad Ghazzālī, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, Rūzbihān Baqlī, and Najm al-Dīn Kubrā include saints and 391 Louis Massignon, Th e Passion of al-Hallāj, vol. 1, pp. 131–32. 392 Ibid., pp. 216–18. 393 Ibid., vol. 2, pp. 58–59.

In the Tamhīdāt, he elaborates on this subject in numerous places. In fact, the Tamhīdāt opens with reference to the signifi cance of Mu\fammadan light. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt approaches this topic by diff erentiating between acquired knowledge and knowledge by proximity and thus sets the tone of his discussion:394O dear, I say: have you not heard or seen this verse in the Qurʾān “Indeed there has come to you from God a light and a lucid book”?395 It calls Mu\fammad light, and the Qurʾān, which is the word of God, light and “Follow the light that was sent down with him.”396ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt then makes an analogy between the intrinsic and the extrinsic (\u0014āhirīyya wa bā\u0007inīyya) qualities of knowledge, Qurʾān, and Mu\fammad. Next, he asserts his own stance in relation to the apparent and the hidden aspects of reality. He describes himself as a person of insight and truth (baīrat wa \u0005aqīqat) since he can perceive the reality of Mu\fammad, as light, with his own heart and soul.397 Th is kind of esoteric understanding is akin to the one described by \u000eallāj, in the passage quoted above, when he states: No one saw him as he truly was except for [ʿAbū Bakr] al-Siddīq, because he was in accordance with him and accompanied him that there might remain no separation between them.\u000eallāj is referring to the understanding between ʿAbū Bakr and Mu\fammad on the one hand and between Mu\fammad and God, on the other. Th e relationship between God and Mu\fammad is one of understanding between two likenesses. In this relationship mysteries are revealed to Mu\fammad by “Mystery Itself.”398 Th e medium of unveiling mysteries of the unseen world (ghayb) to Mu\fammad is light. Th ose who can understand the light of Mu\fammad can, in eff ect, understand the fi rst expression of the light of God. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and others who have spoken on this subject have understood Mu\fammad 394 Tamhīdāt, sec. 2, p. 2.395 Qurʾān, 5: 15. 396 Ibid., 7: 157. 397 Tamhīdāt, sec. 2, p. 2. 398 Bowering, Th e Mystical Vision, pp. 150–51."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"chapter four144as light in the visible world of matter.

He refers to his acquired knowledge in terms of the opening of the eye of insight. In Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq under the heading “al-Shurū\u0007 al-Lāzima li-Infi tā\u0005 ʿAyn al-Baīra” (Th e Necessary Condi tions for the Opening of the Eye of Insight) he gives the following explanation:401If you are a seeker, it befi ts you to ponder thoroughly, with an effi cacious gaze, the prerequisites of faith in the unseen that I have imposed upon you.

Th e heart is the locus where this mystery unfolds. Th e mystic who has dared to tear away from the security of conventions and habits and has dared to let his heart be opened to this light, comes to see his self as light. Th is occurrence brings one in touch with the lights that make up his being and the lights that constitute the created world: the lights of Mu\fammad and Satan. Other Muslim mystics have also defi ned the experience of the “opening of the heart” and the “dawning of light” within. Among those, \u000eakīm Tirmidhī describes this experience as a Gestalt in his mystical growth. In the autobiographical prelude to Kitāb Khatm al-Awliyāʾ, Tirmidhī explains how aft er steadfast prayers and supplications, one night as he was returning home from a recitation gathering he was overcome by the sudden opening of his heart.404When a certain amount of the night had passed, I set out for home. Along the way, my heart [suddenly] became open in a manner which I am unable to describe. It was as if something happened in my heart and I became happy and took delight in it. I felt joyful as I walked on, and nothing that I met with caused me fear, not even the dogs that barked at me. I liked their barking because of a pleasure I experienced in my heart ... until the sky with its stars and its moon came down close to the earth. And while this was taking place, I invoked my Lord. I felt as if something was made upright in my heart, and when I experienced this sweetness, my interior twisted itself and contracted, and one part of it was twisted over the other because of the force of the pleasure and it was pressed together. Th is sweetness spread through my loins and 402 Qurʾān, 39: 22. 403 Maktūbāt, vol. 2, Letter 3, pp. 102–3.404 ʿAlī Tirmidhī, Kitāb Khatm al-Awliyāiʾ, edited by ʿUthman I.

It seemed to me that I was close to the location of God’s Th rone (makān al-ʿarsh). And this remained my practice every night until morning. I stayed awake at night and didn’t sleep. Meanwhile, my heart became strong through this. But I was bewildered (muta\u0005ayyir) and didn’t know what this was. None the less, my strength and my zeal increased in whatever I undertook.405In his autobiography, Tirmidhī hesitates to probe this event any further. His refraining may be due to allegations of heresy made against him: a subject he tactfully hints at in the passage immediately following the one quoted above, as he refers to his adversaries and their schemes against him.406 In his mystical works, Sīrat al-Awliyā, and Bayān al-Fārq bayn al-\u0011adr wa al-Qalb wa al-Fuʾād wa al-Lubb, Tirmidhī discusses an elaborate epistemology on the subject of the heart and the light within.407 In the passage below, for instance, he categorizes human beings according to their capacity for understanding God and the illumination of the light of gnosis in their hearts.408Common men’s allotments from amongst God’s attributes consist of their belief in His attributes, whereas the allotments of those traveling a middle road and of the generality of the Friends who are close to God consist of their breasts being laid open by this belief and their attaining the illumination of knowledge of these attributes in their breasts, each one of them according to his capacity and the capacity of the light of his heart. But the allotments of those who hear supernatural speech, they being the chosen few for the Friends of God, consists of [their] beholding these attributes and of the light of these attributes. For this reason he declared [57/3]: “He [God] is the outer and the inner.” And is the outer anything other than what appears unto hearts? For verily, 405 Bernd Radtke and John O’Kane, Th e Concept of Sainthood in Early Islamic Mysticism (Richmond: Curzon Press, 1996), pp. 21–22. 406 Tirmidhī, Sīrāt al-awliyā, edited by Bernd Radtke (Beirut: Franz Steiner Stuttgart, 1992), sec. 8–9, pp. 19–20. 407 Bernd Radtke, Al-Hakim at-Tirmidi: Ein islamischer Th eosoph des 3./9.

Furthermore, there are two other systems, each of which appears in just one of Tirmidhi’s works. In Farq, he describes the heart as a fourfold organ: the most external part is sadr to which are inwardly liked qalb, fuʾād and lubb (the nucleus of the heart) are linked. In his system, consequently, fuʾād lies within and qalb is located outside. Th e spiritual functions of these organs are: islam for sadr (Farq 35, 2), imān ( faith) for qalb (Farq 36, 9), maʿrifa (gnosis) for fuʾād (Farq 38, 4) and taw\u0005id (monotheism) for lubb (Farq 38, 4). 408 Tirmidhī, Sīrāt al-Awliyāʾ, sec. 54, p. 37."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"appearance and reality147God appears in His attributes unto the hearts of His elite Friends. But when the attributes come to an end, the Friend reaches the inner which is not subject to being “known”. Th en the heart at last takes up a settled position. And when he knows there is no attribute beyond this and he fi nds a position there, he knows there is no position beyond this one.409Tirmidhī describes the light of gnosis (nūr al-maʿrifa) as one’s share of faith in pre-eternity, the understanding of God’s attributes, and the potential for approaching the unknown beyond the realm of attributes.410 He explains that God’s gnosis has an intrinsic (bā\u0007inīyya) and an extrinsic (\u0014āhirīyya) quality. Th e intrinsic knowledge of God is unfathomable but the knowledge that is initially attained by the believer is the knowledge of God’s attributes that belongs to the extrinsic manifestations of God. Th is kind of knowledge signals to hidden meanings beyond itself. In a similar manner, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes the appearance of the light in his heart as a turning point in his spiritual growth. He recalls this experience as the beginnings of his real initiation into knowledge by proximity. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refers to this event in the context of his meeting with his mentor, A\fmad Ghazzālī, on his trip to Hamadhān from his hometown Qazwīn.411 A\fmad Ghazzālī determined a new orientation in his life. In Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, he highlights the formative role A\fmad Ghazzālī played in his mystical development. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes meeting his teacher as a divine gift from God. He received mystical teachings from A\fmad, which he followed diligently until his heart was purged from the “blameworthy qualities that are diffi cult, or rather impossible, to be rid of.”412 Th e purifi cation of his heart led to the escape from the confusions that had dominated his soul. Th ese confusions, which had become rooted inside him, were created by studying rational sciences and expecting to fi nd his deliverance through reason. Th erefore, he had become imprisoned in the confi nes of knowledge and reason and incapable of seeing the obscure realities of the unseen. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt considered their meeting a revival that rescued him from the spiritual crisis he was grappling 409 Radtke, Th e Concept of Sainthood in Early Islamic Mysticism, sec. 54, p. 98. 410 Ibid., sec. 54, p. 98. Radtke argues that there are diff erent degrees of experiencing gnosis. Th e intensity of the experience varies among diff erent individuals depending on their success in overcoming the dominance of the carnal soul and their share of the light of God in pre-eternity. 411 Ibn Khurdādbih, Al-Masālik wa al-Mamālik, p. 12.

Th eir meeting facilitated the comprehension of the mystical “event” (wāqiʿa) that he described as the opening of the inner sight and the visions of the unseen. He felt indebted to his mentor and described the experience as follows:413And while I was setting my encampment on the ground and making the camels kneel that they might recuperate from travel and the night journey, lo and behold my eyes of insight started opening, and I do not mean the insight of reason, lest you be seduced by your mind. Th e mind’s eye was opening little by little; and in the midst of this I was occupying myself with fl eeting birds that were almost blocking my way to seeking what lies beyond the rational sciences. I remained in this condition for about a year and I not yet having comprehended the real nature of the event that had befallen me in this year. Until my lord and master, the elder, his eminence, sovereign of the path and the revealer of truth, ʾAb al-Futū\f A\fmad ibn Mu\fammad ibn Mu\fammad ibn al-Ghazzālī, may God rejoice the people of faith by his longevity and reward him on my behalf with the best of rewards—good fortune brought him to Hamadhān which is my place of origin. And in his service, the veil of perplexity was lift ed from the face of this event in less than twenty days. Th us I saw everything clearly. Th en something dawned on me: nothing was allowed to remain of me and my quest except what God desired. And now for years I have had no occupation except seeking to be annihilated in this thing; and God is the source of help in completing what I have turned my face toward.Here, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes the gradual opening of the eye of insight as an event that takes place in a special realm of experience. In this state, he experiences a light that issues from his heart and enables him to accost the consciousness of God. He perceives that the knowledge of God does not resemble the knowledge of the created things. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that prior to his meeting with A\fmad Ghazzālī, he was facing dilemmas resulting from his inability to understand, through reason, the mystical event he had experienced (“And in his service, the veil of perplexity was lift ed from the face of this event in less than twenty days”). Th ere are no other references to the meeting with Ghazzālī in his writings and their correspondence. In the introduction to the Tamhīdāt, ʿAfīf ʿUsayrān tries to explain what might have happened during their meeting by evaluating how ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt uses the term event (wāqiʿa) in his writings.414 ʿUsayrān notes 413 Ibid., p. 7. 414 Tamhīdāt, pp. 52–56. Considering Hamadānī’s diff erent uses of the term “event” (Wāqiʿa), ʿAfīf ʿUsayrān speculates that in the present context, Hamadānī is"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"appearance and reality149that in the Tamhīdāt this word is used in reference to the relationship between the wayfarer and the shaykh, an emotional state, annihilation (fanāʾ), and visions of the unseen (ghayb). It is not clear which one of these meanings could had been ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s intent when he described his meeting with Ghazzāli. However, he does explain that reason had delivered his inquisitive mind to certain thresholds of understanding that had proved insuffi cient and unsatisfactory: his mind failed him in understanding the mystery of the opening of his inner sight. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was bewildered and saw himself as a “restless dweller on murky grounds”; he was unsettled and ready to continue on with a journey that was vague and obscure. Th is state of confusion was produced as a consequence of his attempts to understand and defi ne the opening of the inner sight. He uses the familiar analogy of poetic aptitude to describe his dilemma.415 He compares insight with the aptitude for composing poetry and explains that in the beginning, one does not need to know the technical details of prosody in order to be ale to distinguish between rhymed and unrhymed poetry. In a similar manner, insight does not need to know the distinctions between the visions that are true and those that are illusive and false. Th e mind of the speculative thinker feels the urge to make these distinctions but is restricted by the insuffi ciency of reason. Th roughout this discussion, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is describing an identity shift that aff ects not only his perception of himself but his perception of God and the creation—clearly, the meeting with Ghazzālī was decisive in the initiation of this process. In fact, he declares that it is only aft er the appearance of the light and its perception by the wayfarer that he is able to acquire faith in the pre-eternal attributes.416 He explains that the mind cannot encompass pre-eternal knowledge unless the eye of insight is opened. Th e relation of reason to this eye is like the rays of the sun to the sun. And the shortcomings of the mind in understanding the intelligibles that are the properties of this eye resemble the shortcoming of fancy in understanding the perceptions of reason. “Whoever attains in his interior a necessary assent, in which there is no doubt—that the absolute abundance (akthar al-mu\u0007laq) and the absolute paucity (qalīl al-mu\u0007laq) in regards to the knowledge of God are without any referring to “willful annihilation” or the event that befalls the heart and settles there. 415 Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, sec. 18, p. 28. 416 Ibid., p. 26."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"chapter four150diff erence—then let him be certain that the eye of gnosis has opened up in his inside. He will become the spring that is close to matters that are similar to these instances of wisdom.”417 One will understand such paradoxes because one is close to their source; this is the meaning of knowledge by proximity to God (al-ʿilm al-ladunnī). ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt warns the wayfarer to be cautious against the impurities that can blur his vision. He compares this eye to the earth and says: “Know that the relation of these events to the eye of gnosis is like the relation of the events that befall the earth and annul its capacity to receive the fl owing of the light of the sun.” He is discussing an alternative cognitive process, which before meeting his mentor he was unable to grasp and come to terms with. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that aft er this event he was uncertain about how he could process the visions. He says: “I was occupying myself with fl eeting birds that were almost blocking my way to seeking what lies beyond the rational sciences.” In reverting to the familiar modes of cognition, he was in eff ect becoming his own hurdle in attaining gnosis. Suddenly, A\fmad Ghazzālī appeared in his life and the guiding light of his destiny permeated his heart, fi lling his bosom with the rhythms of an entirely new angst. Th e mystical teachings of Ghazzālī had saved ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt from the intellectual impasse he was in. Th e Opaque Light of SeparationʿA\fmad Ghazzālī unraveled the event that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refers to in the beginning of Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq. He also played a fundamental role in the intellectual life of his young disciple. Ghazzālī’s teachings on love and on Satan had a formative infl uence on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. Inspired by these teachings, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt perceived Satan not as evil but as an obscure light that appears in contrast with Mu\fammad’s luminosity.418 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains that in the realm of God’s attributes there are two lights: the sunlight and the moon light. Th ese two lights come into view juxtaposed against each other. Sunlight is the “shadow” of God, and moonlight the “shadow” of the sun.419 One comes from the day 417 Ibid., sec. 18, p. 28.418 Th is understanding is at odds with the sharīʿa, which perceives Mu\fammad as a member of the Quraysh tribe who was chosen by God as the prophet, and perceives Satan as the embodiment of evil and sin. 419 Tamhīdāt, sec. 333–470, pp. 254–354."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"appearance and reality151and one from the night, but in that realm there is neither day nor night. Th e metaphorical lights of the visible world correspond to the lights of the unseen: the sunlight comes from the Prophet Mu\fammad and the moonlight from Satan. Th e light of Satan, God’s dejected lover, is compared to moonlight that can only come into view if there is a sun in its orbit that makes it visible. Ghazzālī and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt evaluate Satan as a creature of light and as the paradigm lover-in-separation who ponders the inscrutable will of God.420 In spite of his proximity to God, Satan failed to understand His will (irāda) through His command (amr). Th e story of Satan, thus, points to the will of God as the unknowable. His tragedy was his ignorance in his relationship with God. Satan’s plight is to demonstrate that (1) God’s will is unfathomable, and (2) the state of intimacy between God and His lover is fraught with illusion and misunderstanding. Th ese fi ndings convey the quality of the knowledge that can or cannot be reached apropos God (al-ʿilm al-ladunnī). Evaluating Satan as a tragic personality is a familiar theme that others, including al-\u000eallāj (d. 922) and Sanāʾī Ghaznawī (d. 1131), have discussed. Th e following poem by Sanāʾī describes Satan’s predicament in his own lamenting voice.with Him my heart was united in love and friendship;my heart was nest to the Simurgh of love.At my gate stood an army from the hosts of angels;my rank was to be stationed by the Divine Th rone.But upon my path He laid the trap of His wiliness;Adam was the bait in the middle of that trap.He willed to make me the butt of His curse;He eff ected what He willed; clay Adam was but the pretext.I was the teacher of the angels in the heavens;I set my hope in eternity on this Eternal One.I have passed seven hundred thousand years in obedient worship;thousands upon thousands of treasures were amassed from my obe-dience.I had read upon the tablet that someone would be cursed;I was suspicious of everyone; I didn’t suspect myself.Adam was created of clay, and I, from His pure light.420 Satan refused God’s order to prostrate before Adam and was therefore condemned to separation from the beloved (God)."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"chapter four152I cried, “I am incomparable!”—and he was the incomparable.Th e angels said, “You did not bow even once.”How could I have done it, for He had this laid out for me.Come, O soul, and do not depend on your obedient deeds,for this verse is meant to give insight to people of the present.I understood the end to which we had come because of His decree.Th ereupon a hundred fountains fl owed from my two eyes.O you who are wise in the ways of love, I am sinless!For (my) fi nding the way to their (Adam and Eve) side was not without leave.421Satan explains that he was created from God’s pure light; therefore, he did not follow the command of God because he considered himself superior to the clay-made Adam. However, his pride was not the real reason for his downfall: his refusal to prostrate before Adam was beyond his own volition, because he was destined by God to disobey His command (“I had read upon the tablet that someone would be cursed / I was suspicious of everyone; I didn’t suspect myself.”). According to this perspective, Satan was a victim in God’s plan to demonstrate His mystery and to show that His will is incomprehensible by any one but Him. Satan concludes by saying that his fall was planned to teach others about God’s ways. Al-\u000eallāj speaks extensively about Satan. In \u000bāsīn al-Azal wa al-Iltibās, through a theatrical presentation of Satan, he elaborates the impossibility of understanding God’s intents.422 Th e following dialogue between Satan and God is an example of their dramatic altercations. Here, Satan is asserting God’s unity as he insists on his own individuality (fardānīya).423He was damned as he reached individuation and was turned away as he sought singularity. / He [God] told him, “Prostrate!” He said, “[Before] no one but you!” He said, “Even if I cast my condemnation upon you?” He said, “Nothing except that! / I cannot follow anyone else except you. I am a wretched lover.” He said, “You are arrogant.” He said: “If I had [spent only] a moment with you, pride and haughtiness would be fi tting for me; but I am the one who knew you in eternity. I am better than he.”421 Sanāʾī Ghaznawī, Dīwān, in Peter J. Awn, Satan’s Tragedy and Redemption: Iblīs in Sufi Psychology, (Leiden: Brill, 1983), pp. 173–74. 422 Al-\u000eallāj, “Xāsīn al-Azal wa al-Iltibās” in Kitāb al-\u000bawāsīn, pp. 41–56. 423 Ibid., pp. 43–44."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"appearance and reality153Ironically, in sheer ignorance of God’s will (irāda) Satan boasts about his knowledge of God (“I am the one who knew you in eternity. I am better than he.”). Rūzbihān Baqlī’s interpretation of this episode is that al-\u000eallāj is describing how Satan was not possessed of the “understanding of the understanding” (fahm-i fahm) and did not see the pre-eternal oneness of God in the creation.424 Instead, he retreated into himself and saw a distinction between the creature and God. Conse quently, he vouched for the Oneness of God from the perspective of division. Rūzbihān further explains that the other participant in this relationship is Mu\fammad, who is asked by God to look at the proceedings between Satan and Adam. Mu\fammad also refuses God’s command (amr) and does not look at them. Instead, he looks within himself and sees the beloved, and looks into the beloved and sees himself. Mu\fammad also makes a distinction between himself and God, but in his case, the distinction between the lover and the beloved is a union. Mu\fammad fi nds God inside his heart and worships his own heart, whereas Satan looks at Adam and does not see God but sees his own love. Following the tradition that considers Satan as a tragic character, Ghazzālī and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt perceive him as the counterpart for Mu\fammad and see his state of separation or misunderstanding as a condition of knowledge.425 Th ey see separation as a mystical state that can lead the wayfarer to the presence of God, where he can attain the most intimate level of knowledge by proximity (al-ʿilm al-ladunnī). In ʿAynīyah,426 a personal letter to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, Ghazzālī refers to separation and union, the plight of Satan, death, vision and the Doomsday as follows:427424 Baqlī, Shar\u0005-i Sha\u0007\u0005īyyāt, pp. 508–9. 425 Human beings bear the traits of Satan. Th erefore, the knowing mystic deals with this condition of his humanity consciously. Th e proclamation of infi delity, in contrast to following a faith blindly, is a necessary progress in addressing the infl uence of Satan in one’s life. See, Leonard Lewisohn, “In Quest of Annihilation: Imaginalization and Mystical Death in the Tamhīdāt of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt al-Hamadhānī,” pp. 312–16. 426 Jāmī, Nafa\u0005āt al-Uns, sec. 456, p. 475. Jāmī refers to the degree of intimacy between ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his teacher, A\fmad Ghazzālī, explaining that they wrote many letters to each other. Among those, he explains, is ʿAynīyah, cf. A\fmad Ghazzālī, Majmūʿih-yi Āthār-i Fārsī-yi A\u0005mad-i Ghazzālī, 3rd ed; edited by A\fmad Mūjāhid (Tehran: Intishārāt-i Dānishgāh-i Tehran, 1997), pp. 176–214 and 215–48; henceforth cited as Ghazzālī, Majmūʿih-yi Āthār.427 Ghazzālī, Majmūʿih-yi Āthār, p. 193."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"chapter four154For us, the best state of intimacy is when the barrier comes between usYou think to yourself and come out victorious!

He was thus condemned to separation and banned from seeing the beloved. In the ʿAynīyah, Ghazzālī continues the discussion with ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and further explains that mystery and separation can lead the wayfarer to the tremendous and the cataclysmic Doomsday. Ghazzālī describes this by juxtaposing the words of Satan with the Qurʾān.430 He interprets the events of Doomsday as the unfolding of the individual’s heart on the day when mysteries are revealed. Th e plot in his narrative takes the reader to Mu\fammad and all the other wayfarers who look into their own hearts, witness their own Doomsday, and see God. Mu\fammad understood God’s command when He said “Look!”, Mu\fammad diverted his gaze away from Satan as he was refusing the command of God, and instead looked into his own heart. Th erefore, he referred to God as the muqallib al-qulūb (the one who handles the hearts).431 Th e heart of man contains both the satanic and the divine attributes and must be cleansed in order to refl ect the image of love.432 It is in this context that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt recalls the following verse by his teacher A\fmad Ghazzālī:433428 Qurʾān, 81: 17. 429 Ibid., 81: 18. 430 He is citing Al-Takwīr (Th e Folding Up), an early verse that describes the events of the Day of Judgement. 431 Baqlī, Shar\u0005-i Sha\u0007\u0005īyyāt, pp. 509–10. 432 Tamhīdāt, sec. 252, p. 195. 433 Ibid., p. 281. Emphasizing the signifi cance of his relationship with his shaykh and mentor, A\fmad al-Ghazzālī (d. a.h. 520–a.d. 1126), Hamadhānī cites this poem by al-Ghazzālī while interpreting the \u0005adīth “the believer is the mirror of the believer.”"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"appearance and reality155O God, the mirror of your beauty is this heart.Our soul is rose petal and your love like the nightingale.In the beauty of your light I see myself without a selfTh us in this world every one’s intent is he himself.In the writings of A\fmad Ghazzālī and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, the fall of Satan conveys a consciousness that is closely related to the state of the wayfarer on the mystical path.434 In the Sawāni\u0005, Ghazzālī describes the unseen (ghayb) and the dynamics of separation and union through a psychological analysis of love.435 He describes love as a process of transcendence and annihilation whereby the lover/wayfarer perceives the truth (\u0005aqīqa) and the understanding of unity (maʿrifat al-taw\u0005īd) through his altercations with the beloved/God and by means of separation (fi rāq) and union (wiāl). He describes separation as a mode of understanding that inspires the beloved to remain undistracted from seeking aft er \u0005aqīqa. Th e reality of separation and union is grasped when the lover perceives that he himself belongs in the all-encompassing design of love. Th en he comes to realize that his way to himself is through love. Ghazzālī explains this in his allegorical portrayal of annihilation and rebirth of consciousness in relation to the gradual transformation of the self from subject, to knowing subject, and fi nally to knowing, creating subject. According to this doctrine, the most exalted moment of the transmutation of the consciousness occurs in an unanticipated visionary instant, which is not achieved by means of discursive reasoning. Th e instant itself is not time as measured and emitted by the three-fold extensions. Ghazzālī communicates this in reference to love.436Th e secret why love never reveals itself entirely to any one is that it is the bird of pre-eternity; when it has come here, it has come as the voyager of eternity. Here, it does not show its face to young men since not just any abode is worthy of its alighting.

In the complex dynamics that govern the relationship among the lover, the beloved, and love, separation is described as lack of sight or the lover’s inability to see the beloved.435 For Ghazzālī, love is the truth (\u0005aqīqa) and the essence of the One. Th e truth, in this context, is not a fi xed concept outside and above the individual; it is to be found in the heart as the individual comes in touch with himself, his own emotions, and his understanding of love through separation (fi rāq) and union (wiāl).436 A\fmad Ghazzālī, Sawāni\u0005, edited by Helmut Ritter (Tehran: Markaz-e Nashr-e Daneshgahi, 1990), pp. 22–23; henceforth cited as Sawāni\u0005."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"chapter four156the glory of pre-eternity.

To be self-constituted is the rawness of love. On the path, maturity does not come by self; when one is rid of the self then he arrives at the beloved. At this point, he arrives at the beloved through the beloved. Here annihilation becomes the qiblah of permanence. And the person who prevails to the abode of the beloved, yearning like a moth, joins annihilation from the threshold of permanence. This cannot be contained in simple discourse except through symbols. Perhaps the following verses that I composed during my youth, will testify to this meaning:As long as sagacity and the crystal ball are in my hands,Th e highest fi rmament is my inferior.As long as the qiblah of annihilation is the qiblah of my being,Th e most sober creatures of the world are my intoxicated.“Th is is my Lord,” “I am the truth,” and “Praise be to me,” are all hues of this changing color and are far from particular settings.Ghazzālī explains that the lover, motivated by love, pursues the beloved and in this process experiences unity. In this relationship, the lover and the beloved identify with each other to the degree that the extendings of love and the self come into view. Ghazzālī explains that at last the fateful instant of recognition arrives: “Along the path of the journey there is an astounding moment when the lover comes to meet himself.”437 At this juncture, love has brought out into the open all the inhibitions, fears, and breedings, devouring them, gnawing on the 437 Ibid., pp. 73–74."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"appearance and reality157lover from within, leaving him emptied inside, bewildered with the need for a new sense of himself.438 Th ere is a dazzling step in love, whereby the man in love envisions his self, because the transitory self becomes the vehicle of the beloved, since she dwells in the heart, and the self gains her color from the heart. It is here that man turns his face unto himself and is heedless of the world without, to the degree that it could be that [if the beloved arrives he cannot bear her from the terror induced by the self]. If the beloved keeps him occupied from his self he cannot endure that, since this vision of the self contains a peace that removes the heaviness, seeing the beloved adds heaviness and her intrigues overshadow him. If sustenance appears from within, it bears tranquility, but it is more diffi cult to bear the burden of the beloved’s charms.Th is cathartic process unfolds within a more intimate chamber of the heart, wherein the reckless self is being dominated by the beloved, and has become her vehicle. At this stage, Ghazzālī explains that the lover is no longer concerned with the outside: his vision is totally diverted within, where he observes his own self parading before him. Th e intent of this hidden side is to resist the new harmony dawning in the heart and to safeguard the familiar order of aff airs: fi rst, wishing to seduce the lover away from the beloved; and then, falling into a struggle with her, for claiming the heart. Th e person of the lover, it thus appears, so identifi es with this untamed self, considering him so much of himself, that he is unable to bear facing the beloved, the one who is aware of this vision, and who is a participant in this battle. Th ese discoveries, the author reminds us, are not sporadic instances that have occurred to the selected few; they are diff erent shades of the same truth that are experienced by many wayfarers on the mystical path. Striving toward unity, the lover experiences his self, his desires, and the beloved through separation and union.439 In the Sawāni\u0005, the lover and the beloved come together and are separated until they become indistinguishable. In this process of self-identifi cation they escape the confi nes of time.440As long as he is self constituted, the dictates of separation and union, acceptance and denial, contraction and expansion, joy and sorrow, and such meanings, rule over him and he is a captive of time. As long as he 438 Ibid. 439 Within the context of separation and union, the relationship among the lover, the beloved, and love, is simultaneously the vehicle and the path in approaching unity. 440 Sawāni\u0005, pp. 36–37."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"chapter four158is bound by time, depending on the demands of time, his being will be determined by the judgements of time.

Because his way to himself is through and by the other, such dictates do not apply to him. Here, what is the relevance of separation and union? When can acceptance and denial get hold of him? When can contraction and expansion, joy and sorrow, permeate the court of his dominion?

Th is light appears as the wayfarer reaches the station of annihilation in annihilation. Th is is the stage when the wayfarer’s self is purged to the degree that it can receive this black luminosity. Here, the wayfarer perceives the terrible onslaught of God’s grandeur and majesty as the lord of life and death.443 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains this light to be the fi nal threshold before annihilation in God. His mentor, A\fmad Ghazzāli, regards it in the context of temporality and consciousness. Th e lover who has arrived at this station is not bound by time. He sees himself as an eternal being who through this realization can have a more intimate relationship with God. Th is is the underlying concept in the identifi cation between the lover and the beloved and the transcendence past time toward eternity and immortality.441 Najm al-Dīn Rāzī Abū Bakr ʿAbdallāh ibn Mu\fammad ibn Shahāwar Asadī. 442 Najm al-Dīn al-Rāzī, Mirād al-ʿIbād Mīn al-Mabdaʿ ila Maʿād, edited by Mu\fammad Amīn Rīyā\fī (Tehran: Shirkat-i Intisharat-i Millī wa Farhangī, 1986), pp. 308–9; henceforth cited as Rāzī, Mirād al-ʿIbād. 443 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"appearance and reality159 Th e lover steps out of his time in order to join the beloved.

At this stage, the lover still perceives the beloved in terms of time; therefore, separation and union between the lover and the beloved are still defi ned and defi nable in relation to time, be it time temporal or the durationless time.444 At this juncture in the journey, the wayfarer beholds the loft y opaque light of Satan, which Ghazzālī calls the dark light and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt refers to as the moonlight. Th e wayfarer passes through this light as the last barrier before reaching the beloved beyond time and light. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussion on Satan fi nds its genesis in the teachings of A\fmad Ghazzālī. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt sees Satan as the chamberlain of admittance to the presence of God. He guards the domains of the beloved against the wayfarers who have gone past the stage of (lā illāha), the stage of renouncing all gods and idols. Satan drives them away from the beloved by deluding them with false lights and by frightening them, so they cannot reach the stage of asserting the unity of God (illā allāh).445 O dear, I do not know your taste for “lā ilāha illā allāh.” Gather your might to go past “lā illāha” and to reach the reality of “illā allāh”. As you reach “illā allāh” you fi nd protection and become secure.Alas, the progression of the wayfarers is in the circle of “illā allāh.” “Indeed, God created the creatures from darkness.” So, when they reach the circle of “illā allāh”, they enter the circle of God. “Th en He cast on them from His light”; this light begins conversing with him.When discussing the fi nal stages of the journey before union (wiāl), ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt recalls Satan and the creation of Adam, a creature made of the dark matter and the light of God.446 In the stage of lā illāha (there is no god), the wayfarer fi nds himself at the same crossroad as Satan: at the point of misunderstanding God and the boundaries between God and himself, and boasting of his intimacy with God. At this juncture, Satan insisted on his exclusive relationship with God. Th e wayfarer, also, can fall prey to the temptations of self-aggrandizement and become lost in this realm of illusion and 444 Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, p. 79. 445 Tamhīdāt, sec. 101–2, pp. 73–74. 446 Qurʾān, 38: 72."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"chapter four160negation.447 Satan is well acquainted with the domain of lā illāha and can best distract and delay wayfarers in this realm. He is motivated by jealousy and invidiousness toward any one who approaches the beloved. Th e Prophet Mu\fammad explains that Satan was created in order to block the passage of those whom God does not wish to have in His presence: “If God had wanted to grant forgiveness to all mankind, he would not have created Iblis.”448 Any one who can go past Satan, goes past the darkness of his own material existence and identifi es with the light of God that is bestowed on him; such a person deserves to reach the beloved. Satan is in separation from the beloved, yet in close proximity to His presence. His distance from God is defi ned in a most intimate relationship: he is the beloved’s chamberlain.449 Moreover, the light of Satan borders on the light of Mu\fammad, makes it visible, and is the obstacle to reaching this light. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains:450Th at is the light of Satan; they have described this witness by [the simile of] the curl. He is associated with the divine light. Th ey call it darkness but it is light.

Satan is light but we refer to his light as black in order to show the contrast between his light and the light of Mu\fammad. He further explains that Satan is an expression of the power of God. It is with the power of God that Satan keeps the wayfarer from reaching the beloved: “Th en, by Th y power, I will put all in the wrong.”456 Satan disseminates his wrath in the darkness that delineates the light of Mu\fammad, and also obstructs the wayfarer by seducing him or by inducing fear in him. He seduces the wayfarer by means of the false lights that he mistakes for the light of God. And he makes him faint and frightened through fanāʾ (annihilation).457 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains Satan’s trials in diff erent contexts. In the Tamhīdāt he refers to the attractions of Satan in the context of his own out-of-body experience when he witnessed his own sinfulness.458 In another instance he explains the power of Satan in terms of the love that he feels for him.459Alas, have you not ever been in love with God and Mu\fammad, and in this midst been tempted by Satan for whose sake you wrote these verses?!We are wrung in the twist of your curl,We are wanderers in the wrath of your teasing eyes.We are bloodthirsty by impurity of [our]nature.We are, now, grieving by nature.If there is a remedy to this pain, it is He. How do you know if this can fi nd a cure or not? Whoever is made faint and is killed in the world of Satan, he is given cure in the world of Mu\fammad, because heresy has the quality of fanāʾ (annihilation) and belief has the mark of baqāʾ (sustenance). Unless there is annihilation there won’t be sustenance.

At this stage in the journey, Satan intimidates him and induces fear (khawf) in him in order to keep him away from the realm of baqāʾ (sustenance). Th at realm is permeated with the light of Mu\fammad. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt compares fanāʾ to death and declares it as a necessary stage before attaining life or baqāʾ. Moreover, he explains that fanāʾ and baqāʾ are not fi xed concepts but have diff erent levels of intensity that the wayfarer experiences during his journeys. In summary, the lights of Mu\fammad and Satan are expressions of God’s attributes of wrath and mercy. Th ese lights complement each other and justify the creation in terms of separation and union. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt observed these lights through the opening of his inner sight. In the Tamhīdāt we read that God has bestowed on the heart of men a light whose appearance can lead to the opening of his inner sight.460 Th is state is defi ned by visions of the lights of Mu\fammad and Satan, which the wayfarer experiences through diff erent stages of separation and union. Th e wayfarer who experiences fanāʾ and baqāʾ is still engaged with the realm of attributes. He understands the reality of fanāʾ and baqāʾ at the stage past the light of Mu\fammad. Th at is the stage where the wayfarer comes closer to the presence of God. Th ere, annihilation is fi nding sustenance in God. To die like this is to encounter one’s identity by experiencing the lights within and by having visions of the unseen (ghayb). Mystical death is the initiation of a stage that leads to visions of the day of judgement and goes beyond that to where light and seeing are no longer a modality in understanding. Th rough mystical death the wayfarer comes to see the mysteries of the unseen as well as himself in light of His attributes. But later, he experiences annihilation in God and unity with His essence. Th is understanding is inseparable from the mystical experience of death on the one hand, and mysticism as an activity of the heart on the other. Th e association among the opening of the heart, light, seeing, death, and beyond light, is established in a special realm of consciousness where one’s identity is as singularly defi ned as one’s death.460 Ibid., sec. 272, pp. 212–13."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"the legacy of $ayn al-qud.t163CHAPTER FIVETHE LEGACY OF ʿAYN ALQU*ĀTTh e fi rst modern scholars who took note of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt lived, just as he had, at a critical juncture in history. Th eir epoch was scorched by catastrophic world wars and the rise of Fascism among the most sophisticated European nations, Italy and Germany. Evil was rampant and the promise of rationality seemed to have been a deception. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and the others in his milieu, made sense to the Franco-Arab intellectuals who were searching for spiritual certainty among the ruins of their collapsing civilization. At the turn of the twentieth-century, two major European scholars, Louis Massignon and Henry Corbin, opened the fi eld of Islamic studies to the West. Th ey joined their Indo-Iranian colleagues to advance a complex project aimed at retrieving and canonizing the mystical heritage of Islam. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and A\fmad Ghazzālī were especially important in this project because they were among the fi rst Iranian authors of mystical prose literature who produced works in Persian. Th ey were original thinkers who dared to write about a God who could be loved and could in fact be known in the sensual intimacies among humans. Th ey wrote about a God who could be seen in the beautiful face of young men. And, similar to \u000eallāj, they propagated a stark view of Satan as an angel, be it a fallen one. For them, Satan was a possessive lover who still held a special relationship with the beloved. He was the intimate chamberlain of the beloved and was allotted the task of baring others from approaching His presence. Th e God that these mystics described, was not a tyrant who sat in judgement over the souls of the dead on the day of judgement. Th e day of judgement was at hand; death was a quotidian visionary reality, as mundane as the living; and God was a merciful and benevolent presence who was as close to man as the throbbing of his jugular vein. Th ese ideas were appealing to the hybrid European Islamists of the Massignon era whose research was focused on themes that stood in sharp contrast to the conventional Euro-centric reception of Islam up to that point. Jean Mohammed ben Abd el-Jalil (1904-79), a Franco-Moroccan Muslim convert to Catholicism, and ʿAff īf ʿUsayrān (1919-88), a"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"chapter five164Lebanese shīʿi who also converted to Catholicism, were the fi rst in their generation to make signifi cant contributions to the scholarship on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. ʿUsayrān completed his dissertation in philosophy and Persian literature at the University of Tehran. Th e dissertation consisted of the edited manuscripts of the Tamhīdāt and his critical introduction to the text. In the acknowledgments, ʿUsayrān paid homage to his Iranian mentors, Dhabī\f Allāh \u001fafā and Mu\fammad Muʿīn, and also Henry Corbin, specifi cally, for teaching him how to read and edit manuscripts. Abd el-Jalil in the 1930s edited and published Shakwā al-Gharīb ʿan al-Aw\u0007ān ilā ʿUlamāʾ al-Buldān (Th e Complaint of a Stranger Exiled from Home to the Scholars of the Lands). He also provided a French translation of the text. He soon turned his attention to other aspects of Islam whereas ʿUsayran dedicated most of his life to retrieving and editing the unpublished manuscripts of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. He and his Iranian colleague, ʿAlīnaqī Munzavī, established the fulcrum upon which further study of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was built. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was a logical choice for these scholars considering that Massignon had selected the martyred \u000eallāj as the subject of his magnum opus, and Henry Corbin had dedicated a signifi cant part of his work to another martyr, Suhrawardī al-Maqtūl. All three had been executed for the crime of pushing the boundaries of knowledge and rational thought far beyond the sanctifi ed limits of the sharīʿa. Th e reception of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt in his own time, is a more complex matter. His horrifi c execution was meant to be a hunting spectacle for others to learn from. Aft er he was gone, no one dared to openly associate with his name and memory. Unlike the oft en discussed \u000eallāj who lived and died in a diff erent epoch, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was a contemporary and his case was too sensitive to be brought up in the writing of his time. He was readily identifi ed as a brilliant but reckless thinker who vexed the state authorities and brought destruction upon himself and some of his friends. Another reason for his oblivion was that he died young and did not enjoy the renown of his older colleagues who were deemed more signifi cant and were discussed at length in the medieval canons. Moreover, his complex writing style was diffi cult to understand. For these reasons he did not receive suffi cient attention in the mystical literature of the medieval period except marginally and oft en parenthetically as the student of A\fmad Ghazzālī. For example, Shar\u0005-i Sha\u0007\u0005īyyāt, the encyclopedic compilation of Rūzbihān Baqlī on Islamic mysticism, did not include ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt even though the"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"the legacy of $ayn al-qud.t165visionary inspirations of the author embodied ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s discussions on the divine attributes of beauty and majesty. Nor did Najm al-Dīn Kubrā and Suhrawardī mention ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, although their elaborate discussion of light and color photism was closely related to the mystical project of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. Th eir work off ers examples of how some of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s arguments appeared in the doctrinal writings of his successors without any explicit mention of his name. Najm al-Dīn Rāzī (a.d. 1177–1256), more than a hundred years later, called attention to the teachings that were identifi ed with A\fmad Ghazzālī and his student ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt received exclusive attention only in the writings of two medieval authors. As discussed in the fi rst chapter, the historian of the Saljūq era, ʿImād al-Dīn al-I\"fahānī (a.d. 1125–1201) remembered ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt in a succinct but expressive description in his Kharīdat al-Qar wa Jarīdat al-ʿAr fī Dhikr Fu\talāʾAhl Fārs (Th e Unbored Pearl of the Palace and Account-Book of the Age: An Account of the Eminent Men of Persia). He knew of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt all his life because ʿImād al-Dīn’s infl uential uncles were his intimate friends. In fact, his uncle ʿAzīz al-Dīn who was an important minister and chancellor in the Saljūq court was expelled from his high administrative position and subsequently imprisoned and executed during the same time as ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. Th ese events had a detrimental eff ect on ʿImād al-Dīn’s entire family who were stripped of their noble status and sent into exile. Consequently, when ʿImād al-Dīn grew to be a historian, he included his uncle and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt in his chronicle of the Saljūqs. Another scholar of the Saljūq era, Najm al-Dīn Rāzī made references to A\fmad Ghazzālī and his student’s mystical doctrines. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was not the focus of anyone’s writings until the fourteenth century when the revered Indian Chishtī mystic scholar Sayyid Mu\fammad al-\u000eussaynī Abū al-Fat\f \u001fadr al-Dīn Walī Akbar \u001fādiq (a.d. 1321–1422), known as Khawājah Banda Nawāz Gīsūdarāz provided a comprehensive commentary on the Tamhīdāt.

His most important scholarly project Mirād al-ʿIbād min al-Mabdaʾ il al-Maʿād (Th e Path of God’s Bondsmen from Origin to Return) was an overview of the mystical heritage that concerned these authors. Rāzī discussed the teachings of important mystics, and in this manner, described his own teachings on the origin of the soul, the existence of humankind, and the meaning of death. Rāzī is known to have had very few disciples, perhaps because he did not stay in one place for long or because his complex personality made it diffi cult for others to work with him. Nonetheless, his lucid prose style won him the title dāya for through his writing he had fostered numerous disciples. Rāzī is lauded for his mastery of Persian and his authorial ability to eff ectively communicate mystical meanings, which were oft en vague and obscure in the turgid prose of others. Rāzī left his hometown Rayy, west of Khurāsān, for Khawārazm in his early twenties.

Th e second chapter entitled Concerning the Reason for Writing the Book, Particularly in Persian justifi es Rāzī’s choice of Persian as follows:God Almighty said: “We have sent no messenger save with the tongue of his people that he might make all clear to them.” Th e Prophet, upon whom be peace, said: “Address people in accordance with their degree of intelligence.”Know that although many books have been written concerning the Path, both detailed and concise, and in them many matters and truths set forth, most of them are in Arabic, and they benefi t men of Persian tongue but little.’Tis of the ancient grief one must tell the new beloved,And in her tongue that one must make address.To say lā tafʿal and efʿal is of little use;If thou art with Persians, ‘tis kon and makon thou must say.466Rāzī honored his Persian heritage, especially at a time when his homeland was being plundered and devastated. He took it upon himself to protect the cultural life of this heritage and the intellectual vitality of the Persian-speaking world. Th ese are the reasons that he identifi ed for writing in Persian. Moreover, Rāzī was fulfi lling his own scholarly destiny as he chose to work in the authorial tradition that was established and advanced by Khawāja ʿAbd Allāh al-An\"ārī al-Harawī (a.d. 1005–89), A\fmad Ghazzālī, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, Rūzbihān 465 Ibid., p. 30. 466 Najm al-Dīn Rāzī, Th e Path of God’s Bondsmen from Origin to Return, translated by Hamid Algar (New York: Caravan Books, 1982), p. 38; henceforth cited as Rāzī, Th e Path of God’s Bondsmen."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"chapter five168al-Baqlī, and Shihāb al-Dīn al-Suhrawardī. Th eir avant la lettre work on Persian mystical prose—which, in contrast to mystical poetry, was still dominated by Arabic, the lingua franca of the Islamic civilization—was a much needed contribution. Rāzī was exercising his craft following in the footsteps of authors who were hailed for their command of the Persian language as a literary medium. He joined their ranks for the eloquence and the rhetorical quality of his prose and the subtlety of his discussions. Rāzī refers to the teachings of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and A\fmad Ghazzālī at several places in his writing. He appeals to their ideas and some of their poetry such as the famous couplet of Ghazzālī that is one of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s favorites: “My head is so full of your love / that I fool myself that you are in love with me / either the canopies of your union will be raised in my mind / or my head will be raised on the gallows because of your love.”467 An important example of their refl ection in Rāzī’s work is the discussion on Satan and his black light. Rāzī attests to their interpretation of the black light to be the beacon that foreshadows the approach of the station of annihilation in annihilation. To behold this light is the testament to ones progress on the path of self identifi cation with God. Th e black light of Satan is the manifestation of the wrath and the majesty of God. Th is is the light that burns the wayfarer in annihilation. Rāzī explains that the faculty of reason is incapable of understanding this light because it cannot understand the union of opposites, by which he means the juxtaposition of this light against the munifi cence of the illuminating light of God’s beauty.468 Satan makes himself known in the dawning of this light when the soul is strong enough to endure greater intimacy with God.469 In other words, the appearance of Satan is the measure of that intimacy. It is also the expression of the meaning of the unity of God: “Th ere is no god, but God, “ which begins with a negation and is followed by an assent. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt explains this light to be the fi nal threshold before annihilation in God and the state of self identifi cation with Him. And Ghazzālī explains it in terms of the dissolution of time in eternity. Rāzī invokes these arguments when he says:As for the attributes of splendor, when they manifest, in the station of the eff acement of eff acement, the imperiousness of the awe of divinity 467 Rāzī, Mirād al-ʿIbād, p. 50. 468 Ibid., pp. 307–8. 469 Ibid., pp. 308–9."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"the legacy of $ayn al-qud.t169and the severity of the majesty of eternity, a black light is witnessed that dispenses man from all need of other than God, causes him to abide in God, and gives life and death. For with the appearance of this light the supreme talisman is broken and all vague images are dispersed. Shaikh A\fmad Gazālī, upon him be God’s mercy, says in this connection:We saw the world’s origin and its inner aspect,And passed with ease beyond all sickness and disgrace.Know that black light to be higher than the point of “no”; Beyond that too we passed; neither this nor that remained.Th e Prophet, upon whom be peace, when he prayed in supplication, saying, “Show us things as they truly are,” was seeking the manifestation of the lights of the attributes of favor and wrath. For all that has existence in the two worlds has it either from the ray of the lights of the attributes of His favor, or from this, nothing has real existence, or subsists through its own essence. For real existence belongs only to God, Who ceases not nor has ceased. Th us He said: “He is the fi rst and the last, the outward and the inward.”470In an endnote to the original Persian of the passage, Mu\fammad Amīn Rīyā\fī, the editor of the Persian manuscript, argues that Rāzī had mistakenly attributed the above couplet to A\fmad Ghazzāīī because he had not seen the Tamhīdāt where ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt cites the same poem in two places and in both instances identifi es the poet to be the famous mystic, Abū al-\u000easan al-Bustī.471 Th e editor’s comment seems to overlook Rāzī’s subtle economy of words as in these lines he invokes the whole Khurāsān mystical tradition that was represented by Abū ʿAlī al-Fa\u0002l Fārmadhī (d. 1083/477), his student Abū al-\u000easan al-Bustī, and Ghazzālī and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. Th e couplet by Bustī appears in Ghazzālī’s Sawāni\u0005, and is aptly associated with the writing of the latter as a representative fi gure of this mystical tradition.472 Th e reference by Rāzī points to the whole tradition. Contrary to Rīyā\fī’s argument, it is not an indicator of Rāzī’s lack of exposure to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s most famous work the Tamhīdāt. Rāzī stayed in Hamadhān for a year, hoping that he would be able to return to his hometown, Rayy. He was an erudite scholar who sought knowledge wherever he found himself, even in fl ight and in self-imposed exile. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, and especially his Tamhīdāt, could not skip Rāzī as is evident in his 470 Rāzī, Th e Path of God’s Bondsmen, pp. 302–3. 471 Ibid., pp. 630–31.

Another important reference to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt appears in the discussion of the tranquil soul (nafs-i mu\u0007maʿina), which is the soul of the prophets and the friends of God.473 Rāzī begins the chapter by making his stance clear and identifying the sharīʿa as his chosen path.Know in truth that from the station of the commanding soul it is possible to advance to the station of the tranquil soul only through the eff ect of the rapturous states bestowed by God and the elixir of the Law. Th us God said: “Verily the soul commands unto evil, except my Lord be merciful.”In the beginning, every soul has the attribute of commandingness, even if it be the soul of a prophet or saint, until trained by the Law it reaches the station of tranquility, which is the utmost that the human essence is able to attain, and thus becomes fi t to hear the summons, “return!”474He then advances his argument in a tone and diction that gradually resonates with that of the work Lawāyi\u0005, which is concerned with the dichotomy between love and reason. Th is text is mistakenly attributed to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt because its author, most probably the Chishtī shaykh Qā\u0002ī \u000eamīd al-Dīn Nāgawrī (d. a.d. 1244), aspired to the teachings of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and A\fmad Ghazzālī and patterned his work aft er the Sawāni\u0005. Th is infl uence is expressed in how the work by Rāzī and the author of the Lawāyi\u0005 highlight similar tropes. Th e Lawāyi\u0005 concerns itself with the soul and how it fares in the world. Rāzī uses the image of the fi re of love, the moth / bird and the hunter, to describe the transcendence of the tranquil soul. Th e bird fl ies toward the fi re of God’s majesty acting as both the hunter and the prey. He is the alert and the infatigable hunter who is set on capturing the beloved by overcoming himself. Th e celestial archangels Gabriel and Michael, and the angelic hosts doubt that the feeble soul of mankind can surpass them in approaching God for “when in their hunting they came upon the attributes of the beauty and splendor of Eternal Besoughtness [amadīyat], they drew in their wings and pinions and abandoned prey and the hunt.”475 But, the soul is driven with his love/hunt, and fl ies with the wings of desire that God has bestowed upon him. Despite the mockery and doubt that is directed against him through the 473 Rāzī, Th e Path of God’s Bondsmen, pp. 359–75. 474 Ibid., p. 359. 475 Ibid., p. 371."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"the legacy of $ayn al-qud.t171journey, he arrives at the destination in a place-of-no-place.

Th e latter consists of a dimensionless space where he is the seeker and the sought, the hunter and the prey, the lover and the beloved. Th e fl ight consists of these realizations.

Th e wayfarer understands this to be the purpose of the creation so that God, the hidden treasure, can manifest Himself. Moreover, he understands that the lover cannot be blamed of fault and reproach because he is in love and cannot be questioned about his reckless and dangerous actions such as rushing toward the fl ame of annihilation.478 Rāzī brings this chapter to closure with the powerful remark that so far he has been describing the group of people who “have died a true death before the occurrence of material death.”479 Consequently, God has granted them resurrection and a special place in His presence not only on the day of return but also in this world because their soul has transcended the material world of ap pear ances.480 Rāzī’s indebtedness to these visionary mystics did not prevent him from attacking them for sympathizing with the philosophers and for 476 Ibid., p. 374.

Rāzī was antagonistic toward those who were responsible for corrupting the religion by taking individual initiative for understanding the mysteries that were revealed to the Prophet by God. Th ey engaged in learning concerning God and spoke about His knowledge, but did not follow the path of faith, which Rāzī defi ned to be the pillars of Islam. Th eir pursuit of knowledge, Rāzī maintained, was limited to serving themselves and their own ego. Th erefore, Rāzī considered it legitimate that they should be executed. Th e category that he referred to included a wide range from Khayyām of Nishābūr (a.d. 1048–1131), to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and Suhrawardī, whose ideas were not in line with the teachings of the sharīʿa.482 He expressed regret that the time of those rulers and religious leaders who protected Islam from harm by such people was past. Moreover, he interpreted the Mongol and the Tatar catastrophe to be a sign from God showing His wrath against the decadence and self-indulgence that defi ned his era. He explained:Concern for religion is not laying hold of the skirt of any monarch’s soul, so that he might attempt to repulse the disaster and repair the damage it has caused. It is in roughly the last twenty years that this disaster has appeared and gained strength, for in previous ages none of this group had the temerity to divulge his opinions. Th ey all concealed their unbelief, for there were God-fearing leaders in the sphere of religion, as well as pious monarchs who guarded religion against such pollution. In this age only a few God-fearing leaders have survived to care for religion and respectfully call the attention of kings to the damage caused by unbelief, so that they might undertake its repair. It is therefore to be feared as a matter of course that the empty chatter concerning religion which is still heard 481 Not any specifi c disciple was identifi ed with him, probably because he did not stay in one place for a long time or because his complex personality prevented students from working with him. 482 Rāzī, Mirād al-ʿIbād, p. 30."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"the legacy of $ayn al-qud.t173from some mouths will disappear, and the whole world will be submerged in the chatter of unbelief.483Rāzī’s confl ictual attitude toward these visionary mystics makes his writing intriguing. His complex approach to these thinkers can be summarized in terms of (1) his inclination toward these authors and admiration for them (2) his antagonism toward the same philosophers and mystics who nonetheless inspired him, and (3) his adherence to traditional Islam. Rāzī vouched for ascetic piety as he was, ironically, drawn to the ecstatic mysticism of Man\"ūr ibn \u000eallāj and those who followed in his walk, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and A\fmad Ghazzālī. In fact, a most captivating instance in Mirād al-ʿIbād is when Rāzī remembers the execution of \u000eallāj and begins addressing him as his confi dent. In a dramatic scene, he praises \u000eallāj for his reckless love of God and relates his martyrdom in the imagery of fi re and annihilation. He describes the execution like an eyewitness who was present at the proceeding. Th e striking quality of Rāzī’s description lies in his trust in his reader as his companion at the scene of the execution. By implication, he is recapturing the mystical meaning of \u000eallāj’s execution for the reader who is transported to the scene as the spectator of a momentous instance in the history of Islamic mysticism.484 Rāzī was one of the several Persian mystics of the medieval era who were studied by the early Chishtīs. Th e fourteenth-century historiographer *iyāʾ al-Dīn Baranī (d. a.d. 1357)485 records that Mirād al-ʿIbād was a popular treatises in Delhi.486 Th is was the hometown of Na\"īr al-Dīn Ma\fmūd Chirāgh Dihlī (d. a.d. 1356), and his disciple Gīsūdarāz who referred to Rāzī in his work but did not subscribe to his religious zeal for the sharīʿa. Gīsūdarāz, similar to other early Chishtīs, was inclined toward mystics like ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt whose Tamhīdāt was the subject of his famous commentary. 483 Rāzī, Th e Path of God’s Bondsmen, pp. 382–83. 484 Rāzī, Mirād al-ʿIbād, pp. 336–37. 485 Baranī’s Tārīkh Fīrūzshāhī was dedicated to Fīrūzshāh Tughluq.

Upon his teacher’s request that he should spread the teachings of the faith, Khawāja Abū Is\fāq moved eastward toward Khurāsān and settled in Chisht, near Herat in today’s Afghanistan.487 His teachings were brought to India by Khawāja Muʿīn al-Dīn Mu\fammad \u000easan Sijzī Chishtī (a.d. 1142–1236), known as Gharībnawāz (supporter of the poor), who was born in Sistān (Sijistān) and died in Ajmīr where he established a following among the local Indians. He is an iconic authority in the Chishtī tradition and an advocate for the teachings of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and A\fmad Ghazzālī. His treatise Ganj al-Asrār (Th e Treasure of Secrets) refers to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and A\fmad Ghazzālī extensively.

Muʿīn al-Dīn was in contact with Shihāb al-Dīn Abū \u000eaf\" ʿUmar al-Suhrawardī (a.d. 1145–1234)—a follower of A\fmad Ghazzālī and the author of ʿAwārīf al-Maʿārif (Th e Givens of Knowledge)—and subscribed to the teachings of this Persian mystic/scholar.

Th e other means for the infl ux of these texts into India were travel, commerce, and contact between the Persian and the Chishtī scholars and their disciples. In the fourteenth-century, when Gīsūdarāz lived, the 487 Chisht-i Sharīf is a small village about 110 miles east of Herat, Afghanistan.488 Rāzī, Mirād al-ʿIbād, pp. 22–23."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"the legacy of $ayn al-qud.t175writings of Iranian mystics constituted an established part of the curriculum that the Chishtīs used in training their disciples.

Th is tradition of scholarly wayfaring reached an apex in the extraordinary work of Khawāja Banda Nawāz Gīsūdarāz. He was a visionary mystic, learned scholar, religious leader, and a follower of the sharīʿa.489 In his work, he provided extensive commentaries on Abū Xālib al-Makkī (d. a.d.996), Abū Bakr Mu\fammad ibn Is\fāq al-Kalābādhī (d. a.d. 990–94), Abū al-Qāsim al-Qushayrī (d. a.d. 1072), Al-Hujwīrī (d. a.d. 1072), Mu\fammad Ghazzālī, A\fmad Ghazālī, and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt.

Gīsūdarāz was a sunnī follower of the \u000eanafī school but his forefathers were shīʿis from Khurāsān known as Sayyid \u000eussaynī. Th e name means descendents from the house of the Prophet through his daughter Fā!ima, the mother of the shīʿi iconic martyr Imām \u000eussayn.

Gīsūdarāz was born in Delhi and was a young boy of four when his family moved to Dawlatābād of Deccan in a.d. 1325, a few years prior to the forced migration campaign of Sultan Mu\fammad ibn Tughluq (d. a.d. 1351).492 Th e migration south was part of the political campaign of the ruler of Delhi who was intent on establishing a second capital in Deccan. His plan was to expand his dominion to the South and create a Muslim settlement in that area in order to off set the non-Islamic population of the region. Consequently, he required that the learned Muslim shaykhs be moved there. Khawāja Banda Nawāz’s father, Sayyīd Yūsuf al-\u000eusaynī, known as Rājū Qattāl (d. a.d. 1330 ), was among the fi rst Dihlawī elite who relocated with his family to the Deccan. Over the years, Khuldābād of Deccan became the Chishtī spiritual center in India and gained the title of the “valley of the saints.” Sayyīd Yūsuf al-\u000eusaynī who died while Gīsūdarāz was still a young boy, was one of the fi rst Sufi s who was buried in Khuldābād.493 A disciple of Shaykh Ni~ām al-Dīn al-Awliyā, he was a famous Sufi with followers during his life and aft er his death.

Timur justifi ed his campaign as an attempt to save Islam and to defeat the Delhi rulers for their mild attitude toward the Hindu population. Gīsūdarāz had predicted Timur’s attack and the fall of Delhi about three years prior to the military conquest. According to Sāmānī, during that time Gīsūdarāz used to warn those around him about what the future held and advised them to leave Delhi. When Gīsūdarāz and his company arrived in Deccan, the Bahmanī king, Fīrūzshāh (r. a.d. 1397–1422) showed Gīsūdarāz the respect deserving of his stature. Fīrūzshāh was enthusiastic about Gīsūdarāz’s relocation to his domain and when the caravan reached the outskirst of the city, the king was personally awaiting their arrival.495 Sāmānī describes that upon the arrival of Gīsūdarāz in the Fata\fābād district of Dawlatābād, Fīrūzshāh invited him to his capital A\fsanābād (Gulbarga). Th e Shaykh thought about the off er and responded that he would have accepted the invitation except that the king’s life was soon to end; therefore, his residence in the vicinity of the king was futile as the king was destined to leave. Th e king asked for his blessings so that God would prolong his life. Aft er a few days of prayer, the Shaykh told Fīrūzshāh that his prayers have been answered and the king was granted to live as long as the Shaykh himself. Th at proved accurate and Fīrūzshāh died only a few days earlier than Gīsūdarāz. Th e Shaykh and his company settled in A\fsanābād (Gulbarga) in a.d. 1400. Fīrūzshāh’s initial enthusiasm for him waned in time; however, his younger brother Khān Khānān A\fmad Shāh (d. a.d. 1436) remained dedicated to Gīsūdarāz and helped him build the fortress that served as his residence and hospice. Aft er the passing of Gīsūdarāz, the hospice was transformed to the dargah where his family and disciples lived in residence. Th is tradition has been kept alive over the centures. To this day, there are students of religious sciences who live at the dargah. Gīsūdarāz’s residential quarters have been transformed into the dargah’s library, and some pilgrims spend the night in the courtyards of the shrines of the Khawāja and his descendants.

Today, Gulbarga is counted as one of the most active educational centers in India. Shar\f-i Tamhīdāt Gīsūdarāz was an erudite scholar with remarkable knowledge of Islamic and Indian spiritual traditions. He was a devout Muslim and a religious leader who followed the sharīʿa but was also inclined toward the learnings of mystics like ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt who evaluated faith in terms of knowledge by presence or proximity to God. His commentary on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt complemented the existing Chishtī scholarship on him. Gīsūdarāz’s contribution, however, was distinguished in its exclusive and detailed focus on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt independent of the insurmountable image of his teacher, A\fmad Ghazzālī. Gīsūdarāz was fond of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and in instances when he disagreed with ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and criticized his views, he still defended him and off ered justifi cation for the perspective under consideration. Sometimes, he conveyed his aff ection for ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt in his playful manner of referring to the master as being young and immature or perhaps insane (qa\tī-i mā dīwāni ast). Gīsūdarāz was drawn to this young mystic for the intellectual and spiritual quality of his thought, but also because the early Chishtīs highly regarded him. Chishtī hagiographies that were composed for a more general readership, constitute another important reference on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. It aught to be emphasized that for the early Chishtīs, interest in ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was to a great extent prompted by his relationship with A\fmad Ghazzālī.496 Th is was also the case in the hagiographies and the mystical literature of Iran and the Arabic-speaking world. Th e diff erence between these sources and those of the Indian Chishtīs is that the former did not elaborate much on A\fmad Ghazzālī in the fi rst place. For the most part, he was described as the younger brother of Abū \u000eāmid Ghazzālī. Th ese sources, unlike those of the Chishtīs, cast A\fmad in the shadow of his formidable brother. Naturally, in this body of literature ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, who was identifi ed as the disciple of A\fmad Ghazzālī, received even less attention. Th e Chishtīs, on the 496 Th e later Chishtī generations found added interest in ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt through a comparison of his life and his tragic end with that of an importan Chishtī mystic and martyr, Masʿūd Bakk (d. a.d. 1387)."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"the legacy of $ayn al-qud.t179contrary, celebrated A\fmad Ghazzālī as a defi ning author of mystical literature. Ghazzālī’s doctrine on samāʿ, specifi cally, was at the heart of the Chishtī canonical teachings. Gīsūdarāz’s commentary demonstrates that the author felt an intimate affi nity with ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. Similar to him, Gīsūdarāz was an original thinker and an open-minded mystic who was receptive to varied expressions of faith and venues for acquiring knowledge. At a time when the Chishtī sufi s were discouraged from learning any other language besides Persian and Arabic, Gīsūdarāz had acquired knowledge of Hindi, Deccani, and Sanskrit, which were considered the languages of the heathen and the polytheist. Moreover, he exercised an unconventional approach to writing that was in variance with the Chishtī stance on this subject. Th e Chishtī shaykhs did not favor writing, and our understanding of them is confi ned to the malfū\u0014āt (discourses) that their disciples, at a later point, committed to writing by having memorized the teachings and the sayings of their teachers. Gīsūdarāz was one of the fi rst Chishtī who authored his own texts. He was a prolifi c writer and produced close to two hundred books in Arabic, Persian, and some in Deccani. Shar\u0005-i Tamhīdāt, also known as Shar\u0005-i Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, is among this important collection of original writings.497 Gīsūdarāz organized the commentary, aft er the Tamhīdāt, in ten chapters. Each section followed a large selection of passages from the corresponding chapter in the Tamhīdāt. Th e selections were those that Gīsūdarāz deemed important and/or complex. Th ey included discussions on the verses from the Qurʾān, the mysteries of the unseen, the lights of Mu\fammad and Satan, the opening of the heart as a stage in the process of illumination, mystical disciplines such as fasting and prayer, the wayfarer’s attitude toward his body and its needs, mystical birth and death, faith, habitude, and samāʿ. Th e opening passage of 497 Other titles by Khawāja Gīsūdarāz include the following:(1) Shar\u0005 Mashāriq al-Anwār (A Commentary of the Rising Places of the Lights), (2) Shar\u0005 \u001cAwārif al-Ma\u001cārif (A Commentary on the Benefactions of Knowledge), (3) Shar\u0005 Adab al-Murīd (A Commentary on the Rules of the Novice), (4) Shar\u0005 Fuū al-\bikam (A Commentary on the Bazels of Wisdom), (5) Tarjumih Risālih Qushayriyih (Translation of the Treatise of al-Qushayrī), (6) \ba\u0014ā\u001dir al-Quds (Th e Enclosed Pastures of Holiness), (7) Risālat Istiqāmat al-Sharī\u001cah bi-\u000barīqat al-\baqīqah (A Treatise on How the Shari$a Goes Straight by the Way of the Truth), (8) Asmār al-Asrār (Night Discourses on the Secrets), (9) Maktūbāt Fārsī (Persian Writings), (10) Malfū\u0014āt Musammā bi-Jawāmi\u001c al-Kalim (A Book of Sayings Called Concise Aphorisms)."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"chapter five180Shar\u0005-i Tamhīdāt recaptures the opening lines of the Tamhīdāt, followed by the interpretation of the author.498 “Follow the light that was sent down with him.”499 He called him light and called the book light also. He commanded all to follow that book and made the following of it as the following after Mu\fammad. Th erefore, He brought everything out in the same garb: Mu\fammad as light, the book as light, and the one who was the follower of Mu\fammad as light. And so it is light upon light. Hearken, and make your mind clear, these words are more delicate and subtle than what I am saying. Do you know what he is saying? The Qurʾān came from God and Mu\fammad came from God. Mu\fammad came from God in the same way as Qurʾān came from God. You call one uncreated: consider that jewel to be the amaranth of this jewel. Th is is a seemly metaphor. Since you are a man of gnosis, draw your heart hither and know that if by Qurʾān you understand the paper, ink, and the words, that is not the Qurʾān. Th ere is a Qurʾān beyond this one, which this is a sign of. Also, Mu\fammad, peace be upon him, has hands and feet and a body. But that is not Mu\fammad. Mu\fammad is beyond that as the source of mercy. Th e Qā\u0002ī,500 peace be upon him, is in accord with my sayings.ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt begins the Tamhīdāt with the central argument of his teachings that “everything is light.” He appeals to Qurʾānic verses and explains that the scripture and the Prophet are manifestations of light. Gīsūdarāz opens the commentary by following closely the initial words of the Tamhīdāt. He proceeds by approaching the selections chronologically according to their order of appearance in the Tamhīdāt. Th roughout the work Gīsūdarāz’s methodology is to highlight the crucial concepts or phrases in each passage as the starting point of his discussion. Th e Tamhīdāt was an important text for Gīsūdarāz who regarded its teachings to be so profound and complex that he deemed the novice among his disciples incapable of approaching this text. Th erefore, he forbade his beginning students access to the Tamhīdāt and used it in teaching those disciples who were experienced in mystical learnings. Gīsūdarāz’s detailed and elaborate commentary on the Tamhīdāt was intended for such readers.498 Gīsūdarāz, Shar\u0005 Zubdat al-\baqāʾīq al-Maʿrūf bi Shar\u0005 Tamhīdāt, edited by ʿA!ā \u000eusayn (Hyderabad: Muʿīn Press, 1945), pp. 3–5.499 Qurʾān, 7: 157. 500 Gīsūdarāz is referring to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt as qā\tī, meaning the judge.

Masʿūd Bakk whose full name was Shīr Khān Masʿūd Bakk A\fmad Ma\fmūd Nakhshabī Bukhārī, was a member of the nobility from the Bukhārā region in Transoxania. Aft er experiencing a mystical state he abandoned his life of privilege, joined the Chishtī order in India, and spent the rest of his life there. Hagiographical sources associate Bakk with Shaykh Ni~ām al-Dīn al-Awliyā and identify him as the disciple of the Chishtī Shaykh Rukn al-Dīn ibn Shihāb al-Dīn Imām, next to whom he is resting in peace at the Lādū Sarāy district of Delhi.501 It is common knowledge that Masʿūd was executed upon the order of his kinsman, King Fīrūzshāh Tughluq, but the dates of his birth and his death are not known. Tārīkh Jāmiʾ Awlīyāʾ Dihlī (Th e Comprehensive History of the Saints of Delhi) records his date of execution toward the end of the fourteenth-century.502 Carl Ernst’s analysis of the reception of Masʿūd Bakk in the medieval and the pre-modern Indian hagiographies, indicates that his execution must had occurred during the tumultuous fi nal years of Fīrūzshāh Tughluq’s reign, around a.d. 1387.503 Bakk was known and has been remembered as a poet, a mystic, a member of the nobility, and a martyr. His collection of poetry consists of about one thousand four hundred couplets on familiar mystical themes and motifs. A review of several manuscript copies of his poetry at libraries in Delhi and Hyderabad reveals that Bakk’s poetry is on subjects that appear in the writing of most mystics, including ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. Th rough the collection, Bakk does not refer to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt by name. Th is is not the case with his prose treatises, Mirʿat al-ʿĀrifīn (Th e Mirror of the Gnostics), and Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif fī ʿAyn al-Maʿārif (Th e Source of Books on the Source of Gnosis), which include several references to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his writing.

Th e interest of Bakk in ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was acknowledged in the Chishtī biographical annals. Th ese sources sealed the memory of Bakk as an ecstatic martyr and compared both his writing and his tragic end with the work and life of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. A classical source in this genre is Akhbār al-Akhyār fī Asrār al-Abrār (Th e Tales of the Elite Concerning the Mysteries of the Holy Ones) composed by the famous sixteenth-century scholar and hagiographer ʿAbdal-\u000eaqq Mu\faddith ibn \u001fayf al-Dīn al-Qādirī al-Dihlawī. Th e following passage, which Ernst provides in his study of Bakk, is from ʿAbdal-\u000eaqq’s entry on Bakk and his relationship with ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt.He was in the extremity of intoxication, one of those intoxicated with the wine of unity, who smash their glasses in the wine-house of reality. He spoke intoxicated words; no one in the Chishti order had ever revealed the secrets of reality so blatantly or acted so intoxicated as he. Th ey say that his tears were so hot that if they fell on one’s hand it would be burned. He wrote many works on the science of Sufism and unifi cation. He had one work named Tamhidat, based on the Tamhidat of ʿAy al-Qudat Hamadhani; many subtle realities are contained therein.505Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif fī ʿAyn al-Maʿārif is the text that ʿAbdal-\u000eaqq identifi es as Bakk’s Tamhīdāt. ʿAbdal-\u000eaqq was familiar with the work of Bakk and was not mistaken about the title of the treatise. A close reading of his entry on Bakk demonstrates that the treatise under consideration must had been known both as Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif and the Tamhīdāt. ʿAbdal-\u000eaqq does not mention the title Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif but quotes passages from this text, which he identifi es as the Tamhīdāt. Th rough the text, Bakk refers to himself by the title of Darwīsh. Th is has resulted in cataloging Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif in the A\"ifi yya index of manuscripts under “Darwīsh” as its author. In one place, ʿAbdal-\u000eaqq compares Bakk’s two treatises Mirʿat al-ʿĀrifīn and Tamhīdāt as follows:506 504 Gīsudarāz, Maktūbāt, edited by ʿA!ā \u000eussain (Hyderabad: n. p., 1943), pp. 124-33. Th is letter provides a prime example in Bakk’s capacity for discursive and analytical reasoning. Some scholars have argued that the letter must had been written by Gīsūdarāz and addressed to Bakk. 505 Carl Ernst, “From Hagiography to Martyrology”, pp. 319–20. 506 ʿAbdal-\u000eaqq ibn Sayf al-Dīn al-Turk al-Dihlawī al-Bukhārī, Akhbār al-Akhyār fī Asrār al-Abrār, MS 99, Catalogue no. 1, Tarājima, Fārsī, (Hyderabad: Andhra"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"the legacy of $ayn al-qud.t183Th ese passages are suffi cient in attesting his learning and perfection.

Indeed the amount of knowledge that he outlines in this book is not as much as in the other book.Th is remark is additional evidence that ʿAbdal-\u000eaqq was well familiar with the texts that he identifi es as Bakk’s mystical treatises. Moreover, the fact that his entry does not include any reference to the title Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif means that he is referring to the same text as the Tamhīdāt. Th e narrative by ʿAbdal-\u000eaqq and the evidence from Bakk’s own writing, demonstrate that both titles were used in referring to the same treatise. Bakk uses these titles interchangeably through his writing. Th e following from the beginning of the manuscript where Bakk initiates his discussion identifi es the ensuing text as Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif fī ʿAyn al-Maʿārif, and the Tamhīdāt.507 This compilation was written upon the request of friends who are seeking the unveilings of the realities of the divine knowledge and the infi nite mysteries.

It is my hope that the concealed mysteries in Umm al-Kitāb are expressed through this ink and manifest to the sight of observing the witnessing of those meanings. Th e testament of Darwīsh is to not disclose this book of mysteries to the uninitiated who are not aware of the secrets of the intrinsic mysteries and are content with mere science, and to not expose this excellent sublime to the mimicking pretenders who driven by the blindness of envy have shut the eyes of fairness and unrolled the tongue of mockery against the beholders of the truths. Th at is because the perception of mysteries requires a pure heart, focused mind, and intact reason. And this intention is not found in the pretenders and the lighthearted. Th e stage is that of study, striving, and diligence, which consists of the disciple and the teacher. Th at is why they have said “Witnessing without the striving is as martyrdom without the battle.

Th e title Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif, on the other hand, resonates with Umm al-Kitāb (Th e Source of the Book) that appears in the prelude. It is the title of the tablet of the divine decrees and the fi rst chapter of the Qurʾān. In the present context, Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif refers to the teachings that are revealed to a pure heart by divine sources. Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif echoes these learnings through the discussion of the secrets of the unseen. In this manner, Bakk compares his writing with the divine scriptures that are the source and the mother of all writing. Bakk’s addressee is a reader who has the spiritual maturity and insight to perceive the meaning of the secrets that he is describing. Referring to himself as Darwīsh, Bakk states that it is the testament of Darwīsh that Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif is kept from those who are not fi t to approach the knowledge that it contains. His apprehension is in line with the concern that Gīsūdarāz expresses about protecting from the uninitiated the Tamhīdāt of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, and some of his own writing. Th eir attitude of secrecy is diff erent from ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s self-conscious regret in the Tamhīdāt that he is revealing secrets, which he is forbidden to discuss with others. In the case of Bakk, he is not concerned about disclosing secrets but is worried that his words will reach those who are not qualifi ed to read them. Th erefore, he entrusts his will and his writing to a community of the connoisseurs who are clearly his chosen addressees. A community who will safeguard texts such as Bakk’s Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif attests that Bakk, and also Gīsūdarāz, composed some of their writing for an elite community of mystic scholars among the Chishtīs. In the case of Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif, the small number of the surviving manuscript copies is an indication of the limited circulation of this text. Th ere are two manuscript copies of Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif at the A\"ifi yya collection.509 My attempts to fi nd other 508 Qurʾān, 29: 69. 509 Bakk, Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif fī ʿAyn al-Maʿārif, MS 202, Catalogue no. 1, Ta\"awwuf Fārsī, (Hyderabad: Andhra Pradesh Oriental Manuscripts Library and Research Institute), p. 371.

Th e stylistic and thematic infl uence of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt on Bakk is most readily seen in Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif or the Tamhīdāt. Bakk marks the “introduction to the Tamhīdāt” as the beginning of the ensuing chapters in the text. Th is choice of vocabulary is not coincidental for there are plenty of instances in the text that confi rm the infl uence of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s Tamhīdāt on the author. Similar to this book, Umm al-\u001fa\fāʾif is divided into ten introductions (tamhīdāt) as follows: (1) Introducing the Reality of Aff ection (2) Introducing the Reality of Love (3) Introducing that in the Eyes of the Witnesses of the Unseen, Umm al-Kitāb (Th e Source of the Book) is Manifest in Every Word (4) Introducing the Reality of the Humankind (5) Th e First Part in Regard to the Sending of the Letters of the Alphabet to Adam (6) Th e Second Part in Regard to the Sent Words (7) Introducing the Stages of Wayfaring (8) Introducing the Mute Remembering of the Saying that Peace be Upon Him is not Manifest Dhikr (9) Introducing True Infi delity, and (10) Introducing Th at True Faith also Has Stages. Th ese chapters investigate the distinction between appearance and reality, and reason and knowledge by presence. In Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif, Bakk appeals to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt in order to support his own discussions. Th is is how the objective of his approach is diff erent from that of Gīsūdarāz in his analysis of the teachings of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt. Bakk pays careful attention to the process of transmission of learning from the teacher to the disciple and from the author to the reader. Accordingly, Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif is to transmit Bakk’s divine learnings to the reader. Bakk compares this manuscript with divine texts, which have an exterior and an interior reality that make their message susceptible to varied degrees of interpretation.511 Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif argues that the understanding of the intrinsic meaning of such texts is contingent upon ones dedication to learning and to striving on the mystical path the other manuscript copy is Mullā ʿUmar Ghaznawī \u000eanīfī Chishtī.

An intriguing moment in Umm al-\u0011a\u0005āʾif is Bakk’s description of his own spiritual initiation into the rank of those who receive knowledge through visionary witnessing. His narrative resonates with ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s when he uses the imagery of light and Qurʾānic verses to describe his seclusion with A\fmad Ghazzālī and the meeting with the Prophet Mu\fammad. Bakk depicts himself in the company of the Prophet Mu\fammad and four teachers and guides, two of whom are unknown to him. He identifi es the other as Shihāb al-Dīn [Rukn al-Dīn ibn Shihāb al-Dīn Imām], and the teacher of his time Na\"īr al-Dīn [Na\"īr al-Dīn Chirāgh Dihlī].512 Th ey are respectively the teachers of Bakk and Gīsūdarāz. Th e Prophet Mu\fammad, whom he refers to as the pillar of faith, is seen following the group. Bakk sees himself trailing aft er them when he is ceased with a strange mood that makes him bewildered with love. At this instant, he perceives that the enlightenment of the soul is through the light of these four who are the repository of the light of Mu\fammad. Longingly, he wonders if he would be allotted a portion of their light.513Would a ray from the radiance of their light reach this wretch from that pole of life who is “a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the East nor of the West,”514 from the light of the lamp that is in this four-fold glass of the brilliant star. He, in its niche is the pillar of faith and the pole of the universe. How would I know if this mad-man will receive a radiance of that light or not and if he will become its moth or not. Conveying this event through Qurʾānic verses and visions of light, Bakk continues with explaining that his fi ve senses leave him emancipated and he approaches the divine assembly. One of the shaykhs calls him nigh, draws him close to his chest, and little by little kindles the light of his soul with the candle-light of the truth.

In a similar manner, Bakk is chosen as the recipient of the light of Mu\fammad that the Shaykh in his vision instills in him. Th is scene is reminiscent of the relationship between ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his mentor and the subsequent opening of his eye of insight. Bakk refers to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his Tamhīdāt at several places in this manuscript and in Mirʿat al-ʿĀrifīn. Th e writings of Bakk and Gīsūdarāz confi rm that the Chishtiī elite and the order’s defi ning authors were engaged in studying and discussing ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt.

Mīrān Jī was an important Chishtī shaykh of Hyderabad who rose to this status from a secular background. His initiation into mysticism appear to had been foreordained. He was a civil servant in charge of the cavalry in the government of Sultan ʿAbdullāh Qu!b Shāhī (r. a.D. 1625–72) who acknowledged his professionalism and promoted him to responsibilities that were reserved for his intimate deputies. Once he appointed Mīrān Jī to the court of Ibrāhīm ʿĀdil Shāh in Bījāpūr.515 Mīrān Jī completed his assignment in a few days and was preparing to leave for Hyderabad when he learned that the famous local mystic Shāh Amīn al-Dīn ʿAlī (d. a.d. 1705) had come out of his forty-day-seclusion (khalwa) and was accepting visitors.516 Mīrān Jī went to visit 515 ʿAbd al-Jabbār Khān Malkāpūrī \u000eydirābādī, Ma\u0005būb \u001eū al-Minan fī Tadhkirat Awlīyāʾ Deccan, vol. 1 (Hyderabad: Ra\fmān Press, 1900), p. 955. 516 Ibid., pp. 116–20.

Amīn al-Dīn received his initiation robe (khirqa) from his father Burhān al-Dīn Jānam and replaced him as the religious leader in that area. He authored several treatises including the famous Chakī Nāmā (Th e Book of Handgrinder).

Mīrān Jī’s title, Khudānamā (showing God) is in reference to his reputation as a teacher who enlightened many on the path of God.518 Mīrān Jī’s commentary on the Tamhīdāt was aptly titled Shar\u0005-i Shar\u0005-i Tamhīdāt (Th e Commentary on the Commentary of the Tamhīdāt). It was composed in Deccani, a dominant language of the South, and made available to a large readership especially in Bījāpūr and Hyderabad. Mīrān Jī’s commentary consisted of translated passages from the Tamhīdāt of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and the commentary of Gīsūdarāz. It is accurate to say that his work was a Deccani rendition of the commentary by Gīsūdarāz. Th rough his writing, Mīrān Jī oft en refers to Gīsūdarāz by name in order to distinguish between his comments and those of Gīsūdarāz.

Th e Chishtīs considered samāʿ to be an important medium for connecting with the spiritual realms. In fact, practicing samāʿ has been one of the distinguishing tenants of the Chishtī order. Th e early Chishtī scholars esteemed ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and A\fmad Ghazzālī for their discussion of samāʿ as a form of anamnesis or recollection of the instance of the covenant as a theophanic experience. Masūʿd Bakk who was famous for his fondness of samāʿ, provided valuable insight on dying as a consequence of samāʿ. He explained that this death occurred on the fringes of a cosmos that the wayfarer entered by means of samāʿ. Th is cosmos consisted of twelve constellations and seven planets that paralleled the twelve scales and the seven melodies of music.523 Th e wayfarer went on his/her introvert miʿrāj (nocturnal travel) into this space by listening to music; which similar to Burāq served as a vehicle for the journey into the unseen spheres. Th e fi rst song that invoked the soul to embark on its passage was related to the Moon, the second to Mercury, the third to Venice, the fourth was related to the Sun, the fi ft h to Mars, the sixth to Jupiter, and the seventh to Saturn. In this manner, Bakk explained samāʿ as the wayfarer’s attunement to the vibrations of a cosmic reality. Th ese planets and their corresponding constellations marked the proximity of the wayfarer to the homeland. Th e traveller who reached Saturn was at a point of no-return. He had gone far away from his earthbound existence and come so close to the instance of the covenant that his state could be defi ned in terms of a dying at the instance of having been born. At this stage, his soul was completely freed from his body and he was able to hear the words of the Truth. Th is kind of hearing eliminated the movement that overtook the body in samāʿ (hazat). Th e stillness of his body was a sign that his samāʿ had become permanent. Th at meant, the one who heard 523 Masʿūd Bakk, Marʾat al-ʿĀrifīn, edited by Abū Rajā Mu\fammad ʿAbdal-Qadīr (Hyderabad: Matbaʿ-i Mufīd, 1892), pp. 162–63."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"chapter six192(mustamiʿ) had become one with the one who caused him to hear (musmiʿ). Th ere were other Muslims who saw the aff ective quality of samāʿ as an opportunity for Satan to accost the human kind and lead him/her astray. Th e discussion of samāʿ and its permissibility concerned mystics, theologians, jurists, and commentators of the Qurʾān and the \u0005adīth. Traditionists and jurisprudents Mu\fammad ibn Ismāʿīl al-Bukhārī (a.d. 810–870) and Abū al-\u000eusayn Muslim ibn al-\u000eajjāj al-Nayshābūrī (a.d. 817/821–75) collected detailed records on the treatment of samāʿ by the Prophet and his companions. Al-Qushayrī whose encyclopedic compilation of mystical concepts was the subject of a commentary by Khawāja Banda Nawāz Gīsūdarāz, was frequently cited by those Muslim mystics who established the theoretical basis for the debate on samāʿ. Al-Qushayrī’s entry on samāʿ traced this discourse among Muslim scholars and theologians to the eight-century. By the tenth-century, the discussion of samāʿ had become prevalent and during the time of al-Qushayrī, the eleventh-century, it was treated as an established theme in mystical and religious texts. Th e fi rst Muslim mystic who introduced samāʿ to his followers in India was Abū al-\u000easan ʿAlī ibn Uthmān al-Jullābī al-Hujwīrī (d. a.d. 1072/1077), best known as the author of the oldest Persian treatise on mysticism, Kashf al-Ma\u0005jūb Li-Arbāb al-Qulūb (Th e Unveiling of the Concealed for the People of the Heart). He was born in Hujwīr in Ghazna, traveled extensively in the region, and aft er a long stay in Iraq ended up in India.524 Al-Hujwīrī settled in Lahore where he completed the Kashf al-Ma\u0005jūb, his only surviving text.525 His scholarship had a 524 Hujwīrī, Kashf al-Mahjub: Th e Oldest Persian Treatise on Sufi sm, translated by Reynold A. Nicholson (Lahore: Islamic Book Foundation, 1976), pp. xviii, 91. Nicholson explains that Hujwīrī did not move to Lahore on his own volition but was taken there as a prisoner against his will. As a result he lost access to his books, which were left behind and had diffi culty completing Kashf al-Mahjub. Nicholson’s translation of the text reads:My Shaykh had further traditions concerning him, but I could not possibly set down more than this (andar waqt-i man \tiqi būd ū az in mumkin na-shūd), my books having been left at Ghazna—may God guard it!—while I myself had become a captive among uncongenial folk (dar miyān-i nājinsān) in the district of Lahāwu, which is a dependency of Mūltān.

Th e Ghazzālī brothers aspired to Hujwīrī. A\fmad Ghazzālī’s classical treatise on samāʿ entitled Bawāriq al-Ilmāʿ fī al-Radd ʿAlā Man Yu\u0005arrimu al-Samāʿ (Th e Lightning-Flashes of Indication Concerning the Refutation of Th ose Who Declare Audition Forbidden in General), established him as a defi ning authority on this subject. Th e early Chishtīs appealed to Ghazzālī in their development of the discourse of samāʿ. Bruce Lawrence explains: Th ere are two extant treatises on samāʿ, one in Arabic by a disciple of the foremost Chishtī saint of Delhi, Nizām ad-dīn Badāʿūnī (Awliyā), the other in Persian by \u001fūfī Hamīd ad-dīn Nāgurī, a successor to the fi rst Indian Chishtī Shaykh, Muʿin ad-dīn Sanjarī Ajmerī. Both Uūl as-samāʿ and Risālah-e samāʿ contrast with one another but even more with the sole extant treatise from an early non-Indian devotee of samāʿ.526Lawrence is referring to Bawārīq al-Ilmāʿ, which he identifi es as the most important theoretical treatise on samāʿ. Th e early Chishtī authors considered this text as a theoretical manifesto on samāʿ. In his analysis Lawrence observes that Marijan Molé gives prominence to only four Indian authors as the signifi cant theorists of samāʿ: ʿAlī Hujwīrī, the title-page, and pretended that they themselves were the authors. In order to guard against the repetition of this fraud, he has inserted his own name in many passages of the present work. His writings, to which he has occasion to refer in the Kashf al-Mahjūb, are—1. A divān (p. 2).2. Minhāj al-din, on the method of \u001fūfi sm (p. 2).

Th is is a strong indication of the breath and depth of Ghazzālī’s infl uence on the Chishtī authors. Samāʿ as a Muslim spiritual practice was taken to India by mystics from other lands. Th e founder of the Chishtī order in India, Khawāja Muʿīn al-Dīn Mu\fammad \u000easan Sijzī Chishtī (a.d. 1142–1236), similar to his precursor Hujwīrī, was an avid lover of music who came to India as a foreigner. He was born in Sistān or Sījīistān (in present-day Iran) and went to India in a.d. 1193. In contrast to the members of the Suhrawardī order who shunned the practice of samāʿ,529 he held samāʿ sessions in his house and listened to music every evening.530 Muʿīn al-Dīn and his disciples institutionalized samāʿ among the Chishtīs.531 Th eir eff ort was reinforced by a wealth of theoretical writing that was produced by the later generations of the Indian Chishtīs among whom Gīsūdarāz and Masʿūd Bakk receive special recognition. Th e opponents of samāʿ argued that it distracted the soul from God and incited in it fanciful passions that were in tune with the desires and deceptions of the ego. Th ose in support of samāʿ stated that it was a medium for elevating the soul into the spiritual realms where it was susceptible to varied spiritual awakenings. Al-Qushayrī defi ned samāʿ as the pleasant voice/sound, which is an ornament of the Qurʾān and 527 Ibid., pp. 72–73. Cf. Marijan Molé, “La Danse extatique en Islam,” in Sources Orientales, no. 6, edited by Denise Bernot, Anne-Marie Esnoul, et al. (Paris: Seuil, 1963), pp. 147–280. Marijan Molé is another scholar who provides valuable information on the reception of samāʿ among the early Chishtī. Her analysis identifi es a few authors as the authority in this domain. 528 Lawrence, “Th e Early Chishtī Approach to Samāʿ,” p. 74. 529 Ibid., pp. 80–81. Bruce Lawrence expresses astonishment that both Abū Najīb al-Suhrawardī and his nephew Abū \u000eaf\" ʿUmar al-Suhrawardī, who were, to use the author’s words, “direct spiritual descendants of A\fmad Ghazzālī,” are said to had been disinclined toward samāʿ. He suggests that their own mystical experiences or pressure from the Muslim community could be factors in determining their attitude. 530 Hussaini, Sayyid Mu\u0005ammad al-\busaynī-i Gīsūdirāz, p. 122. 531 Th e Suhrawardīs were the disciples and the followers of Shihāb al-Dīn Abū \u000eaf\" ʿUmar Suhrawardī.

Th ose persons who were aware of what a formidable companion and adversary the ego was, could engage with their ego by taking part in samāʿ. Th erefore, samāʿ was permissible for the ascetics on account of their strivings on the path. It was favored for the mystics for the vitality of their hearts.534 Qushayrī explained that samāʿ aff ected the soul and each member of the body. When it affl icted the sight it brought tears to it; the tongue it brought songs to; the hands it moved to rend the garment; and the feet it set to dancing.535 A\fmad Ghazzālī defi ned music as the “arrangements of notes and spiritual analogies,” which humans were innately drawn to. He explained that samāʿ awakened the heart of the mystic and took it toward God.536 Bawāriq al-Ilmāʿ celebrated samāʿ as a medium for the transcendence of the soul. In this state, spiritual forces, which bore the presence of Satan, were tangible and audible. Considering that Bawāriq al-Ilmāʿ presented a rhetorical defence of samāʿ against its opponents, Ghazzālī avoided any direct reference to the instrumental role of Satan in the awakening of the soul. He hinted at this subject discreetly through the imagery of contrasting lights. When the bodily members are united in aff airs which are suitable, the law of contention is removed, and the law of mutual agreement appears.

He based his discussion of samāʿ on the contrasting properties of harmony and discord or light and darkness. Th ese contrasts complemented each other and enabled the wayfarer to distinguish between the cacophony of the ego and the affi nity of the spiritual realms whose vibrations cleansed the heart. Satan had a share in the heart of mankind and was inevitably met when the heart was opened through samāʿ. Ghazzālī limited the discussion of this subject to the symbolism of contrasting lights. His objective was to defend and promote samāʿ against the objections of the jurists of his time who in comparison with the jurists of the past were like the cronies of the rulers in contrast to the “godly, energetic, and religious” saint/jurists.538 Th eir judgement on samāʿ was groundless since “... if they blame the poor, saying that their audition is not permissible, they do not follow the provisos of the saints of the past. Th ey are deserving of blame for not following what the godly jurists of the past were engaged in.”539 Ghazzālī welcomed the temptations of Satan in samāʿ since it was the “negative-guide” whom mystics like ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, Ghazzālī, and Man\"ūr ibn al-\u000eallāj diligently pursued in gauging their own spiritual cohesion and in navigating their way toward the beloved. Samāʿ was an opportunity to rend the veils that separated these wayfarers from God.Diff erent Views on Samāʿ: Ibn Abī al-Dunyā and A\u0005mad GhazzālīIt was agreed that samāʿ was a delicate issue. Th e traditionalists and the Sufi sects, the Naqshbandīa and the Qādarīa, considered samāʿ too dangerous and risky to try. Th ose mystics who engaged in samāʿ approached it as a sacred ritual that was performed under the supervision of a master. Junayd listed three conditions for samāʿ: time, place, and the brethren. Samāʿ sessions were to be held in specifi c physical and emotional environments, and in the company of individuals whose assembly perpetuated meditation on the divine. 537 Ibid., pp. 72, 123. 538 Ibid., pp. 117–18. 539 Ibid., p. 18."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"sam$197Samāʿ, with all its attending dangers, was a sacred experience because it invoked the memory of the primordial covenant (mithāq) between man and God when God addressed His supreme creature with the question: “Am I not your Lord?”540 In the terrestrial realm, samāʿ was conceived as an echo of that call.541 Jalāl al-Dīn Rumī is renowned for his adherence to samāʿ, which he celebrated as the memory of the union between the lover and the beloved and the pledge of love that was exchanged between them. Th e Tale of the Reed (Nay Nāmih), is a most expressive instance of this focus in the work of Rumī.542 Th e central character of the poem is the musical instrument reed that laments its separation from its natural abode at home with the beloved. Th e opening lines of the poem invite the listener to hear this tale of love and separation: “Listen to the reed how it tells a tale, complaining of separations || Saying, ‘Ever since I was parted from the reed-bed, my lament hath caused man and woman to moan.”543 Th is is how Tale of the Reed places samāʿ at the center of action in the poem. Th e voice of the reed is an echo of a durationless instance (ān) of union between the lover and the beloved.

Th ose who vouched for samāʿ were confronting the view that condemned it as a medium utilized by Satan to tempt man astray.

Ibn Abī al-Dunyā and Ghazzālī argued their positions by relying on the Qurʾān, the tradition, the four schools of jurisprudence, and evidence from the life of the faithful. Th e following overview of their work provides a framework for understanding the signifi cance of A\fmad Ghazzālī and his student 540 Qurʾān, 7: 172. 541 Th e soul of the humankind yearns for the voice of the beloved, which it accosts in the sound of music. Connection to the spiritual realms through audition of music was considered to exert healing eff ects not only on the soul but also the body.

Dhamm al-Malāhī (Censure of Instruments of Diversion) is the earliest treatise by a Muslim author condemning samāʿ. Ibn Abī al-Dunyā was an important fi gure in the Abbasid court; he was the tutor to the caliphs, al-Muʿta\u0002id and his son al-Muktafī.544 He composed several books on the principal vices that the pious must avoid. Audition of music was a great sin and a signal that would announce the coming of the Doomsday. At that time, those who entertained music, the author warned, will be metamorphosed into beasts.545 Ibn Abī al-Dunyā began his treatise by referring to the Prophet who said that the end will be at hand when music and wine are permissible, and earthquakes swallow the creatures, stones shower from the sky, and humans change into beasts.“Among the last of my people there will be swallowing up, pelting, and metamorphosis.” It was said, “O, apostle of Allāh, When?” He said, “When the maʿāzif and the qaināt appear, and wine is considered lawful.” Th e maʿāzif are musical instruments (ālāt al-\u0007arab), and the qaināt are the singing-girls. And as for the pelting, it is the throwing of stones [from the sky, just as they were sent on Lot’s people, some on tribes and some on houses; and they will be sent on them] (ie. the people mentioned in the tradition).546Ibn Abī al-Dunyā took as witness the house of the Prophet, the companions, important religious jurists, and state authority fi gures. He expanded on the subject of the metamorphoses and appealed to the status of Abū Huaira, one of the companions, who quoted the Prophet saying: “In the last time some of these people will be metamorphosed into apes and swine.”547 Th ose present asked how that could be possible when these people testify to the unity of God, believe in the legitimacy of His Prophet, and fulfi ll the duties prescribed by Islam. He answered that the Prophet confi rmed that these people fast and pray and perform the pilgrimage but pointed out that “Th ey have employed stringed instruments, tambourines (dufūf), and singing-girls, and spent the 544 Tracts on Listening to Music, p. 14. 545 Ibid., p. 15.

He expanded on other evils that involved music such as gambling, throwing dice, playing games like chess and backgammon, fl ying pigeons, fornication, and sodomy. He concluded that listening to music and songs corrupted the heart and distracted it from devotion to God.548 He referred to the Umayyid caliph Yazīd ibn al-Walīd (d. a.d. 744), who warned his followers against music and singing on the grounds that these activities increased desire, decreased shame and inhibition, and destroyed manliness. If one could not avoid music, then he had to make sure to keep women and children away when listening to music because it stimulated sexual feelings. Music was intoxicating like wine, and could arouse erotic passions. Ironically, mystics used the same analogy of love, desire, and intoxication, to defend music as a medium for approaching God. Juxtaposed against Ibn Abī al-Dunyā, Robson presents A\fmad Ghazzālī and his manifesto in defence of music, Bawāriq al-Ilmāʿ. In contrast to Ibn Abī al-Dunyā’s promise of the catastrophic visions of fear and the horrors of the Domesday, Ghazzālī begins the treatise by remembering the pledge of love between man and God. He uses this framework to set the stage for the discussion of samāʿ, which he defi nes as the echo of the voice of God during the covenance (mithāq). He explains that the soul remembers when God addressed it directly with the question “Am I not your Lord?” Th is memory attracts the soul to beautiful sounds and justifi es the visceral longing of man for music and song. In this discussion, Ghazzālī defi nes dance as the symbolic expression for the jubilance and elation of the soul when God acknowledged its prominence in the scheme of creation.549 Ghazzālī explains that all actions in samāʿ have a spiritual meaning. He describes the signifi cance of diff erent dance gestures that are conveyed through the movements of the hand, feet, and the head. Rending of ones clothes, whirling, or joining hands with another, are other topics that he elaborates.550 He provided a systematic description of samāʿ as a powerful medium for emancipating the soul from the body, thus preparing it to 548 Ibid., p. 27. 549 Ibid., p. 99. 550 Ibid., p. 100."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"chapter six200receive the illuminations that appear as a result of listening to music. He used classical sources, including the writing of Qushayrī and Hujwīrī, to counter the objections of the dogmatic jurists against samāʿ. Ghazzālī called attention to the religious leaders of the early Islam who were close to the teachings of the Prophet and similar to him were fond of music and singing. He argued that the adversarial approach to samāʿ, which insisted on its prohibition, was in fact an indication of the wide popularity of music. Moreover, those who were deemed unfi t to participate in samāʿ, such as women and the novice, had once been so much in the view that their visibility provoked this kind of reaction. Th e concluding pages of Bawāriq al-Ilmāʿ considered these issues in retrospect.As time went on, they permitted pious women who were of their number to look at them through windows and elsewhere, and [also allowed] their assembling with beardless youths who were pious, but not with others. Th ings went on like that till the common people imitated them, and the good was mingled with the corrupt, and the system was disordered. So everyone must look to his own state and what pertains to him and leave everything else, just like him who lives among the sick; so he must be occupied with himself alone. ... So it is now necessary for every pious person to apply himself to what is true and abandon what is vain. And similarly the audition which is approved among the saints is what we have mentioned. And when the good is mingled with the corrupt, every possessor of taste and ecstasy must apply himself to audition according to its established conditions, and not withdraw from it at the word of an objector and opponent, for that brings about the abandonment of imitating the saints ...551Ghazzālī points out that samāʿ was a favored practice among the saints of God and the followers of the Prophet who even included women and the youth in the ceremony. Here, Ghazzālī is rhetorically referring to the fi nal words of Hujwīrī on samāʿ, which are also the concluding passages in his Kashf al-Ma\u0005jūb. Hujwīrī ends the last chapter, Fī al-Samāʿ wa Bayān Anwāʿhu (Concerning Samāʿ and Describing its Kinds) in the following intimate and confessional words. He states “I who am ʿAli ibn ʿUthmān al-Jullābī” prefer that the novice are not allowed into samāʿ sessions in order that their heart is not irritated by vile thoughts and they are not distracted from the path of God. Hujwīrī warns against the dangers of samāʿ, which include allowing women to 551 Ibid., pp. 113–14."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"sam$201look at men during samāʿ.552 Ghazzālī takes this observation as an indication of the popularity of samāʿ and the strong presence of women and the novice at the sessions. He describes samāʿ as a sacred ritual that must be approached with care and attention and reiterates that there are conditions to be observed but ultimately everyone is responsible for their own conduct and should be left to themselves. Following in the footsteps of Ghazzālī, Gisūdarāz interpreted the classical warning against the inclusion of the novice in samāʿ as an indication that the youth and the uninitiated were widely participating in samāʿ sessions and their presence prompted this discussion among the scholars of Islam. Gīsūdarāz explained that the warning was not to ban them from the samāʿ sessions but to discipline them against idle thoughts and fancies.553 According to Gīsūdarāz, the novice should not be prevented from participation in samāʿ but must be supervised, made aware of this specifi c path, and instructed about its rituals. Gīsūdarāz emphasized specifi c conditions for “time, place, and brethren.” It is noteworthy that he was more liberal in his approach to samāʿ than in his restrictive outlook on making ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s writing available to the initiates. Ghazzālī provided detailed descriptions of his favorite musical instrument, the tambourine, which is an essential instrument in the Chishtī samāʿ gatherings and during the course of the ʿurs celebrations. Ghazzālī represents the tambourine as a living symbol for the “cycle of existing things.”554 Th e skin that covers this instrument is a symbol for “general existence,” and striking it symbolizes “descent of the divine visitations” that reveal the realities of the essence. Accordingly, the sound of the tambourine invokes these visitations and makes audible the secrets of the soul. Th e fi ve bells that are attached to the tambourine represent the ranks of the prophets, saints, apostles, caliphs, and the imāms. And “their combined sound is a reference to the appearance of the divine revelations and unrestricted knowledge by means of these realities in the hearts of saints and the people of perfection.”555 He explains that, samāʿ is necessary for the holy persons because they are detached from this world and ready to connect with the other. Samāʿ facilitates this transition.552 Al-Hujwīrī, Kashf al-Ma\u0005jūb, p. 610. 553 Hussaini, Sayyid Mu\u0005ammad Al-\busaynī-i Gīsūdirāz, p. 129. 554 Tracts on Listening to Music, p. 98. 555 Ibid., p. 99."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"chapter six202ʿAyn al-Qu\tāt and SamāʿʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt described samāʿ as a spiritual exercise that brought the wayfarer in contact with the illuminations of the divine realm. In the fourth chapter of the Tamhīdāt, “Know Yourself in Order to Know God,” he spoke of samāʿ as a reality that involved the transformation of the heart when the light of God shined through the wayfarer and obliterated the fi re of Satan. Th is experience was versifi ed by some mystics who attested to the transformation while being in samāʿ.556 It is sound to associate samāʿ with the relationship between ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and his teacher, A\fmad Ghazzālī, and the event of the “opening of the inner sight” that he attributes to their Hamadhān meeting. Moreover, samāʿ seemed to have served as an occasion to bring these mystics in contact with their contemporary Chishtī Shaykh, Qu!b al-Dīn Mawdūd (d. a.d. 1133), an important fi gure among the early founders of the order in Chisht. He is a venerated saint who at the age of twenty–six, or according to some sources twenty–eight, replaced his father, Khawāja Yūsuf Chishtī, as the leader of the order. Mawdūd is said to have memorized the Qurān by the age of seven. Miracles that are attributed to him include resurrecting the dead and invoking in his disciples visions of the unseen.557 It is known that when Abū Na\"r A\fmad Jām (a.d. 1049–1141), who was a disciple of the famous Abū Saʿīd Abū al-Khayr, reached Herat, Mawdūd went to visit him. He spent three days with this master and received teachings from him.558 Th is is the only travel by Mawdūd that is recorded in the biographical sources. Th e Chishtī sources associate the memory of Mawdūd with that of these Iranian mystics. Shaykh ʿAbd al-Ra\fmān Chishtī (d. a.d. 1683), the author of the biographical dictionary Mirʿat al-Asrār (Mirror of Secrets) ranked A\fmad Ghazzālī and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt among the principal teachers of the Chishtī order and placed them and Qu!b al-Dīn Mawdūd in the same category as the fourteenth generation of divine men aft er the Prophet. 556 Tamhīdāt, sec. 85, p. 63.

At one place in the Tamhīdāt ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt counts a person named Mawdūd among his Shaykhs, but he does not explain if he is Qu!b al-Dīn Mawdūd Chishtī. He identifi es Mawdūd as an important Shaykh next to Shaykh Baraka, A\fmad Ghazzālī, and Mu\fammad Ghazzālī. Th is is the only time that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt mentions the name Mawdūd, which could indicate that although Mawdūd was an important member of ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s milieu, he was among them so infrequently that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt did not mention him as oft en as the others. Mawdūd was a popular name in medieval Ghazna and Herat.559 Th e Mawdūd of the Tamhīdāt was probably from that region rather than the Arab-speaking world, because he spoke Persian and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt remembered him by a verse of Persian poetry that he frequently recited. Th is evidence supports the argument that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was probably referring to Qu!b al-Dīn Mawdūd Chishtī, from the region of Transoxania. In the introduction to Shar\u0005 Tamhīdāt, ʿA!ā \u000eussain reads the reference to Mawdūd as proof that Qu!b al-Dīn Mawdūd is the individual in focus.560 Th e present study, however, remains cautious about drawing defi nitive conclusions based on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s reference since biographical dictionaries and writings by other Chishtī mystics do not speak about contact between Qu!b al-Dīn Mawdūd and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt Hamadhānī. However, absence of recorded information on this subject does not refute its possibility for Mawdūd could very well have traveled westward to Iran, met with A\fmad Ghazzālī and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, and from there proceeded to Mecca on the same route that many of his predecessors had taken. Th e following will address the reference in the Tamhīdāt in light of these considera tions. Tamhīdāt, similar to Mirʾat al-Asrār, lists ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, Mawdūd, and A\fmad Ghazzālī together as the spiritual elite of its discourse. It describes them as the rāsikhūn fī al-ʿilm, or the fi rm authorities on the knowledge of God: the ones who observe the light of Mu\fammad and Satan and express their visions through poetry. Against this background, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt introduces Mawdūd as his shaykh and even elevates him above Mu\fammad Ghazzālī when he explains that 559 It was a name that was used in the Ghaznawīd court in that region. Mawdūd was the son of Masʿūd ibn Ma\fmūd ibn Sabuktakīn. 560 Gīsūdarāz, Shar\u0005 Zubdat al-\baqāʾīq, p. 5."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"chapter six204he knew about the special relationship of A\fmad, Mawdūd, and Baraka with God earlier than he perceived Mu\fammad Ghazzālī is also one of them.

He explains that there is a place on the path when the wayfarer sees God in his heart as he sees himself in the light of God. At this juncture, the distinction between the lover and the beloved is obliterated. Poetry and samāʿ are eff ective mediums for cultivating the heart to accept this light. In order to further clarify this point ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt cites the following verse by A\fmad Ghazzālī:563O God, the mirror of your beauty is this heart.Our soul is rose petal and your love like the nightingale.In the beauty of your light I see myself without a selfTh us in this world every one’s intent is he himself.Th ese lines, an interpretation of the \u0005adīth “Th e believer is the mirror of the believer” (al-mūʾminu mirātu’l-mūʾmina), provide the occasion for ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt to reiterate that A\fmad Ghazzālī, Mawdūd, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt himself, and his other shaykhs, saw themselves and each other refl ected in the mirror of their hearts. Th eir self-identifi cation with one another and with God had a qualitative eff ect on their perception of the unseen in which they saw their oneness with and separation from God. Th is kind of understanding earned them the title rāsikhūn fī al-ʿilm because they were set on the path of constantly striving for a higher truth that removed them from their stance of separation and took them closer to union.

Th is poem and the other stanzas that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt employes in this section of the Tamhīdāt are the center of action that highlight the signifi cance of samāʿ for these mystics. Another important verse is the one that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt says his Shaykh Mawdūd was in the habit of repeating. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt lists this verse immediately aft er the poem by Ghazzālī.564Our Shaykh Mawdūd repeated this verse oft en:If the ascetic reaches the beauty of that visageWe can reach the district [of the beloved] with just one cry of hūyHe identifi es Mawdūd as his Shaykh but does not specify if he heard Mawdūd directly, heard about his ways from others, or met him in his visions and dreams.

Mawdūd’s name is brought up a second time in the Paris manuscript copy of the Tamhīdāt.565 Th e phrase, “our Shaykh Mawdūd” identifi es him as the subject of passage number sixty–seven on heresy, the black light of Satan, and meditation through prayer.566 Th is passage immediately follows a verse that depicts God dancing as in samāʿ, raising His hands in a gesture that the lover interprets to be a calling on him. God is heard saying that He is not inviting the lover; it is His way to move about in this manner.567 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt coordinates the memory of Mawdūd sequentially with the image of God in the kind of jubilation that the wayfarer experiences in samāʿ. He depicts the Mawdūd of the 564 Ibid., sec. 367, p. 282. 565 Ibid, p. 48n10. ʿU\"ayrān observes this note in his manuscript edition. His observation is noted by A\fmad Mujā\fid.

Wearing the garb of the infi del (zunnār), he decides to follow the route that will take him closer to God through infi delity. Similar to ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and A\fmad Ghazzālī, he is ready to dive into himself and sink into the black light of Satan. Aft er Mawdūd comes out of alāt, he proves himself blasphemous by comparing himself with the Prophet.568 O Mu\fammad!

Moreover, the similarity between the verse that is cited in the present context and the one that Mawdūd likes to repeat can be an indication that both passages are referring to the same person. Th e key word in these poems is the “district” (kūy) that the wayfarer wants to reach. Both passages, sixty–seven and two-hunred–eighty–two, are about the way to God through the domain of Satan. Mawdūd’s favorite poem compares the strivings of the ascetics with the vocative utterance hūy, which is orthographically identical with the term “hawā,” meaning fancy and passion.

If the Shaykh that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is referring to is Qu!b al-Dīn Mawdūd, then poetry and samāʿ provide an appropriate occasion for recalling the memory of this Chishtī leader. In conclusion, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt and the mystics of his milieu practiced samāʿ with the understanding that the encounter with Satan was an important stage in reaching true faith in God. Samāʿ was an opportunity to meet and greet Satan, the companion who could tempt mystics astray. He could also challenge them into asserting their stance beyond the chatter of ego toward an internal quiescence where God could be found in the echo of the covenance that pulsates through the soul. Satan was an indispensable adversary who could be employed in navigating the way to God for he knew the way and was intent on barring the seeker passage onto the canopies of the beloved. Th ose who understood this principle and set out searching for Satan in the hidden corners and the expansive valleys of their soul were regarded by Satan as worthy antagonists. A\fmad Ghazzālī boasted about being such a person: a claim for which some scholars of Islam criticized him and accused him of infi delity. Sib! ibn ʿAbdallāh al-Jawzī (a.d. d. 1256) and Sharaf al-Dīn Abū Barakāt ibn al-Mustawfī al-Irbilī (a.d. 1170–1239) reported that Ghazzālī claimed that during his stay in Hamadhān Satan appeared to him and prostrated before him at the hospice where he was residing. Th is certainly refers to the prophetic saying, “my Satan has submitted” (aslama shay\u0007ānī). When Ghazzālī was asked how that could be possible when Satan refused the command of God to prostrate before Adam, he reiterated that Satan repeated the action more than seventy times. Ibn al-Jawzī and al-Mustawfī questioned his faith in God and said that he fabricated this story in order to promote himself.572 Th e meeting with Satan—fi ctitious or actual—illustrates that Ghazzālī’s courageous faith in God compelled Satan to acknowledge this descendent of Adam worthy of his respect. Th ere was a lesson for Satan to learn; through their interactions, Satan approached the moment of creation with the understanding that humankind is the created image of God. Th is incident provides an example for the kind of wayfaring that the seeker could venture as he navigated the atmosphere of samāʿ where Satan was lurking to lure 571 Mawdūd Chishtī was a celebrity in the Deccan and an inspiration to the later Chishtī religious leaders.

Samāʿ was a venture that took the wayfarer on the turbulent waters of his/her soul to a state of internal quiescence. Ghazzālī even gave preference to samāʿ over acts of worship.So the inner nature (sirr) of audition in its various ranks (marātib) comprises the verities of the fi ve pillars; for prayer, pilgrimage, and the two testimonies pertain to external ranks, and fasting and almsgiving to internal ranks; and sometimes a man gets from audition perfections such as are not obtained from persistence in many acts of devotion.573Th e Chishtīs were in accord with Ghazzālī on the subject of samāʿ. Khawāja Gīsūdarāz approved of Ghazzālī and his contemporary Chishtī mystic Qu!b al-Dīn Mawdūd who considered samāʿ to be superior to prayer.It must be noted though, that Gīsūdirāz was very particular about prayers and sharīʿah in general, but he does not seem to have been a man who would take any criticism against samāʿ, in which respect he is comparable to A\fmad al-Ghazālī as seen through Bawāriq al-Ilmāʿ. In the following quotation of Shaykh Mawdūd Chishtī (d. 527/1132), cited approvingly by Gīsūdirāz, a clear implication of preference to samāʿ over prayers is discerned. When asked whether samāʿ was better than prayers, Shaykh Mawdūd Chishtī replied, “ a person prays with all its formalities, but still he is not certain whether his prayers will be accepted, for God might hear them or reject them. For us, samāʿ is one of the “attractions” (jadhbah) of the Merciful (al-ra\u0005mān). Prayer is doubtful in its being heard (qubūh), whereas samāʿ is “acceptance itself” (ʿayn-i qubūl).574Th is perspective on prayer and samāʿ sheds light on ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s description of Mawdūd in the Tamhīdāt where he depicts him in the attire of the infi del, preparing for prayer and the meeting with Satan. His motive is to surrender his tainted humanity in total confi dence to an aff able God who is there, in the ravishing tunes that invoke memories of the homeland and arise in man the longing for the divine. Mawdūd Chishtī had a considerable celebrity in the Deccan and was the subject of a number of miniature paintings. Th e emphasis on the domain of Satan, however, was not an issue in the work of the later generations of the Chishtīs. In the India of Gīsūdarāz, the controversy over samāʿ was formulated in terms of the divisive impact of samāʿ on the integrity of the already small Muslim population of India.575573 Hussaini, Sayyid Mu\u0005ammad Al-\busaynī-i Gīsūdirāz, p. 103. 574 Ibid., p. 127. 575 Ibid., p. 123."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"sam$209Th e confl ict between the ʿUlamāʾ and the sufi s during the Delhi Sultanate (602/1206-962/1555) was mainly focused on the question of samāʿ. Th e Indian ʿUlamāʾ, instead of condemning the institution through treatises and books as was the case in the classical period, tried to put an end to samāʿ gatherings by calling meetings (ma\u0005\tar) before the Sultans. Th ey endeavoured to make the Sultans issue offi cial interdicts against the organizations of samāʿ, but they were never successful.Th e objection was that audition of music was a discord to the “harmonious relationship between the Sufi s and ‘ordinary believers.’”576 Such criticisms did not dissuade the Chishtīs from engaging in samāʿ and institutionalizing it as a major tenet of their order. Gīsūdarāz and Masʿūd Bakk were important authorities in this debate. Like their predecessors, they utilized the teachings of A\fmad Ghazzālī and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt in their writing and developed important discussions in advancing the discourse on samāʿ. Gīsūdarāz remained committed to samāʿ in spite of the threats that were directed against him. His activities provoked Sultan Fīrūzshāh Bahmanī who was informed by members of the ʿulamāʾ that in samāʿ gatherings some people prostrated before Gīsūdarāz. Th e king “... sent word to the Chishtī sufi to hear samāʿ in seclusion (khalwat). Siyar-i Mu\u0005ammadī relates that aft er that Gīsūdarāz listened to samāʿ from inside a room with a curtain separating him from the rest of the listeners.”577 Th is warning demonstrates that the Sultan was politically threatened by the authority and popularity of Gīsūdarāz. He was not only a charismatic religious leader but also an openminded thinker who considered samāʿ permissible for all members of the community irrespective of their religion and creed. Th is is how he used samāʿ as an occasion to foster solidarity among the community members at large, even as the king interpreted it a “threat” to his own popularity and the integrity of the Muslim community.578 Th e early Chishtī scholars joined A\fmad Ghazzālī and ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt to the degree that oft en mention of one was followed by recalling the other.

If you are beyond this, you are neither a believer nor an infi del. If you are below this, you are a Muslim and a polytheist. If you are ignorant of this, you should know that you have no value, and do not deem yourself among the totality of existing things.” Shaykh Abū Saʿīd in the Maābī\u0005 [sic] says: “Th ese words caused me to attain what a lifetime of a hundred thousand years of worship would not.”580 Mu\fammad ibn Munawwar Abī Saʿīd Mayhanī, Asrār al-Taw\u0005īd fī Maqāmāt al-Shaykh Abī Saʿīd, 5th. ed.

Ibn Munawwar explains that these two masters were in correspondence with each other and had the occasion to meet in person in Abū Saʿīd’s town, Meyhana of Khurāsān. Upon their meeting at the hospice of the Shaykh, they withdrew from others and held private council for three days and nights. Avicenna departed aft erward. When each was asked by his students separately about his impression of the other Avicenna replied “Everything I know, he sees!” and Abū Saʿīd said “Everything I see, he knows!” In this manner, they emphasized their access to the body of knowledge that one articulates through knowledge and the other perceives by means of visionary enlightenment.582 Tamhīdāt, sec. 463, p. 349."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"conclusion212Th e Tamhīdāt is clear about ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s views on Avicenna, but ambiguous about the source and the context for Avicenna’s comment. Some scholars have argued that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was mistaken about the authenticity of this exchange between Avicenna and Abū Saʿīd because this passage is not found in any of the surviving manuscript copies of Avicenna’s Risālat al- A\t\u0005awiya, which the Tamhīdāt identifi es as the source. Shafīʿī Kadkanī, the renowned scholar of Islamic mysticism, initially supported the view that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was mistaken about the identity of Avicenna’s addressee and mistook Abū Saʿīd Abū al-Khayr for Abū Saʿd al-Hamadhānī.583 Shafīʿī Kadkanī revisited this statement on the basis of new textual evidence that he and some of his colleagues discovered a few years later. He explained that the exchange attributed to Avicenna and Abū Saʿīd was found verbatim in correspondence between them, which was cited in the Massignon copy of Zubdat al-\baqāʾīq. In the beginning of the passage ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt wrote “It is a memento from our Shaykh A\fmad—may God sanctify his sīrr.” Th is is how ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt identifi ed A\fmad Ghazzālī as the one who brought this passage to his attention.584 Th is new evidence led Shafīʿī Kadkanī to conclude that ʿU\"ayrān’s edition of the Tamhīdāt misread the word ukhrā (another) for a\t\u0005awiya.585 It must be noted that ʿU\"ayrān includes the sentence on Ghazzālī in his edition but places it at the end of the preceding paragraph following a couplet on infi delity on the path of love. Th erefore, ʿU\"ayrān’s reading associates A\fmad Ghazzālī with the couplet and not the exchange between Avicenna and Abū Saʿīd. Reading this passage becomes more complicated as it attributes a text called Maābī\u0005 (Luminaries) to Abū Saʿīd, possibly by error since there are no records to indicate that he authored this treatise. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s reference to Avicenna and Abū Saʿīd is important in illustrating that he was referring to an actual document that was available in his time and known by him and Ghazzālī. Moreover, the attention that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was paying to this topic by placing it in the conclusion of his most important work, 583 Mu\fammad Ri\u0002ā Shafīʿī Kadkanī, “Dar bārih-ye Abū Saʿīd Abū al-Khayr,” Sukhan 19. 7 (1969): 694, 697–98. Th e author argues that ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt was mistaken about the identity of Avicenna’s interlocutor who is probably Abū Saʿd al-Hamdhānī. Moreover, Avicenna did not write the A\t\u0005awiya treatise as a response to the question that Abū Saʿīd Fa\u0002lallāh posed to him. Th e treatise was written for Al-Shaykh al-Amīn Abī Bakr Mu\fammad ibn ʿAbīd. 584 Abī Saʿīd Mayhanī, Asrār al-Taw\u0005īd, vol. 1, pp. 51–52. 585 Ibid., p. 52."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"conclusion213underscores the importance of Avicenna for him. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt evaluated the relationship between Avicenna and Abū Saʿīd to be one in which the mystic was seeking guidance (arshadanī) from the philosopher. Th is emphasizes the regard that he had for the visionary philosophers who stood in immediate vicinity to the stage of knowledge by proximity (al-ʿilm al-ladunnī). Th e philosopher had an advantage over the mystic because of his ability to contemplate and discuss supra-rational realities by means of discursive reasoning, which in the fi nal analysis argued for the limitation of reason. Mu\fammad Qu!b al-Dīn Ishkiwarī (d. a.d. 1088/95) the author of Ma\u0005būb al-Qulūb (Th e Beloved of the Hearts) approached the exchange between Avicenna and Abū Saʿīd in the context of the Qurʾānic allusions. Ishkiwarī argued that “veritable unbelief” fi nds its genesis in the verse “Whoever rejects Evil and believes in Allah,” that vouches for renouncing anything that is other than God.586 He explained that Avicenna’s words “anything except God” mean the corporeal world of transition and chance possibilities. “Notional Islam” is nominal assent to faith as is verifi ed in the verse “We believe.”587 And the “three fi gures” are the people of paradise, the people of hell, and the people of aʿrāf (a place between paradise and hell which resonates with the purgatory of the Christian faith). One who pays heed to these divisions is a believer in God and a non-believer in anything other than Him. One who goes beyond the three fi gures but stops at that point in his quest, is neither a Muslim nor an unbeliever because these defi nitions do not apply to him. But, if he is below the three, he is a polytheist on the grounds that he is submissive and obedient in his belief but turns to other than God in fi nding his faith. Anyone who is ignorant of these divisions is not worthy of mention and consideration.588 A diff erent analysis is provided in a marginal note which appears in one of the copies of the Avicenna/Abū Saʿīd correspondence manuscripts. Th e anonymous commentator explains that Avicenna’s “three fi gures” stand for the stages of belief and heresy that the wayfarer goes through: (1) Muslim and infi del (2) 586 Qurʾān, 2: 256. “Whoever rejects Evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy Handhold, that never breaks.” 587 Ibid., 49: 14. “We believe.” Say, “Ye have no faith: but ye (only) say, ‘We have submitted our wills to Allah,’ for not yet has Faith entered your hearts.”588 Qu!b al-Dīn Ishkiwarī, Avicenna bi Rawāyat-i Ishkiwarī and Ardkānī, translated by A\fmad \u000eusaynī Ardkānī (Tehrān: Intishārāt Amīr Kabīr, 1985), pp. 59–60."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"conclusion214neither a believer nor an infi del, and (3) Muslim and polytheist. He explains, to be simultaneously a Muslim and a polytheist marks the state of consciousness that is known as the Doomsday and al-\u0007āmma al-kubrā (the Great Event) that is mentioned in the Qurʾān. Th e seeker is not going to have any other Doomsday past this stage.589 More specifi cally, the author is describing a stage when the wayfarer experiences his consciousness as the convergence of the absolute acceptance of the word of God (i\u0007lāq) and its repudiation (tafīl).590 Th ese brief remarks by the commentator lead the reader to conclude that the Doomsday of the wayfarer is the uprooting of his understanding where the affi rmation and the renunciation of belief—namely being a Muslim and a heretic simultaneously—are not juxtaposed against each another but are perceived as a confl uence, which the wayfarer joins.591 Avicenna’s discussion points to the transient quality of faith and challenges the view that sees faith as a self-contained concept. It argues for the existence of a paradoxical state of consciousness where faith and its antithesis do not collide but merge. In this state, the unity of God is experienced in His manifestation in all of the existence such that the wayfarer can be deluded into misinterpreting His unity as polytheism. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt is in accord with Avicenna that the wayfarer goes through a process of unlearning the concepts that he has held to be true and perceiving the unity of God as an undiff erentiated manifestation that is not held in sway by either faith or disbelief. In a discussion whose aim is to enlighten the wayfarer on the path to God, both the sharīʿa and the path are abandoned for the murky prospects of a truth so incomprehensible that it can cause the wayfarer to become insane.592On the path of love, unbelief and heresy (tarsāʾī) are betterIn the vicinity of your tavern, infamy is better;Wearing the zunnār instead of the habit of unity, is betterInsanity, insanity, insanity, is better.589 Abī Saʿd Mayhanī, Asrār al-Taw\u0005īd, p. 51. 590 Ibid., pp. 50–51. 591 Carl Ernst, Words of Ecstasy in Sufi sm, p. 82. Ernst compares this letter with a similar letter by \u000eallāj on the subject of infi delity. He points out that Avicenna is referring to “transcendence of the three ‘individualities (shukhus),’ probably meaning the three ‘persons’ of grammar, and hence, all multiplicity; acceptance of these distinctions is equivalent to dualistic idolatry.” 592 Tamhīdāt, sec. 463, p. 350."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"conclusion215Avicenna is remarkable because he is able to perceive this insanity and yet use rational discourse to describe it to others. In several places in his writing, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt reiterates that the wayfarer’s experience of God is too complex to be rendered as pantheism or polytheism. He explains, just as we know that God is with us in all manifestations of existence, we remain unaware of the quality of His proximity to us. In other words, our restricted and restrictive human understanding prevents us from comprehending the consciousness of God. Th erefore, when we experience God in dimensions where reality is too paradoxical to be comprehensible, we are tempted to misconstrue our witnessing in the familiar pantheistic or polytheistic terms. Th is is the case with faith and heresy as they are discussed beyond the dictums of religion. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt emphasizes that religion is meant to respond to the human condition, which is dominated by the body and the corporeal mode of existence. A person who sheds the body, in death or in special realms of consciousness, perceives the irrelevance of religious dictates to his altered state of consciousness. At this juncture, he is directed by his heart and his soul in perceiving the meaning of the Doomsday and the apocalypse: “the day when earth is transformed into something other than itself and so is the fi rmaments.”593 Th e hour is reached beyond the three fi gures of Avicenna which stand for the spectrum from the believer to the polytheists who include the Greek philosophers, the Indian sects, and the atheists. When one’s consciousness is linked to the consciousness of God, he perceives faith and infi delity to be the manifestations of the same reality. Gīsūdarāz Chīshtī provides valuable insight on this discussion in his commentary of the Tamhīdāt. He explains that the exchange between Avicenna and Abū Saʿīd indicates that entry into veritable unbelief has two meanings. It means that the seeker reaches the truth and has an interpretation of it. However, his understanding of the truth is heretical, and incompatible with the sharīʿa. Th e other meaning is that the seeker enters a truth, which is void of division, multiplicity, defi nition, and allusion. He perceives this truth as his con sciousness joins it. But as he becomes conscious of it and tries to defi ne it, he fi nds himself articulating heresy. In other words, the union is overshadowed with duality. In this manner, Avicenna describes veritable unbelief as an activity of perceiving the truth, which is equivalent to the seeker’s 593 Qurʾān, 14: 48."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"conclusion216experience of his self-identity. Gīsūdarāz identifi es the three fi gures to be the angelic realm (malakūt), the highest heaven (jabrūt), and the divine realm (lāhūt). He adds that some mystics like Ibn ʿArabī could only advance this far into the unseen. In contrast, Avicenna identifi es realms beyond these three, which are unimaginably abstract and remote from conceptualization. A mystic who is below the three fi gures is a Muslim in having his heart set on God and in not engaging in idolatry, and a polytheist on the grounds that his attention is set on himself and his self-identifi cation through the actions (afʿāl), motions (\u0005arakāt), and rests (sakanāt), that he experiences in accosting God. Th e mystic who reaches the realms past the three fi gures, is dissociated from notional Islam and the superfi cial norms of religiosity. Such a person is both a Muslim and a non-believer on the grounds that he has arrived at such depths in the unseen but is still far from the truth of the truth. In this context, unbelief is a beacon on the path that directs the wayfarer toward the next destinations. Th is is how unbelief fi nds its genesis in the truth. When Abū Saʿīd pays homage to Avicenna on account of his insights, he is either referring to witnessing an existence whose being overtakes the wayfarer and the act of witnessing, or he is speaking about a mode of perception that the mystic identifi es with. Drawing attention to these two possibilities, Gisūdīrās makes a distinction between the visionary and the contemplative modes of perceiving unbelief and the truth. Th ese truths are reached through death. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s approach to death is such that he considers both living and thinking to be constituents of death. He argues that life and death are not separable by the ceasing of one’s heart beat. Death is an elevated state of consciousness that can be experienced by the mystic at the same time as he is anchored in a living body. In his writing, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes an exalted out-of-body experience, which he refers to as mystical death. While in this state, the wayfarer is not unalive: he is in a state incorporating both life and death and yet undefi nable by conventional understanding of the two. Mystical death is the stage of experience that reveals the transparency of perception on the Doomsday. Th is coming in contact with death is a response to time. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, similar to his mentor A\fmad Ghazzālī, contemplates time as a grappling between the time of the lover (time temporal) and that of the beloved (durationless time). ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes his understanding of time as the event of the Doomsday and as the"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"conclusion217perception of the lights that the wayfarer experiences.594 Th rough death, the wayfarer penetrates into the unseen seeking union with the beloved. Th ere he sees the secrets of the Doomsday because he has passed through the veils that conceal the “hour.” For ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, the Doomsday of the wayfarer is the day that he has risen against himself and embraced the end of time. Th at is the day when the secrets of his heart are laid open and he perceives them through his transcended consciousness.595 Mystical death creates a rupture in the consciousness that relativizes life and death as well as ones identity. Th is detached consciousness has progressed beyond thinking, through death, through—even—the apocalypse. Mystical death is a state of mind, a mode of beyond-thought that perturbs any pre-conceived notion of cognition and self-identity. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt conveys this consciousness in terms of the lights that he has observed in the unseen. In the Tamhīdāt, aft er describing human beings and the creation through an epistemology of lights, he ex plains:596But, O friend, know that if they want to allow a man into himself and enlighten him into his own self, he will gain sight: “And if you obey him you will be on the right path.”597 It is thus that the illumination of the Light of God gives man eyes, and ears, and tongue. “By him was I 594 Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, p. 95. Consider for instance the passage below in Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, from the section entitled Th e Nature of Doomsday Is Hidden in Relation to Human Knowledge.Know that the Hour is inside the veils of the heavens and the earth, and it bears the same relation in regard to these veils as the fetus bears to the womb of his mother. For this reason, the Hour will occur only when “the earth has shaken to its extreme,” [Qurʾān, 99:1] and the sky has opened asunder and the stars have been eff aced, and the sun has fallen, and the mountains have moved and the loaded she camels left unattended, [Qurʾān, 81: 1–4] and the contents of graves have scattered, and the contents of the hearts made manifest [Qurʾān, 100: 9–10]. To sum up, “the day when earth is transformed into something other than itself and so is the fi rmaments” [Qurʾān, 14: 48]. So, as long as the wayfarer is outside the veils of the earth and the heavens, the Hour does not happen to him. For, the Hour is only inside the veils because God is inside the veils and to Him belongs the knowledge of Hour. As he—God’s blessing and peace be upon him—says: “Th e Hour will not occur while on the face of earth there is anyone who says `there is no God but God.” Th is means: as long as a man remains outside the veils, the Hour is hidden from his knowledge; but as soon as he passes these veils on his path and becomes grounded in enjoying the presence of Ideas, the secret of the Hour becomes disclosed to him.595 Tamhīdāt, sec. 427, pp. 325–26. 596 Ibid., sec. 354, pp. 270–71.597 Qurʾān, 24: 54."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"conclusion218hearing, and seeing and speaking and by me he hears and by me he sees and by me he speaks,” are descriptions of the attributes that adorn the wayfarer. At this stage he has gone past the earth and the heavens and slough off his self and his humanity and has seen “yet, when we want, we can change, entirely, the like of them.”598 He has arrived at “the day when earth is transformed.”599 He has inhaled the scent of “who has known his self,” and tasted the wine of “has known his lord.” “Indeed, God created Adam aft er the visage of mercy” has appeared to him. “Th e merciful is established on the throne,”600 is disclosed to him. “Governing the aff airs from the heavens to the earth”601 is actualized to him. “God all mighty is descending,” has become manifested to him. With zeal, he has set on in the world of “the enactment of their temperament is through the qualities of God.” He has attained “they became recipients of divine attributes.” And “the believer is a mirror for another believer” has brothered him.As this passage indicates, insight through death results from a direct and individual experience; it involves desiring and willing death on the part of the wayfarer and being taken in on the other side. Th is relies on the will to step into another reality—death—whose preliminary move is to part with one’s self and to examine the self. Th is experience incorporates the cognizance of the self-identity in relation to the unseen (ghayb) as well as the relation between the body and the soul as the individual wayfarer experiences it. Th e narrator in the Tamhīdāt recalls and records life in terms of death, and death in terms of life. Th e writing in the Tamhīdāt is thus the juncture of eternity and also the presence expressed most vividly in the technical language of lights.602 ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt has observed the lights in the realm of death that have derived from within his own heart. His perception of these lights pivots on the relation between external light and the non-compared light of God in his station in the quest: his degree of self-knowledge of 598 Ibid., 76: 28. 599 Ibid., 14: 48. 600 Ibid., 20: 5. 601 Ibid., 10: 3. 602 Mu\fammad S.

Th e encounter with the self and the unknown is as personal and unique as a person’s death can be. ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt states the varied complexities of this individuality through his teaching that each mystic’s path is distinct from others to the extent that insanity and blasphemy in some can be taken as the true measure of faith.603 Th is death, daring, and love is an act of faith beyond reason. When the wayfarer arrives at the threshold of death he must part with his body and willfully enter the unknown. Th e initiation into death requires the exercise of the mystic’s individual and personal ability to overcome his attachment to the body and its security: the security of form as a familiar container—a frame and a shield, outlining one’s dimensions in time and in space. Th is existence means separating one from the others: in this case, death. Leaving the body behind characterizes the stage when the wayfarer overcomes being anchored in the body. Rending the soul free from the body involves suspense as the soul is outside the body while hovering in close proximity to it. Th is suspense occurs in the moments aft er the soul has left the body but can still think in corporeal terms, in relation with the body. Fear (khawf) is an anticipated reaction in this state. Th e apprehension of the unknown and the fear of not returning back into the body and dying an untimely death permeate this threshold. Th e wayfarer grapples with death and annihilation (fanāʾ) at diff erent stages in the journey as he roams the unseen and participates in its mysteries by interacting with the lights of Mu\fammad and Satan. Th ese lights represent the created world as emanations of God.604Th e conclusion of what is being said is that God is the essence and light the contingency; and essence never is nor shall be without accident.

In ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt’s interpretation of the Doomsday, heaven and hell are described in their relationship with one’s ability to see the beloved.605So, it becomes clear what is heaven and what is hell. Th at elder thus said: “Love is the path and the sight of the beloved is heaven but separation is fi re and torment.” He said that the love of God is the religion of the lover, and seeing the beloved his heaven, being far from Him is his inferno. Th is, also, is entirely within the self.Here ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt describes a kind of seeing that defi nes the Doomsday of perception. Hell is where one cannot see the beloved, and heaven is being in his presence. In this manner, ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt contemplates the process of separation and union, the move in the direction of truth, and the reality of unity in terms of death and the language of lights.606 He explains, one’s identity (anāʾiyatuhu) issues from his separations from his self at diff erent stages of the death journey. One’s identity, death and visions of the beloved, involve many levels of discovery or “unveiling.” He explains that the wayfarer can see the unseen not with the eyes of reason but, similar to the Prophet Mu\fammad, with his inner sight (ʿayn al-baīra). Th is kind of seeing is an act of faith and an essential step on the path toward God. Sight is associated with the vision of God almighty and the apocalyptic vision of His wrath and mercy on the day of judgement. Th e act of seeing, the seen, the sight of the Judgement Day, revelation, and the person of the wayfarer are all brought together in a place of no place: the heart of the wayfarer. Th ere, both time and space cease being and the truth is manifest in eternity. For ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt, the secrets of the Doomsday become visible to whomever traverses the distance between life and death, goes beyond the confi nes of understanding toward the unseen and the unknown, and ultimately, fi nds repose in His presence. Th e truth is encountered 605 Ibid., sec. 384, p. 292. 606 Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, pp. 91–92:"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"conclusion221in degrees in a special state of consciousness that is inconceivable unless it is personally lived. Th e truth is where light ceases being a modality in observation. Th e truth is perceived beyond Mu\fammad and Satan who represent the attributes of God: the truth is past good and evil in the direction of His essence. Th is realization brings ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt closer to his understanding of his own humanity and his understanding of man through death. It did not, unfortunately, bring understanding to the men who sat in judgement of him in 1131."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"appendix222"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"appendix223APPENDIX Letter 98ʿAyn al-Qu\u0002āt addressed the following letter to an unidentifi ed person who criticized him for appealing to his captors for release from the prison in Baghdad.607550 – I read the consolation that came from the great and endeared brother, may God prolong his longevity and make his end more blessed than his worldly life. My soul received abundant peace and comfort from it. I welcomed those elegant words and subtle meanings wholeheartedly and these verses came to my mind:Your letter arrived, it is colorfulIt made me vivacious with joy.Th e gardens, when they saw your letter, withered with envyTh e pearl dissolved abashed by its eloquenceI fi lled my ears with passages from itUntil I covered its lines with kisses551 – I did not want to leave a few points unattended, may God out of His graciousness keep us against errors. First: you were astonished by the description of the longing for the homeland; had you studied these chapters in their entirety you would not have found room for this objection. In a similar vein, Balāl al-\u000eabashī, may God be pleased with him, and the Prophet, praise be upon him, yearned for the mountains and the streams of Mecca. Th is is what we understand from the apparent qualities. In addition, your objection that in my diction, I was verbose and rhetorical rather than unrestricted, is exactly true; your words speak my heart. Indeed, the best poetry is the most untrue and the verbose is the twin of the poets.608 Th at is why I renounced 607 “Letter 98,” in Maktūbāt, 2: 355–63.608 Arabic uses the word shuʿarā rather than al-shāʾarīn as the plural for shāʿir. Th e choice of this form here can indicate a mistake on the part of the scribe whose native language is, ultimately, Persian. Or it can be a pun indicating “those who feel,” which is the exact meaning of the word al-shāʿarīn."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"appendix224both of them and admitted that the perfection of both of these craft s is that which is adorned with deceit. When the wayfarer understands the harm in lying, he will cease doing it. Th at is all! 552 – Your letter had also said that patience is the behest of the noble. Th is is true; however, cultivating and acquiring knowledge is a diff erent matter. Just as being described by distinguished attributes and being dissociated from abject qualities, is a diff erent world all to itself. My aim is to acquire knowledge of asceticism, patience, unity, trust, content, surrender, resignation, and aff ection. But, I am indeed far from the reality of these attributes. Blind-folded I can read the writings of this groupI want to reach and greet them, but I cannotI love the righteous but I am not among themWould that God grant us righteousness553 – However since I am not one of them, I follow aft er them. If I cannot buy a jar of sugarAt least I turn the fl ies away from the jarIndeed, the people of the truth have said:Even if you weigh two thousand measures of wineUnless you drink of it, you cannot be intoxicated As for the saying, one who loves a people is one of them, that also is marvelous. When the beloved is out of reach, the lover has no choice but to be acquainted with her domain. Th ose who stand guard and protect your district and dwellingAre indeed sovereign over me, since they carry your scent554 – O you brave young man! It is deception, when I am not patient but claim patience. If I have claimed knowledge, I have done so by way of my humanity not by way of chivalrous men. If I have claimed [knowledge] in Zubdat al-\baqāʾiq, which I composed ten years ago, either I was deceitful and ignorant in all my lengthy and elaborate discussions or at that time I enjoyed a state that is no longer with me. Th erefore, that was correct in relation to that time only. Th e issue now is in relation to the present time. And of course, the mystic lives at the moment, only. In every breath he only states and strives for that which is real at the moment.

Should one remain silent, then it is interpreted as a confession of heresy and of disbelief. Should one speak, then the listener should have a thousand ears. Alas, how strange! Verse:Th ere is no one like the wretched meWho is disheartened by both seeing and not seeing youIn spite of this, they should not make any complaints because this longing is a long journey. How can one who objects understand my intention by intimating Alwand and Māwashān? Peace be upon him who said: How well did Zaynab hide her love from the people?556 – A group of travelers saw Bāyazīd grabbing on to the knob on the door of the kaʿba. Th ey said: did you leave your lord in Bistām? If he is yearning for Bistām, how can they understand what kind of point it is: When I saw the tears, [I knew that] the tears revealed and betrayed me Th ey increased and added sadness to my sadnessI left all, but you, in their suspicionsI covered the face of love with loveIf Moses, peace be upon him, yearned for mount Sinai, his yearning was not for dirt and pebbles. And if in the eternal Qurʾān he takes a vow on these two mountains, the Fig and the Olive (al-tīn wa al-zaytūn) that vow is not on the earth and stones.609 Alas, no one except the lovers can understand the mysteries of love.When you come turn your eyes to other than usSo they would assume that love is where you are looking It takes someone with the qualities of Ibn ʿAbbās who can understand that taking such a vow is neither on the dirt nor the stones, nor day, 609 Qurʾān, 95: 1–3."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"appendix226nor night, and the stars. I swear by the night, the day, the sun, and the forenoon, indeed by the lord of all these.557 – Dear friend! Be aware! Do not treat lightly the words of the lovers. “Th ere is, in their stories, instruction for men endowed with understanding.”610 Behold, they are talking about Jacob. Do you think “And his eyes became white with sorrow. And he fell into silent melancholy”611 is because of his separation from Joseph or for something else? If he was suff ering this pain on account of Joseph then since it is permissible for the prophets to suff er such a pain, the entire world is justifi ed in its longing for the friend. “How great is my grief for Joseph!”612 Th is sigh means a diff erent world of meaning for the Lord of love. In fact, that pain was not on behalf of Joseph. Joseph was a sign for another aff air. Th erefore, objections are not admissible. One should look at Alwand and Māwashān, and the tales of the lovers, with appreciation. Th is pain and complaint are not entirely about Hamadhān; they are about something else. Prison, is separation from the beloved; release, is fi nding the beloved. 558 – Here, I am not referring to myself. Nonetheless, I will say it, even though it is befi tting if someone else talks about it so objections cannot be raised against him. Th ere are many stations in love where the lover’s complaints and pleads are pleasing to the beloved but not his patience. No one knows this but the lover. And not just anyone knows the extent of the world of love.Th e universe of love is vast, and your bosom is narrowTh e tale of love is long, and out of your reachDo not forget that a grand master dismissed the patience that \u000eussayn Man\"ūr \u000eallāj, may God be pleased with him, was enduring in his affl iction. He said: A youth who is settled in his folly says, “Patience! Rely on God.”559 – O friend! You had written to me that an issue is not set aright with faint zeal and verbose decrees. I swear on the great God, that is indeed the case. Praise be upon him [who said]: O soul, love is forbidden to the unrighteous. Love and self-affl icted-humility have always existed together.
