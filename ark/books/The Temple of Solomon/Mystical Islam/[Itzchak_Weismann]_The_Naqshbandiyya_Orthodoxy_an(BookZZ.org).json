Its strength lies in its characteristic combination of strict adherence tothe divine law and active involvement in social and political affairs.The book begins with an examination of the place and unique features ofthis brotherhood within the larger Sufi movement, and Islam in general. Itthen traces its historical evolution through three main phases, each domin-ated by one offshoot: the original Naqshbandiyya of Central Asia, theMujaddidiyya which sprang from India, and the Khalidiyya, which wasformed in the Ottoman lands and reached the remotest corners of theMuslim world – the North Caucuses, Siberia, and Indonesia, as well asWestern Europe and North America. The final chapters examine modernIslamic thinkers and movements that had roots in the Naqshbandiyya andthe Naqshbandi masters and branches that have adopted new strategies tocope with the challenges of modernity and postmodernity.This fully illustrated study presents a broad synthesis of the history of theNaqshbandiyya throughout the eight centuries of its existence, and analysesits basic principles and the teachings of its outstanding masters.

This interest has largely been due to the realization that in the eightcenturies or so of its existence masters affiliated with the Naqshbandi trad-ition, and with its major successive Mujaddidi and Khalidi offshoots, timeand again acquired positions of influence with the rulers of the day andwithin their respective communities. Such outstanding political and socialinvolvement has been employed by scholars not only to discredit the onceprevalent view about the decline of latter-day Islam, but also to demonstratethat Sufism played an important role in framing the Muslim world’s responseto modernity. A perusal of the vast literature produced within the Naqshbandi traditionitself reveals that the major preoccupation of its masters was rather to dem-onstrate the conformity of their mystical teachings and practices to the pre-cepts of Islamic law – the shari‘a. From their point of view, the urge forsocial and political activism was thus embedded in a general orthodoxframework. The basic compatibility of Sufism and orthodoxy was stressedby many a Muslim thinker throughout the ages, not least among them theillustrious eleventh-century mystical theologian Abu Hamid al-Ghazali,while Shadhili, Khalwati, and innumerable other brotherhoods exhibitedactivist traits in certain periods of their history. None, however, combinedand implemented the two tenets in so consistent a way as did the masters ofthe Naqshbandiyya. These emphatically orthodox bent and activist thrust were complementedin the Naqshbandi tradition by missionary zeal that resulted in the expan-sion of the brotherhood out of its original homeland in the Bukhara oasis toever-more distant lands. The same combination underlies its remarkableadaptability in the contemporary era of globalization, making it a veritableworldwide phenomenon. Today Naqshbandi branches are to be found inmost parts of the Muslim world – Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, theMiddle East, the Caucasus, and the Far East, but also in Western Europeand North America.xii"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The academic literature on the Naqshbandiyya is vast and constantlygrowing. An important landmark in the study of the brotherhood was around table conference held in Sèvres in May 1985, the proceedings of whichwere subsequently published in a voluminous book. This collection beginswith two articles by Hamid Algar, the person who has done more than any-one else to focus our attention on the Naqshbandiyya. The first piece is anoverview of the history of the brotherhood; the second piece is an assess-ment of the work accomplished in Naqshbandi studies up to that point.Algar’s conclusion that much “remains to be filled in the scholarly investiga-tion not only of Sufism but also. . . the history of the numerous lands wherethe Naqshbandiyya has taken root,” still largely holds today. Yet, thanks tothe meticulous studies undertaken by him and numerous other scholars sincehe penned those words our knowledge of the history and work of differentNaqshbandi masters and branches in their respective environments hasadvanced remarkably. This scholarly endeavor has yielded several books,dozens of dissertations, and literally hundreds of articles dispersed in theprofessional journals. Twenty years after the Sèvres conference it is time totake stock of the new wealth of detail and reformulate in its light our overallpicture of the Naqshbandi tradition.This book is an attempt – informed by the insights I have gained duringmy own almost two decades’ study of different aspects of the Khalidioffshoot, as well as travels to the Naqshbandi centers in Uzbekistan,India, Turkey, China, and Indonesia – to integrate this large body ofresearch within one analytical narrative. For practical reasons I have con-fined myself to works in the three major Western languages: English,French, and German, along with fundamental primary sources in Persianand Arabic. Such an enterprise is meant for both the professional scholar,who should benefit from a critical overview of the Naqshbandi traditionto further his/her more specific studies, and for the informed readerwho wishes to know Islam beyond its current militant manifestations.To make the text accessible to as wide a readership as possible Ihave reduced the use of professional terms to the minimum. For instance,I have usually preferred master to shaykh or pir, brotherhood or tradition totariqa, etc.Still, the present undertaking is designed neither as a general survey of thehistory and teachings of the Naqshbandiyya nor as a detailed account of allits masters and lines of transmission in every age and place. More specific-ally, I wish to avoid the pitfall of a simplistic presentation of the evolution ofthe brotherhood as the unfolding of some essential characteristics, which toodetached a view might engender, but also not to lose sight of its basic iden-tity and continuity by close-ups on its contingent manifestations. Taking amiddle course, as it were, this book offers a multi-faceted analysis of theinteraction between the evolving trajectory of the Naqshbandi traditionthroughout the ages and its spiritual-religious teachings and rites. ReadersPREFACExiii"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"seeking to locate specific masters are referred to the diagrams of lineagesdispersed through the text.The main source for the study of the Naqshbandiyya is by far theextremely abundant Naqshbandi literature itself, which bears out its claim toembody the most learned tradition of all Sufi brotherhoods. This literaturemay be divided into two major categories, though in practice these are oftenjuxtaposed in the same works. One category is the biographical literature,either in the form of collective dictionaries which record the lives, sayings,and miraculous deeds of Naqshbandi masters in different periods andplaces, or as monographs dedicated to exceptionally outstanding individuals.The other category comprises works dealing with Naqshbandi teachings andpractices, including discourses of the great masters as recorded by their dis-ciples, collections of letters, manuals of conduct, polemical expositions and,more recently, pamphlets, cassettes, and websites. These primary sources aresupplemented by information gleaned from outside sources such as generalbiographical dictionaries and scholarly rosters, opponents’ writings, chron-icles and material evidence, archival documents, travelers’ accounts, mediareports, and personal observations. This wealth of material allows us to reconstruct in a fairly detailed mannerthe history and teachings of the Naqshbandiyya. Still, when employing thevarious sources one must also be aware of their deficiencies. One suchdeficiency concerns the nature of the Naqshbandi sources on which ourinvestigation so much depends. As part of the Muslim biographical trad-ition, Naqshbandi authors tend to focus on the “great men” of theirbrotherhood and to depict them as they ought to have been rather than asthey actually were. This “ideal-hero” kind of writing is amplified in the Suficase, in which the divine wisdom and miraculous deeds of the masters areoften brought to the fore at the expense of their daily conduct, social rela-tions, and economic bases. Such biases necessitate a critical reading of theNaqshbandi writings, crosschecked where possible against independentsources to shed additional light on the personalities of the masters, andinformed by an interdisciplinary approach to uncover the institutional andpopular dimensions within which their activities were conducted.Another deficiency of our source material is its uneven availability, whichcreates conspicuous imbalances in our knowledge about the different stagesin the evolution of the Naqshbandi tradition. This shortcoming derives notonly from the general diminution of information with the regression of time,but also from recent historical circumstances. Research into the originalphase of the Naqshbandiyya was seriously impeded by Central Asia’s longsubjection to Soviet rule; we are only now beginning to tap into the vastsources collected in libraries, such as the al-Biruni Institute in Tashkent,which became available to scholars after Uzbekistan won independence in1991. We know more about the second phase of the Naqshbandiyya, whichwas dominated by the Mujaddidi offshoot of India, though here againPREFACExiv"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"information is rather fragmentary and tends to concentrate on the work ofits towering figures, most notably the founder, Ahmad Sirhindi. We are in afar better position to assess the third phase, which followed the establishmentof the Khalidiyya in the Ottoman Empire and its Middle Eastern successorstates, as well as modern religious movements that sprang out of theNaqshbandiyya.This book has nine chapters. The opening chapter considers the basicfeatures that have defined Naqshbandi identity and secured its continuity onthe one hand, and the place of the brotherhood within the larger Sufi andIslamic traditions on the other. The rest of the book follows a historicalscheme. The inner division of the chapters is determined by the relevantbranches: the original Naqshbandiyya, the Mujaddidiyya, and theKhalidiyya. The period in which each of the branches was dominant is dealtwith by two consecutive chapters. Chapters 2 and 3 study the emergence ofthe Naqshbandiyya out of the Khwajagan tradition and its consolidation(thirteenth to sixteenth centuries). Chapters 4 and 5 focus on the Mujad-didiyya (sixteenth to eighteenth centuries) and its competition with theoriginal Naqshbandiyya. Chapter 6 is dedicated to the Khalidiyya (nine-teenth century to the present), and Chapter 7 examines the continuingevolution of the older branches at the same period. The last two chapters ofthe book turn to modern Islamic thinkers and movements with roots in theNaqshbandiyya. Chapter 8 discusses early responses from within thebrotherhood to the challenge of modernity, while Chapter 9 moves toexplore the adaptation of various branches in the contemporary setting. Thebibliography presents an attempt to compile an exhaustive list of works onthe Naqshbandiyya in the Western languages mentioned above, along withbasic Naqshbandi, Mujaddidi, and Khalidi texts that have been consultedfor this study. PREFACExv"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"1THE CORE AND CONTOURS OF ASUFI BROTHERHOODThe origins of the Naqshbandiyya lie in the mystical tradition of the GreatMasters – the Khwajagan – which flourished during the thirteenth throughsixteenth centuries in the oases of Central Asia. From there it spread west-ward to Anatolia, eastward to what is now Chinese Turkistan, and south-ward to the Indian subcontinent. Here at the beginning of the seventeenthcentury it gave rise to its major offshoot, the Mujaddidiyya, which producedits own missionaries. These carried the message to the Turkish and Arablands, as well as back to Central Asia. In the early nineteenth century theKhalidi offshoot of the Mujaddidiyya was established in the OttomanEmpire and further extended the geographical boundaries of the brother-hood to such remote areas as the Caucasus and Indonesia, and later to West-ern Europe and North America. The Naqshbandi tradition looms large atthe background of such diverse modern Islamic movements as the Jadiditrend in the Muslim lands under Russian rule, the Ulama Council in colonialand postcolonial India, and the Salvation Party in Turkey.1Several figures stand out in the vast and ramified Naqshbandi lineage,each epitomizing one phase in its trajectory. The earliest is ‘AbdulkhaliqGhijduwani, who at the turn of the thirteenth century introduced eightprinciples and a silent form of dhikr (rite of recollection) into theproto-Naqshbandi trend of the Khwajagan, thereby setting it on a distinctpath. Most consequential among these principles in the public arena waskhalwat dar anjuman (solitude in the crowd), a paradox implying that thespiritual master should involve himself in the social and political affairs ofhis community. Next is ‘Ubaydullah Ahrar, with whom in the second half ofthe fifteenth century the Naqshbandi brotherhood was consolidated andbecame enmeshed in politics. Ahrar employed especially the spiritual practiceof suhba (accompanying the master) to rally his followers around him.Then, in the seventeenth century, comes the founder of the Mujaddidiyya,Ahmad Sirhindi, who developed the idea of renewal of the millennium (taj-did al-alf) as an intellectual basis for the orthodox and activist proclivities ofthe brotherhood. Sirhindi’s orthodoxy was epitomized in his assertion thaton the Day of Judgment people would be asked about their adherence to the1"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"shari‘a rather than about their mystical affiliation. He was followed in theearly nineteenth century by the founder of the Khalidiyya, Khalid al-Shahrizuri (also al-Baghdadi), who sought to galvanize his offshoot into aneffective socio-religious movement to implement these tenets through a con-centrated form of rabita (binding the heart with the master) and intensivekhalwa (seclusion). Modern thinkers with roots in the Naqshbandi traditioninclude such eminent figures as Shah Waliullah, the hadith scholar of Delhi,Bediüzaman Sa‘id Nursi, the modernist philosopher from eastern Turkey,and Muhammad Rashid Rida, the fundamentalist propagandist based inCairo. These may be regarded as seeking, each in his own peculiar way, toreestablish the balance between the two elements of orthodoxy and activismin the face of the radically altered environment of modernity. Along with these, many other masters feature in the following pages, fromBaha’uddin Naqshband, the eponym of the brotherhood, who added threeprinciples to its spiritual path, to Nazim al-Haqqani, the most active Naqsh-bandi master on the contemporary global scene. Each of these Naqshbandiand Naqshbandi-related masters creatively adapted the tradition he hadinherited from his predecessors to the particular circumstances in which helived and worked: Ghijduwani reacted to the threat posed by the Turkishand Mongol nomads to the sedentary population of the Bukhara oasis;Naqshband sought to renew his legacy once Muslim rule was restored in theregion; Ahrar contended with the havoc generated by the rapid disintegra-tion of Timurid rule in central Asia; Sirhindi set out against the syncretisticFigure 1.1The Naqshbandiyya and its offshoots2THE CORE AND CONTOURS OF A SUFI BROTHERHOOD"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"religion adopted by the Mughal court in India; Khalid responded to theweakening of the Ottoman government and the rising threat from the West;Waliullah, Nursi, and Rida each stood up to the cultural challenges of mod-ernity as they perceived them; and Haqqani accommodates the Sufi path tothe current realities of globalization. One should never forget, however, that the teachings of these masterscould not strike root, nor indeed were they preserved in the collective mem-ory of their communities, without the backing of the innumerable lessermasters and deputies and the multitude of disciples and adherents whothroughout the ages recognized and loved them as saints, flocked to theirlodges, spread their call far and wide, and thus kept the Naqshbanditradition alive in their deeds and in their hearts.The mystical pathThe formation, spread, and adaptation of the Naqshbandiyya is part of thelarger story of the institutionalization and popularization of the mysticalaspect of Islam. The Islamic term denoting a Sufi brotherhood, or any of itsoffshoots, is tariqa, which literally means path or method. From the earliestdays tariqa was the most widely used metaphor for the Sufi quest. Itbranched off from another path, that of the Law – shari‘a (lit. the way to thewater, and by extension the straight path) – and led, by God’s willing, torealization in the Divine or Truth – haqiqa. As an orthodox brotherhood, theNaqshbandiyya emphasizes that the follower of the path must always adhereto the injunctions of the Law and it denounces Sufis who claim to be nolonger bound by them since they have reached the goal. The inner relation-ship between shari‘a, tariqa and haqiqa is vividly expressed by the renownedearly nineteenth-century Hanafi jurist Ibn ‘Abidin, who was affiliated to theKhalidi branch of the Naqshbandiyya:The tariqa and the shari‘a necessitate each other, since the path toGod consists of an external aspect and an internal aspect. Itsexternality is the shari‘a and the tariqa and its internality is thehaqiqa. The internality of the haqiqa in the shari‘a and the tariqa islike the internality of butter in milk. It is impossible to reveal thebutter in the milk without churning it. The aim of the three – theshari‘a, the tariqa, and the haqiqa – is to fulfill the state of servitudeto God.2In describing their experiences along the path, the early Sufis identifieddifferent stations through which they had to pass. These were divided in theirexpositions into two major types: stages (sing. maqam), like renunciation,poverty, and trust in God, which one reaches and maintains by one’s ownstrivings, and states (sing. hal), like vision and certainty, which come and go3THE CORE AND CONTOURS OF A SUFI BROTHERHOOD"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"without control. The last stations on the path are the two complementarystates of love (mahabba) and gnosis (ma‘rifa). They lead to annihilation inGod (fana’) and subsistence in Him (baqa’) in full realization of the divineunity (tawhid). Intoxicated mystics have always rejoiced in the bliss of theannihilation of their self in the One, while sober mystics like the Naqsh-bandis put the stress on their subsistence in order to return to this world andguide others on the same journey.The main instrument for advancement on the mystical path is dhikr – theconstant recollection of God – founded on Qur’anic injunctions such as this:“O believers, remember God oft, and give Him glory at the dawn and in theevening.”3 Meditation on the One through dhikr is most intense duringperiods of seclusion (khalwa), when the external senses are shut and the heartis prepared to receive the divine gift. Along with the usual slow and painstak-ing following of the path (suluk), Sufis recognize the possibility of beingsuddenly and instantly attracted by God (jadhba).4 As we shall see, in theNaqshbandi tradition seclusion is performed in the crowd and divineattraction precedes the following of the path. The various features of the Sufi path were consolidated and systematizedfrom the tenth century on, partly in response to the collapse of the centralauthority of the ‘Abbasid Caliphate and the consequent onset of politicalinsecurity.5 Externalization of the inner experience facilitated the spread ofSufism among the masses and enabled it to provide an alternative basis forsocial order. One aspect in this development was the urge to demonstrate thefundamental orthodoxy of the Sufi tenets, culminating in the comprehensivework of the celebrated theologian and mystic Ghazali. Such endeavorshelped make Sufism acceptable to the religious scholars (‘ulama’) andintegrated it into the main body of religious knowledge.6 Another aspect was the elaboration of a theory of sainthood. This postu-lated a hierarchy of “friends of God” (awliya’, sing. wali), modeled on theexample of Prophet Muhammad and topped by the pole of the age (qutb)and “the seal of saints” – the greatest Sufi of all ages. The terminology wasintroduced into Sufi discourse in the ninth century and was fully elucidatedthree centuries later by Muhyi al-Din ibn ‘Arabi, the Greatest Master, whoclaimed the title of seal for himself. Ibn ‘Arabi’s comprehensive synthesis ofthe mystical sciences of his day was to form the common heritage underlyingthe distinctive paths of the various Sufi brotherhoods, including theNaqshbandiyya.7 Following him Mevlana Jalal al-Din Rumi, the eponymousfounder of the Mevlevi brotherhood (“the whirling dervishes”), gave the Sufivision a profound poetical expression in his unforgettable couplets.8Most significant for the formation of the Sufi brotherhoods, however, wasthe institutionalization of the master–disciple bond. From earliest times Sufisrecognized that spiritual aspirants (sing. murid) need an accomplished guide(Ara. murshid, Per. pir) to direct them through the different stations andpoint out for them the way to union with God. They were also aware of the4THE CORE AND CONTOURS OF A SUFI BROTHERHOOD"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"dangers of deceit, pride, and self-destruction that threaten to lead followersastray not only from the tariqa but even from the shari‘a, and therefore theyattributed absolute authority to the spiritual guide. The central role of theSufi master in the process was grounded in the Prophetic saying (hadith) that“the shaykh in his group is like the Prophet among his people”; his authoritywas epitomized in the complementary saying that “the adept to his shaykh islike a corpse in the hands of a corpse-washer.”9 Naqshbandis in particularpractice as part of their dhikr a form of concentration on the great masters intheir spiritual chain back to the Prophet in order to be blessed by them andto strengthen their souls. This ritual, known as khatm al-khwajagan, includes,according to the early twentieth-century Egyptian-based Naqshbandi masterMuhammad Amin al-Kurdi, the following supplication:Praise be to God, who in the light of His beauty illuminated thehearts of the knowers (‘arifiyin) and in the awe of His majestyburned the heart of the desirers (‘ashiqiyin) and in the subtlety of Hisprovidence built the innermost of the attainers (wasiliyin).

This was followed in the twelfth century by the appearance of Sufibrotherhoods encompassing networks of masters who related to common5THE CORE AND CONTOURS OF A SUFI BROTHERHOOD"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"eponymous founders.11 The masters of each brotherhood elaborated distinctspiritual methods and disciplinary practices. Many of them set up lodges(sing. Ara. zawiya, Tur. tekke, Per. khanqah) to cater to the spiritual as wellas material needs of various levels of society, and they attracted the supportof local rulers.12 In the following centuries the influence of organized Sufismincreasingly grew, spreading from its initial centers in the cities of Iraq andPersia to all corners of the Muslim world.13 Brotherhoods of various sizeand appeal – from the local to the global – covered the Muslim world, someof the most widespread and enduring among them being the all-presentQadiriyya, the Shadhiliyya in North and West Africa, the Rifa‘iyya inthe eastern Arab world, the Shi‘ite Ni‘matullahiyya in Iran, and theNaqshbandiyya in Central Asia, India, and Turkey.The orientalist–fundamentalist paradigm in Sufi studiesThe wide dissemination and considerable influence that the Naqshbandiyya,and other Sufi brotherhoods, have enjoyed throughout the ages run counterto the still widely held view that following a formative or classical periodIslam entered into a prolonged period of decline. This view was advancedwithin the framework of two distinctly modern paradigms. One is the Orien-talist paradigm which, by essentializing Islam as the (inferior) Other, helpedjustify the Western colonial enterprise and continues to inform Westernpolicy makers and Islamic “experts” today; the other is the Islamic funda-mentalist paradigm, which depicts latter-day Muslim tradition as a deviationfrom the exemplary model of the forefathers and a principal obstacle to therenewal of Islamic vigor in the face of the West and the WesternizedMuslims. For A. J. Arberry, a major representative of the Orientalisttradition in Sufi studies, the very emergence of the brotherhoods marked thebeginning of the decline of Sufism:The age of Ibn Farid, Ibn ‘Arabi and Rumi [in the thirteenth cen-tury] represents the climax of Sufi achievement, both theoreticallyand artistically. Thereafter, although through the numerous and evermultiplying Religious Orders the influence of Sufi thought and prac-tice became constantly more widespread, and though sultans andprinces did not disdain to lend the movement their patronage andpersonal adherence . . . the signs of decay appear more and moreclearly, and abuse and scandal assail and threaten to destroy its fairreputation.14The distinct bias in this statement toward the “classical” personal form ofSufi piety and the concomitant downgrading of the social and politicalimport of “post-classical” organized Sufism is reproduced in J. SpencerTrimingham’s Sufi Orders of Islam, the most comprehensive treatment of the6THE CORE AND CONTOURS OF A SUFI BROTHERHOOD"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"subject to date. Trimingham constructed a tripartite scheme of Sufi histori-ography, which somewhat delays its perceived era of decline. Consequent tothe formative period, he distinguishes between a tariqa phase, when initi-atory lines were formed and the authority of the master over his discipleswas consolidated, and the ta’ifa phase in which the brotherhoods were fullyinstitutionalized and the master became an object of popular personal cult.The tariqas began to form in the wake of the Sunni triumph over the Shi‘itedynasties in Baghdad and Cairo during the twelfth century, and their organ-ization was crystallized as ta‘ifas in the fifteenth century, with the growth ofMuslim empires in Persia, Anatolia, India, and North Africa. According toTrimingham, in the last phase, which continues to this day,The orders became hierarchical institutions and their officialsapproached nearer to a clergy class more than any other in Islam,whilst the zawiya was the equivalent of a local church. The sheikhceased to teach directly but delegated authority both to teach andinitiate to representatives (khulafa’, sing. khalifa). A special cult sur-rounded the shaykh’s person, associated with the power emanatingfrom the founder-saint of the ta’ifa; he became an intermediarybetween God and man. If we characterize the first stage, as affectingthe individual, as surrender to God, and the second as surrenderto rule, then this stage may be described as surrender to a personpossessing baraka (spiritual power), though of course embracing theother stages.15A similar picture of corruption and decline emerges from the writings ofIslamic fundamentalists, though obviously for totally different reasons. For‘Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi, an early representative of the Salafi trendin the Arab world, which advocated a return to the example of the piousforefathers of Islam at the expense of latter-day tradition, the variousmanifestations of Sufism in his day were nothing but deviation and unbelief:One has no choice but to declare that the state of the great majorityof Muslims, except in the Arabian Peninsula, is in every respect simi-lar to the state of unbelievers. . . Some of them have exchanged theidols for tombs. They build over them mosques and shrines, installlights and hang veils, and then circumambulate them, kiss and touchtheir pillars, shout out the names of those interred in times of dis-tress, and offer sacrifices to others than God . . . Some peopleassemble to worship God by dhikr, a recollection that is sullied bythe singing of songs of praise and excessive veneration of latter-daypoets in a way that the Prophet forbade even for his own noble self. . . A group of them were not satisfied with the bright Law andinvented injunctions which they called esoteric sciences, the science7THE CORE AND CONTOURS OF A SUFI BROTHERHOOD"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"of Truth, or the science of Sufism. This is a science that the Prophet’scompanions and followers and those living in the early centuries ofIslam knew nothing about . . . And among them are people who haveturned the religion of God into a plaything. They sing, dance, beattambourines and drums, wear green and red, play with fire andweapons, scorpions and snakes, and in this way deceive the commonpeople and scare the stupid ones.16Opposition to the popular aspect of Sufism has never been absent fromthe Muslim public arena. Its two landmarks in the middle period of Islamwere the strictures of the Hanbali theologian Ahmad ibn Taymiyya in thelate thirteenth/early fourteenth century, shortly after the formation of thebrotherhoods, and the puritan Wahhabi movement of the eighteenth andearly nineteenth centuries, when Sufism became almost all-pervasive.17 Criti-cism of unorthodox practices associated with popular Sufism, however, wasmostly articulated from within the Sufi tradition itself, as the case of theNaqshbandiyya amply demonstrates. But Islamic fundamentalists likeKawakibi went far beyond that. Wishing to appropriate the rationalist-scientific discourse of the West, they came to question the central tenets ofthe Sufi tradition, particularly the esoteric sciences and the master–disciplebond. The most radical among the fundamentalists rejected Sufism in toto assheer heresy and a foreign import.18A convenient point to examine the validity of both the Orientalist andfundamentalist paradigms is the period just preceding the advent of modern-ity. Studies of revival and reform movements in Islam during the eighteenthand early nineteenth centuries have shown that the ultra-orthodox Wah-habiyya was rather the exception, while the great majority of these move-ments were actually Sufi. Their activities were known long before Triming-ham, and it has become customary to describe them under the common labelof Neo-Sufism. John O. Voll and Nehemia Levtzion included among thecharacteristic innovations of the pre-modern revival thinkers and movementsa new emphasis on the study of hadith, a shift from a pantheistic interpret-ation of Ibn ‘Arabi’s teaching to a new interest in the transcendentalapproach of Ghazali, stricter compliance with the precepts of the shari‘a,greater involvement in politics and society, and consolidation of the struc-tural organization of the brotherhoods. Prominent among the pre-modernSufi brotherhoods were the Khalwatiyya in Egypt, the African brotherhoodsthat emanated from the Shadhili Sufi scholar Ahmad ibn Idris and, last butnot least, the Naqshbandiyya in India and the Ottoman Empire.19 More recent scholarship, informed by the insights of R. S. O’Fahey andBernd Radtke, has seriously questioned both the common framework andthe innovative thrust implied by the term “neo-Sufism.” Basing themselveson evidence from the western Islamic world, O’Fahey and Radtke were onlyprepared to admit that during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries8THE CORE AND CONTOURS OF A SUFI BROTHERHOOD"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"there were some “organizational innovations of certain Sufi brotherhoods inspecific regions of the Muslim world.”20 Of course, this criticism was in noway meant to diminish the importance of the Sufi aspect of Islam in the pre-modern period. On the contrary, the thrust of the critics’ argument was thatthe characteristics attributed to Sufism in that phase – an orthodox bent,veneration of the Prophet, and sociopolitical activism – were eventually partof the rich and variegated Sufi experience also in the previous generations,down to the very formation of the brotherhoods in the twelfth century.Moreover, it is my contention that Sufism continues to play an importantrole even in the modern era. The unprecedented challenge of secularizedauthoritarian state structures, Western-inspired rationalist discourse, andIslamic fundamentalist critique since the second half of the nineteenth cen-tury have undoubtedly led to a perceptible decline in the traditional forms ofSufism. Yet by the latter part of the twentieth century it had become clearthat many Sufi masters had managed to adapt to the new circumstances,especially by allying with one or another of their adversaries, as well as byskillful use of the modern means of communication. On the other hand, aclose examination of modern Islamic movements and thinkers reveals thatmany of them, Kawakibi included, had roots in the Sufi brotherhoods andappropriated elements from the spiritual and activist Sufi traditions. Onethus can chart a spectrum of modern Islamic organizations, spanning frommoribund Sufi brotherhoods through adaptive branches and fundamentalistmovements that acknowledge their Sufi connection to radical Islamist van-guards that totally reject Sufism. The Naqshbandiyya and its Mujaddidi andKhalidi offshoots have a considerable share in the first three types, and areamong the most adamant opponents of the last.21Naqshbandi identity and continuityIn latter-day Islamic history the signification of the term tariqa was extendedfrom the inner spiritual path or method (suluk), the essence of the Sufi quest,to include the socio-religious organization through which this path wasexternalized, institutionalized, and popularized. In Western languages thismode of organization is commonly rendered as “Sufi order,” despite thegeneral acknowledgment that the term connotes the Christian monasticorders.22 Such a rendering obscures the nature, and ambiguities, of theinternal bonds and external boundaries that together determine the identityof a tariqa on the one hand, and of the ideological mechanisms that defineits continuity over time on the other.To convey these aspects of latter-day Sufism, I prefer to use the two com-plementary terms of “brotherhood” and “line(age),” which respectivelyarticulate its spatial and temporal dimensions. Brotherhood refers to a groupof followers who are united around their master, and by extension with theirentire tariqa, but also, in line with the Qur’anic injunction that “The9THE CORE AND CONTOURS OF A SUFI BROTHERHOOD"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"believers indeed are brothers,”23 with the Muslim community at large.Though admittedly gender-biased, this concept does reflect the dominanceof men in organized Sufism while leaving room for less visible sisterhoods.The second term points to the chain of spiritual transmission (silsila)through which such masters are related to their forebears in the tariqa, andalso, by its projection back to the Prophet, to the overall Muslim history.Organized Sufism, it follows, embraces more than the terms “brother-hood” and “lineage” separately would suggest. In its broadest sense tariqa isbest rendered as “tradition” which, in agreement with Marilyn RobinsonWaldman, I treat “as process – as a modality of change, as a way, but not theway, in which any society can cope with universal problems of human exist-ence, such as legitimacy, authority, and change itself.”24 Dialectically tran-scending “brotherhood” and “lineage” in space-time, the term “tradition”helps us better to grasp the impact of the various branches of theNaqshbandiyya on the course of Muslim religious and socio-political his-tory in which it was enmeshed, and more clearly to perceive the persistenceof Naqshbandi elements among modern post-Naqshbandi thinkers andpopular associations. Two additional remarks concerning the term “tradition” are in place here.First, from my point of view “tradition” and “modernity” not only do notexclude each other, an assertion that has become a platitude in academiccircles;25 in the sense I use it to describe the Naqshbandi experience, “trad-ition” actually encompasses its modern manifestations and transformations.Second, in line with Timothy Mitchell’s observation that “there was no ana-lytic separation in this [pre-modern Islamic] approach between writing andpolitics, or between theory and practice,”26 I consider the literature producedby members of the Naqshbandi brotherhood a constitutive part of its trad-ition rather than its mere representation. This amounts to an attempt tofollow the “objective” history of the Naqshbandiyya “from within,” as anaccumulative “way” of spiritual knowledge and action.More than any of the other major Sufi brotherhoods in Islam, the identityand continuity of the Naqshbandiyya seem to rest on a firm foundation.At the core of Naqshbandi doctrine and practice lie the eleven principles(kalimat-i qudsiyya, lit. sacred words) attributed to its early founders,‘Abdulkhaliq Ghijduwani and Baha’uddin Naqshband, and a distinct formof silent dhikr. To these were added during the course of time other “canon-ized” texts and rituals, particularly the collection of letters (Maktubat) ofAhmad Sirhindi and spiritual practices such as suhba, khalwa and rabita inthe specific uses to which they were put by ‘Ubaydullah Ahrar, Khalid al-Shahrizuri, and other lesser figures. Although none of these texts and ritualsremained uncontested by rivals or affiliates of the brotherhood, they consti-tuted the discursive field of orthodoxy and activism around which theNaqshbandi tradition revolved.27This firm foundation ensured that throughout its history, the Mujaddidi10THE CORE AND CONTOURS OF A SUFI BROTHERHOOD"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"and Khalidi offshoots and their numerous localized branches and sub-branches would remain within the overall Naqshbandi fold. These offshootsand branches shared in the Naqshbandi sense of distinction, their leadersoften reiterating the postulate that theirs is the shortest way to attain spirit-ual perfection and the claim to belong to the spiritual chain of Abu Bakr, theimmediate heir of the Prophet. Thereby they distinguished themselves frommost other Sufi brotherhoods, which consider ‘Ali, Muhammad’s cousin andson-in-law and the fourth Caliph, as the principal transmitter of esotericknowledge in Islam.28 Of course, one should not infer hence that every singleNaqshbandi, by his mere affiliation to the brotherhood, was a livingembodiment of orthodoxy and activism. It is my argument, however, that intimes of political and social upheaval it was particularly members of theNaqshbandiyya that rose to the task, conceived new ideas for religiousreform and renewal, and formed socio-religious revivalist movements torectify the situation.Still, as with other Sufi brotherhoods the identity of the Naqshbandiyya islargely imaginary. This is true not merely in Benedict Anderson’s sense con-cerning the nation, namely that most Naqshbandis “will never know most oftheir fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them.”29 No less significantis the fact that the inner cohesion of the Naqshbandiyya has always beenweak while its boundaries to other brotherhoods and with the larger Muslimcommunity have never been clearly demarcated. This state of affairs, which isinherent in the loose structure of the tariqa organization in general, isaccentuated in the Naqshbandi case by the paradoxical nature of the veryprinciples that define its specific identity. Within the bounds of the Naqshbandi brotherhood, the activist attitudewhich the principle of “solitude in the crowd” entails necessitated alertnessto prevailing social and political circumstances. As these differed consider-ably according to place and time, so did the readings and applications of theprinciple. They ranged from community work in colonial India, for example,through cooperation with governments, either Islamic such as the Hamidianregime in the late Ottoman era or secular like the Ba‘th regime in con-temporary Syria, to resistance and rebellion as in the Jihad movementsagainst the Russian conquest of Chechnya or against the Soviet invasion ofAfghanistan. Factional struggles over leadership and resources in thebrotherhood could likewise generate disagreements over doctrinal points orthe right course of action. Such were the cases of the conflict between theolder Naqshbandiyya and the Mujaddidiyya in the Haramayn in the seven-teenth century and of the “old teaching” and “new teaching” factions in theChinese Naqshbandiyya. The orthodox stress on the shari‘a could be similarly interpreted in a var-iety of ways in the overall Muslim space. Some, like ‘Abd al-Rahman Jami inTimurid Herat, stressed the attachment of the Naqshbandiyya to the com-mon orthodox Sufi edifice, normally on the basis of Ibn ‘Arabi’s teaching.11THE CORE AND CONTOURS OF A SUFI BROTHERHOOD"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Others, mostly belonging to the ulama class, for example, Ahmadal-Qushashi and Ibrahim al-Kurani in seventeenth-century Medina, joinedin the religious scholars’ critique of “unlawful” Sufi practices. On theother hand, in one instance in the second half of the nineteenth century aMujaddidi lineage from the rural periphery of Lucknow in northern Indiawas passed to the Hindu environment; it has not only survived there to thisday, but has also been transplanted into the contemporary globalized scene.Finally, there were those modern Naqshbandis for whom, to some extent orother, the mystical path was superseded by modernist and fundamentalistreadings of Islam. Prominent among these are the Nur movement among theTurkish peoples and the Salafis in the Arab world.In between the overarching Muslim arena and the inner-brotherhoodscene(s), the Naqshbandi self-characterization as the shortest path to attainspiritual perfection was likewise translated into various kinds of relation-ships with other brotherhoods. Depending on real relations of power andinfluence on the one hand, and on the extent of both sides’ commitment tothe orthodox creed on the other, these spanned from hegemony to conflict tocooperation and actual merger. Thus, by the sixteenth century the originalNaqshbandiyya was able to incorporate within its fold the other indigenousmystical traditions of Central Asia – the Kubrawiyya and Yasawiyya – aswell as some of their rituals. Less confident in India, from its very inception the Mujaddidiyya juxta-posed itself to the established brotherhoods of the subcontinent – includingthe popular Chishtiyya – while presenting itself as the most competent tofight Mughal syncretism. The Khalidiyya, during its own initial phase,induced the modernizing Ottoman administration to ban the heterodoxBektashis and close their lodges. Subsequently some Khalidi branches, not-ably in Kurdistan and Indonesia, sought to bolster their position by aligningwith more prestigious Qadiriyya lineages. Among modern Naqshbandi-related movements the entire form of tariqa organization was either relegatedto a secondary role or abandoned altogether. The continuity of the Naqshbandiyya over time may also be taken aslargely invented. “Invented tradition” is defined by Hobsbawm and Rangeras “a set of practices, normally governed by overtly or tacitly accepted rulesand of a ritual or symbolic nature, which seek to inculcate certain values andnorms of behaviour by repetition, which automatically implies continuitywith the past.”30 Such practices are evident in the apocryphal projection ofthe Naqshbandi chain of transmission back to the Prophet, a feature sharedby practically all Sufi brotherhoods, as well as in the peculiar occurrence ofloopholes in the proto-Naqshbandi chain, which are portrayed as specialcases of “spiritual transmission.” Far beyond that, however, “invention” is a constant feature of theNaqshbandi tradition. It may be gauged from the wide gap between thelinear presentation of the trajectory of the brotherhood as it appears in its12THE CORE AND CONTOURS OF A SUFI BROTHERHOOD"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"genealogical tree (shajara) and its actual history, which has been checkeredby recurrent conflicts over leadership and material resources and over teach-ings and rituals. The Sufi silsila, not unlike the chains of transmission of thehadith on which it was ultimately modeled, was devised to bridge such dis-continuities. They allow succeeding masters to shape and reshape theirancestry in line with the requirement of legitimacy (isnad), as well as todiscredit rival masters. Such a construction was again especially potent in theNaqshbandi brotherhood, in which every modification on the path wasmeasured against its foundational basis. Accordingly, there is no indication in the Naqshbandi chain of transmis-sion of the successive establishment of the Mujaddidi and Khalidi offshoots.Also overlooked are more subtle changes in the modalities of the transmis-sion itself. A turning point in this respect was reached in the fifteenth andsixteenth centuries, when hereditary succession, a common custom amongmost Sufi brotherhoods but explicitly denounced by the founders of theNaqshbandiyya, was now accepted as the rule. This development was paral-leled by the emergence of the lodge as the locus of Naqshbandi spiritual life,a practice that likewise had been proscribed in the early days of the brother-hood. Both modifications reflected transformations in the wider world oforganized Sufism during this period, most notably the spread of the customto augment multiple chains of transmission as a source of enhanced spiritualprestige. Another turning point was reached in the late nineteenth and twen-tieth centuries when those Naqshbandi masters who abandoned the tariqaform of organization were also ready to do away with their lineage in favorof new modes of legitimacy such as rationalist discourse, state backing, orpopulist appeal.The picture of the Naqshbandiyya that thus emerges is of a fairly loosenetwork of masters and disciples in their lodges, who share a set of foun-dational principles and practices while constantly modifying and reinterpret-ing them according to changing circumstance and personal preference. Sucha flexible and open-ended structure, which informs both ritual and modes oforganization, allows not only wide divergence within the system, but alsospilling over to the broader environment. Thus, the silent form of dhikr,generally recognized as the mainstay of the Naqshbandi ritual, was oftenaccompanied by vocal forms of recollection, while in more recent times itsometimes came to resemble a religious lesson or preaching, as I witnessed inthe Ismail Agha mosque in Istanbul. Similarly, exceptionally charismaticmasters were able hierarchically to structure their tariqa and provide it withconsiderable economic and political leverage. As the case of the HinduMujaddidi branch in India and the quietist approach of numerousNaqshbandi branches all over the Muslim world indicate, such flexibilityand open-endedness do not exclude even the two central pillars of theNaqshbandi tradition, its orthodoxy and its activism.13THE CORE AND CONTOURS OF A SUFI BROTHERHOOD"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"2LOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASESOF INNER ASIA (THIRTEENTH TOSIXTEENTH CENTURIES)The Naqshbandiyya derives its name from Baha’uddin Naqshband, theepithet of the fourteenth-century spiritual master Muhammad al-Uwaysi ofBukhara. It is a combination of the Persian words naqsh and band, meaningimpressing the divine name Allah and fixing it to the heart. Like in manyother Sufi brotherhoods, though, it was the disciples of the eponym, fore-most among them the charismatic ‘Ala’uddin ‘Attar and the scholarlyMuhammad Parsa, and to some extent, the younger Ya‘qub Charkhi, whoactually laid the foundations of the new path while evoking the name of themaster as a source of legitimization. The Naqshbandiyya traces its beginnings farther back to the Khwajagan,the spiritual masters of Central Asia, and is embedded in their tradition. Thelegendary founder of this tradition at the turn of the thirteenth century was‘Abdulkhaliq from the small town of Ghijduwan in the Bukhara oasis. ToGhijduwani were attributed the introduction of a silent form of dhikr andthe formulation of eight principles (kalimat-i qudsiyya), which specified thecharacter and spiritual methods of his lineage as against the incipientYasawiyya brotherhood and in opposition to the organizational forms thatCentral Asian Sufism was then taking in general. Ghijduwani as well asAhmad Yasawi are described in the Naqshbandi sources as disciples ofYusuf al-Hamadani, the first khwaja in their chain of transmission. The linkschosen for this apocryphal chain going back to the Prophet Muhammad,and the relations between them, symbolize the particular traits of theKhwajagan-Naqshbandi spiritual path.Under Chaghatay Mongol rule (thirteenth to mid-fourteenth century)the Khwajagan came to represent a low-profile widely diffused current com-prising a multiplicity of local groups engaging in divergent practices andrituals. Some of them survived to as late as the sixteenth century. Onegroup was the line of Khwaja Baha’uddin, who after the restoration ofMuslim rule in Bukhara evoked by way of “spiritual transmission” thelegacy of Ghijduwani while supplementing it with three principles of hisown. During the time of his disciples, coinciding with the reign of Timur14"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Lang (1370–1405) and his successors, the Khwajagan-Naqshbandiyyaspread to other urban centers of Transoxiana, where it appealed primarily tothe culturally Iranian (Tajik) artisans. In the following generation it estab-lished a presence in the major Timurid cities of Balkh and especially thecapital Herat. In the second half of the fifteenth century ‘Ubaydullah Ahrargave the Naqshbandiyya a more solid organizational shape from his base inSamarqand, while the scholarly literati ‘Abdurrahman Jami and ‘Ali ShirNava’i thrived in Herat under the wing of the court.Scholarly research on the Central Asian Naqshbandiyya has surged sincethe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989. Special efforts have been exertedsince then by numerous scholars to locate, catalogue and publish originalmanuscripts, most notably biographies of Baha’uddin Naqshaband and theworks of Muhammad Parsa. Most of these manuscripts are deposited inthe al-Biruni Institute in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. This endeavor, along withthe original researches conducted on the basis of the rediscovered sources,actually amount to a dismantling of the ideological edifice of the “official”Naqshbandi chain of transmission to make way for a more critical assess-ment of the role of the brotherhood in Transoxianan politics and society ofthe thirteenth to sixteenth centuries.The formation of a traditionAlthough constructed by disciples and followers, the biography of Baha’uddinNaqshaband1 shows few spiritual feats of note; nor did he leave behind writ-ings that may reveal any special teachings or a systematic path. Born in 1318in the village of Qasr Hinduwan (later renamed Qasr ‘Arifan) close byBukhara, Baha’uddin Muhammad is said to have been adopted as an infantby Khwaja Muhammad Sammasi, who then assigned his future spiritualtraining to his principal deputy, Khwaja Amir Kulal. Along with this tutor,his immediate predecessor in the Naqshbandi lineage with whom he is said tohave spent many years, Baha’uddin attended other spiritual masters, bothKhwajagan and Turkish Yasawis. Among the latter was a certain Khalil Ata,allegedly the ruler of Bukhara, under whom, according to one anecdote,Baha’uddin served as executioner. After Khalil’s fall Baha’uddin began cul-tivating his own circle of disciples. Thereafter he left his native place twice toperform the hajj, and then only once more to journey to Herat, where he hadan audience with the ruler. Baha’uddin died in 1389 and was buried in Qasr‘Arifan. Later he was made the virtual patron saint of Bukhara, and in thesixteenth century his tomb became a center of pilgrimage for Muslims fromCentral Asia and beyond.The unique feature in the biography of Baha’uddin Naqshband, and thekey to understanding his position as the eponym of the Naqshbandi lineage,lay in his symbolic relation to the founder of the Khwajagan tradition,‘Abdulkhaliq Ghijduwani, from whom he was separated by five links. It isLOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA15"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"told that during his discipleship to Kulal, Baha’uddin had a vision of the“spirituality” of Ghijduwani, who urged him strictly to follow the shari‘aand instructed him in the method of the silent dhikr. Hence his epithet al-Uwaysi, namely a Sufi “who has attained illumination outside the regularmystical path and without the mediation and guidance of a living shaykh.”2Following this vision, Baha’uddin added three principles of his own to theeight of the great master, all relating to the dhikr.3 Still, despite the resent-ment of other disciples, he did not leave the circle of Amir Kulal, who wasactually present in his vision and even helped him interpret it, but onlyabsented himself whenever the vocal dhikr was practiced. Kulal, for his part,is said by the Naqshbandi sources to have continued to hold his disciple inhigh esteem and ultimately to free him to pursue other masters:He [Amir Kulal] pointed to his noble chest and said: I have emptiedthe breasts of gnosis (‘irfan) for you so that the bird of your spiritual-ity was delivered from the egg of humanity. But, the falcon of youraspiration (himma) is flying high. Therefore I give you now thepermission to wander around in the land, and if the smell of gnosisreaches your nose from a Turk or a Tajik, seek it from him.4This account is paradoxical in two complementary respects.

On the other hand, the “spiritual” initiation resulted in aspell away from the Khwajagan tradition in a “free” search for spiritualenlightenment. These paradoxes should be set against the wider political andsocial developments of Baha’uddin’s time, which witnessed the collapse ofthe Chaghatay state and the renewal of Muslim rule in Transoxiana andKhurasan. The Khwajagan masters, whose activity had been repressed underthe Mongols, could now reassert their spiritual eminence, while the moreambitious among them were seeking to further remold the tradition inaccordance with the new opportunities offered by the Timurid government.Such reformist traditionalism was expressed in the portrayal of Baha’uddinas “spiritually initiated” by Ghijduwani, in his implied, though reverent,criticism of the intervening Khwajagan, in his reexamination of the currentFigure 2.1The genealogy of Baha’uddin NaqshbandLOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA17"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"practices among the existing traditions, and finally, in the practical innov-ations he introduced; all these made him the eponym of the Khwajagani pathof revival that came to be known after him as the Naqshbandiyya.The choice of Baha’uddin Naqshband as the epitome of revival within thebroader Khwajagan tradition was essentially the achievement of the follow-ing generation of his disciples. The leading figures in this group were‘Ala’uddin ‘Attar (d. 1400), Baha’uddin’s charismatic son-in-law who wasrecognized as his successor, and Muhammad Parsa (d. 1420), an outstandingreligious scholar who provided the intellectual foundation of the new move-ment, along with Ya‘qub Charkhi (d. 1447), a noted alim and mystic in hisown right. The Naqshbandi sources are somewhat ambiguous about rela-tions between the three masters, who parted company after Baha’uddin’sdeath, each forming his own circle of disciples. It is particularly evident thatParsa was more important than later Naqshbandi tradition would admit, notonly because he too was favored by the master but also because he remainedin Bukhara while the others had to establish themselves elsewhere. Be that asit may, Parsa and ‘Attar clearly complemented each other in their work offormulating the new tradition. Still, though less impressive than both, it wasultimately Charkhi who came to be regarded as the most important link inthe “official” Naqshbandi genealogy, being the spiritual master of Ahrar.5Shams al-Din Muhammad al-Hafizi, nicknamed Parsa (the pious one),6was the founder of the literary tradition of the Naqshbandiyya. Scion of arenowned family of Hanafi ulama of Bukhara, he assembled the sayings ofthe master in his Risala-i qudsiyya (The Treatise of Saintliness) and, perhapsat the instigation of ‘Attar, wrote the first hagiography of Baha’uddin, Anisal-talibin wa-‘uddat al-salikin (The Companion of the Seekers and Providerof the Followers). No less important were Parsa’s doctrinal works, foremostamong them Fasl al-khitab li-wasl al-albab (The Conclusive Judgment inUniting the Hearts) in which, as its title indicates, he sought to smoothfrictions in matters of doctrine and practice through a general mysticalsynthesis. In this and other works, Parsa also introduced in Central Asia thelegacy of the great classical Sufis as well as the teachings of Ibn ‘Arabi, andlinked the Naqshbandiyya with the mystical traditions of Baghdad andKhurasan. Though shunning politics, he is reported to have sent letters tothe Timurid Sultan Shahrukh (1405–1447) on behalf of the Muslim popula-tion of the capital Herat. Muhammad Parsa’s contribution to the reform ofthe wider intellectual life of Bukhara becomes clear from the investigation ofthe “Library of Khwaja Parsa,” a family establishment that he augmentedwith his rich private collection and which survived into the nineteenth centuryas the public library of Bukhara.7The more practical Muhammad ‘Ala’uddin ‘Attar was mostly responsiblefor the perpetuation of the new path of the Naqshbandiyya. Son of amigrant from Khwarazm, the young ‘Attar led a severe and ascetic way oflife that greatly impressed Baha’uddin, who offered him his daughter’s handLOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA18"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"in marriage. Following the path under his father-in-law’s guidance, he swiftlyrose to the position of chief disciple and was assigned the training of the lessadvanced adepts. On Baha’uddin’s death ‘Attar was recognized as his succes-sor by all other disciples, including Parsa. This may have been due to hisconsiderable yet sober spiritual powers, as well as to Parsa’s dislike of fric-tion. Before proceeding with our historical narration, however, it is necessaryto examine the Khwajagan setting of the early Naqshbandis and the majormystical ideas and practices that emerged from it. The Khwajagan settingAmong the settled populations of Central Asia, the term khwajagan origin-ally referred to the upper stratum of Turkish nobles and sayyid families(those claiming descent from the Prophet) in general. Only during thefifteenth and sixteenth centuries did khwaja come to denote exclusively aman of religion, primarily of the mystical type. The later usage, however,was already in vogue in what has sometimes been described as the proto-Naqshbandi phase, the period that stretched from ‘Abdulkhaliq Ghijduwani,the legendary founder of the Khwajagan tradition, to Baha’uddinNaqshband. In Central Asia the spiritual descendants of Baha’uddin con-tinued to be described as khwajagan long after his death, retaining the desig-nation even after Ahrar gave the brotherhood a more distinct structure. Itwas probably among the latter’s followers in the Iranian and Turkish realmsthat the term Naqshbandiyya had gradually taken root before it was carriedback to Transoxiana in the sixteenth century.8It is not easy to separate the factual details in the biography of ‘Abdulkha-liq Ghijduwani from the legends that surround the circumstances of hisfounding the Khwajagan path. There is some ambiguity even about hislifespan: he died either in 1179 or 1220, though it seems certain that hespent most of his life in the small town of Ghijduwan, some 50 kilometersnortheast of Bukhara. According to the Rashahat,He received the silent recollection (al-dhikr al-qalbi) in his youthfrom al-Khidr, peace be upon him, and persisted with the said recol-lection. Al-Khidr accepted him as a son and commanded him tobecome absorbed in it and to say in his heart under the water “thereis no god but God and Muhammad is the messenger of God.” TheKhwaja did it. He learned this from him and engaged himself withthis there, until all sorts of openings and elevations occurred to himbeyond the perception of discernment. The manner of his engage-ment, his goal, and his utmost perfection were acceptable and desir-able from beginning to end among all people. When Khwaja Yusufal-Hamadani, his secret be hallowed, arrived in Bukhara, Khwaja‘Abdulkhaliq came to visit him and, as he learned that he too isLOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA19"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"engaged in the silent dhikr, he benefited from his company (suhba)and attended him during his stay in Bukhara. Therefore it is said thatal-Khidr, peace be upon him, was his master in instruction andinspiration while Khwaja Yusuf was his master in accompaniment.9About his work it is related, for example, that it was al-Khidr, the mysteri-ous patron saint and initiator of travelers,10 who instructed him in themethod of the silent dhikr. As Algar maintains, the eight principles thatGhijduwani subsequently bequeathed to the brotherhood, if their attributionto him is indeed correct, should be regarded as a general statement character-istic of Central Asian Sufism of his day, rather than as a defined doctrine.Centuries later, Jami would declare that the point of his work was to urgepeople to follow the Sunna and refrain from unlawful deviations (bid‘a).11The Naqshbandi genealogy describes Ghijduwani as one of four successorsof Hamadani (d. 1140), the first spiritual master to whom it accorded thetitle of khwaja.Of the three other alleged successors the most important was Ahmad al-Yasawi (d. 1167), eponym of the Yasawiyya brotherhood, from which lateralso sprang the Bektashiyya.12 It is often claimed that there was a division ofinterests between the lines of these two masters, Ghijduwani’s followersworking mostly in the urban centers in which the Iranian culture was domin-ant, while those of Yasawi addressed the Turkic elements in the steppe. It isalso generally recognized that such a distinction cannot be carried too far; wePlate 2.2‘Abdulkhaliq’s tomb, GhijduwanLOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA20"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"have seen that even in the case of Baha’uddin Naqshband Turkish teacherswere no less conspicuous in his education than cultural Iranian ones. This maytestify to a measure of amiable cooperation as well as a growing tensionbetween the two groups, a duality symbolized in the genealogically con-structed positions of Yasawi and Ghijduwani as successors of the same masterbut originators of distinct ways. Devin DeWeese tends to stress the conflictualaspect in the relationship. In his view, from its very beginning the KhwajaganNaqshbandiyya was a Sufi “reformist” current which, partly to distinguishand legitimize itself, expressed criticism of “popular” practices of establishedCentral Asian Sufism, in which the Yasawiyya naturally had a part.13Moreover, contrary to the linear presentation of the “official” Naqshbandilineage, it seems more appropriate to treat the Khwajagan from Ghijduwanionwards as a diffuse current, “a bundle or cluster of interrelated local andregional traditions.” These traditions were embodied in what Jürgen Paul hasdefined as “collateral lines,” each featuring a distinct ancestry and differen-tiating itself by certain practices. Some of the groupings claimed descentfrom Ghijduwani, while others referred to other “founders”, for example,‘Abdallah Baraki and Hasan Andaki, the two remaining successors ofHamadani, or to various communal figures. Khwajagan groupings formedand disbanded in quick succession in the Bukhara oasis during the thirteenthand fourteenth centuries, consonant with the fortunes of the masters. Fur-thermore, the status of each khwaja was less secure than was customaryamong the Sufi brotherhoods: his disciples were always free to leave foranother master or even to follow the path on their own, while he lost allauthority over them when they completed their training. Conducting aspiritual center (khanqah) was also frowned upon.This was essentially the situation of Baha’uddin Naqshband in Qasr ‘Arifan.He was one among several Khwajagan working in the city of Bukhara, whileother masters were active in the surrounding villages. Among the latter wasthe Kulali group, which referred to his erstwhile preceptor, Amir Kulal.According to the latter’s hagiography, it was his son Hamza rather thanBaha’uddin who was recognized as successor. The two contenders may thusbe regarded as the founders of two collateral lines, whose chief differencewas the form of dhikr they practiced.14The volatility of the Khwajagan current was exacerbated by the destruc-tion of Bukhara by the Mongols, who stormed Central Asia in 1220, the yearof Ghijduwani’s death, or perhaps a generation after him. The havocresulted in the weakening of the “learned” brand of Islam in the cities of theoasis, but also in the flourishing of the more popular forms of Sufism inthe small towns and villages. This situation seems to have affected theKhwajagan themselves, who abandoned most of Ghijduwani’s principles. Inthe early fourteenth century ‘Ali ‘Azizan-i Ramitani, the link immediatelypreceding Sammasi in the proto-Naqshbandi lineage, left Bukhara andestablished himself in the neighboring region of Khwarazm. With BabaLOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA21"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Sammasi, and following him Amir Kulal, the center of activity of this linereturned to the Bukhara countryside where, in opposition to the prevalentpopular practices, they appealed to the more articulate artisans of Iranianstock.15 Following the reinstitution of Muslim rule in Central Asia by theTimurids, Baha’uddin Naqshband, and still more his disciples, re-establishedthe “reformist” tradition of the Khwajagan in the city of Bukhara, beforetheir successors carried it farther, to Herat and Samarqand.The proto-Khwajagani lineageForging a silsila is a never-ending project, which masters of every generation“imagine” according to their particular tradition, outlook, and need of legit-imacy. The process begins with the very formation of the brotherhood andmay cease only if it disappears from the scene. As with the hadith literature,however, legitimization requires that the chain of transmission stretch backfrom the founder(s) to the model of all correct Muslim belief and practice,the Prophet Muhammad. In the case of the Khwajagan-Naqshbandiyya, thebackward projection of the chain of transmission was gradual. The initialphase discussed above was the work of Baha’uddin’s disciples, the actualfounders of the Naqshbandiyya brotherhood, who extended their lineageback from their master to Ghijduwani, the alleged originator of theKhwajagan current. Their successors, whose efforts were consolidated in theRashahat, continued the construction from Ghijduwani all the way back toMuhammad. Though obviously spurious, the proto-Khwajagani chain ofinitiation (as represented in Figure 2.4) is revealing in two major respects.First, through the symbolic value of the specific figures chosen as its links, itrepresents the basic ideology of the early Naqshbandiyya; second, taken as awhole the peculiarities of the chain of transmission point to the complex andoften contradictory historical process through which it was constituted.Contrary to the established convention, the proto-Khwajagani lineageactually has three distinct chains of transmission rather than one.16 Thismultiplicity of lineages, which supplied Naqshbandi masters with a measureof freedom of choice, may reflect either the manifold character of theFigure 2.2The emergence of the Naqshbandiyya as a collateral lineLOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA22"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Khwajagan current or successive strands in its evolution. Two of the chainsconform to most other brotherhoods in going back to the Prophet through‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, his cousin and fourth Caliph to whom, according to Sufitradition, he transmitted esoteric wisdom.

It may alsoreflect the fuzzy boundaries between the Sunni and Shi‘i creeds before therise of the Safavids in Iran made the Naqshbandiyya hostile to Shi‘ism.In the third proto-Khwajagani lineage the first link after the Prophet isAbu Bakr al-Siddiq, the first Caliph. The selection of the immediate polit-ical, and arguably spiritual, successor of Muhammad implied not merely asense of distinction but eventually a claim of precedence over the other Sufibrotherhoods, which normally boast an ‘Alid ancestry. The Bakri line bothunderlies the strict Sunni orthodox attitude that the Naqshbandiyya hadespoused from its very beginning and reinforced its rejection of Shi‘ism.Finally, in the Qur’anic story of the Prophet’s hiding with a companion,generally recognized as Abu Bakr, in a cave during their flight from Mecca toMedina (hijra), the Naqshbandis find the legitimacy for the silent form ofdhikr which set them apart from all other brotherhoods. The next link in thisline is Salman al-Farisi, who signifies the connection between the Iranian andArab worlds, and who in addition is regarded as the patron saint of smallartisans, the original mainstay of the Khwajagan in the Bukhara oasis, andof the common people at large.19 Perhaps to retain some of the prestigederiving from the Prophet’s family, the Bakri line also incorporates the sixthImam, Ja‘far al-Sadiq.The next links in the proto-Khwajagani genealogical tree show a clearrupture between the united ‘Alid line and the parallel Bakri line. The firstpasses through leading figures in the Baghdad school of the ninth and tenthcenturies, in which classical Sufism was consolidated, including the toweringfigure of al-Junayd, the master of sobriety who features in most Sufi lineages.The latter line, by contrast, leaps by way of “spiritual initiation” to Bayazidal-Bistami, the ninth-century archetype of spiritual intoxication, and fromhim to the illiterate eleventh-century Abu al-Hasan al-Kharaqani. So by akind of inversion it was now the ‘Alid line that came to represent the Sunniorthodox strain of the Khwajagan-Naqshbandiyya, while the Bakri lineexpresses its mystical feats. The Uwaysi type of “spiritual transmission” ofBistami and Kharaqani served to vindicate Baha’uddin’s claim to have beeninitiated by the “spirituality” of Ghijduwani, as well as his wider doctrinethat a Sufi can awaken the “spiritual presence” of a deceased master bydirecting himself to him (tawajjuh). This doctrine allowed Baha’uddin torelate himself to yet another important Sufi who had been obliterated fromthe lineage system, al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi (d. ca. 908), one of the earlyexponents of the theory of sainthood.20 More important still, Bistami, and probably Kharaqani as well, were out-standing representatives of the Malamati tradition which had been in voguein Khurasan. The Malamatiyya, which traced its origins to Abu Bakr andSalman al-Farisi, advised its adherents to conceal their piety and behaveoutwardly in a way that invited blame (malama) to ensure their sincerity.21 ItLOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA24"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"seems, therefore, that not only did the Khwajagan-Naqshbandiyya appropri-ate a Malamati genealogical tree, but also that it might have owed to thistrend the paradoxical character of its own basic tenets: the silent form ofdhikr and the cardinal principles of traveling in the home (safar dar watan)and solitude in the crowd (khalwat dar anjuman), as well as its initial pro-pensity to mistrust miraculous deeds and avoid wearing distinctive garb orliving in hospices.22 The Malamatis’ reference to the Qura’nic verse (24, 37)“men whom neither commerce nor trafficking diverts from the remembranceof God” must have resonated through the urban circles in Bukhara,especially those of the bazaar.23All three proto-Khwajagani lines finally converged in Abu ‘Alial-Farmadi, a seminal figure in the formation of early organized Sufism.Farmadi studied with Abu al-Qasim al-Qushayri (d. 1074), author of thewidely read Risala fi ‘ilm al-tasawwuf, and taught the noted Sufi scholar AbuHamid al-Ghazali (d. 1111), as well as his younger brother Ahmad (d. 1126)from whom several Sufi lineages were to be derived.24 In the Naqshbandigenealogy he is the immediate link before Yusuf al-Hamadani, whom Ghi-jduwani claimed as his own spiritual master. According to the version attrib-uted to the latter Hamadani, a descendent of Abu Hanifa, kept a spiritualconnection with his Sufi teacher even after his death and at his instigationmoved from Iran to Samarqand. Here, not without the intervention ofal-Khidr, he was joined by Ghijduwani and his other three deputies.Madelung is certainly right in maintaining that this biography is “simple andpure fiction,” since Ghijduwani probably had never met Hamadani and thelatter was actually a Shafi‘i.25 Yet it was exactly the “invention” ofHamadani, and through him the entire lineage, that heralded the emergenceof the new path of the Khwajagan. Through the constructed master theparadoxical intoxication of the Malamati tradition could be joined to thesobriety of the Junaydi line within a more profoundly orthodox mysticalsynthesis. The legitimacy of the Khwajagan was then sealed by embeddingthe new synthesis in the native Hanafism of Transoxiana.The foundational baseThe constitutive event of the Naqshbandiyya brotherhood was Baha’uddinNaqshband’s adoption of the silent dhikr from the “spirituality” of‘Abdulkhaliq Ghijduwani. This led to his refusal to take part in the sessionsof vocal dhikr performed by his master, Amir Kulal, and consequently to theestablishment of his own distinct group. The vocal dhikr (public recollection– dhikr jahri, uttered by the tongue – dhikr al-lisan) is the common practiceamong the Sufi brotherhoods, and normally includes mystical music anddance. By Baha’uddin’s time it had become the prevalent practice alsoamong the Khwajagan, despite their ascription to Ghijduwani. Thereintroduction of the vocal dhikr was attributed to Mahmud Anjir Faghnawi,LOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA25"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Plate 2.3Abu al-Hasan al-Kharaqani’s mosque in Kars"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"the link preceding ‘Ali ‘Aziz al-Ramitani in the proto-Naqhshbandi chain oftransmission (see Figure 2.1). To silence critics Faghnawi maintained that hismaster, ‘Arif Riwgari, who was a direct disciple of Ghijduwani, had con-doned the practice before his death, “in order to call people to God.”26 Thedeviation was challenged by other disciples of Ghijduwani under the leader-ship of Awliya’-yi Kabir, in a controversy that had clear social undertones, asAwliya’ and his followers lived in the city of Bukhara whereas Faghnawi wasbased in the countryside. It continued unabated down to Baha’uddin’s time,opinions ranging from permitting performance of the vocal dhikr underrestrictive terms to total disregard of the silent dhikr.Following Baha’uddin, the silent dhikr (hidden recollection – dhikr khafi,whispered in the heart – dhikr al-qalb) became the dominant practice in theNaqshbandiyya, a distinguishing feature of its overall orthodox and sobercharacter. This, however, did not prevent practical disagreements among suc-cessive Naqshbandi masters, particularly about the attitude to be takentoward the vocal dhikr. The debate started already with Baha’uddin’slearned disciples, Muhammad Parsa and Ya‘qub Charkhi. Parsa, in line withhis general “ecumenical” approach, made way for the vocal dhikr besides themore elevated silent one.27 He described it as appropriate for beginners, whoshould internalize it while advancing on the path. On the other hand, Parsastressed that the vocal dhikr must not be performed as a means to gain fameor material benefits, as probably was often the case. Charkhi took a moreradical approach, rejecting the vocal dhikr altogether. He claimed thatBaha’uddin proscribed it and that it has no basis in the Qur’an and theSunna. This position was to receive the sanction of his influential discipleAhrar.28Along with the silent dhikr, Baha’uddin also accepted Ghijduwani’s set ofeight principles that broadly defined the spiritual path of the Khwajagan,supplementing them with three principles of his own. The eleven “sacredwords” (kalimat-i qudsiyya) basically refer to the mystical exercises of thebrotherhood, although some of them bear broader social and politicalrepercussions. The eleven principles are as follows:1. Yad kard – recollection2. Baz gasht – return3. Nigah dasht – watchfulness4. Yad dasht – remembrance5. Hosh dar dam – awareness in breathing6. Nazar bar qadam – watching the steps7. Safar dar watan – travelling in the home8. khalwat dar anjuman – solitude in the crowd9. wuquf-i zamani – awareness of time10. wuquf-i ‘adadi – awareness of multiplicity11. wuquf-i qalbi – awareness of the heartLOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA27"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"This set of principles represents four layers in the formation of theNaqshbandi ideology. The first four principles refer to the foundations of thedhikr, which the Naqshbandiyya shares with all other Sufi brotherhoods.According to the nineteenth-century Damascene Muhammad al-Khani, theyinclude the constant recollection of the unitary formula “There is no god butGod”; returning to consciousness through phrases such as “My God, Thouart my goal and Thy satisfaction is my desire”; watching over the heartagainst distracting thoughts; and remembering which signifies the ever pres-ence of the heart with God. Then come two principles – awareness in breath-ing and keeping watch on the steps – which allude to an Indian influence onthe Naqshbandiyya.29 Khani explains them as the means to keep the heartfrom distraction when, respectively, the breath enters the body and the eyeslook at the world.30The next group of two principles – traveling in the home and solitude inthe crowd – are the most consequential in terms of their contribution to thesocial and political evolution of the Naqshbandiyya. Both reveal a senseof mystical superiority and are paradoxical in nature, a fact that betraystheir Malamati origin.31 The latter of the two in particular is emphasizedin the Rashahat: “Khwaja Baha’uddin Naqshbandi was asked: on whatis your way founded? He said in his reply: on this phrase, namely solitudein the crowd, which means to be outwardly with the creatures and inwardlywith the Creator . . . God’s word [in the Qur’an]: men whom neithercommerce nor trafficking diverts them from remembrance of God, indicatesto this state.”32 This principle is opposed to another common Sufi practice,the seclusion (khalwa) of the adept in an isolated place in order to con-quer the lower soul (nafs) and ward off worldly thoughts, which theNaqshbandiyya describes as befitting weak souls. Conversely, seclusionin the crowd enabled craftsmen and traders, the mainstay of the earlyNaqshbandiyya, to join the brotherhood without giving up their occupation.Finally, the principles of safar dar watan and khalwat dar anjuman could beinterpreted as encouraging Naqshbandis to be involved in the world as partof their mystical vocation.The final three principles, those attributed to Baha’uddin himself, weredesigned to increase the dhikr performer’s awareness of himself, of the worldaround him, and of the constant presence of God. Practically they entail adaily moral self-examination, which emphasized the orthodox character ofthe brotherhood; keeping account of the number of utterances of the uni-tary formula, which helps to control the breath and is usually done by usingbeads; and, most importantly, permanent concentration on the movementsof the heart to ensure its purity and permanent attention to God:33Awareness of the heart (wuquf qalbi) has two meanings. One of themis that the heart of the recollecting be present with the Lord (al-Haqq) be He praised and exalted; in this meaning it is like yad dashtLOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA28"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"(remembrance) . . . The second is that the recollecting be aware to hisheart, namely that during the dhikr he be directed toward the pieceof flesh of pineal shape which is figuratively called the heart and issituated in the left side parallel to the left breast, causing it to beengaged in dhikr and not leave it neglectful and oblivious to itsmeaning.34As against seclusion, and therefore as a practical application of the twoprinciples of traveling in the home and solitude in the crowd, the Naqsh-bandiyya preferred the method of suhba, accompanying a perfect master.Through companionship the master could not only teach his disciples butalso convey to them directly his spiritual qualities and attributes. Suhba isdescribed in the Naqshbandi sources as the most elevated and effectivemethod to reach God. Along with it, the founders of the Naqshbanditradition introduced the complementary method of rabita, which hasreceived a great deal of scholarly attention, including a full-length treatiseby Meier, primarily because of the central place it later came to hold inthe Khalidiyya. Literally meaning binding, rabita refers to the techniqueof keeping the image of the perfect master in the disciple’s heart, whether heis present or absent. As Chodkiewicz explains, it is reciprocated by the prac-tice of tawajjuh, which requires the master to direct his heart toward thedisciple. Forming a bond of love, the often interchangeable concepts ofrabita and tawajjuh point to the intermediary position of the master, whoseimage is likened to a mirror reflecting the Prophet and serves as the conduitto the effusion of Divine lights.35 On the practical level they allowed charis-matic masters to increase their influence over their disciples and to expandthe sphere of their spiritual authority, while leaving them time for otherpursuits. Rabita had been first adopted by ‘Attar and passed throughCharkhi to Ahrar.36 It was also given a collective form in khatmal-Khwajagan, the concluding prayer of the dhikr, in which the links ofthe Naqshbandi lineage, from the immediate master to the Prophet, areenumerated and blessed.37The incorporation of these mystical practices within the new synthesis ofthe Naqshbandiyya brotherhood was accompanied right from the start by an“intellectual” streak. This was primarily the achievement of MuhammadParsa, who, through his writings, introduced into the Khwajagan traditionnumerous classical Sufi authors such as Ghazali, Qushayri, and Hujwiri.Above all, he proved an ardent follower of al-Shaykh al-Akbar Ibn ‘Arabi,although, perhaps to avoid the polemics raging around his teachings, hehardly mentioned him by name. Parsa assiduously studied the works of Ibn‘Arabi – a commentary on the most controversial among them, Fusus al-hikam (The Bezels of Wisdom) is attributed to him – and fully espoused thecentral concept associated with him, wahdat al-wujud (the unity of being),seeing no contradiction between this principle and strict adherence to theLOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA29"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"example of the Prophet and to the shari‘a.38 Undoubtedly he drew inspir-ation from the Greatest Master’s comprehensive theosophical enterprise forhis own endeavor to integrate the major orthodox mystical traditions andpractices of Central Asia within the Khwajagan-Naqshbandiyya.Among Parsa’s peers ‘Attar seems to have adopted a reverential attitudetoward Ibn ‘Arabi, whereas Charkhi was more interested in the ideasexpressed in the mystical poetry of Rumi. Ahrar, for his part, was wellacquainted with Ibn ‘Arabi’s teaching, though he held that its secrets weredangerous and should not be divulged to the uninitiated. A somewhat con-trary approach was taken by Jami, the foremost representative of the Ibn‘Arabi school among the early Naqshbandiyya. Jami dedicated many of hisworks to explaining the teachings of the Greatest Master and took an activepart in the debates they sparked in Herat. His poetry was particularly effect-ive in diffusing Ibn ‘Arabi’s theosophical concepts in the Iranian world, butalso in Central Asia, the Ottoman Empire, and India.39As befitting a living mystical tradition, none of the foundational principlesand practices of the Naqshbandiyya were fixed and unequivocal. The three-fold structure of its lineage, the relation between the silent and vocal formsof dhikr, the four deposits of its “sacred words,” and the alternatives ofsuhba and rabita gave Naqshbandi masters throughout the ages considerablefreedom to dismantle and rebuild its path according to the needs of theirpersonality, place, and time. Thus, emphasizing its ‘Alid lineages, incorpor-ation of the vocal dhikr, and a preference for principles such as yad kard andnigah dasht would demonstrate the common ground between the Naqsh-bandiyya and other Sufi brotherhoods. By contrast, dwelling on the Bakrilineage, exclusive use of the silent dhikr, and emphasis on the Malamatiprinciples of safar dar watan and khalwat dar anjuman implied a reformistattitude, which might be directed against more popular brotherhoods, butalso against a deviant state. In times of total crisis they could also occasion-ally lead to the opposite attitude of antinomian drifting away from society.Together, these foundational principles and practices formed the discursivefield within which, and at times against which, Naqshbandi history was torevolve.Dissemination in central AsiaThe emergence of the Naqshbandiyya also marked the spread of the Khwa-jagan tradition beyond Bukhara. This expansion too was attributed toBaha’uddin Naqshband, who is reported to have won disciples in Khurasanon his way to the hajj. It began in earnest, however, with ‘Ala’uddin ‘Attar,his foremost deputy, who for unspecified reasons moved to the region ofChaghaniyan, today’s Denau in south Uzbekistan, where he died a decadeafter the master. He left behind ten successors, among them his son,Baha’uddin’s grandson, Hasan-i ‘Attar, the celebrated theologian SayyidLOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA30"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Sharif al-Jurjani, and Nizamuddin Khamush, whose line led to theNaqshbandi circle of Herat.40 ‘Attar’s departure from Bukhara was followedby that of Ya‘qub Charkhi, who wandered farther east, to the mountainousregions between Badakhshan and Hisar (in today’s northeast Afghanistanand Tajikistan respectively).In the next generation, when family succession crept into Naqshbandipractice, the brotherhood reached the major cities of the Timurid state.Parsa’s son Abu al-Nasr left Bukhara to settle in Balkh (north Afghanistan),where for generations his descendents held the paramount position ofShaykhülislam. Abu al-Nasr is said to have “exaggerated in concealing hispath to such a degree that no one knew that he belonged to the people of thisway.”41 ‘Attar’s son Hasan moved to the capital Herat, “where he dis-tinguished himself in the quality of his spiritual effluence (tasarruf) in all thelands of Transoxiana and Khurasan. Everyone who came to kiss his handand foot became absent from himself.”42Herat in the fifteenth century became a major center of religion and cul-ture under the patronage of the court. As implied in reference to the city inthe biographies of both Baha’uddin and Muhammad Parsa, it had acquireda special attraction for the Naqshbandis at the first half of that century, notleast due to the clash with the less than orthodox governor of Transoxiana,Ulugh Beg. Still, the brotherhood established itself firmly in Herat only afterthe arrival on the scene of Sa‘duddin Kashghari, the charismatic disciple ofKhamush, whose influence superseded that of ‘Attar’s direct descendentsand other Naqshbandi masters already present in the city.43The son of an itinerant merchant from Kashghar, Sa‘duddin completedhis religious studies before going to Bukhara in search of an appropriatespiritual master. He spent several years with Nizamuddin Khamush, andthen set out for the hajj, but apparently stopped on the way and settled inHerat. He took up residence near the central mosque and soon attracted alarge following, including members of the cultural and literary elite of thecity, as well as artisans of lower strata. Several of Sa‘duddin’s discourseswere recorded in the Rashahat, showing him familiar with the terminologyof Ibn ‘Arabi. Otherwise, he was described as being in a near-constantstate of ecstatic rapture which, apparently like his master Khamush (thesilent one), caused him to fall in silence. After his death in 1456,Sa‘duddin Kashghari’s tomb acquired great sanctity; it was rebuilt in theeighteenth century by Ahmad Shah Durrani, founder of the modern Afghanstate.44The absence of detailed research on the cultural milieu of Herat in thesecond half of the fifteenth century makes it difficult to gauge what exactlyattracted figures of the caliber of ‘Abdurrahman Jami (1414–1492) to Kash-ghari. There is no doubt, however, that Jami was deeply devoted to his mas-ter, as is testified in the pages he allotted him in his celebrated hagiographicalcollection Nafahat al-uns (Breaths of Intimacy), which includes an importantLOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA31"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Figure 2.4The spread of the Naqshbandiyya in central Asia"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"account of the early Naqshbandiyya, as well as in his profuse poetry. This iswhat he has to say about their first encounter:The first time that I came to the service of our master Sa‘duddin inthe congregational mosque, I sat at his feet. As was his habit, he wasrepeatedly absent [in God], and I thought he was sleepy. I said: If youtake rest for a moment it will be better. He smiled and said: Don’tyou think that I have any business other than sleeping?45Kashghari was also responsible for the initiation into the brotherhood of‘Ali Shir Nava’i (1441–1501), the famous Timurid minister who is consideredthe virtual founder of Chagathay Turkish literature. Under Nava’i’s auspicesthe Naqshbandiyya was granted rich endowments (awqaf) and its influencereached the ruler. The Naqshbandi affiliation by no means exhausted Jami’sreligious and poetic activity, which included Qur’an exegesis, hadith studies,and commentaries on Sufi works, particularly those of the Ibn ‘Arabi school.On Kashghari’s death ‘Abdurrahman Jami declined to take on theleadership, a step which may have contributed to the fading out of thisNaqshbandi line.46 The task of consolidating the brotherhood within thegeneral Khwajagan tradition fell to his contemporary and colleague inSamarqand, ‘Ubaydullah Ahrar.LOCAL BEGINNINGS IN THE OASES OF INNER ASIA33"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"3CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSIONWith Nasir al-Din ‘Ubaydullah Ahrar, commonly revered as Hazrat Ishan,the formative phase of the Naqshbandiyya brotherhood reached a criticaledge. Under him, most though by no means all Naqshbandi groups ofCentral Asia were brought together within a well-organized interregionalnetwork, and he was also the first to send emissaries outside Transoxiana.Ahrar’s role as a spiritual master was closely connected to his ramified socio-economic activity and his political involvement, which became a model forthe public application of the principle of solitude in the crowd. Both his Sufiand his worldly activities placed a fresh accent on the supremacy of theshari‘a, and more still on the duty of spiritual masters to strive to secure itsimplementation by rulers. Though Ahrar’s enterprise seemed to falterafter his death, it prepared the ground for the dominant position that theNaqshbandiyya was to acquire in Central Asian Sufism in the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries, as well as for the spread of the brotherhood to otherparts of the Muslim world.Ahrar’s legacy was perpetuated in the sixteenth century, now under Uzbekrule, by two major lineages. One lineage returned to Ahmad Kasani ofDahbid near Samarqand, better known as Makhdum-i A‘zam (the greatestmaster), the other to his disciple, Muhammad Islam al-Juybari back in theBukhara region. The Juybaris regained and even surpassed the economicand political leverage of their illustrious ancestor, while rival lines of Makh-dumzades (descendants of Makhdum-i A‘zam) vied for power in easternTurkistan until the Chinese conquest in the mid-eighteenth century. On theother hand, many lesser Naqshbandi lineages were influenced by other Sufitraditions, notably the Yasawiyya and even the Qalandariyya, a generic namefor groups of wandering dervishes who defied all social and religious author-ity. It is a sign of the hegemonic position won by the Ahrari line in CentralAsia that what we know of such groups, which normally also practiced thevocal dhikr, comes mainly from other lands they roamed: Turkey, India, orChina.The “official” history of the Khwajagan-Naqshbandiyya was also formu-lated toward the end of the fifteenth century and in the early sixteenth,34"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"setting its seal on Ahrar’s project of consolidation. The tone was given bysome of his disciples, especially ‘Ali ibn Husayn al-Wa’iz al-Kashifi of Heratin his celebrated Rashahat ‘ayn al-hayat (Drops from the Fountain of Life)and Muhammad Qazi, his most renowned successor in Transoxiana, inSilsilat al-‘Arifin (The Chain of Spiritual Masters). In the Rashahat the mas-ter’s hagiography is preceded by a lengthy introduction, actually more thanhalf of the book, which presents the Naqshbandi chain of transmissionteleologically, leading first to Baha’uddin Naqshband and then to ‘Ubaydul-lah Ahrar. Such a linear presentation tended, on one hand, to obscure therelations between the early Naqshbandiyya and other Khwajagan groups,and on the other hand, to highlight within the Naqshbandi lineage the directforebears of Ahrar, leaving collateral lines in the shadow. Silsilat al-‘Arifin ismore focused on the sayings and deeds of Ahrar himself.Khwaja ‘Ubaydullah Ahrar‘Ubaydullah Ahrar (1404–1490)1 was born into a wealthy family from thevicinity of Tashkent. At the age of twenty-two he was sent to study in areligious college in Samarqand, but soon he interrupted his studies, a firstindication of a lifelong aversion to scholarly knowledge. Instead he chose topursue Sufism, first in Samarqand and later on in Herat. Ahrar attendedseveral spiritual masters until finally in Chaghaniyan he met Ya‘qubCharkhi, who initiated him into the Naqshbandiyya. During this period healso visited Husamuddin Parsa, then leader of the Bukharan Naqshbandis.It is also related that Ahrar lived as a poor Sufi, but that he received thefavors of the Timurid Sultan Shahrukh too. On his return to Tashkent in1431, in apparent contradiction to his previous pursuits, Ahrar engaged inagriculture. Building on the capital he seems to have inherited from his fam-ily, he amassed a large amount of property in the regions of Samarqand andTashkent and also became involved in trade. At the same time he gatheredaround him a circle of disciples, thereby arousing the animosity of mastersfrom other brotherhoods who felt threatened by his increasing power andpopularity.Ahrar’s engagement in politics began at a later stage of his life, in thecontext of the power struggles that threatened to break up the Timurid stateafter the death of Shahrukh in 1447. At least in the initial phase, hisinvolvement appears to have been at least partially motivated by the wish todefend his economic assets against the depredations and extortions of themilitary commanders (amirs), who dominated the political scene at theexpense of the weakening Timurid princelings. During this time Ahrar trans-formed the Naqshbandiyya into the nucleus of what Jürgen Paul has definedas a faction (ta’ifa) – a system of patronage and protection – around whichhis agricultural and commercial activities were organized. His faction, whichwas clearly distinct from other factions and groups, comprised peasants,35CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"craftsmen, and traders who were ready to work for him in exchange forprotection (himaya) of their interests, along with his Sufi adepts. As againstthe amirs’ “Mongol” methods of government and taxation, Ahrar began toemphasize the duty incumbent upon rulers to base their government on theprecepts of the shari‘a.2The first recorded political move of Ahrar was his attempt in 1450 toapproach the governor of Samarqand and urge him to follow Islamic law.Failing to receive an audience, he lent his support to the religiously mindedTimurid Abu Sa‘id, who took control of the city in 1451 and establishedhimself as Sultan. This is how the Rashahat depicts the encounter betweenthe two:One day he [the master] asked for a pen and inkwell and wrote thenames of people on a piece of paper. In the course of this he wrotethe name of Sultan Abu Sa‘id and put it in his headgear (‘amama)above his head, although the emblem of Sultan Abu Sa‘id has notyet appeared at that time and nobody heard about him. Whenasked. . . he said: this is the name of a person that we and you andthe people of Tashkent, Samarqand and Khurasan will all be amonghis subjects. Some days later the roar of Sultan Abu Sa‘id rouse fromTurkistan, while before that the mentioned Sultan saw in his dreamthat our noble master read the prayer (fatiha) on his behalf at theindication of Khwaja Ahmad Yasawi [whose line was dominantamong the Turks]. . . When the eyes of the Sultan fell on him [Ahrar]he became confused and said: by God, this is the master whom I sawin my dream. He threw himself at his feet and showed him humilityand respect. Following that a lofty friendship (suhba) was contractedbetween him and our noble master.Thereafter many troops gathered around him, and the idea cameto his mind to conquer Samarqand. He came to our noble masterand said: I aim at Samarqand, please turn your thought [to it]. Ournoble master asked: for what purpose you aim at it? If your purposeis the fortification of the shari‘a and compassion toward the subjects,your purpose is blessed and your conquest and victory assured.3At Abu Sa‘id’s instigation, ‘Ubaydullah Ahrar then moved from Tashkentto Samarqand, henceforth the center of his political, economic, and spiritualenterprises. Ahrar’s influence on the Timurid court and the ruling circlesderived both from his spiritual status as a shari‘a-bound charismatic Sufimaster and from his standing and wealth as head of a faction. He becameadviser to Abu Sa‘id, and even more markedly to his son and successorSultan Ahmad, who ascended the throne in 1468. At the same time, the fiscalprivileges Ahrar was granted allowed him to augment his wealth andpurchase a vast amount of land holdings all over Central Asia, though he36CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"forwent grants from the rulers in order to keep his independence. Many ofhis assets were converted into waqf endowments, which Ahrar continued toadminister himself. The patronage system established by Ahrar also facili-tated the expansion of the spiritual network that he built from his shrineon the outskirts of Samarqand. Special ties were developed with theNaqshbandis of the Timurid capital Herat. Neither the worldly nor thereligious aspects of Ahrar’s activity went unchallenged.There is a marked difference between the perception of Ahrar’s influenceon Central Asian politics in the second half of the fifteenth century in theTimurid chronicles and in the Naqshbandi hagiographies. The latter, as inthe above quotation, portray Ahrar as the central character, who through hisspiritual powers and miracles shapes the events of the time; in the former heis placed in the shadow of the actual rulers.4 Be that as it may, under theincreasingly enfeebled Timurid state, Ahrar, at the head of his faction,wielded considerable political power. The mission he undertook was toprotect what may be construed as the civil society of his day. His politicalobjective was accordingly twofold: to prevent warfare among the variousTimurid contenders and to remove the Turko-Mongol system of taxationimposed by their amirs. Both objectives involved a role of mediation, eitherbetween the feuding rulers or between the population and the ruling elite atlarge. To the first belonged Ahrar’s efforts to avert a siege on Samarqand in1454 and to bring to an end a rebellion against Abu Sa‘id in 1461–1463.Ahrar had no objection to Abu Sa‘id’s initiative to wage a campaign inPlate 3.1‘Ubaydullah Ahrar’s tomb, Samarqand37CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Persia, which actually ended in the latter’s death in 1469, but he exertedmuch effort to negotiate a treaty between his sons after him. Ahrar’s secondtype of political activity is represented by his success in 1460 in persuadingthe Timurid ruler, who had meanwhile moved to Herat, to rescind the infam-ous market tax (tamgha). In other cases, particularly in his hometownTashkent, Ahrar paid excessive taxes out of his own purse to relieve theburden on the populace.5Less studied is the opposition which Ahrar encountered on the part of thereligious estate in Samarqand. This encompassed both fellow Sufi masters,especially of the ‘Ishqiyya brotherhood, and ulama under the leadership ofthe city’s Chief Jurisconsult. Part of the opposition must have derived fromthe envy awakened by Ahrar’s extensive economic base and wide politicalinfluence, and from the doubts they cast on the sincerity of his religiousmotivation.6 The Rashahat presents this envy, and the brutal punishment itentailed, as examples of the spiritual powers of the master,At that time there was in Tashkent a master who was followed inthese regions. He was knowledgeable in the external sciences and inthe Sufi sciences and he had innumerable disciples, so that he author-ized fifty of his companions to guide. When he saw that our noblemaster began to attract the capable he became jealous. One day hecame to his [Ahrar’s] assembly . . . to show his power and overcomehim. He sat with his face toward our noble master, fixing his eyes onhim and directing all his intention (himma) toward him to put aburden on the noble master. Our noble master . . . after a secondraised his blessed head and took his hand from his sleeve. In hishands was a kerchief, with which he stroked on his face saying: howcan I sit with a crazy deranged man that nothing of his knowledgeremained in his mind . . . When he rose up the [other] master shoutedgruesomely and fell unconscious . . . On the next day a melancholicdisturbance afflicted his mind to the degree that he forgot all hisknowledge, and he began wandering about naked in the alleys andmarkets oblivious to the need to protect and cover his body.7One day the noble master [Ahrar] was mentioned in the assemblyof Khwaja Mawlana [the Chief religious scholar of Samarqand].This said in violation of all etiquette: leave this dung beetle, whichhas no goal but to amass worldly possessions. When the master wastold about these words he said: he will die like a dung beetle . . .Khwaja Mawlana came to Herat as he could no longer stay inSamarqand. The great ones of Herat came to visit him once or twiceand saw him in an extremely confused and absent-minded state . . .In his last days he became sick and used laxatives for this sickness. Isometimes came to him during his sickness and saw him sitting in hisfilth and squalor . . . and so he died.838CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Yet religious hostility toward Ahrar was grounded in more profound fac-tors touching upon the very character of the Naqshbandiyya. Notwithstand-ing their common ground in the teaching of Ibn ‘Arabi, for the Sufi mastersAhrar was not only a threatening rival in the competition for disciples, butalso the most powerful representative of a “reformist” tradition that chal-lenged their spiritual beliefs and practices. The use of the complementarytechniques of suhba and rabita, along with the silent form of dhikr in thespiritual center that he established in the vicinity of Samarqand, were aconstant reminder of this critical attitude.Similarly, underlying the resistance of the ulama to Ahrar, despite hisprofessed orthodoxy, was not only the scholar’s suspicion of the mysticquest but also a different approach toward the shari‘a. For the ulama thediscovery and formulation of the divine will was an ongoing professionalproject, on which their religious authority was ultimately based. Ahrar, bycontrast, regarded the shari‘a as a general concept to be applied in thesocioeconomic and political fields against rival systems of law. His preten-sions to reach a qadi’s verdict without having any formal training served onlyto irritate the religious establishment. The ability of Ahrar’s successorsto soften such animosities by a more inclusive approach enabled theNaqshbandiyya to occupy in later Muslim history a special position as abridge between the Sufis and the ulama.Revival and universalization of the pathFollowing the death of ‘Ubaydullah Ahrar in 1490 the empire that he hadbuilt threatened to fall apart. The underlying reasons were the difficulty to fillthe void left by so dominant a personality, the usual struggles over the lead-ership among successors, the sheer vastness of his enterprise and the enor-mous wealth that was at stake, and the changes wrought on the politicalsituation in Central Asia by the establishment of Shaybanid Uzbek rule atthe turn of the sixteenth century. Friction was apparent already duringAhrar’s lifetime, as his two sons vied for his spiritual and material inherit-ance. The fortunes of the family were eclipsed when, following the conquestof Samarqand, Shaybani Khan (1501–1510) had the younger brother Yahyakilled for his role in organizing the resistance and confiscated his assets. Thesubsequent division of the Shaybanid domain among rival branches of theclan further hampered the integrity of the Naqshbandiyya. With its mastersseeking the patronage of various contenders, not only did their fate andactivity become subject to the political vagaries of the time, they were alsooften pitted one against the other.Still, the continuity of Ahrar’s project was secured, albeit with significantmodifications, through the work of two remarkable masters who lived in thefirst half of the sixteenth century. These were Muhammad Qazi (d. 1515),Ahrar’s disciple in Tashkent who steered the Naqshbandiyya in the stormy39CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"period of transition from Timurid to Shaybanid rule, and even more hisdeputy, Ahmad Kasani of Dahbid near Samarqand, better known asMakhdum-i A‘zam (d. 1542), who combined large political influence with animpressive scholarly endeavor to adjust its doctrines to the new circum-stances. These two masters departed from the path of Ahrar in adopting aninclusive attitude toward other mystical traditions. They also gave “official”approval to the principle of family succession which, although frequentlyused in practice, had been frowned upon in the early Khwajagan tradition.These innovations helped consolidate the Naqshbandiyya and paved the wayfor the position of dominance it would acquire in Central Asian Sufism inthe following centuries.After Ahmad Kasani’s death a serious split with both doctrinal andgeographical dimensions affected the ranks of the Naqshbandiyya. Theprotagonists were two of the major disciples of Kasani, Muhammad IslamJuybari of Bukhara (d. 1563) and Lutfullah Chusti (d. 1571), who estab-lished himself in Tashkent. Both circumvented Kasani’s own designated heir,his eldest son Muhammad Amin, who, it was claimed, had passed theleadership to either of them. Juybari concentrated on Ahrar’s economic andpolitical legacy, and founded a Naqshbandi dynasty whose economic inter-ests surpassed even those of the great master. He was less interested inexpanding the brotherhood and adopted a lenient attitude toward otherbrotherhoods. The Juybaris continued to thrive under the Astrakhanid dyn-asty well into the seventeenth century. Lutfullah Chusti, for his part, stroveto return to Ahrar’s original spiritual mission, and was active in propagatingthe Naqshbandiyya in the eastern part of Transoxiana at the expense of theKubrawiyya and Yasawiyya brotherhoods. He cherished spiritual rather thanphysical descendents.Figure 3.1Leading Central Asian Naqshbandis of the sixteenth century40CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Shaybanids were well aware of the social and political influenceexerted by the Naqshbandiyya. Shaybani Khan studied the religious sciencesfor two years in Bukhara, and was said to have paid a visit to Baha’uddin’sshrine in Qasr ‘Arifan before leaving for Turkistan, from where he began hismarch on Transoxiana. While in the city, he seems to have forged contactswith descendents of Muhammad Parsa, one of whom later headed the dele-gation of city notables that offered its capitulation to the Shaybanid army. InSamarqand, by contrast, Ahrar’s elder son ‘Abdallah chose to flee, whereasthe younger Yahya stayed to organize the defense of the city. Following itssurrender he was ordered to set out for the hajj, but was murdered togetherwith his sons on the way and his vast property was confiscated; it wasreturned to the family only in the 1540s. Shaybani Khan’s representative inthe negotiations during the siege of Samarqand was another disciple ofAhrar, who was rewarded with the post of shaykhulislam of the city.9Most important for the perpetuation of Ahrar’s legacy in this period oftransition was Muhammad Qazi, whom we have met as the master’s biog-rapher. Scion of an ulama family from Samarqand, Qazi began his spiritualpursuit in the ‘Ishqiyya brotherhood and joined Ahrar relatively late, around1480. Initially critical of the presence of rulers and high officials in the mas-ter’s mystic sessions, he soon changed his mind and became a major aide inthe political field. Qazi’s swift rise to a position of prominence aroused thejealousy of the veteran disciples, which forced him to leave for a while andstay with Jami in Herat. After Ahrar’s death he settled in Tashkent, where herenewed his political contacts while frequently traveling to the Ferghanavalley to guide disciples and settle disputes. Being denounced by hisNaqshbandi peers for introducing a forty-day fast, which Ahrar hadexplicitly forbidden, Qazi maintained, in a much more significant departurefrom the master’s way, that the Khwajagan tradition was universal andincluded practices of all mystical traditions. Qazi was unable to prevent theShaybanid conquest of Tashkent in 1503, so he astutely opted for the newpolitical masters and agreed to accompany them in their campaign againstBukhara. For the next six years he strove to spread his brand of theNaqshbandiyya in that city, but apparently with less success. In his finalyears he returned to Andijan in the Ferghana, where his sons continued hiswork after him.10Muhammad Qazi’s efforts were consolidated by his faithful deputy,Ahmad Kasani (Makhdum-i A‘zam). Although apparently the most out-standing figure in the Central Asian Naqshbandiyya after Ahrar, there is stillno detailed study in any western language of his several biographies or of thethirty or so treatises in which he expounded his teachings. Born into a cele-brated Sayyid family from Kasan in the district of Andijan, Ahmad acquireda profound religious education before joining Qazi’s circle. He accompaniedhis master on his travels but when, not unlike Qazi, he felt animosity on thepart of other disciples, he asked his permission to retire to his hometown,41CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"then in Moghul hands. Kasani took part in the defense of the Ferghanavalley against Shaybanid attack in 1510, but later fell foul of the Moghuls andaccepted the patronage of their rivals. Following the death of Qazi in 1515,he was able to secure his position as head of the Naqshbandiyya in theFerghana. Some time in the 1520s, at the invitation of the local ruler, Kasanimoved to Dahbid, where he established a religious-economic center knownas karkhane-i khwajagan (the Masters’ factory). Not unlike Ahrar’s enter-prise, this allowed Makhdum-i A‘zam to play a conspicuous political rolevis-à-vis the vying Shaybanid princelings and to patronize the lower strata ofsociety.11Ahmad Kasani combined this worldly activity with extensive writing onthe affairs of the brotherhood in which, in the footsteps of his master, headvocated not only political involvement for the implementation of the sha-ri‘a, but also the idea of the universality of the Naqshbandiyya. This wasbased on the claim that saints belonging to various traditions chose theirpath according to the particular circumstances of their time and place, andthat only those familiar with all paths may attain perfection. The practice ofthe vocal dhikr in the Khwajagan tradition before Baha’uddin, and even ofits special version of dhikr-i arra (recollection that sounds like sawing) whichwas introduced by Ahmad Yasawi in his brotherhood, are cases in point.Kasani also stressed the duty of the Naqshbandi masters to keep solidarityamong themselves and to spread the tradition wherever they could.12With Muhammad Islam Juybari and Lutfullah Chusti the difficulties ofPlate 3.2Makhdum-i A‘zam’s shrine in Dahbid42CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"maintaining a balance between the spiritual and worldly aspects of theNaqshbandiyya, which ultimately derive from the paradoxical principle ofsolitude in the crowd, came to the fore. Juybari embraced the Naqshbandiyyaunder the inspiration of Muhammad Qazi during the latter’s stay inBukhara, and then joined most other disciples in accepting Kasani’s author-ity. Gradually he became part of the master’s inner circle, and subsequently,at the end of a fierce succession struggle, he won the recognition of mostother disciples.Establishing himself in Bukhara, Juybari used his family connections topurchase vast landholdings and became involved in local politics. UnlikeAhrar however, his position was maintained at the cost of dependence on therulers, particularly ‘Abdallah Khan who took over Bukhara in 1557 andreunited the Shaybanid domains.13 With his consent, Juybari acquired asayyid status for his family and his own nomination as naqib al-ashraf (doyenof the Prophet’s descendents). His followers came mostly from the Bukharamilitary and religious elites, while the protection of the lower strata waslargely abandoned. Moreover, under the guise of the Malamati doctrine,Juybari neglected his duties as a spiritual guide, and made no effort topropagate the brotherhood outside his region. Yet, owing primarily to thepolitical nexus, Juybari was the founder of a Sufi dynasty from which in thefollowing centuries most influential Naqshbandi groups of Central Asiawould arise.14An essentially opposite direction was taken by Lutfullah Chusti, whostrove to preserve Ahrar’s legacy in the eastern part of Transoxiana. LikeJuybari, Chusti was a disciple of both Muhammad Qazi and Makhdum-iA‘zam. Following the latter’s death he moved to Tashkent, turning it into abase for propagating the path in his native Ferghana and in Hisar. Chusti’smethod was to send deputies to these regions with authorization to guidedisciples on their own. These activities were carried out in strong competi-tion with other Sufi brotherhoods, particularly the Kubrawiyya, who wereaccused of harboring Shi‘i sympathies. On the other hand, partly undoubt-edly due to his uncompromising character, Chusti failed to unite the localNaqshbandi groups under his own leadership. Similarly he was unable tosecure the support of the Shaybanid rulers, particularly after he quarreledwith Baraq Khan, the governor of Tashkent from 1552 to 1556. Therefore,although spiritual descendents of Chusti could be found in these regionseven in the early twentieth century, his line did not exert the influenceenjoyed by its Juybari counterparts to the west.15Expansion out of TransoxianaAlong with the incorporation of most Central Asian Naqshbandi groupsunder his authority, ‘Ubaydullah Ahrar is also credited with the expansionof the brotherhood to other parts of the Muslim world. His missionary zeal43CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"was directed mainly westward, toward Iran and Asia Minor. Ahrar’s princi-pal strategy was to send foreign disciples back to their native countries withauthorization to propagate the path on their own.The crystallization of new major Muslim empires in the early sixteenthcentury changed the geographical patterns of this expansion. Naqshbandipresence was gradually eliminated in Iran, which was turning Shi‘i underSafavid coercion, while it intensified under the Ottomans, then emerging asthe bastion of Sunnism. Most importantly, the brotherhood found a newhome in the Mughal Empire of India, which was founded in 1526 by aTimurid prince and Naqshbandi adept from the Ferghana valley. Finally, bythe second half of the century the Naqshbandiyya had acquired a para-mount position in Eastern Turkistan as the progeny of Ahmad Kasani, theMakhdumzade Khojas, established themselves in the Tarim basin. This sec-tion focuses on the dissemination of the Naqshbandiyya to western Asia andeastern Turkistan during the sixteenth century; the parallel establishment ofthe brotherhood on the Indian subcontinent is discussed at the beginning ofChapter 4, as a prelude to the establishment of the Mujaddidi offshoot.Contacts among Naqshbandi groups stretching over so vast an area, fromthe Balkans to the borders of China, could be at best tenuous; unlike inTransoxiana, decentralization remained the order of the day even whenbranches co-existed in the same region or the same city, most notably inIstanbul. Consequently, each Naqshbandi center developed the shared trad-ition according to local conditions, and relatively independent of the othersor of the original lines in Central Asia. Many masters also proved ready tocombine their path with the paths of the dominant Sufi traditions in theirregion. Diversity was most salient in the political field: the Ottoman Naqsh-bandis were basically quietist, their counterparts in India invariably soughtthe proximity of the rulers, and the Khojas of Eastern Turkistan becamethemselves the rulers. Above this diversity, however, not least in response tothe rising Shi‘i challenge from Iran, a general tendency emerged among theNaqshbandi masters of the sixteenth century to emphasize the orthodoxy oftheir brotherhood. This stress was given a definite shape, though not withoutits own paradoxes, in the teaching of Ahmad Sirhindi, the founder of theMujaddidi offshoot in India.Western AsiaThe introduction of the Naqshbandiyya into western Asia was connectedwith the process of Ottoman state building and the search for an orthodoxalternative to the unruly dervish fraternities that had accompanied the con-quest of Anatolia. Sultan Bayazid I, who initiated the first attempt to createa unified Ottoman state in the late fourteenth century, drew Khwajagan mas-ters to his court, among them a son of Amir Kulal, Amir Sultan (1368–1429), who even became his son-in-law.16 The Naqshbandiyya established a44CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"firm foothold in the Ottoman domains during the reign of SultanMehmed II, conqueror of Constantinople/Istanbul in 1451. Most import-ant among the masters who furthered the path in the city at this initialstage were ‘Abdullah Ilahi and his deputy Ahmad Bukhari, both disciplesof Ahrar. The brotherhood acquired a firm presence in Istanbul and innearby Bursa, second only to the influential Khalwatiyya, and by the mid-seventeenth century could boast of twelve active lodges (tekkes). It wasless successful in the provincial towns of Anatolia and Rumeli or in thecountryside.Naqshbandi presence was felt earlier in the Arab lands owing to the pil-grimage undertaken by many masters and through the work of disciples ofAhrar who stayed in the Hijaz to propagate the path. In the late sixteenthcentury Ahmed Sadiq Tas ̧kandi, a disciple of Islam Juybari, turned his atten-tion also to the Arab provinces, now under Ottoman rule; later on he settledin Istanbul to found another lasting Naqshbandi line in the capital.Naqshbandi activity in Arabia, as well as in Kurdistan, began in earnest onlyFigure 3.2Major Naqshbandi lines in Istanbul during the sixteenth century45CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"in the seventeenth century and therefore will be dealt with in the nextchapters.‘Abdullah Ilahi was a native of Simav in western Anatolia, who acquiredthe religious sciences in Istanbul before traveling east in pursuit of spiritualguidance. He completed the path with Ahrar, and then was sent as deputyback to Anatolia. On the way he visited Jami, who converted him to Ibn‘Arabi’s teachings. Ilahi returned to his hometown and established animpressive circle of followers. Loath to seek publicity by nature, he moved toIstanbul only after much hesitation in 1481, settling in a dilapidated collegein the Fateh quarter. He soon attracted the attention of the city elite andhigh-ranking ‘ulama, which ultimately caused him to leave for a secludedplace in Rumeli. Ilahi’s last years were spent in writing on Sufi matters, par-ticularly in expounding the Malamati tradition and the intricacies of wahdatal-wujud.17The task of establishing the Naqshbandiyya in Istanbul was thus left tothe more practical Ahmad Bukhari, Ilahi’s faithful companion and foremostdeputy. A grandson of Khwaja Mahmud Faghnavi and a disciple of Ahrar, itwas Bukhari who provided a solid material base for the operation of thebrotherhood in the Ottoman capital by establishing three lodges; the mostprominent among them, in Fateh, continued to exist for at least three cen-turies. Like his master, Bukhari gathered a large body of committed fol-lowers, most of them from among the elite. These he guided through a“distinct way,” consisting of perpetual silent dhikr, concentration on God,and strict observance of the Sunna and shari‘a.Bukhari’s successors throughout the sixteenth century (see Figure 3.2) fol-lowed in his footsteps in their strict orthodoxy, as well as in appealing to thereligious scholars, expanding the material base of their brotherhood, andseeking the patronage of the elite. The foremost among them, MahmudÇelebi of Fateh, attracted many scholars by teaching Rumi’s Mathnawi,while Hekim Çelebi of Izmit exploited his influence over the Grand Vizier topersecute the Shi‘i Kizilbash of eastern Anatolia.18 Several of the Naqsh-bandi masters of Bursa also belonged to this line, principally the native poetand writer Mahmud Lami‘i Çelebi (d. 1531), who perpetuated the literarymodels of Jami and Nava’i.19Other Naqshbandi masters arrived in the Ottoman capital from Transoxi-ana, directly or via Iran or India, before as well as after ‘Abdullah Ilahi. Oneof the earliest was Ishaq Bukhari Hindi, for whom Sultan Mehmed II (1451–1481) is said to have endowed the first center of the brotherhood in Istanbul,the Hindiler Tekkesi. The stream of Naqshbandis who came to the city wasswollen in the sixteenth century by pilgrims who assembled there to join theorganized caravan to the Hijaz after it became an Ottoman domain, and byrefugees from Safavid Iran who preferred to live under Sunni government.Among the latter was Sun‘ullah Kuzakunani of Ardabil (d. 1576), the onlymissionary master of note hailing from the Kashghari line of Herat, who46CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"was brought to Istanbul following his flight to Aleppo.20 Many of thesemasters combined their Naqshbandi affiliation with other Central AsianSufi traditions. Such was the case of Shaykh Khazini, a follower of theNaqshbandiyya, Yasawiyya, and Kubrawiyya, who practiced the vocal dhikrwhich he justified by asserting that not the form of the recollection of Godwas important but its intention.21More important still was the aforementioned Ahmed Sadiq Tas ̧kandi,scion of a venerable sayyid family from Bukhara who through a successionof pilgrimages spread the brotherhood in the Arab lands, particularlyDamascus and Jerusalem. He also authorized a local disciple to compose thefirst known treatise on the Naqshbandi lineage in Arabic. Upon arriving inIstanbul toward the end of his life, Tas ̧kandi may have initiated into thebrotherhood the pious Sultan Murad III (1574–1595), who sponsored thefirst Turkish translation of the Rashahat. Tas ̧kandi’s son, Ziya’uddinAhmed, took over the Bukhari tekke in Fateh in 1593; it stayed in thefamily’s possession for almost two centuries, well after the advent of theMujaddidiyya.22Eastern TurkistanEarly traces of the Naqshbandiyya in Altishahr (the six oasis cities of theTarim basin in today’s Chinese province of Xinjiang) go back to the latefourteenth or early fifteenth century. Gradually it gained ground here at theexpense of the Yasawiyya, particularly after the Holy family of Kucha, theKataki, who were the first to convert a Mongol ruler to Islam, transformeditself into a Naqshbandi line and adopted the title of Khwaja. The brother-hood spread among the Moghul nobility and the settled population of theoases, but also among the nomads in the surrounding regions. At the sametime it retained the indigenous emphasis on saint veneration and miracles,which Khwajagan elsewhere usually abhorred. The Naqshbandis of theTarim kept firm connections with their colleagues in Transoxiana, and manyset out westward to study with its great masters. Among them was Sa‘duddinof Kashghar, the founder of the major Naqshbandi line in Herat. Anotherimportant master was Tajuddin Kataki (d. ca.1533), a disciple of Ahrar, whopropagated the path farther east among the Uighurs, then inhabiting the vastarea between the Turpan region and the Jiayuguan Fort in Gansu, until hewas killed in a fight with the Chinese. Two grandsons of Ahrar, MuhammadYusuf (d. 1530) and Mahmud Nura (d. 1536), vied for primacy in Altishahritself, but when the former died the latter went on to India.23Naqshbandi activity in Eastern Turkistan was consolidated in the secondhalf of the sixteenth century under the domination of the Makhdumzadelineage. Makhdum-i A‘zam himself seems to have acquired some influence inYarkand, where he was granted several endowments, but he never visitedthe region in person.24 It was his son Ishaq who established the family in the47CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"oases of the Tarim basin. Ishaq Wali (d. 1599) was a formidable rival of theJuybaris, to whom his elder brother had passed the Naqshbandi leadershipof Transoxiana. When he fell foul of the Uzbek ruler ‘Abdallah Khan II inthe 1580s, he dispatched some disciples to Altishahr and then went therehimself. Capitalizing on his descent, his spiritual charisma, and his loyaldisciples, Ishaq was soon able to establish himself as head of the variousNaqshbandi masters in the country.The Ishaqiyya, as Ishaq Wali’s group came to be known, expanded theinfluence of the Naqshbandiyya among the common folk in the Altishahroases, as well as among the nomadic Kirghiz peoples in the Pamir and TianShan mountains to their west. Most importantly, Ishaq Wali became deeplyinvolved in local Moghul politics, when in 1591 he helped place his discipleMuhammad Khan on the throne. Later on Muhammad was named Ishaq’ssuccessor, thereby combining the Naqshbandiyya with Chaghataid royalty.This move paved the way to the seizure of the Moghul throne by theMakhdumzade Khojas in the seventeenth century.2548CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"4SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THEGREAT EMPIRES (SIXTEENTH TOEIGHTEENTH CENTURIES)The Naqshbandiyya spread into the Indian subcontinent in the footsteps ofthe conquering Timurid army. Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire in1526, belonged to a family which had been closely allied to ‘UbaydullahAhrar, and was himself tutored by one of the foremost disciples of themaster in Ferghana. His successors’ commitment to the brotherhood wasless pronounced as they became enmeshed in the Indian environment, butit nonetheless remained substantial owing to their Central Asia connec-tions. Among the Naqshbandis who settled in Mughal India were severaldescendents of Ahrar; these were normally integrated into the religious-administrative elite. They were followed by practicing masters, who in thenext two centuries disseminated the Naqshbandi path in different parts ofthe country. Most consequential among them was Baqi Billah inDelhi who, unlike his colleagues, did not confine his activities to theforeign Mughal elite but propagated the tariqa also among the localpopulation. Among his disciples was Ahmad Sirhindi, the founder of theMujaddidiyya, which in due course superseded almost all other Naqshbandilines in India.The Mujaddidiyya derives its name from the role of renewer of the millen-nium (mujaddid-i alf-i thani), which was ascribed to Sirhindi by his disciplesfollowing his own allusions. Ahmad Sirhindi received more scholarly atten-tion than any other master in the history of the Naqshbandiyya. This wasinitially due to the appropriation of his image by the modern Pakistaninational movement, though his prominence lay rather in the spiritual-intellectual sphere. Sirhindi’s major achievements were in forging a freshcombination of the mystic path and the shari‘a, and in adding a new dimen-sion to the Sufi tradition through the concept of wahdat al-shuhud (unity ofperception). A controversial figure in his own lifetime and after, Sirhindisucceeded in propagating his message above all by the “Indianization” of histariqa. The subsequent dwindling of immigration from Central Asia in thewake of the disintegration of the Mughal Empire in the eighteenth centuryleft the Mujaddidiyya the only viable Naqshbandi offshoot in India. The49"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"spread of the Mujaddidiyya to other parts of the Muslim world, particularlythe Ottoman Empire and Central Asia, and its relations with the originalNaqshbandiyya of these regions, will be dealt with in the next chapter.Subscribing to the practice of familial heredity, Ahmad Sirhindi nomin-ated three of his offspring as consecutive successors, describing them as hisheirs to the lofty degree of sustainer of the world (qayyum). In the wake ofthe destruction of Sirhind by the Sikhs in the mid-eighteenth century, theactivity of the Mujaddidiyya was dispersed between competing branches ofthe family in the capital Delhi and in the Punjab. The brotherhood wasreunited and reformed in the circumstances of the Mughal decline throughthe leadership of Mazhar Jan-i Janan in Delhi, who abandoned the endeavorto influence the rulers and focused his attention instead on protecting theintegrity of the Muslim community. His enterprise was continued by hissuccessor, Ghulam ‘Ali, who following the British conquest of Delhi in 1803turned his attention from the Indian environment to the Muslim world atlarge. Contemporary Naqshbandi masters in the Mughal capital adoptedalternative courses, making them precursors of the modern transformationsin the Naqshbandiyya. Nasir ‘Andalib and his son Mir Dard found refuge inthe poetry of the “Muhammadan way,” whereas Shah Waliullah turned tothe sciences of hadith.The new emphases in the teachings of the Naqshbandiyya-Mujaddidiyyawere conveyed through a variety of mediums, from “official” hagiographiesand doctrinal treatises to records of mystical discourses and collections ofletters. In the Indian Mujaddidi tradition, of special importance were theletters through which masters guided their disciples or addressed public fig-ures. The example was set by Sirhindi himself in what came to be known asMaktubat Imam-i Rabbani (Letters of the Divine Master). It was compiledduring his lifetime in three consecutive volumes which betray the evolutionof his mystical thought.Another important genre for the study of the Naqshbandiyya during thisperiod is the general biographical dictionaries. These usually focus on thechains of teachers and students that constitute the backbone of the religiousestate. In this chapter and the next we use two major works of this kind,representing two modes of organization of the material, the temporal andthe spatial; both were written by scholars who were themselves related tothe Naqshbandiyya. In the Indian case this is ‘Abd al-Hayy al-Hasani’sNuzhat al-khawatir wa-bahjat al-masami‘ wa’l-nawazir, which deals with themen of religion of the subcontinent from earliest times to the author’scontemporaries in the early twentieth century.Our knowledge about the Mujaddidiyya is more advanced than it is aboutthe original Naqshbandiyya. Still, especially in the Indian sphere, there is acertain imbalance in the scholarly literature, which has focused on the ideasof the towering figures of Sirhindi and Waliullah at the expense of othermasters and aspects of the brotherhood. Moreover, with some notable50SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"exceptions much of the research is lacking in scientific standards, and inrecent years it has almost come to a standstill.Arrival in the Indian subcontinentThe first Naqshbandis arrived in India with Babur, a Chaghataid-Timuridprinceling from Andijan who after establishing himself in Kabul invadednorth India and made Agra his capital in 1526. Babur was a grandson ofAbu Sa‘id, the ruler of Samarqand under whom Ahrar had acquired hispolitical clout, and was himself tutored by one of the influential disciples ofthe master in the Ferghana valley who became his adviser when, still a boy,he ascended the throne. Later on the young ruler tried to gain the support ofAhrar’s son Yahya in Samarqand, but on account of the Uzbek victories hewas finally driven out of Transoxiana and turned southwards. There is nodoubt that Babur was an ardent admirer of Ahrar, as is evident inter aliafrom the versified translation into Turkish which he prepared of one of hisepistles. Makhdum-i A‘zam, the contemporary leader of the Central AsianNaqshbandiyya, then dedicated a treatise to the new Indian sovereign,Risala-i baburiyya, which included commentary on his poetry along withdirectives for government.1As Indian rulers, Babur’s successors on the Mughal throne had to paymore attention to the established brotherhoods in South Asia: the Qadiriyya,the Shattariyya, and above all the Chishtiyya. Nevertheless, the countryremained a major attraction for Central Asian Naqshbandis, who were inte-grated into the mostly foreign administrative-religious elite and were allowedwide scope for action. The immigrants included members of the principalNaqshbandi dynasties, as well as spiritual masters imbued with missionaryzeal. Among the first were two grandsons of Ahrar. One who had arrivedfrom Eastern Turkistan left, disgusted by the dependence of EmperorHumayun (1530–1540, 1555–1556) on a Shattari Sufi, while the otherremained and spent his life in Mughal service. Under Akbar (1556–1605),the consolidator of the Mughal Empire, the stream of Central AsianNaqshbandis greatly accelerated, among them members of the Juybarifamily who fell foul of the new Astrakhanid rulers in Bukhara. Interested inhigh civil and military posts rather than in the mystical path, the newcomersusually supported the syncretistic religious policy that Akbar adopted after1579. Naqshbandis were also often employed as ambassadors from theMughal court to the Turkish dynasties of Transoxiana, not least in thecommon struggle against Safavid Iran.2More important for the establishment of the Naqshbandiyya in India werepracticing masters who throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuriesspread out to various parts of the subcontinent. Such masters considerablydiffered in terms of their backgrounds and the ways in which they performedtheir task. While most of them still await a serious study, the few existing51SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"monographs may help us form a picture of the common modalities oftheir work on the one hand, and isolate the particular features that explainthe ultimate success of the Mujaddidiyya on the other. The monographs atour disposal are those of Khawand Mahmud, who introduced the Naqsh-bandiyya into Kashmir in the early seventeenth century, and of Palangposhand Baba Musafir, who brought the brotherhood to the Deccan toward theend of that century. Their activity will be contrasted with that of Baqi Billah,a contemporary of Khawand Mahmud, who implanted the Naqshbandiyyain the heartlands of the Mughal Empire and recruited to its ranks theseminal figure of Ahmad Sirhindi.Khwaja Khawand Mahmud (1563–1642) was a descendent of ‘Ala’uddin‘Attar and a disciple of Ishaq Wali Dahbidi, founder of the Ishaqiyyabranch in Eastern Turkistan. Like Ahrar, in his youth Mahmud abandonedhis formal religious studies in favor of the mystical quest. He was authorizedas Ishaq’s deputy in 1598 and was sent to propagate the path in Lahore.Instead he stopped in Srinagar, Kashmir, which had been incorporated intothe Mughal Empire in 1586. Unlike previous Naqshbandi masters in theregion, Mahmud attracted not only official patronage but also a wide popu-lar following. His estimated fifteen deputies, however, were almost all ofCentral Asian origin. Two of these were sent to propagate the path in Tibet.Khawand Mahmud undertook several journeys to Agra, but was unable toforge firm connections in the court of Jahangir (r. 1605–1627), partly becauseof the influence of Naqshbandis attached to the rival Juybari line. Back inKashmir he became entangled in the local struggle against the substantialShi‘i community, and as a result in 1636 Emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1657)summoned him to Delhi and banned his return to Srinagar. KhawandMahmud spent the last six years of his life in Lahore, to which he had beenoriginally assigned by his master. He was succeeded in Kashmir by hislearned son and biographer Mu‘inuddin (d. 1674), followed successively byhis progeny until the line died out in the late eighteenth century.3Baba Muhammad Sa‘id Palangposh (d. 1699) and his disciple Baba ShahMuhammad Musafir (d. 1714) were natives of Ghijduwan and belonged to alocal Naqshbandi lineage that also returned to Makhdum-i A‘zam. The twoarrived in India in 1675 and followed the army of Awrangzeb, the last greatMughal emperor (1658–1707), to the Deccan. They represented two differenttypes of Sufis. Palangposh, literally ‘Leopard-clad,’ moved with a retinue ofattendants (darvishes) in the fashion of the unruly Qalandars to aid theforces in battle through his powers of concentration (tawajjuh). The twoaspects of his spirituality are vividly described by his biographer.With 40,000 men under his command Ghazi al-Din Khan wasappointed to pursue the enemy separately with his own forces andattack them wherever they spread out. When his forces went to war,they saw that Hazrat Baba Palangposh always went forward in front52SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"of the army of Islam and would loose arrows upon the army ofunbelievers. When Ghazi al-Din’s men saw his blessed beauty, eventhough their numbers were small, they would launch themselvescourageously upon the foe and gain the victory.4Around 150 to 200 men, faqirs of Wilayat [Transoxiana], wearingquivers, went beside his bridle. Another band, bareheaded and bare-foot, who had nothing but a single loincloth on the bodies, acquiredfelicity by looking after the horses and camels and other tasks . . .These faqirs, as they were seekers of God and believers in HazratPalangposh, considered the hardships by night and day to be the bestof comforts and heaped up the treasure of the last days. BabaPalangposh, as his were a broad way and a generous nature, inaccordance with the path of the Qalandars and with peace towardsthe rest of mankind, bestowed the glance of compassion upon all,whether stranger or acquaintance, king or beggar.5The austere Baba Musafir, by contrast, settled in the new capital Auranga-bad, where he founded the impressive Panchakki shrine. Little interested indisseminating the Naqshbandi path among the local population, he attracteddisciples and followers almost exclusively among Central Asian immigrantslike himself. His successor, Baba Shah Mahmud (d. 1761), further expandedthe lodge with the support of the first Nizam of Hyderabad, who broke offfrom the Mughal government in the north in 1722. Mahmud is the author ofthe hagiographical work on Palangposh and Musafir on which this analysislargely relies, lately translated into English by Simon Digby. By his time, thisNaqshbandi line was already in decline owing to the dwindling of immigra-tion from Central Asia. The Panchakki shrine became the private propertyof his descendents, who lived off the large land grants attached to it until thelast of them died without heirs in 1916.6 Today it is managed under thesupervision of the ministry of endowments by a Chishti-Qadiri master,the aged Shah Muhammad ‘Abd al-Rashid Vahdati, who by virtue of hisposition claims to be affiliated also with the Naqshbnadiyya.7Unlike the above masters, who regarded themselves and were perceived asforeigners, Muhammad Baqi Billah (1563–1603) held a middle positionbetween Central Asia and India. Sayyid Raziuddin, known to posterity asBaqi Billah (lit. abiding in God) was born in Kabul into a religious familythat originated from Samarqand. Since his youth he had been attracted tothe Sufi traditions of his fathers’ homeland and several times journeyednorthward in search of enlightenment. On the last visit, which followed atwo-year sojourn with a Naqshbandi master in Kashmir, Baqi Billah joinedthe circle of Khwajagi Amkanagi (d. 1599), an eminent spiritual descendentof Ahrar in Samarqand. He was allegedly ordained as deputy in three days,before being sent back to India. Staying for fourteen months in Lahore, BaqiBillah arrived in Delhi in 1599 and in the four years that he spent until his53SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"untimely death in that city, not the capital but still in convenient proximity tothe Mughal court, he dedicated himself to the propagation of the Naqsh-bandi tradition. Though it is not easy to disentangle Baqi Billah’s teachingsfrom the ideas of his illustrious disciple Sirhindi, they appear to haverevolved around two axes which he regarded as perfectly compatible. Onewas strict adherence to the shari‘a, the other Ibn ‘Arabi’s doctrine of unityof being.8To promote his work in Delhi, Baqi Billah pursued two parallel courses.On the one hand, like Khawand Mahmud, Baba Musafir, and many othermasters, he sought the patronage of influential nobles of Central Asian ori-gins, who helped him find a lodge and financed his activities. On the otherhand, contrary to his Naqshbandi colleagues, Baqi Billah ordained a numberof remarkable local deputies, who secured the implantation of the Naqsh-bandiyya in South Asia and beyond. Prominent among these was Husamud-din Ahmad, who after the master’s death looked to the education of hisinfant sons, ‘Ubaydullah (Khwaja Kalan) and ‘Abdallah (Khwaja Khurd);these two, who inherited the lodge in Delhi, remained deeply devoted to Ibn‘Arabi’s teaching and favored musical sessions (sama‘).9 Also prominent wereShaykh Ilahadad and Shaykh Tajuddin, who unsuccessfully vied for theleadership of the brotherhood. The latter subsequently left for the Hijaz, andhis activity there will be discussed in the next chapter; and finally ShaykhPlate 4.1Master and disciples at Panchakki shrine, Aurangabad54SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Ahmad Sirhindi, whose path was in the long run not only to supersede mostother Naqshbandi lines in India, but also to give a new thrust to the historyof the brotherhood in general.10Shaykh Ahmad SirhindiMuslim historians sympathetic to the idea of Pakistan appropriated AhmadSirhindi as a precursor of Muslim communalism in South Asia. Accordingto them, he strongly reacted against the religious experiments of EmperorAkbar and brought about a gradual change in the religious attitude of theMughal rulers. This construction is based on episodes in Sirhindi’s biog-raphy which recorded his demand that Jahangir be prevailed upon by hisministers to stay away from the “heresies” of his father, as well as on somestatements in his writings, such as the assertion that it is incumbent upon theNaqshbandi master to approach the ruler in order to guide him on the pathof the shari‘a. These efforts, which echo the political work of Ahrar, are saidto have borne fruit in the religious policies of the pious Awrangzeb.11Rival historians, generally supported by Western scholarship, have demon-strated that neither Sirhindi nor any of his descendents had exercised anynotable influence on the evolution of Indian politics.12 Indeed, in the demo-graphic realities of the subcontinent, where Muslims always remained aminority, discriminating against Hindus was ultimately harmful to theinterests of the state. It was in the Sunni Muslim majority countries to whichthe Mujaddidiyya subsequently spread that the orthodox and activist dimen-sions of Sirhindi’s teaching could be put into practice. This was especiallythe case with Khalid al-Baghdadi who, at the head of his own Khalidi off-shoot, disseminated the path in the Ottoman lands in the early nineteenthcentury.In any event, politics was only one dimension in Ahmad Sirhindi’s overallmystical project; the final success of his Mujaddidi offshoot in India was aresult of a combination of other factors. One was his impressive intellectualFigure 4.1The lineages deriving from Baqi Billah55SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"abilities, which are plainly demonstrated in the theoretical depth of his Sufithought in general and in the forceful formulations he gave to the Naqsh-bandi teaching in particular. Secondly, unlike other Naqshbandi masters inIndia, Sirhindi was a native of the country and well versed in its scholarlyand mystical traditions. Related to this is that, like his Central Asian con-temporaries, he adopted an inclusive approach toward other brotherhoods,remaining affiliated with some of them under the overall Naqshbandiumbrella. Finally, Sirhindi laid the foundations for the organizational net-work of the Mujaddidiyya by sending deputies to propagate the path in thetowns of India, and even more so by ordering, in parallel to similar devel-opments in the Makhdumzade and Juybari lines, that the leadership devolveupon his descendents. For his followers, the greatness of Sirhindi was provenby innumerable miraculous deeds which, his devaluation of miracles not-withstanding, fill the pages of the hagiographies composed by his disciples.Central among these are Hazarat al-Quds (The Presences of Holiness) byBadr al-Din Sirhindi and Zubdat al-Maqamat (The Quintessence of MysticalStates) by Muhammad al-Hashim al-Kishmi al-Badakhshani.Ahmad Sirhindi was born in 1564 into a family of scholarly standing inthe Punjab. After attaining a thorough religious education he left at the ageof twenty for Agra, where he established contacts with leading scholars atAkbar’s court. Allegedly taken aback by their “free thinking”, he returnedhome to follow the Sufi path under his father, ‘Abd al-Ahad, a master in theQadiriyya and Chishtiyya brotherhoods and an admirer of Ibn ‘Arabi.13 Atthat time Ahmad also wrote several scholarly works, including a vindicationof the orthodox view of prophecy, Ithbat al-nubuwa, and a refutation of theShi‘i creed, Radd-i rawafiz. Following the father’s death Sirhindi intended toperform the hajj, but while in Delhi he was introduced to Baqi Billah andstayed with him. Completing the path within three months in 1599, theimpressed master nominated him deputy. The transformation that Sirhindiunderwent during that time is indicated in his first Sufi compilation, Mabda’wa-ma‘ad (The Crux of the Matter).14After Baqi Billah’s death Sirhindi quarreled with the other deputies overboth the leadership and points of doctrine. He devoted himself to the propa-gation of his path, authorizing numerous disciples who carried his messagefrom Sirhind to the major urban centers of north India. Occasionally, hewould also urge high officials in Jahangir’s court to impress upon theemperor his duty to implement the shari‘a. In 1619 Sirhindi was summonedto Agra and imprisoned, either for his arrogance, as Jahangir himself wrote,or because of the renewed Shi‘i influence in the court, as the master’s bio-graphers maintain. On his release a year later he chose to remain in the royalcamp and returned to Sirhind only shortly before his death in 1624.15Understanding the mystical teachings of Ahmad Sirhindi is largely a mat-ter of hermeneutics, which engaged his Mujaddidi followers and adversariesalike, as well as modern scholars. This derives partly from the complexity of56SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"his ideas and partly from the nature of the genre in which they were con-veyed. Rather than a coherent exposition, as a Sufi master Sirhindi chose toexpress himself on an ongoing basis through letters in which he responded todisciples’ questions or addressed men of prominence. These were collectedduring his lifetime in three consecutive volumes under his own direction.16Extending over a quarter of a century, the ideas contained in the letters wereaffected by the circumstances in which each was written, as well as by shiftsin the author’s emphases over time. A detailed analysis of Sirhindi’s doc-trines is beyond the scope of this book; we will only touch on some majorthemes that run through his whole edifice. These revolve around the adventof the millennium, the relationship between shari‘a and tariqa, the Sufitradition, the Naqshbandiyya brotherhood, and the Indian environment.17Ahmad Sirhindi’s thought was anchored in the general messianic fervorthat swept India toward the advent of the first Muslim millennium in 1591.18Sirhindi describes a fundamental transformation in the hierarchy of spiritual“realities” according to which the lower haqiqat-i Muhammadi ascended tounite with the higher haqiqat-i Ka‘ba while receiving the name haqiqat-iAhmadi. Beyond this is the haqiqat-i ilahi, the reality of God as such. Thiscorresponded to the disappearance of Muhammad’s worldly individuation(ta‘ayyun), its symbol in the first mim of his name being replaced by an alifstanding for divinity (uluhiyyat) and thus becomes Ahmad, which alsoPlate 4.2Present master at the tomb shrine of Ahmad Sirhindi57SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"happens to be Sirhindi’s first name. As a result, he claims, the communitylost the prophetic guidance and sank into infidelity and unlawful innovation.The decline of the Muslim community will be reversed, however, with theappearance of the renewer of the millennium (mujaddid-i alf-i thani), laterreferred to more modestly as “one of the community” (fard-i ummat) butalso as “the sustainer of creation” (qayyum), who revives the faith andthrough whose mediation God grants all people existence and all outer andinner perfections. Sirhindi did not identify himself explicitly with either ofthese figures, but this is not far below the surface.19 Thus he writes in a letterto a trusted disciple:I am both the seeker of God (murid Allah) and God’s desired (muradAllah). The chain of my discipleship is connected with God the mostexalted without any mediation and my hand is the substitute for thehand of God the most exalted. My discipleship is connected withMuhammad the messenger of God, pray and peace upon him,through many intermediaries: in the Naqshbandi brotherhoodbetween me and him are twenty-one intermediaries, in the Qadiribrotherhood twenty-five intermediaries, and in the Chishti brother-hood twenty-seven intermediaries . . . Hence I am both a disciple ofMuhammad the messenger of God and share with him the samepreceptor.20Many statements in Ahmad Sirhindi’s writings testify that he regarded theSunna of the Prophet and the shari‘a as superior to Sufism. The object of themystical quest, according to him, is not knowledge of the unseen butincreased certainty in one’s faith and ease in performing the religious duties.He also warns that on the day of resurrection people will be asked abouttheir adherence to the shari‘a, not about their tariqa. On the other hand,Sirhindi’s concept of Islamic law is rarely that of the jurists. He ratheremphasizes the inner aspect of the shari‘a, which entails a proper under-standing of the ambiguous verses of the Qur’an (mutashabihat). Such under-standing is the fruit of following the Sufi path. In other words, tariqa is theservant of the shari‘a, but its service is essential for making obedience to theshari‘a complete. The ulama, the guardians of the law, are correspondinglydivided by Sirhindi into two types: the worldly scholars (‘ulama’-i zawahir),who are captivated by the form of the shari‘a and rely on the unequivocalverses of the Qur’an (muhkamat), and the profound scholars (‘ulama’-irasikhan), who delve into the essence of the shari‘a and are no other but thetrue Sufis.21Other basic concepts in the Islamic tradition receive the same dialecticaltreatment. Most important in this respect are the concepts of infidelity andprophecy. Sirhindi naturally confirms the absolute opposition between Islamand infidelity (kufr): they are “two antidotes that will not meet until the58SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"arrival of the hour of resurrection. Reinforcing the one demands eliminationof the other and honoring the one requires humiliation of the other.”22 On ahigher, mystical level, however, they represent consecutive stages on themystical path. Sufi infidelity occurs in the state of unity (jam‘), in whichthe wayfarer is annihilated in God (fana’) and forgets everything else, eventhe distinction between Creator and creature. Sufis in this state should not bepunished since they are overwhelmed by the love of God. Sufi Islam reflectsthe state of separation following unity (farq ba‘d jam‘), in which the wayfarersubsists in God (baqa’) while regaining all distinctions. In this stage Sufism isunited with the essence of the shari‘a.23Likewise, prophecy (nubuwa) is not only the mission of a person sent byGod but also, in conjunction with sainthood (walaya), the culmination of themystical journey. Whereas sainthood is characterized by mystical intoxica-tion (sukr), the prophet is privileged to return to sobriety (sahw) and guidethe people to God. In contrast with the historical prophecy which has beensealed with Muhammad, mystical prophecy thus never ceases.24This brings us to what is perhaps the most intricate aspect of AhmadSirhindi’s thought, namely his attitude to Ibn ‘Arabi and the central conceptassociated with his name, wahdat al-wujud. Modernist writers have depictedIbn ‘Arabi’s theory as irrational monism, detrimental to both the survival ofthe Muslim community in India and to its modernization, and Sirhindi ascompletely rejecting it.25 Yet as Friedmann and ter Haar have shown,although criticizing certain aspects of the Great Master’s teaching, Sirhindihighly appreciated his contribution to Sufi thought. Moreover, he excused hiscontroversial utterances as equivalent to the innocent errors of a mujtahidand, in line with his open attitude toward other Sufis, including the intoxi-cated Bayazid Bistami and Husayn ibn Mansur al-Hallaj, he regarded themas legitimate expressions of the mystical experience.Sirhindi maintained that the wujudi utterance “all is He” (hame ust) doesnot imply that God dwells in the material world or is united with it, but onlythat beings are manifestations of the Divine Essence. It is thus actually iden-tical with the orthodox “all is from Him” (hame az ust). On the other hand,over against wahdat al-wujud Sirhindi places wahdat al-shuhud, the unity ofperception, a higher stage in which God is perceived as one and completelydifferent from his creation.26 This leads to the ultimate stage of certitude,which is nothing but servitude to God.27As for the Naqshbandi tradition, Sirhindi stresses time and again that it isbuilt on the twin foundations of strict observance of the shari‘a and fullsubmission to the perfect master. The first, he points out, entails not onlydistancing oneself from what is forbidden but also from what is permitted byway of dispensation. Accordingly, although innovations may have crept eveninto the Naqshbandiyya, it generally shuns objectionable customs prevalentamong the Sufis, such as music, dancing, and ecstatic sessions. Miraculousdeeds are also of no consequence, the true import of the saint being in59SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"observing the law and attracting others to God. Sirhindi does not condemnsuch practices, but insists on the exclusive practice of the silent dhikr. Hisattitude is epitomized in his stress on the Bakri lineage of the Naqshbandiyya,which set it apart from the other brotherhoods that trace their origins to ‘Ali.The second foundation is the embodiment of the practice of companionship(suhba) between master and disciple, supplemented by the mutual techniquesof “attention” (tawajjuh) and “bond” (rabita), the latter commonly referredto in India as annihilation in the master (fana’ fi’l-shaykh). In parallel to hismystical interpretation of the shari‘a, Sirhindi identifies the Naqshbandiyyawith the way of the Prophet’s Companions, which leads to the perfections ofprophecy. Owing to these characteristics, he claims, the Naqshbandiyya isthe shortest and most effective way to reach the mystical goal:The attainment of this great state depends in this time on allegianceto the exalted Naqshbandi group and direction toward them. Whathappens in one association (suhba) with them cannot be attained byhard spiritual exercises and arduous effort over a long time. This isbecause in the path of these Great Ones the end is included in thebeginning (indiraj al-nihaya fi ’l-bidaya) . . . The path of these GreatOnes is the path of the noble Companions (tariqat al-sahaba). Whatthese obtained at the beginning of their accompaniment of the bestof humankind [the Prophet Muhammad] is rarely achieved by thesaints of this community at the end of the path.28“The inclusion of the end in the beginning,” a principle already attributedto Baha’uddin Naqshband, implies that the Naqshbandi adept begins hismystical journey where other Sufis end theirs; it is thus the epitome of thesuperiority of the Naqshbandiyya over all other brotherhoods. This meansthat through his direction the master shares his advanced stage with hisbeginning disciple, and thus enables him to reach closer to God than in otherbrotherhoods. Put differently, this mystical inversion is an expression of theprecedence in the Naqshbandi path of the attraction to God (jadhba) overtraveling toward Him (suluk), which so active an influence of the masterbrings to his disciple. Yet on a higher level “the inclusion of the end in thebeginning” underlies the peculiar contribution of Sirhindi to Sufism in gen-eral and to the Naqshbandi tradition in particular. A profound formulationof the Malamati paradox that had characterized the way of the Khwajaganfrom its very beginning, it not only reinforced Naqshbandi involvement inpublic affairs as formulated by the principle of solitude in the crowd but alsoprovided it with a new ground for its orthodoxy by emphasizing constantawareness of God along the path as implied in the parallel principle of yaddasht.29Paradoxically, India does not occupy a prominent place in the thought ofSirhindi. He generally belittles the contribution of Indian Muslims to the60SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Islamic culture and stresses their indebtedness to the religious scholars ofTransoxiana. His writing is located within the classical frame of reference,even concerning themes relevant to the situation in India in his day. Such areSirhindi’s denunciation of the Shi‘is, though usually as misguided believersrather than sheer infidels; his condemnation of women, whom he describesas utterly stupid and prone to blameworthy practices; and the harsh meas-ures he demands against the Hindus. To define the status of the latter,Sirhindi argues that prophets were sent to India but were all rejected, as is“evidenced” by the existence of ruins all over the country and by whatever iscorrect in the teachings of the Brahmins. The Muslim government shouldtherefore humiliate the Hindus by mercilessly levying the poll tax (jizya) onthem, by treating them like dogs and, above all, by the slaughtering of cows.30Facing orthodoxyThe expansion of the Mujaddidiyya in South Asia began with AhmadSirhindi himself, who sent numerous deputies to propagate his message in theurban centers of north India. Most of his deputies, though, met with littlesuccess. The brotherhood continued to spread throughout the seventeenthcentury under the direction of his son and heir Muhammad Ma‘sum andother descendents. However, their missionary activity was hampered by sev-eral formidable obstacles. One was fierce religious antagonism on the part ofrival Naqshbandi lineages and of orthodox circles at large, who werealarmed at Sirhindi’s extravagant statements. Another was the inability ofthe Mujaddidis to establish firm contacts with the political authority. Thenthere was the inner rivalry among the Mujaddidi family itself, which pre-vented unified action. Opposition reached its peak during the reign ofAwrangzeb, when reading the Maktubat was officially prohibited.Conflict arose between Sirhindi and other senior disciples of Baqi Billah inthe Delhi lodge – Tajuddin and Ilahdad – shortly after the death of themaster in 1603. While this may have begun as the usual dispute over thesuccession, and in this case also over the education of Baqi Billah’s minorsons, it became exacerbated in time by questions of doctrine. Sirhindi’s rivalsaccused him of deviating from the path of their preceptor, while he was upsetat their attraction to mystical music and dance, practices which he loathed.31Orthodox opposition to Sirhindi began somewhat later, when his collectionof letters began to circulate. Among his critics was ‘Abdulhaqq Dihlawi, aprominent scholar who specialized in hadith studies and an erstwhileadmirer. The main points at issue were Sirhindi’s arrogance in claiming tobe equal to the Prophet with no intermediary between himself and God, andhis statement that the reality of the Ka‘ba is superior to the reality ofMuhammad. Later discussions generally followed these lines of argument.32Sirhindi’s efforts to spread the Mujaddidi path in north India were alsobeset by difficulties. Most of his deputies were still Central Asians and61SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Afghans, and their ability to propagate his teachings was limited. When oneof them, Adam Banuri (d. 1663), acquired a large following among theAfghans in the Punjab, he was banished by the Mughal government to theHijaz.33Little research has been done on the development of the Mujaddidiyyaunder Ahmad Sirhindi’s descendents in the seventeenth century. It seemsthat Muhammad Ma‘sum, his third son, who had been designated heir in1623, was particularly active in disseminating the new path, both in Indiaand outside it. Together with his older brother, Muhammad Sa‘id, Ma‘sumcontinued to write letters of guidance to his father’s disciples and engaged inclarifying and defending his controversial assertions. This is precisely whatbiographer ‘Abd al-Hayy al-Hasani has to say about him:The master, the imam, the great scholar: Ma‘sum ibn Ahmad ibn‘Abd al-Ahad al-‘Adawi al-‘Umari, Shaykh Muhammad Ma‘sum al-Naqshbandi al-Sirhindi. He was the most beloved among his father’schildren, resembled him most in his manner, the closest to him in hisstanding, the most faithful to his way of life, the most special in hisspiritual perceptions, the most famous among the people, and themost beneficial to them . . .He learned some books with his big brother Shaykh MuhammadSadiq, and most of them with his father and Shaykh MuhammadTahir al-Lahuri. He attended his father and “took” from him thepath . . . His father predicted for him lofty states such as qayyumiyya(sustaining the world) and its like. When his father died, he began toguide [lit. sit on the pillow of guidance]. He traveled to the HolyPlaces, performing the hajj and visiting the Prophet’s tomb, andstayed in Illuminated Medina for substantial time. Then he returnedto India and spent his life in teaching and advising.34Of particular interest is the question to what extent the two brothers influ-enced the religious policies of the orthodox Emperor Awrangzeb. Sa‘id andMa‘sum both sent him several letters, mostly before his ascension to thethrone in 1658, and the latter’s son, Safiuddin, spent some time at his court.There is no doubt that the Mujaddidis supported Awrangzeb, but asFriedmann notes, they were more concerned with teaching the Mughal rulerthe spiritual principles of the Naqshbandi path than in molding his religiouspolicies. Moreover, alarmed at the rise of orthodox anti-Mujaddidi feelings,in 1679 Awrangzeb instructed the Chief Qadi of Aurangabad to proscribethe teaching of Sirhindi’s Maktubat. The actual effect of this decree isuncertain. At the same time, internal rivalries became apparent amongSirhindi’s grandsons, resulting in recurrent divisions within the family. Thedepredations of the Sikhs in the Punjab prompted many of them to leaveSirhind for Delhi or other places in the Punjab and beyond.35 They were62SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"particularly welcomed in the principality of Rampur, where they enjoyed thepatronage of the local Nawab.36Reunification and assimilationOpposition to the Mujaddidi brotherhood subsided during the eighteenthcentury with the progressive disintegration of the Mughal Empire and thesubsequent conquest of Delhi by the British. The political crisis resulted inthe disappearance of most Naqshbandi lines dependent on the government,leaving the Mujaddidiyya the only viable offshoot. Within the Mujaddidiyyaitself the crisis stimulated a variety of reactions, some actually exceeding thebounds of the brotherhood. Such were the teachings of Shah Waliullah andof Nasir ‘Andalib and his son Mir Dard, whose enterprises will be discussedin Chapter 8. But the need to respond was also felt among the feudingbranches of the Mujaddidi family. Consequently, by the mid-eighteenth cen-tury the leadership passed out of the family to Mirza Mazhar Jan-i Janan,who in his spiritual genealogy reunited several lines of descent deriving fromSirhindi. Adapting the tradition he inherited to the realities of Mughaldecline on the one hand, and renewing its missionary impetus on the other,his path came to be referred to as the Shamsiyya-Mazhariyya. His successorGhulam ‘Ali renewed the Mujaddidi missionary activity also away fromIndia. The central lodge in Delhi was restored to the descendents of Sirhindiin the early nineteenth century, when the situation in the city improved.Born around 1700 into a noble family of Afghan extraction which servedin the Mughal administration, at the age of eighteen Mazhar Jan-i Janangave up the official vocation and the inheritance awaiting him in favor of theSufi quest. Moving to Delhi, he attended several masters of different brother-hoods, but was mostly attracted to the Mujaddidiyya. He followed the pathunder Nur Muhammad Badayuni and completed it with Muhammad ‘AbidSunami, attending in between other spiritual masters of its lineage (seeFigure 4.2). After Sunami’s death in 1747 Mazhar became head of the cen-tral Mujaddidi lodge in Delhi. Though strict in his rules of conduct, he wassought out for initiation by many, mostly into the Naqshbandiyya butoccasionally into the Qadiriyya, Chishtiyya, or Suhrawardiyya brother-hoods. Women were guided by his wife until she became insane.Mazhar Jan-i Janan apparently authorized more deputies than any of hispredecessors, particularly from among the Afghans inhabiting the lands eastof Delhi. They spread his message throughout the country, from the Punjabin the northwest to the Deccan in the south. In the footsteps of Sirhindi,Mazhar regularly corresponded with his deputies; his letters were later col-lected, and they form the basis of our knowledge about his life and ideas.Unlike the great master, though, he also undertook frequent journeys to visithis deputies and authorized the most talented among them to systematize histeachings. Inimical to the renewed prominence of the Shi‘a in the court, in63SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Figure 4.2The spiritual genealogy of Mazhar Jan-i Janan"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"1781 Mazhar allegedly made some derogatory remarks against a ta‘ziyaprocession (consolation for the death of Imam Husayn) and was assassinatedby a group of Shi‘i zealots.37As a true heir to the Mujaddidi tradition, Mazhar is invariably describedas strictly following the precepts of the shari‘a. He was particularly attachedto the Prophet Muhammad, whom he regarded as the source of his powers.Alarmed by the increasingly precarious situation of the Indian Muslimcommunity of his time, Mazhar introduced some momentous novelties intothe tradition, the repercussions of which are felt to this day. For one, in clearcontrast to Sirhindi’s injunction to approach the rulers in order to guidethem on the path of the shari‘a, he relinquished contacts with thegovernment. This is conveyed in two anecdotes that Hasani cites from thebiography compiled by Mazhar’s foremost disciple:Muhammad Shah had sent to him [Mazhar] his minister Qamar al-Din Khan and said to him: God gave me large property, take fromme whatever you like. He replied that God most high says: Say: thepossession of this world is little.38 As the possessions of the sevenregions [of the world] are little, what is the worth of the small frag-ment of one region that is in your hands. The poor one [Sufi] will notbow to kings for so little . . . Nizam al-Mulk gave him 30,000 coins,but he did not accept them. Nizam al-Mulk said to him: If you donot need it, take it and distribute it among the needy. [Mazhar]replied: I am not your secretary, if you want to distribute it do it byyourself once you have left my house.39On the other hand, in an effort to avert the frictions that had beset theMujaddidiyya since the days of its founder, Mazhar adopted a more tolerantattitude toward all elements of society: the other Sufi traditions, the religiousestate at large, and even the Indian environment. Such an attitude alsoexplains his unprecedented success in disseminating the Mujaddidi path.Mazhar’s was an introverted way, offering a retreat into the spiritual realm intimes of public disorder and rampant violence.Thus, while adhering to Sirhindi’s position that wahdat al-shuhud repre-sents an advanced stage in relation to the commonly accepted wahdatal-wujud, Mazhar Jan-i Janan maintained that both are legitimate parts ofthe Sufi revelation. To further mollify the adversaries of the Mujaddidiyya hedeemphasized the entire issue by placing it outside the category of essentialbeliefs. Similarly, while himself avoiding music in accordance with theMujaddidi teachings, Mazhar did not object to the practice as long as itconformed to the shari‘a. He even went so far as claiming that in this respectthe difference between his brotherhood and, say, the Chishtiyya was a ques-tion of temperament rather than principle. Within the Muslim community atlarge, Mazhar sought to reduce conflict both among the legal schools65SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"(madhahib) and between the Sunna and Shi‘a. In the first case, perhapsunder the influence of Shah Waliullah, he suggested resolving differences byreferring them to the reliable hadith. As for the more pressing second issue,possibly in an attempt to appease the influential Shi‘i group in the courtMazhar maintained that respect for the Companions of the Prophet did notbelong to the essentials of the faith either, and that owing to their professionof the unity of God (shahada) the Shi‘a should be included within the foldof Islam.The greatest departure of Mazhar from the Mujaddidi tradition, however,concerned his attitude toward the Hindus. Showing acquaintance with thebasic teachings of Hinduism, he stated unequivocally that they too professthe unity of the One and therefore should be exonerated from the charge ofpolytheism (shirk). Mazhar recognized Krishna and Rama as prophets andthe Vedas as of divine origin, and even went so far as to describe Hindu idol-worship as resembling the Sufi rabita in that both practices involve using anintermediary for the concentration on God. Mazhar nevertheless regardedthe Hindus as unbelievers (kafir), as distinct from polytheists, since they didnot follow the divine laws delivered by Muhammad, the seal of the prophets.On the practical plane, Mazhar admitted Hindu disciples to his circle, someof them on the basis of a shared interest in Persian and Urdu poetry.The inevitable struggle over the leadership of the Mujaddidiyya that fol-lowed the death of Mazhar Jan-i Janan was decided in favor of Ghulam ‘AliDihlawi (d. 1824), his foremost disciple from the Punjab. His main adversarywas Na‘imullah Bahraichi (d. 1803), who then chose to move to Lucknow,capital of the Shi‘i regional state of ‘Awadh. Each of the contenders wrote abiography of the master, no doubt partly to enhance their stance. Of cardinalimportance to the development of the brotherhood were also the morescholarly Ghulam Yahya ‘Azimabadi (d. 1772) and Thana’ullah Panipati (d.1810). ‘Azimabadi, who was located in Lucknow too, was assigned by Maz-har to formulate his position regarding the controversy over Sirhindi’s wah-dat al-shuhud.40 More important still was Panipati, an outstanding scholarand a prolific writer who combined wide erudition in the religious sciences,particularly those of jurisprudence and hadith, with Naqshbandi spirituality,a trend that would achieve full realization in the teachings of theKhalidiyya.41Ghulam ‘Ali consolidated the renewed Mujaddidi path that had been ini-tiated by Mazhar by providing it with an institutional center and by extend-ing his call to foreign disciples. A native of Batala in the Punjab, Ghulam ‘Alimoved to Delhi with his family when eighteen years old. Under the inspir-ation of his father he sought spiritual guidance from several masters, untilfour years later he joined Mazhar’s circle. Upon the master’s death, Ghulam‘Ali undertook the guidance of his disciples, and when their number grewhe erected an extended lodge over his tomb. In the footsteps of Mazhar,he supported the institution by unsolicited donations rather than by66SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"endowments and gifts from the ruling elite and the wealthy. He alsotightened the alliance between the Mujaddidiyya and the Indian Afghans.In the wake of the conquest of Delhi by the British in 1803 Ghulam ‘Aliaccentuated some of his master’s positions and reformulated others. For one,he emphatically rejected any association with the infidel government oremployment in its service. To compensate for this, he turned his attention tothe Muslim community and made the lodge an institutional source of pat-ronage for the needy. In this context Ghulam ‘Ali used to say that his powerof attention was of such great effectiveness that it became the equivalent offormal initiation. On the other hand, his inability to exert influence on theforeign Christian government drove Ghulam ‘Ali to reinstate the basicorthodoxy of the Mujaddidiyya. In contrast to his master he showed himselfopposed to mystical audition, to Shi‘i beliefs, and to any community withHindus. Instead, Ghulam ‘Ali developed a sense of identity with the Islamiclands outside India, particularly of Central and Western Asia, making spe-cial efforts to draw disciples from them. Upon completing the path under hisguidance in the Delhi lodge, these were sent back to their home countrieswith full authorization to initiate disciples of their own.42 Among them prideof place is reserved for the Kurdish Shaykh Khalid, who integrated therenewed spiritual message from India with the quest for modernity in theOttoman state.67SHARI‘A AND RENEWAL IN THE GREAT EMPIRES"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"5INNER RIVALRIES ANDCOOPERATIONParadoxically, it was outside India that the orthodox and activist thrusts ofAhmad Sirhindi’s teaching came into fuller play. Mujaddidi missionaryefforts began with Sirhindi’s son, Muhammad Ma‘sum, in the mid-seventeenth century. They were directed at both the Ottoman Empire, nowwith its Arab provinces, and the Central Asian Khanates, at the originallands of the Naqshbandiyya. In both regions the Mujaddidis had to competenot only with masters of other brotherhoods, but at times also with thoseaffiliated to the original Naqshbandiyya, who in addition often vied amongthemselves. At other times a relationship of cooperation was establishedbetween existing branches of the Naqshbandiyya and newcomers from theMujaddidi offshoot.Of particular importance for the spread of the Mujaddidiyya were theHoly Cities in Arabia, which in the seventeenth century emerged as the hubof an international network of Islamic scholarship. Here, however, theMujaddidis were preceded by another prominent disciple of Baqi Billah,namely Tajuddin al-‘Uthmani. Their mission was further compounded in thesecond half of the century, when the controversy that raged in India in thetime of Emperor Awrangzeb (r. 1658–1707) regarding Sirhindi’s orthodoxyspilled over to the Holy Cities and resulted in his denunciation as an infidel.The Mujaddidiyya was more successful in the Syrian provinces of theOttoman Empire and especially in Istanbul. This was due to the work of twodeputies of Ma‘sum, Murad al-Bukhari, the founder of the leading religiousfamily of Damascus for the next century and a half, and Ahmad JarullahJuryani, who gained many followers among the learned and bureaucraticelites in the Ottoman capital. The brotherhood had been first introduced inTransoxiana by yet another deputy of Ma‘sum, Habibullah Bukhari, andwas latter reinforced by Musa Dahbidi, a descendent of Makhdum-i A‘zam.It acquired considerable political influence in the late eighteenth and earlynineteenth centuries in both the Ottoman Empire, then embarking on thepath of modernization, and the Mangit Khanate which sought to revitalizethe Bukharan state. The Mujaddidiyya failed to penetrate into EasternTurkistan and China, where a fierce contest among rival Makhdumzade lines68"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"during the seventeenth century was followed, in the second half of the eight-eenth century, by the introduction of the New Teaching of Ma Mingxin, aspiritual descendent of Tajuddin ‘Uthmani.There are no collections of letters of Mujaddidi or non-Mujaddidi mastersof the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries operating outside Indiacomparable to the Maktubat of Ahmad Sirhindi. In the Ottoman domain wefind instead translations into Turkish and Arabic of the foundationalNaqshbandi texts along with numerous original expositions of the brother-hood’s teachings, mostly still in manuscript form. But we do have at ourdisposal biographical dictionaries, of which we used here Muhammad Khalilal-Muradi’s Silk al-durar fi a‘yan al-qarn al-thani ‘ashar (The String of Pearlson the Notables of the Twelfth Century), roughly covering the eighteenthcentury. A more concentrated form of this kind of legitimization is thescholarly roster (thabat), of which Abu Salim al-‘Ayyashi’s Ithaf al-akhilla’bi-ijazat al-masha’ikh al-ajilla’ (Presenting the Friends with the Diploma ofthe Venerable Masters) will serve as an example.ArabiaThe Naqshbandiyya became known in the Hijaz from the early stages of itsexistence. Baha’uddin Naqshband, Muhammad Parsa, ‘Abdurahman Jami,and many others performed the hajj and may have initiated disciples into thebrotherhood. Deputies of ‘Ubaydullah Ahrar came to the Haramayn forlonger periods in order to disseminate the path, most notably Isma‘ilShahrawani who spent four decades in Mecca combining Sufi guidance withthe teaching of Qur’an and hadith. Unable to fully integrate within the localsociety, the Naqshbandi adepts in the Holy Cities were mostly visitors fromCentral Asia, Iran, and India.Neither did the Istanbul Naqshbandiyya succeed in striking roots in theHijaz, even after the incorporation of the Arab lands into the OttomanEmpire in the early sixteenth century, which facilitated free movementthrough the entire area. One exception was Ahmed Sadiq Tas ̧kandi, who inthe latter part of that century disseminated the path in the course of a num-ber of pilgrimages he undertook before as well as after he settled in Istanbul.Only in the seventeenth century did a member of the Central AsianNaqshbandiyya, Muhammad Husayn Khwafi of the Dahbidi line, success-fully propagate the path in Mecca; he even married into the local Sharifianelite. He was the preceptor of Muhammad Hasan ibn al-‘Ujaymi, author ofan important Sufi biographical dictionary of the Haramayn, Khabayaal-zawaya (Secrets of the Lodges).1An enduring Naqshbandi presence was established in Arabia during theseventeenth century by masters from India belonging to both pre-Mujaddidiand Mujaddidi lineages. This coincided with the emergence of the Haramaynas the center of a cosmopolitan network of scholars, who radiated a69INNER RIVALRIES AND COOPERATION"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"combination of orthodox Sufism and hadith studies to many regions of theMuslim world.2 The earliest among the Indian masters was SibghatullahBaruji, who blended the Naqshbandi and Shattari traditions, along with theteachings of Ibn ‘Arabi. Arriving in Medina in 1596, Baruji built a lodge(ribat), which became a center of Sufi guidance, and ordained a number ofremarkable disciples, the foremost being the learned Ahmad al-Shinnawi.This lineage led to the towering figures of seventeenth-century Medina,Ahmad Safi al-Din al-Qushashi and Ibrahim al-Kurani, the focal points ofthe scholarly network of their time. The import of this chain of transmissionis exemplified in the license (ijaza) that Kurani bequeathed to a Moroccanmaster, which begins thus:I authorize by way of recitation Shaykh ‘Abdallah [Abu Salim al-‘Ayyashi] and all those mentioned with him for everything that wasauthorized to me and from me in the books of hadith, exegesis,jurisprudence and its principles, theology (kalam), Sufism includingtreading the path, mystical knowledge and truths, and whatever elseis known to be related to me. In the science of mystical truths he readwith me al-Tuhfa al-mursala ila rasul Allah (The Gift Transmitted tothe Prophet) of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Fadl Allah al-Hindi, themost revered disciple of the master of our masters, the eminent eru-dite scholar who combined the inner and outer sciences, al-SayyidSibghatullah ibn Ruhullah al-Hasani [al-Baruji] blessed be his secret.He learned with me in another reading part of al-Futuhatal-makkiyya of the master of investigation, my master ShaykhMuhyi al-Din ibn Muhammad ibn al-‘Arabi blessed be his secret. Healso read part of his Fusus al-hikam. I handed it over from ourmaster, the imam, the succor, the seal, my master Safi al-Din Ahmadibn Muhammad al-Madani [al-Qushashi] . . .3Baruji was followed in Arabia by Tajuddin Zakariya al-‘Uthmani,Sirhindi’s rival to the succession of Baqi Billah. Tajuddin performed thepilgrimage first in 1617 and then in 1631, after which he spent the last decadeof his life in Mecca. He had great success in spreading the Naqshbandiyya inthe Haramayn, but also in the eastern province of al-Ahsa’ and above all inthe Yemen, where he attracted to the path ‘Abd al-Baqi of the learned Miz-jaji family. To enhance his teaching, Tajuddin translated major Naqshbandiworks into Arabic, including Jami’s Nafahat al-uns and Kashifi’s Rashahat‘ayn al-hayat, and authored some epistles of his own, in which he expoundedthe lineage of the brotherhood and its practices.4The Mujadiddiyya was introduced into the Haramayn by Adam Banuri,Sirhindi’s powerful deputy in the Punjab. Banuri arrived in Mecca in 1642and engaged in training disciples on the path. To spread his master’sideas among the scholars of the Haramayn he also translated into Arabic a70INNER RIVALRIES AND COOPERATION"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"selection from the Maktubat. However, his exposition of Sirhindi’s teachingsaroused opposition among the ulama, particularly on the part of Qushashiand his followers who were affiliated with the original Naqshbandiyya. Thecontroversy was of a scholarly nature rather than specifically Sufi, and ini-tially revolved around Sirhindi’s doctrine regarding the superiority of thereality of the Ka‘ba to that of Muhammad.Apparently to relax tensions, Muhammad Ma‘sum sent to Mecca one ofhis closest deputies, the Bukharan Ahmad Jarullah Juryani, and in 1656 wenthimself on the hajj, accompanied by his brothers and a large entourage.Ma‘sum stayed in Medina for the next three years, during which time he didhis utmost to appease Qushashi and his associates, a clear indication of thegreat importance that he attached to the acceptance of the brotherhood inthe Haramayn. When the Mujaddidi group set out to return to India,another close deputy, Badr al-Din al-Hindi, was left behind. Both Hindi andJuryani remained in the Holy Cities for the rest of their lives, and are said tohave won the respect of the local scholars and to have initiated into theMujaddidiyya numerous disciples, residents and pilgrims.Still, the controversy over Ahmad Sirhindi’s teachings was rekindled in1682, following the arrival of a request for a legal opinion (istifta’) from theMujaddidiyya’s opponents in India who wished to buttress EmperorAwrangzeb’s official ban on the Maktubat. The charges leveled this timeagainst Sirhindi were more comprehensive and included the extravagantclaims he made about himself and his millenarian doctrines. Two of Kurani’sassociates composed within a month book-length replies in which theydeclared Sirhindi an infidel. These were sent to “the qadi of India” by theSharif of Mecca with an accompanying letter in which he asserted that theseauthors’ verdict was unanimously accepted. Copty suggests that the Sharif’sattitude derived from his desire to appease Emperor Awrangzeb and topocket himself the large amount of charity that the latter had sent that yearto the Haramayn. Be that as it may, there are clear indications that some ofthe Hijazi ulama did not agree with the condemnation of Sirhindi, amongthem perhaps Kurani himself. The defense of the Mujaddidiyya’s founderwas taken up, with at least some measure of success, by Muhammad al-Uzbeki, who maintained that the fatwas against him were based on faultytranslation and misrepresentation of the Maktubat.5Surprisingly, no detailed studies are available on the development of theNaqshbandiyya in the Hijaz during the eighteenth century, despite theimportance commonly assigned to this period as the culmination of pre-modern reform trends in Islam. From the pieces of information that we dohave, mainly from biographical dictionaries such as that of Muradi, itappears that the polemic around Sirhindi and his teachings faded, and theMujaddidiyya was integrated into the scholarly fabric of the Haramayn.Still, owing in great part to the legacy of Qushashi and his followers inMedina, it was unable to surpass the original Naqshbandiyya, which71INNER RIVALRIES AND COOPERATION"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Figure 5.1The Naqshbandiyya in seventeenth-century Haramayn"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"remained one of the leading brotherhoods in Arabia. Among its principalleaders in the eighteenth century we find Isma‘il al-Uskudari (d. 1768), astudent of Muhammad Abu Tahir, son of Ibrahim al-Kurani. The elite char-acter that the Naqshbandiyya retained during this period is exemplified bythe multilineal affiliation to the brotherhood of the Mirghanis, a nobleMeccan family of Central Asian origin. One of its scions, Muhammad‘Uthman al-Mirghani, may later have passed some Naqshbandi traits to theSudan through his reformist Khatmiyya brotherhood. The Naqshbandiyyacontinued to be strong among the learned elite of Zabid also.6The Ottoman EmpireThe group of Sufi ulama that fought against the spread of the Mujaddidiyyain the Haramayn in the seventeenth century represented a powerful combin-ation of learned opposition to Sirhindi’s controversial teachings and faithfulallegiance to the original Naqshbandiyya. No comparable impedimentexisted in the heartlands of the Ottoman Empire where, as we have seen, thevarious Naqshbandi centers were largely disconnected, or in its Arab prov-inces, where they hardly existed. In these regions relations between thetwo branches were generally amicable. In the early seventeenth century aNaqshbandi lodge was established in Jerusalem, but its influence remainedlimited as residence was restricted to non-Arabs, preferably from Transoxiana;hence its name, al-zawiya al-uzbakiyya.7Later on ‘Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulusi (d. 1731), the celebrated religiousscholar of late seventeenth and early eighteenth-century Damascus, was ini-tiated into the original Naqshbandiyya by a Bukharan master belonging tothe Dahbidi line while the latter paid a short visit to the city in 1676.Though this affiliation remained superficial, he wrote an influential com-mentary on Tajuddin Uthmani’s Tajiyya. But Nabulusi also composed awork in defense of Sirhindi and associated with the Muradis, the leadingMujaddidi family of Damascus.8 Unlike Arabia, then, in other parts of theOttoman Empire the Mujaddidiyya was better placed to eclipse earlierNaqshbandi groups.The introduction of the Mujaddidiyya in Istanbul and in the Syrian landswas effected principally through the agency of two deputies of MuhammadMa‘sum, both of Central Asian origin and both physically handicapped:Murad al-Bukhari, who shuttled between Damascus and Istanbul, and theabove-mentioned Juryani, who was popular among the Ottoman pilgrims inthe Haramayn. While we are still hardly in a position to assess the actualspiritual work and the special teachings of either Bukhari or Juryani, theavailable research allows us to take them as the starting point for anexamination of the major strategies through which in the seventeenth andeighteenth centuries the Mujaddidi tradition was transmitted and insti-tutionalized. One of these was familial succession, which facilitated the73INNER RIVALRIES AND COOPERATION"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"incorporation of the saint’s physical descendents into the imperial and localelites, as was the case with the Muradis. Another process was cooperationwith masters of the original Naqshbandiyya, most visibly in Istanbul. Lastbut not least was the endeavor to influence the Ottoman government, in linewith Sirhindi’s original provision. Such involvement had been undertaken byBukhari on behalf of the people of Damascus, and reached its climax acentury later in the form of support by a spiritual descendent of Juryani,Mehmed Amin Bursali, for the first attempt at modern reform in theOttoman Empire under Sultan Salim III.Our knowledge of the Muradi family history depends almost exclusivelyon the biographical dictionary of its fourth-generation member, MuhammadKhalil. As Barbara von Schlegell has suggested, this may have projected onthem greater importance than is due, but it nevertheless offers us a closerlook at the trajectory of a Naqshbandi family within the imperial/provincialand spiritual/worldly dialectics characterizing pre-modern Muslim states. Inthe course of a century and a half the Muradis became embedded in thelocal elite of Damascus at the expense of their imperial connections, andthey shed their actual Naqshbandi identity in favor of a more comprehensiveIslamic interest. Murad al-Bukhari, the eponym, was born in 1640 to a noblefamily in Samarqand. He became paralyzed in his legs at the age of three, acondition that did not prevent him from spending much of his life traveling.In India Murad was appointed Ma‘sum’s deputy and then went on the hajj.Spending three years in the Hijaz, he returned to Samarqand through Iraqand Persia, only to depart for the west again.Figure 5.2Naqshbandi genealogies in Damascus and Istanbul74INNER RIVALRIES AND COOPERATION"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Murad al-Bukhari established his residence in Damascus around 1670. Ashis great grandson tells us:Among his deeds in Damascus was the college known after him.Before, this had been a hostel where corrupt and sinful people lived.God saved it from darkness to light. Its endowment deed stipulatedthat no beardless [lad], no married man, and no smoker of tobaccoshall live there. He also built a college at his home in the Suq Sarujaquarter, which is known as the Outer Naqshbandi college, along witha mosque.9Murad, however, seems to have become more interested in Istanbul,whither he set out for the first time in 1681. In a number of prolongedsojourns in the Ottoman capital he succeeded in gaining audiences with twosuccessive sultans, petitioning them to alleviate onerous taxes from thepeople of Damascus and to free the city of its financial and political civicresponsibility for the annual pilgrimage caravan. In recognition of his stand-ing he received a sinecure from some villages in the Damascus area, whichwere the basis for the future prosperity of his family. In 1708 Muradmoved permanently to Istanbul, where he became involved in the politicalstruggles over the Great Vizierate, and also wrote a short treatise on theNaqshbandiyya.10 After his death in 1720 his burial place in the Eyup quar-ter became an important center of the Istanbul Mujaddidiyya, with severalaffiliated Muradi lodges along the Golden Horn.The descendents of Bukhari preferred to remain in Damascus. The familywas divided into two branches, the more important being that of his youngerson Muhammad (d. 1755). He was ordained as deputy by his father andstudied Ibn ‘Arabi’s Futuhat al-makkiyya with Nabulusi.11 Muhammad setout for Istanbul after his father’s death, but on the way he suffered a spiritualcrisis that forced him to return to Damascus and assume an ascetic way oflife. In 1752, three years before his death, the reputed Sufi master was sum-moned to the presence of the sultan in Istanbul, and was greatly honored bytwice performing the hajj on his and his successor’s behalf.Muhammad was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, ‘Ali al-Muradi (d.1771), who identified much closer with his city’s interests and acted as a localnotable, mediating between government and society. ‘Ali greatly expandedand diversified the economic resources of the family through landholdings,management of waqf endowments, and patronage, while for his services tothe central administration he was appointed in 1758 to the most prestigiousreligious post in Damascus, namely its Hanafi mufti. The position wasretained by the family almost uninterruptedly for the next century. When ‘Alidied prematurely the leadership devolved upon his minor son, the biographerMuhammd Khalil al-Muradi (d. 1791), who achieved scholarly fame but lostmuch of the family’s contacts in the Ottoman court. As Khalil died in his75INNER RIVALRIES AND COOPERATION"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"early thirties without offspring, the leadership passed to his cousin ‘Ali (d.1815) and then to the latter’s son Husayn (d. 1850).12 No longer a practicingNaqshbandi Sufi, Husayn supported the religious revival that Shaykh Khalidinitiated in Damascus in the 1820s as the head of the new offshoot of theKhalidiyya.13We have no comparable source of information on Ahmad Juryani, alsoknown as Yakdast (the one-handed). Even Muradi’s information about himwas sketchy:He came to noble Mecca and settled there for years. He becamefamous and excelled. Many people took from him the afore-mentioned tariqa [Naqshbandiyya]. He and [my] grandfather, themaster Muhammad Murad ibn ‘Ali al-Bukhari, may God sanctifytheir secret, were companions during their study with the masterMuhmmad Ma‘sum al-Faruqi.14Still, Juryani’s spiritual chain appears time and again throughout theeighteenth and early nineteenth centuries among the bureaucratic andlearned elites of Istanbul. His followers here perpetuated the Naqshbandidisconnected mode of operation, as well as its propensity to cooperate withother Sufi brotherhoods. These included not only the elitist Mevleviyya andindeed the pre-Mujaddidiyya itself, but also, not unlike the situation we havemet in India, the wandering Qalandars.15 The foremost deputy of Juryani inthe Ottoman capital was Mehmed Amin Tukadi (Tokatli), who received ini-tiation while on the hajj. Tukadi became administrator at one of the Sufilodges founded by Ahmad Bukhari, co-founder of the original Naqshbandiyyain Istanbul in the fifteenth century, and gained a large following whichincluded ulama and high officials. He also initiated the first translation ofSirhindi’s Maktubat into Turkish. The task was accomplished shortly afterhis death by Sa‘d al-Din Mustaqimzade, though its quality left much to bedesired.16Another instance of inter-Naqshbandi cooperation revolved around whatcame to be known as the Kashghari lodge in the hills above Eyup. It wasbuilt by a high official who had been introduced into the Mujaddidiyya byJuryani while on pilgrimage. This appointed to the lodge ‘Abdallah Nida’i(d. 1760) of Kashghar, an itinerant Naqshbandi belonging to the Dahbidilineage. Nida’i regarded poverty (faqr) as the heart of the Sufi quest andwandered as a mendicant for forty-five years before settling in Istanbul.Gaining first the patronage of a follower of Murad al-Bukhari who reno-vated for him the Qalandar Khane of Eyup, he later moved to head the newlodge uphill. Despite the high respect that he acquired among the Mujad-didis of Istanbul Nida’i never abandoned the original Naqshbandiyya. Hislodge became a meeting place for pilgrims from Central Asia, while itsmasters often served as ambassadors between the Ottoman government and76INNER RIVALRIES AND COOPERATION"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"the Central Asian Khanates. It remained in the possession of Naqshbandimasters, mostly the founder’s family, until the outlawing of Sufi brother-hoods by the secular Turkish government of Atatürk in 1925, and to someextent even thereafter.17The impact of Juryani’s Naqshbandi-Mujaddidi branch in Istanbulpeaked in the latter part of the eighteenth century, when its leaders becameinvolved in Ottoman reform politics. Its prominent master at that time,Mehmed Amin Bursali, was a Kurd from Kirkuk, who entered the service ofthe Grand Vizier. Bursali was first initiated into the Mujaddidiyya in hishometown; then, in Istanbul, he joined a learned group belonging to the lineof Juryani which was also affiliated to the Mevlevi brotherhood and engagedin teaching the Mesnevi, Rumi’s great collection of poems. As Abu-Mannehhas shown, many among the reformist elements in the bureaucracy of SultanSelim III (1789–1807), who initiated the first Ottoman effort at moderniza-tion, were followers of Bursali. As a Mujaddidi master bent on influencingthe ruler, the latter’s support seems to have derived from his recognition ofthe need to revitalize the empire, along with his desire to keep the reformswithin the bonds of the shari‘a. In the wake of the dethronement and murderof Selim, Mehmed Emin was exiled to Bursa while many of his followerswere put to death. Subsequently, in the early years of Sultan Mahmud II(1808–1839), one of his deputies, Ali Behcet, moved back to Istanbul and re-established contacts with some government officials of reformist bent. In thePlate 5.1Interior of the Kashghari tekke in Istanbul77INNER RIVALRIES AND COOPERATION"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"1820s these joined forces with the Khaliddiyya in the renewed drive to set theempire on the course of reform.18From Istanbul the Mujaddidiyya also spread into the Balkans, mainly inthe Bosnia and Herzegovina provinces. According to legend, Naqshbandistook part in the Ottoman conquest of these regions in 1463, and their firstlodge was built shortly thereafter by the governor in what came to beSarajevo. They were followed in the 1480s by ‘Abdullah Ilahi of Simav,founder of the Istanbul Naqshbandiyya, who however was more interestedin contemplation and writing than in training disciples. Allied with the rulerswho supported them with stipends and lands, the Naqshbandis of the Bal-kans may have been used in the struggle against unorthodox dervishes.The brotherhood was reinvigorated toward the end of the eighteenth cen-tury with the arrival of the Mujaddidiyya, which established its major lodgesin the countryside around Sarajevo. It was brought to the Balkans by HuseinBaba Zukic ́ (d. 1800), who was initiated into the path while completing hisreligious studies in Istanbul. At the instruction of his guide, who belonged toMurad al-Bukhari’s line, he then left for Konya where he spent three years atRumi’s shrine, another sign of the cooperation between the two brother-hoods, and proceeded to Bukhara to spend seven more years at Baha’uddinNaqshband tomb. After returning from his travels Zukic ́ founded a lodge inhis home village of Zˇivc ˇic ́, in a mountainous area west of Sarajevo; his soledeputy, ‘Abdurrahman Sirri Baba (d. 1846), founded nearby a second lodge,around which the village of Oglavak grew up. On being nominated the gov-ernors of Bosnia would go there to pay their respects. One of Sirri Baba’sdeputies, Muhammad Mejli Baba (d. 1853) who came from Anatolia, tookup the lodge in Zˇivc ˇic ́, and descendents of both continued to head the twolodges at least until Yugoslavia’s civil war of the 1980s.19The Central Asian KhanatesThe trajectory of the Mujaddidiya in Central Asia paralleled in manyrespects the developments in the Ottoman domains. In these regions, though,rivalry between local branches largely replaced the cooperation we havenoted in Istanbul, while contacts with the Indian primary brotherhoodremained more substantial. As in Western Asia, the Mujaddidiyya wasintroduced into the original Naqshbandi lands in the second half of theseventeenth century by a deputy of Muhammad Ma‘sum, HabibullahBukhari, who met the master in India or in Mecca. His name appears inmany of the Mujaddidi genealogies in Transoxiana.Half a century later another branch was established in the area by MusaKhan Dahbidi, a descendent of Makhdum-i A‘zam, who had been initiatedinto the path by Muhammad ‘Abid, one of Mazhar Jan-i Janan’s masters, inKashmir. Musa thus merged the Mujaddidi and Dahbidi lines but, unlikehis illustrious ancestor, he shunned politics. Dedicating himself to writing,78INNER RIVALRIES AND COOPERATION"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"training disciples, and preaching the shari‘a, he followed the Indian terri-torial model in assigning each of his more than hundred deputies a specifictown or region. The arrival of Musa in Transoxiana sparked a rivalry withMujaddidi masters of Habibullah’s lineage. After Musa’s death animosityalso developed between two of his major successors: Khudayar, his firstdeputy, and Muhammad Siddiq, who soon eclipsed him as head of theshrine in Dahbid. The Mujaddidiyya was also implanted in the Ferghanavalley, where its most influential representatives were the Miyan familyin Kokand.20Again in parallel to Istanbul, the Central Asian Mujaddidiyya acquiredpalpable political influence in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth cen-tury, following the rise of the Mangit dynasty of Bukhara (1785–1920). Theearly Mangits were not merely fervent adherents, and patrons, of thebrotherhood, but actual Sufi masters. The Mujaddidiyya provided them withlegitimization, backed their drive to reinforce law and order in the country inthe face of hostile Uzbek chieftains, and served as intermediaries betweenthem and the people. On the other hand, the power of the Mujaddidi masterswas circumscribed by their divisiveness, which allowed the Mangit rulers toplay off one master against the other.Shah Murad (1785–1800), the founder of the dynasty, was initiated intothe Mujaddidiyya by a master who belonged to Habibullah Bukhari’s lin-eage, and was later declared deputy. Subsequently, as a ruler, Murad chose asecond master, the Indian Miyan Fazl Ahmad, a descendent of Sirhindi onhis mother’s side who, like his ancestor, was also affiliated to the Qadiriyyaand Chishtiyya brotherhoods. Ahmad served for twenty years as the mentorof Murad’s son and successor, Amir Haydar (1800–1826), but later he had tocontend with the head of the Dahbidi circle, Muhammad Amin. Eventually,Amin became the ruler’s new preceptor after moving at his request toSamarqand, while Ahmad seems to have returned to his hometown Pesha-war, in today’s Pakistan.21Under the influence of his Mujaddidi masters Shah Murad implemented astrictly orthodox policy after his ascension to the throne, owing to which hegained the epithet of “reviver of the sunna, protector of the shari‘a, andremover of deviations.” During his reign Murad abolished unlawful taxes,renovated mosques and religious schools, and called his people time andagain to follow the shari‘a. Ascetic in his disposition, he declared war againstthe Shi‘is, but also against Sufi brotherhoods, including some branches of theNaqshbandiyya, which practiced vocal dhikr. Amir Haydar, his successor,was likewise extolled for his piety and continued to support Islamic institu-tions and learning, though he somewhat moderated the religious policies ofhis father. Haydar indulged in a luxurious lifestyle, and re-imposed taxes andforced labor to finance the administration. He had no objection to vocaldhikr, which was practiced along with the silent one in the Dahbidi line.Under the later Mangits the Mujaddidiyya lost much of its political79INNER RIVALRIES AND COOPERATION"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Figure 5.3Major Mujaddidi masters in Transoxiana"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"influence, as the attention of the rulers shifted from local politics to thestruggle against the Russian expansion.The most remarkable Mujaddidi master in Transoxiana during the lateeighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was apparently MuhammadNiyazquli (Pir-i Dastgir), Khwarazmian belonging to Habibullah Bukhari’slineage. Extremely orthodox, Niyazquli emphasized the precedence of theshari‘a over the tariqa, and of following the path (suluk) over divineattraction (jadhba). He was likewise an adamant opponent of vocal dhikr.Niyazquli’s uncompromising attitude earned him the animosity of fellowNaqshbandis, including the influential Amin Dahbidi, and of the religiousestate of Bukhara at large. Nevertheless, under the protection of the Mangitrulers he served for thirty years as a preacher in the central mosque of thecity and founded his own Sufi lodge, the celebrated Chahr Minar. Niyazquliwas largely responsible for the spread of the Mujaddidiyya in the Muslimparts of the Russian Empire, disciples of his becoming particularly active inthe Volga-Aral region. Through the missionary work undertaken by him andby the other masters, the Mujaddidiyya was able to supersede the originalNaqshbandiyya even in its homeland. The absence of a centralized organiza-tion did not obstruct, and perhaps even encouraged, this rapid expansion,but it also had a negative side, leaving the brotherhood dependent on thepolitical authority.22The Chinese FrontierUnlike in the Ottoman Empire or the Central Asian Khanates, the Mujad-didiyya was unable to excel the original Naqshbandiyya in the Tarim Basinor among the Muslims of China proper. This was largely due to the promin-ent position that descendents of Makhdum-i A‘zam, locally known as theKhojas, had acquired during the seventeenth and the first half of the eight-eenth century in the politics and society of Eastern Turkistan. Combiningtheir sharifian and Naqshbandi lineage with the prestigious Karakhanidancestry as their sources of legitimization, the Khojas came to exerciseoverwhelming influence on the Khans of the oasis cities, and later becamethemselves rulers. Concomitantly they conducted wide-ranging missionaryactivity for the Islamization of both the sedentary and nomadic populations,which they sought to unite under a centralized government.23 The Khojaswere divided into two hostile camps, known after their founders as theIshaqiyya and the Afaqiyya, which fiercely fought for political supremacy inthe Tarim. The Afaqi lineage especially was active in spreading theNaqshbandiyya farther east among the Chinese-speaking Hui andTurkish-speaking Salars. It also established contact with the Dalai Lama inTibet.24At the beginning of the seventeenth century the Ishaqiyya, the lineage ofIshaq Wali, were undisputed leaders of the Naqshbandiyya in the oases of81INNER RIVALRIES AND COOPERATION"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Eastern Turkistan. They wrought enormous influence on the Moghul Khanin Yarkand and amassed large landholdings, turning into the dominantbrotherhood in the Tarim Basin. Around the mid-seventeenth centuryanother grandson of Makhdum-i A‘zam, Muhammad Yusuf (d. 1653),arrived from Transoxiana. Encouraged by the local rulers, who found itexpedient to support a rival Naqshbandi, he traveled extensively to propa-gate the path in Altishahr and farther east in Uighuristan and China. Yusuf’ssuccess was such that he was poisoned by partisans of the Ishaqiyya. Hismission was continued by his son, Hidayatullah (d. 1694), known to historyas Khoja Afaq, founder of the Afaqiyya branch.Forced to flee from both the Khan and his Ishaqi enemies, Afaq touredChina, Kashmir, and Tibet in search of Allies. In Tibet he gained the supportof the Dalai Lama, who referred him to the ruler of the Mongol Zungharconfederation to the north of the Tarim.25 The latter sent his army to Alt-ishahr and enabled Afaq to establish himself in the new capital of Kashgharin 1679. Makhdumzade rule in those regions was buttressed by a wide net-work of able deputies and mass initiation based on dhikr ceremonies whichincluded music as well as ecstatic dance.26 All the while the Ishaqis retainedtheir power base in Yarkand.Both the Afaqiyya and the Ishaqiyya Khojas, which by the early eight-eenth century were renamed the White Mountain and Black Mountain fac-tions respectively, made constant efforts to throw off Zunghari tutelage, butto no avail. The complex political history of the period, in which they playeda prominent role, is beyond the scope of this study. In any event, when theQing army invaded and annexed Zungharia in the second half of the 1750stwo great grandsons of Khoja Afaq led the resistance to the incorporation ofFigure 5.4Inner Naqshbandi divisions in Eastern Turkistan and China82INNER RIVALRIES AND COOPERATION"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Altishahr in the Chinese Empire, not before using the Chinese to eliminatethe detested Ishaqis. Defeated in 1759, the brothers fled to Badakhshan,where they were executed. The Khojas continued to play a considerable,though diminished, political role in the new Chinese province of Xinjiang,incorporating Altishahr, Zungharia, and Uighuristan.27Muhammad Yusuf and his son Khoja Afaq precipitated the advance ofthe Naqshbandiyya into China proper. They built on previous work ofpreachers and traders affiliated with the brotherhood, which dated back to atleast the second half of the fifteenth century. Yusuf traveled in the northwestprovinces – today’s Gansu, Ningsia, and Qinghai – for six months andpropagated the path among both the Hui and the Salars. He was followed byAfaq, who in 1671–1672 visited the Gansu capital city of Lanzhou andChina’s “Little Mecca,” Linxia. During this tour he established firm contactswith the founder of the Qadiriyya brotherhood in northwest China, andappointed a number of deputies, from whom derived the three majorNaqshbandi lineages in the country.Foremost among these was the line initiated in Linxia by Ma Tai Baba (fl.ca. 1680–90) and his energetic deputy and son-in-law, Abu al-Futuh MaLaichi (d. 1753). Son of an impoverished noble family, Laichi acquired athorough religious education and went on the hajj, during which he had asecond initiation into the Naqshbandiyya at the hands of Muhammad‘Aqila al-Makki, a local deputy of Khoja Afaq.

Of Kurdish extraction, Khalidacquired a thorough religious education in his homeland before departing toIndia in 1809 to be initiated into the Naqshbandiyya-Mujaddidiyya by ShahGhulam ‘Ali. He then propagated a combination of learning and orthodoxSufism during a stormy career spanning Sulaymaniyya, Baghdad, andDamascus. Most importantly, Khalid’s disciples in Istanbul joined the localMujaddidiyya in supporting Sultan Mahmud II’s (1808–1839) effort torevitalize the Ottoman Empire and re-establish law and order in its provinces.Khalid paid special attention to the organizational dimension of hisbrotherhood. His innovations in this sphere – a new stress on the rabita, aconcentrated form of khalwa, and “closing the door” to non-members dur-ing the dhikr – were designed to turn the Naqshbandiyya-Mujaddidiyya-Khalidiyya into an effective socio-religious movement in the service of theMuslim community and orthodox Islam.The involvement of the Khalidiyya in Ottoman reform policies continuedthroughout the last century of the Empire. The impact of its orthodox tenetswas discernible in the early part of the Tanzimat reforms (1839–1876), but asthese turned increasingly Westernized the Khalidis moved to the opposition.Many of them, most prominently the hadith scholar Ziya’uddinGümüs ̧hanevi, were later integrated into the “Pan-Islamic” policies of theSultan-Caliph Abdülhamid II. Khalidi activity was greatly hampered by theestablishment of the secular Turkish state in the aftermath of the First WorldWar and the subsequent outlawing of the Sufi brotherhoods in 1925.In Iraq and Syria, the original arenas of Khalid’s work, his brotherhood’simpact was less palpable than in its Turkish or Kurdish parts. This was partlydue to the dominance of non-Arab masters in its ranks, and partly to therising fundamentalist challenge of the Salafiyya, which chose the Naqsh-bandiyya as its main target. In the early twentieth century serious attempts85"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"were made by Khalidi masters to adapt the brotherhood to modern realities.Muhammad Sa‘id in Baghdad and ‘Isa al-Kurdi in Damascus laid the foun-dations for some of its transformations in post-independence Iraq and Syria.The Khalidiyya also managed to establish a firm presence in the Holy Citiesin the Hijaz, still an important hub of communication. This position enabledKhalidi, and parallel Mujaddidi lines, to propagate the path among pilgrimsfrom all over the Muslim world until the Saudi takeover in 1925. It also madesome headway in Egypt.Along with its activity in the Ottoman urban centers, during the nine-teenth century the Khalidiyya established a firm foothold in “peripheral”regions in which a Naqshbandi presence had been hitherto marginal or lack-ing altogether. To enhance its prestige in those regions its masters oftenforged alliances with local Sufi lineages, notably of the Qadiriyya brother-hood. Thus in Kurdistan, Khalidi saintly families emerged as leaders oftribal society in the wake of the elimination of the indigenous amirates bythe Ottoman state from the 1830s onwards. Subsequently, masters of thebrotherhood such as Said of Palu and Mustafa al-Barzani became engagedin one way or another in the Kurdish national struggle against the Turkishand Iraqi states respectively.Farther north a line of Khalidi Imams led the armed resistance to theRussian conquest of Chechnya and Daghestan. The last, Imam Shamil,engaged the imperial army for a quarter of a century before capitulating in1859. The struggle against Russian and Soviet rule has continued intermit-tently under various combinations of Naqshbandi and Qadiri lineages to thisday. Finally, the Khalidiyya was brought to the East Indies through pilgrimswho had joined it in the Hijaz. Masters such as Isma‘il Minangkabawi andAbdulwahhab Rokan spread the path in the Archipelago, gaining a followingamong ruling elites and peasants alike.The Khalidi literature is vast and constantly growing. Its large output wasenhanced by the introduction of printing into the Ottoman Empire and theMuslim world at large, and on the other hand by the need to respond to thechallenges of its formidable rivals, be they Islamic fundamentalism, secular-ism, or Western culture. The polemical tone adopted by the Khalidiyya isalready apparent in its two foundational texts: Baghdadi’s al-Hadiqa al-nadiyya fi adab al-tariqa al-Naqshbandiyya wa’l-bahja al-Khalidiyya (TheDelicate Garden on the Manners of the Naqshbandi Path and the KhalidiJoy), which was written under Khalid’s supervision, and Khani’s al-Bahjaal-saniyya fi adab al-tariqa al-‘aliyya al-Khalidiyya al-Naqshbandiyya (TheExalted Joy in the Manners of the Lofty Khalidi Naqshbandi Path), thework of his principal deputy in Damascus.These foundational texts were augmented in due course by numerousworks in the variety of genres we have encountered in the previous periods,such as general and thematic treatises, collections of letters, hagiographies,and biographical dictionaries. Notable among the last-named is ‘Abd86SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"al-Majid al-Khani’s al-Hada’iq al-wardiyya fi haqa’iq ajilla’ al-Naqshbandiyya (The Rose Gardens Concerning the Truths of the VenerableNaqshbandis), a construction of the history of the brotherhood from itsCentral Asian beginnings to the Khani family of Damascus. In this periodwe also encounter more allusions to the brotherhood in “secular” docu-ments, thanks partly to its political involvement, as well as in Westernsources such as official reports and travelers’ accounts, which reflect thegrowing interest in the “Orient”. These have been merged with the still fewanthropological and my own observations of contemporary activeNaqshbandi centers.Our knowledge of the Khalidiyya far surpasses that of the earlier stages ofthe Naqshbandiyya. There are detailed studies on the work of Khalid, aswell as his successors in the Ottoman Empire and increasingly also in theArab lands. Less known is the working of the contemporary Mujaddidibranches in India, and less still of the original Naqshbandi affiliations inCentral Asia or China.Diya’ al-Din KhalidAlthough closer to us in time, Khalid left no mark in the collective Muslimmemory comparable to the heritage of his illustrious predecessors, ‘Ubaydul-lah Ahrar in Central Asia or Ahmad Sirhindi in India. This is partly becausein the successor states of the Ottoman Empire, secular Turkey and the Arabcountries with their hegemonic nationalist-Salafi discourse, there was hostil-ity to his legacy, and partly because of his own discreet modes of operation.Only with the recent resurfacing of the brotherhood in some of thesecountries have historians discovered Khalid’s importance in the revival ofIslam on the eve of the modern era, and the Khalidiyya’s role in themodernization of the Ottoman Empire in general.In many respects Khalid’s career represents the culmination of theNaqshbandi enterprise. In him were united, and elaborated in the mostcomplete manner, the two foundations of the brotherhood: its socio-politicalactivism and its commitment to orthodoxy. Despite the various suspicionsand enmities that he faced, and his own peripheral background, Khalidmanaged time and again to influence the men in authority to follow theshari‘a for the sake of the Muslim community, directly in the provincesthrough which he wandered and indirectly in Istanbul. At the same time, as areligious scholar in his own right he embodied in his highly mystical path thesubservience of the tariqa to the shari‘a and to the Prophet’s Sunna. Withinthe general movement for revival and reform of the eighteenth and earlynineteenth centuries, the Khalidiyya distinguished itself by its independentwork in the urban centers of the Empire, as against the Khalwatiyya, whichremained more subservient to the local government in Egypt, or thefollowers of the North African reformist Sufi Ahmad ibn Idris, who directed87SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"their missionary activity to the peripheral areas of the Sahara and theSudan.1Diya’ al-Din Khalid (1776–1827)2 was born in the town of Qaradagh inthe Shahrizur district of Iraqi Kurdistan.

Appar-ently a witness to the Wahhabi takeover of the Holy Cities, Khalid departedthree years later to India to be initiated into the Naqshbandi path at thehands of the foremost Mujaddidi master in Delhi, Shah Ghulam ‘Ali.Following a year of training, the Indian master conferred on him “full andabsolute succession” and instructed him to spread the path in western Asia.Back in Sulaymaniyya, Khalid contracted the enmity of the leading Sufimaster in the city, the powerful Ma‘ruf al-Barzinji of the Qadiriyya brother-hood, and was forced to leave in 1813 for Baghdad. There he gained thepatronage of the Kurdish Haydari family, and many ulama and notablesfollowed their example and became his disciples. For them, as for the Otto-man governor, Khalid’s path offered a viable alternative to the Wahhabi-typeideas that had spread in the city in the previous decades. This successbrought about the birth of the distinct Khalidiyya offshoot.3Following a change of rulers in the Baban amirate, and the new ruler’swish to normalize relations with Baghdad, Khalid was invited to return andestablish himself in Sulaymaniyya. In the succeeding years he ordained alarge number of deputies, who spread the path in the urban centers ofKurdistan and Anatolia and gained the support of several Kurdish princelyfamilies. However, as the pressure of his Qadiri rivals mounted4 Khalidreturned to Baghdad and then, in 1822, with many of his deputies, he wentto Damascus. In the Syrian capital the notable Ghazzi family took him undertheir wing, and numerous ulama and notables received the path fromhim. They included Husayn al-Muradi, the then head of this illustriousMujaddidi family. For these dignitaries, the orthodox tradition that Khalidoffered came to represent the prospect of reinstating law and order, sovulnerable in Damascus at the time. In the remaining five years before hisdeath in a plague in 1827, Khalid worked for the religious revival of the city.Khalid had never visited Istanbul, but from around 1820 he began to dis-patch deputies to the Ottoman capital, possibly in preparation for his ownarrival which, because of his premature death, could not materialize. Hisemissaries won many adherents among Kurdish immigrants to the city andalso its venerable religious scholars and dignitaries. The latter included suchprominent figures as the s ̧eyhülislam and the Chief Judge of Istanbul, as wellas influential bureaucrats. The rigor of the newcomers was bound to arousethe jealousy of other Sufi masters; it also awakened apprehensions on thepart of Sultan Mahmud II, who saw in their orthodox-activist zeal apotential threat to his absolute authority. Nevertheless, the Khalidissupported the reforming measures of the sultan, deeming them necessary88SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"for the preservation of the Muslim state and community in the face of boththe Western and the internal Wahhabi threats. Accordingly, in 1826 theyencouraged the ulama and senior bureaucracy to approve the elimination ofthe moribund Janissary corps, which stood in the way of the OttomanEmpire’s modernization. Shortly thereafter the heterodox Bektashi brother-hood, the ally of the Janissaries, was abolished, and a general mood oforthodoxy came to prevail among the elite of Istanbul.5Following the lead of his eighteenth-century Indian predecessors, Khalidshowed little interest in the Sufi sciences. Instead, he distinguished himself inthe complementary domains of religious learning and the organization ofthe brotherhood, which earned him the epithet dhu al-janahayn – the posses-sor of the two wings, the scholarly and the mystical. As an alim, Khalideventually reversed Sirhindi’s emphasis on the “inner” aspect of the shari‘aand cherished the sciences of jurisprudence and theology as elaborated bythe religious scholars throughout the ages.6 Phrases such as the followingappear time and again in his letters to deputies:I say: the follower of the path before he drinks from this spring andhis soul is elevated to take from this drink must correct his creed andbuttress his conviction in the unity of the necessarily existent [God]in accordance with what the rational theologians sanctioned on thebasis of the Sunna and the [consensus of] the community, such as theAsh‘aris and Maturidis from among the Hanafis and Shafi‘is.7Khalid’s initial success lay apparently in his profound religious eruditionwhich won him, although a stranger, the respect and support of the leadingulama wherever he went. Thus, on arrival in Damascus he was tested by thelocal men of religion, and later was asked by them to compose an epistle onthe theological question of predestination vs. free will. This gave Khalid theopportunity to ground his Naqshbandi activism in the Maturidi doctrine ofkasb (acquisition), according to which man is the doer of his actions andtherefore is responsible for his fate.8More important still were the organizational innovations that Khalidintroduced into the Naqshbandi-Mujaddidi path, the hallmark of the dis-tinct Khalidiyya. One such innovation concerned the practice of khalwa(seclusion). In contrast to the reserved attitude of past Naqshbandi masters,Khalid referred the initial instruction of the disciples to his deputies, andthen gave them concentrated training during a seclusion period of forty days.This method allowed him to ordain a large number of disciples in the short-est time, and thus promoted the spread of the Khalidiyya. In all, he is said tohave ordained 116 deputies, assigning to each, apparently in imitation of theIndian practice, a carefully delineated region.A complementary innovation concerned the spiritual method of rabita.Practically replacing the customary accompaniment, Khalid demanded that89SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"all Khalidi disciples, including those who had never seen him, concentratein their imagination solely on his figure. This measure was designed toconsolidate the new offshoot under the leadership of its founder. It met,however, with opposition on the part of deputies, particularly those work-ing away from the master: ‘Abd al-Wahhab al-Susi, Khalid’s successfuldeputy in Istanbul, who was ultimately expelled from the brotherhood, andIsma‘il Shirwani in the Caucasus; they felt that their spiritual independencewas curtailed by the practice. In a letter of reproach to the latter, Khalidwrites:The masters of our path declared that rabita to him who has notpassed away from his being is of no avail to the follower of the path,but may put him in danger. . . The master who has attained realiz-ation is an intermediary between the seeker and his Lord. Turningaway from him entails turning away from Him. Don’t teach anyoneto bind his heart to your figure; even if it appears to him, it is thedevil’s deceit. And don’t ordain anyone as your deputy unless it is myorder . . . If you persevere in this neglect, we will discard youaltogether.9The rabita was also criticized by many ulama, who saw it as getting dan-gerously close to unlawful saint worship. These controversies spawned aplethora of epistles for and against the practice, beginning with Khalid him-self and continuing after him, especially in discussing bondage to dead mas-ters (rabitat al-mawt).10 A third organizational innovation was ghalq al-bab(closing the door) during khatm al-khwajagan, the litany concluding thedhikr session. A kind of extension of the silent dhikr, this practice was meantto give the new brotherhood a more exclusive character. Together, theseinnovations helped Khalid to turn his brotherhood into an effective socio-religious movement, whose aim was to support the Ottoman government’seffort to modernize while keeping it within the bounds of the shari‘a in theservice of the Muslim community.11The late Ottoman EmpireDespite the continuing misgivings of Sultan Mahmud II, the Khalidiyya, likethe Naqshbandiyya and the Mujaddidiyya before it, struck deep roots inIstanbul. Owing to its activity, by the mid-nineteenth century theNaqshbandiyya had become the most widespread brotherhood in theOttoman capital, and a succession of able masters reinforced its prestigedown to the end of the Empire. Naqshbandi influence was discernable inparticular in the formation of Mahmud II’s son and successor, SultanAbdülmecid (1839–1861). One of the tutors of the young prince was aKhalidi adept; and many of the high bureaucrats who had been attracted to90SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"the orthodox ideals of the Khalidiyya during his father’s lifetime continuedto serve him in his early years on the throne.Abdülmecid’s mother and sister also belonged to the Naqshbandiyya.They were followers of the Indian Muhammad Jan (d. 1850), another deputyof Ghulam ‘Ali who had settled in Mecca in the late 1820s. More moderatethan Khalid, Jan too sent emissaries to Istanbul, and through them estab-lished contacts in the highest echelons. As Abu-Manneh has shown, aNaqshbandi-inspired orthodoxy stood behind the Gülhane rescript of 1839,in which the new sultan pledged to follow the shari‘a and implement a rule ofjustice for all his subjects.The enduring commitment of Sultan Abdülmecid to the Naqshbandiyyawas demonstrated in the building of a mausoleum and a large lodge overKhalid’s tomb in Damascus in the 1840s and in his frequent visits in thefollowing decade to the Khalidi lodge in Fatih, where he requested that aweekly khatm al-khwajagan be performed at his grave after his death. Thepractice apparently continued until the abolition of the brotherhoods in1925.Yet with the transfer of actual power in the Ottoman Empire from theearly 1850s on from the Palace to the Sublime Porte, which at that time wascoming under Western political influence, the Naqshbandi position was con-siderably weakened. In the imperial edict of 1856, which was dictated by theWestern allies following the Crimean War, civil and political equality weregranted to the non-Muslim subjects of the sultan in direct contravention ofthe shari‘a. Khalidis played a leading role in the resistance to this edict, andone of them, the Kurdish scholar Ahmad al-Sulaymani, headed the Societyof Zealots which in 1859 was accused of hatching a conspiracy againstthe government.12 As will be shown, Khalidi influence was apparent in theteachings of the oppositional Young Ottoman movement.The Naqshbandiyya in general and its Khalidi offshoot in particular wereable to reassert themselves in the Ottoman capital in the late 1870s, as polit-ical power shifted back to the Palace. Many of them became harnessed to the(Pan-) Islamic policy inaugurated by Sultan Abdülhamid II (1876–1909) fol-lowing his prorogation of the first Ottoman constitution in 1876. Two majorcomponents of this policy were the sultan’s posture as the Caliph of allMuslims, by means of which he strove to fortify his legitimacy, and hispatronage of the Sufi brotherhoods, which he regarded as a vital channel ofcommunication to his people.13 Thus, as early as 1878 Abdülhamid renovatedthe Bukhari lodge in the Sultan Ahmet quarter and employed its head as anemissary to the Khanate of Bukhara.14 Similarly, the last descendant of‘Abdullah Nida’i to head the Kashghari lodge, Mehmed ‘Ashir (d. 1903),was appointed member of the prestigious Council of Sufi Masters.15On the other hand, Khalidis who opposed the autocratic regime of SultanAbdülhamid II, and apparently also the Westernized state reforms, whichgreatly accelerated during the Hamidian period, were dealt with severely.91SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Figure 6.1Major Mujaddidi and Khalidi influences in Istanbul"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"This was especially the case with the popular Kurdish master Mehmed As‘adIrbili (d. 1931), who after heading another lodge in Istanbul for a decade wasbanished in 1897 to his hometown in Iraqi Kurdistan. He returned after therevolution of 1908 and joined the Sufi association that favored the YoungTurk movement. The association was founded by Musa Kazim, a Khalidifollower known for his reformist inclinations, especially in the field of educa-tion. He served twice as s ̧eyhülislam under the Young Turks, the second termcovering the last two and a half years of the empire.16At the forefront of the Naqshbandi masters who opted for complete loy-alty to the autocratic rule of Sultan Abdülhamid II was Ahmed ZiyauddinGümüs ̧hanevi (d. 1894). Born in 1818 into a merchant family from north-eastern Anatolia, Gümüs ̧hanevi went to Istanbul to complete his religiousstudies and remained as a teacher. He claimed to have been initiated into theKhalidiyya and ordained as deputy by Sulayman al-Urwadi, a Syrianfollower of Khalid who visited the Ottoman capital in 1846. Only more thanfifteen years later, however, after completing his two main works – acollection of hadith and a compendium of the Sufi brotherhoods – didGümüs ̧hanevi embark on a career as a Sufi master. His numerous deputieswere mostly Turks from western Anatolia, along with some immigrants fromthe Caucasus and residents of other Muslim lands, notably Kazan andEgypt.In defiance of the late Tanzimat Westernized statesmen, Gümüs ̧haneviestablished his lodge directly opposite the Porte. In 1877–1878, he along witha group of disciples, fought in person in the Russo-Ottoman war. His loyaltywon him the favor of the sultan, into whose presence he was sometimesinvited, as well as many followers among the government officials. One of hisdeputies was sent to Peking to preside over the Hamidiyya Islamic universitythere.17 Gümüs ̧hanevi departed from Khalid’s teachings in some significantrespects. For one, instead of the shari‘a he emphasized the study of hadith,especially those traditions that supported absolute obedience to the Sultan-Caliph. For another, he adhered to the doctrine of wahdat al-wujud andauthorized the vocal dhikr, which brought his branch closer to other Sufibrotherhoods. Thus, in a simplified exposition of Ibn ‘Arabi’s teaching hewrites:The secrets of the existential unity (tawhid wujudi) might be revealed.The source of this is that because of the abundance of spiritualworship and exercises, the abandonment of books and desires, thepermanence of dhikr and meditation, the seizure of passionate love,love to the true beloved, [because of all these] it appears to the fol-lower of the path.

One lodge of the brotherhood was established inSarajevo in the mid-nineteenth century, but by the 1970s, when Algar visitedit, the place was closed and in a state of neglect. Another lodge was built innearby Visoko shortly before the First World War by the Sufi scholar HusniNumanagic ́ (d. 1931), the most eminent religious figure in Bosnia at the time.Numanagic ́ pursued his studies in Istanbul, Medina, and Cairo, and workedas a teacher in Visoko before he was appointed mufti of Travnik. All Bosnianlineages regarded the Qadiriyya as a twin, or even the senior brotherhood,and practiced vocal dhikr in their lodges. There are also some Shi‘i elementsin their devotional life. The activity of the Naqshbandi lodges in Bosnia wasinterrupted during the Second World War, and in 1952 they were officiallydissolved, though the order was hardly enforced.20 No such measures weretaken in Kosovo and Macedonia, where the center of activity moved fromSkopje to the Albanian-dominated Djakovica. The lodge that operates in thelatter city was founded in 1932 by Shaykh Jakup, who received the path fromMehmed As‘ad Irbili in Istanbul; it was taken in due course by his son,Mehmed Ali Isnic ́i, who dedicated himself to the defense of Sufism.21The Arab worldAlthough two decisive landmarks in the career of Diya’ al-Din Khalid,official hostility in Baghdad and Damascus, and the rather short period oftime he spent in each, left his mission incomplete. The work of Khalid’ssuccessors in the provinces of Iraq and Syria remained to the end of theOttoman Empire dependent on the political vicissitudes in Istanbul, a factthat also exacerbated the recurrent struggles among them over the leader-ship. Only toward the end of the nineteenth century did Khalidi mastersmanage to consolidate the position of the brotherhood in these provinces,while facing the rising challenges of modernity and fundamentalism. In theHijaz, by contrast, and especially in Mecca, already by the 1820s Khalid’sdeputies perceptibly strengthened the Naqshbandi presence and radiated hismessage far and wide, from Istanbul to Indonesia. Here they competedamong themselves, but also with masters of the Mujaddidi mother brother-hood, which since 1858 included Sirhindi’s descendants from Delhi. By theend of the nineteenth century the Naqshbandiyya was also implanted inEgypt through three separate lineages originating in Istanbul, the Haramayn,and Kurdistan.94SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Upon his abrupt departure from Baghdad in late 1822, Khalid left behinda collective leadership, with an emphatic warning to keep clear of politics.The senior figure in this group of disciples was ‘Abd al-Ghafur al-Mushahidi. The position of the Iraqi Khalidiyya was greatly enhanced afterthe inauguration of the Tanzimat reforms, when the governor took themunder his wing and built a magnificent lodge for their use. Concomitantly,and to the end of the empire, the heads of the brotherhood in Baghdadengaged in an ongoing struggle with two rising trends in Iraq’s religiousscene, the fundamentalist Wahhabiyya-turned-Salafiyya, which was led bythe Alusi family, and the Shi‘a. The circumstances that led to the surfacing ofthe long controversy with Abu al-Thana’ al-Alusi, the founder of the familywho had studied with Khalid in his youth, are somewhat apologeticallydescribed by a prominent scion of the Haydari family that had originallypatronized Khalid in Baghdad:The educated scholar who is known as Alusi, may God forgive him,composed an epistle against the successors of our master Khalid,may God preserve his secret, when the governor of BaghdadMuhammad Najib Pasha dismissed him from his post as juris-consult. He [Alusi] wrote against the exalted Khalidi brotherhood,because the said minister belonged to His Highness our masterKhalid . . . He destroyed the Khalidi shrine in Baghdad and built itanew in a better way . . . Alusi composed this epistle because of hislow opinion that the Khalidi successors urged him [the governor] todismiss him, but this is far from true.22Following the death of Mushahidi in 1862 a fierce struggle broke out overthe leadership of the Baghdadi Khalidiyya, which was ultimately resolved byinviting an outsider master to head its lodge. This, in his turn, conferred thetask to the Sufi scholar Da’ud ibn Sulayman ibn Jirjis (1812/1816–1881),who dedicated himself to the refutation of the Salafi creed. In a series oftreatises he penned against the Salafis during the 1870s, Ibn Jirjis defendedthe Sufi customs of visiting saints’ tombs and seeking their intercession, aswell as the orthodox learned practices of following the schools of law andimitating their authorities (taqlid).23Ibn Jirjis was succeeded by a no less reputable scholar, Muhammad Sa‘id(d. 1920), who however had a second Khalidi authorization from the prom-inent Kurdish master ‘Umar Diya’ al-Din of Hawraman.24 Author of a com-pendium on Islamic sciences, Sa‘id turned much of his energies to containingthe spread of the Shi‘a in Iraq. This struggle secured him the patronage ofSultan Abdülhamid II, who built for him a college in the major Shi‘i concen-tration of Samarra. Subsequently he was rewarded with the lucrative pos-ition of teacher and preacher in the Abu Hanifa mosque in Baghdad, whichhe filled for two decades.

He became head of the clandestine Arab nationalistal-Ahd society in 1914 and instigated actions against the British presence inIraq following the Ottoman departure in 1918. The genealogical lines ofmost contemporary Naqshbandi masters in the Arab parts of the countryreturn to him. No study has been done so far on the role of the Khalidiyya inother parts of Arab Iraq or on its activity during the Mandate period andafter independence.25The untimely death of Khalid in the course of a plague in 1827 left theKhalidiyya of Damascus in an even more vulnerable situation. Many of hissenior deputies were carried off with him and a year later the rest of thosewho had accompanied him from Iraq were sent back there on the orders ofSultan Mahmud II. Consequently leadership devolved into the hands ofMuhammad al-Khani (d. 1862), the most senior of Khalid’s few Arab Syriandeputies. Hailing from a small town near Hama, Khani found it difficult tointegrate into the religious elite of Damascus, and most of his deputies wereKurds or Turks. His claim to be the designated head of the entire Khalidiyyawas challenged by Khalid’s younger brother, Mahmud al-Sahib (d. 1866),who settled in Damascus in 1840 under the aegis of Sultan Abdülmecid.26The other Syrian Arab deputies of Khalid, Sulayman al-Urwadi (d. 1858),whom we have encountered as Gümüs ̧hanevi’s master, and Ahmad al-Tizkili(d. 1867), established independent centers in Tripoli and Homs respectively.The center in Tripoli died out in the 1850s, but that of Homs was to play acentury later an important role in the formation of the northern Syrian soci-ety of the Muslim Brothers.Meanwhile, in Damascus the dispute over the leadership of the Khalidiyyawas brought to a head by As‘ad al-Sahib (d. 1928), Mahmud’s son andKhalid’s nephew, who in the name of orthodoxy was harnessed to theIslamic policies of Abdülhamid. His adversary was Muhammad al-Khanithe younger (d. 1898), who was associated with the local reformist circle ofthe celebrated amir ‘Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza’iri (d. 1883). Jaza’iri had beeninitiated into the Naqshbandiyya by Khalid in his youth and combined theteaching of Ibn ‘Arabi with a quest for modernity. Toward the end of thenineteenth century his followers moved to adopt the oppositional Salaficreed. Both sides made use of the new technology of print to advance theirclaims, Sahib publishing the foundational texts of the Khalidiyya underofficial patronage, the Khanis printing their works privately in Egypt. Thedelicate position of Muhammad al-Khani, who still regarded himself ashead of the entire Khalidiyya, is reflected in the description by his son ‘Abdal-Majid (d. 1901), in his biographical dictionary:He loved very much the Malamati way of concealing the secret,being agreeable to the people in their talk, movement and standing,equaling the religious scholars in his dress and appearance . . . Hechanged nothing even in the smallest detail from the system of the96SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"exalted brotherhood from what it was in the days of our master[Khalid], may God sanctify his noble secret. He did not allow, andwill never allow any of the seekers of the path to bind his heart but tothe figure of our master, and strongly condemns those who allow it.27Upon the death of Muhammad al-Khani, Sahib managed to deprive hisson of the succession and took over their lodge. He was able also to retain hisfavored position with the Young Turks, who renovated his headquarters andsanctioned his publishing a large collection of Khalid’s letters in exchangefor his support of their regime.28The most outstanding Khalidi master in Damascus during the Hamidianperiod, however, was the immigrant ‘Isa al-Kurdi (d. 1912). He arrived to thecity from the Diyarbakr region in 1878 and settled in the Kurdish quarter,where he dedicated himself to religious instruction and Sufi guidance andgained a large number of followers. ‘Isa appreciated the mystical writings ofGümüs ̧hanevi, his contemporary from Istanbul, but clung to the traditionalNaqshbandi stress on the shari‘a rather than on hadith and denounced Sufipractices that contravened it. Less hostile than Ibn Jirjis, his Iraqi colleague,to the emergent Salafi trend, he still approved of visiting saints’ tombs andcondemned the use of ijtihad as rational deliberation. Faithful but not servileto the sultan, ‘Isa feared most that Sufism would succumb to the combinedpressures of modernity and fundamentalism, and added some new emphasesto the Naqshbandi path to sustain it. He required his deputies to concealtheir path from outsiders and keep close connections between themselves; onthe other hand, he centered much of his effort on the less affected urbanlower classes and the countryside. This conservative populism and the dis-creet collective leadership he cherished paved the way for a transformation inthe Syrian Naqshbandiyya in the twentieth century.29Khalid counted among his followers the Hanafi mufti of Jerusalem, whobelonged to the celebrated Husayni family, but the only Naqshbandi centerwhich continued to operate in Palestine after him was that at the Uzbekilodge. Its membership was enlarged at the end of the nineteenth century byadepts from the Central Asian khanates who refused to live under infidelRussian rule. One of these refugees, Rashid al-Bukhari, established the lin-eage that ran the lodge throughout the twentieth century. The weekly sessionwas interrupted in 1968 in the wake of the Six-Day War, which cut the lodgeoff from the bulk of its community of adherents in Amman, but later itsactivity was renewed.30No detailed studies are available on the Naqshbandiyya and its Khalidioffshoot in nineteenth-century Hijaz. Here we must be content with high-lighting some landmarks, mostly on the basis of outside sources. Khalidappointed two deputies to the Holy Cities, the foremost being ‘Abdallah al-Arzinjani in Mecca, whose influence on Istanbul has already been noted andwho introduced the Khalidiyya into Indonesia. He was followed by the97SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Mujaddidi Muhammad Jan, the master of Sultan Abdülmecid’s mother. Thepresence of the Mujaddidiyya in the Haramayn was further strengthenedwith the arrival in 1858 of the then head of the lodge in Delhi, Ahmad Sa‘id(d. 1860). A descendant of Sirhindi, Sa‘id spent the last two years of his lifein Medina, where he continued to guide disciples on the path. He was suc-ceeded by his three surviving sons, two of whom remained in the Hijaz andestablished their own family lineages, while the third returned to Indiashortly before his death.31The Dutch scholar Snouck Hurgronje, who arrived in Mecca in 1885 tostudy the Indonesian residents and pilgrims, mentions four Naqshbandi mas-ters then active in the city, two Khalidis belonging to Arzinjani’s line andtwo Mujaddidis (see Figure 6.2). The Khalidi masters were more popular andcompeted among themselves for disciples.32 Manzilawi, who translated intoArabic Kashifi’s Rashahat ‘ayn al-hayat and Sirhindi’s Maktubat, describeshis master, Zawawi, and the challenges a Sufi master had to face at that time:He, may God protect him, was very strict in the training andadvancing of the brothers, urging them to exert themselves on thepath in their words and states. Moreover, he often assisted them withhis money, saying that if a poor man to whom no one pays attentioncomes to me to receive the path, I like him more than fifty intelligentmen who ask to study with me . . .He said: some people say: how can we waste five years or six yearsin attaining this path, while it is not certain whether you will get itduring this period or not. This saying points to their remotenessfrom the field of felicity. If a man withholds from giving five years ofhis life for the search of God most praised and high, in what will hespend his entire life?33Naqshbandi activity in Mecca and Medina, and the Sufi presence in theHijaz in general, were brought to an end, at least publicly, in 1925, followingthe Saudi takeover of the Holy Places and their subjection to Wahhabidoctrine.One of the earliest Naqshbandi masters to propagate the path in Egyptwas Ahmad al-Dimyati (d. 1715), who had received it while in Arabia from adeputy of Tajuddin al-‘Uthmani. Two other Naqshbandi lodges becameactive in Cairo in the early nineteenth century, the one inhabited by Anato-lian Turks and the other by Central Asians. Only after mid-century, however,and especially since the 1880s, did the brotherhood establish a more perman-ent basis in Egypt. This was due to the combined endeavors of several mas-ters. One was Gümüs ̧hanevi, who appointed two local deputies: the TurkAhmad ‘Ashiq, for whom Khediv ‘Abbas (1848–1854) had built a lodge inCairo in 1851, and the Arab Juda Ibrahim, who after his ordination duringthe master’s visit to Egypt in 1876 won a following in the Delta region.98SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Figure 6.2Principal Naqshbandi masters in nineteenth-century Haramayn"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Another master was the Sudanese Isma‘il al-Sinnari, who had been initiatedinto both the Mujaddidiyya and the Khalidiyya in the Hijaz and whoestablished his own branch in Sudan and Upper Egypt.The last, and most consequential, Khalidi master in Egypt wasMuhammad Amin al-Kurdi (d. 1914), another deputy of ‘Umar Diya’al-Din of Hawraman who had settled in Cairo in 1886 and began topropagate the path a decade later. A religious scholar of note, he taught atal-Azhar and authored several books presenting the Naqshbandiyya andIslamic law.34 Amin attracted a considerable following in Cairo and in therural areas to the north.

Their prosperity wasfacilitated by the relaxation of control by the state-sponsored central Sufiauthority, which had favored the established brotherhoods, after the Britishconquest of the country in 1882. This entailed, however, a far-reaching adap-tation to the popular mystical traditions prevalent among the Egyptians. TheJudiyya and the followers of Sinnari have both adopted the vocal dhikr at theexpense of the silent one, and participate along with other brotherhoods insaints’ birthday ceremonies (mawlids) and other public celebrations. Aminal-Kurdi too was integrated into Egyptian society, though his family branch,conducted by his son and grandson after him, apparently appeals to higherstrata of society.36 Though more successful than previous Naqshbandibranches, the Khalidiyya also failed to expand farther west to North Africaor to Muslim lands south of the Sahara.KurdistanMost of Khalid’s deputies were ethnic Kurds like him, and it was largelythrough their efforts that the Khalidiyya was disseminated in the Ottomanlands. In Kurdistan itself, as we have seen, Khalid had appointed deputies forthe urban centers, assigning to each of them a specific territorial jurisdiction.His initial endeavor received a great boost from the 1830s on, when theindigenous Kurdish amirates were eliminated by the Ottoman reformers andEuropean influence intensified. Khalidi masters, mostly with some parallelQadiri affiliation, moved in to fill the vacuum and acquired enormous powerand wealth as religious leaders and mediators. Their political influencepeaked in the period lasting from ‘Ubaydullah of Nehri’s short-lived cam-paign to establish a Kurdish principality on Iranian soil in 1880 to Said ofPalu’s revolt against the newly founded secular Turkish republic in 1925.Thereafter the fortunes of the Khalidiyya varied according to country. InTurkey it was outlawed, together with all other Sufi brotherhoods, in thewake of the Shaykh Said revolt, but it resurfaced following the liberalizationof the 1950s; in Iraq and Iran Kurdish resistance movements to the central-izing policies of the Ba‘th and to the Islamic regime of Khomeini wererespectively organized by the Khalidi lineages of Barzani and Hawraman; inSyria, by contrast, Kurdish Khalidi resident masters and refugees from theneighboring countries normally cooperated with those in power.The Naqshbandi presence in Kurdistan predated Khalid by some threecenturies. Its introduction there was associated primarily with refugees fromSafavid Iran. Among them was the seventeenth-century ‘Aziz Mahmud, sonof an influential Naqshbandi family from Urumia who established himself inDiyarbakr. From this strategically located town his reputation spreadthroughout Kurdistan and beyond, the number of his followers was reportedto exceed 40,000. Most of them were common people, on whose behalf101SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Mahmud sought relief from excessive taxation. But there were also highofficials and big merchants who came to pay their respects. In the name ofSunni orthodoxy Mahmud supported the Ottoman war against the Safavids,and took part in Sultan Murad IV’s 1635 campaign on Yerivan.Nevertheless, on the way back from his next Persian campaign in 1639, inwhich he wrested back Baghdad, Murad had the master executed, apparentlyout of fear of his great popularity and because of rumors that he was prepar-ing a messianic rebellion. Mahmud’s son and grandson retained much of hispower, but were more interested in poetry and music than in training dis-ciples and the lineage died out. The celebrated Turkish traveler Evliya Çelebimentions Naqshbandi lodges in five other cities in mid-seventeenth-centuryKurdistan, among them one for Indians and Central Asians. Like Mahmud,all these masters belonged to the original Naqshbandiyya, while hardly anyof them was a Kurd.37Until the early nineteenth century the dominant brotherhood in Kurdistanwas the Qadiriyya. Khalid’s missionary work in these regions during the1810s challenged this supremacy, and his success was such that even Qadirimasters were converted to his path. His numerous deputies established sec-ondary centers in their home cities and towns, forming a wide network thatcovered Kurdistan and the adjacent areas. This process was accelerated afterthe death of the founder, when no longer impeded by his endeavor to create aunified brotherhood, his followers turned their lodges into frequently clash-ing independent regional cults, and themselves into objects of unparalleledveneration. Many combined the Khalidiyya with some Qadiri affiliation,while others turned into antinomian sects.The destruction of the semi-autonomous Kurdish amirates, Europeanpenetration, and the resurfacing of tribalism in the course of the nineteenthcentury enabled the Khalidi lineages to extend their authority over the tribes.Consolidating their position as landlord families, they did not hesitate toexploit their countrymen in quest of political power and wealth. Such werethe saintly families from Hawraman, Nehri, Palu, and Barzani, which sup-plied the leadership for a succession of Kurdish religious-national rebellions,some of them with millenarian overtones, against the Ottomans and theirtwentieth-century successors in Turkey and Iraq.38Among the prominent Khalidi lineages of Kurdistan pride of place goesto the Siraj al-Din family of Tawila, in the Hawraman region near Halabja.Its ancestor, ‘Uthman Siraj al-Din I (d. 1867), had studied with Khalid in hisyouth, and in due course became his first deputy. He accompanied the masterfor a decade before returning in 1820 to his hometown, where he establishedone of the major centers for the spread of the Khalidiyya in Kurdistan. Theusually laconic Haydari writes:He had many dazzling miracles and visible amazing supernaturaldeeds. The elite and common people testified to his sainthood. He102SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"became famous among the people, and many distinguished religiousscholars and the most respected virtuous and pious followed thepath under his hand. Many Jews and Christians were converted toIslam through his attention and heed, followed the path in his logde,and attained mystical states. The condition of this saint was mostlyintoxication and majesty.39In recognition of his position, Siraj al-Din was invited in 1838 by theBaban ruler to supervise the Khalidi lodge in Sulaymaniyya. Like his master,whom he survived by four decades, ‘Uthman ordained a large number ofdeputies and determined the direction of his lineage. By appointing two ofhis sons as successors he confirmed its hereditary character, and by sendinghis grandson, ‘Umar Diya’ al-Din (d. 1901), to be trained at the lodge of aninfluential Qadiri master in Kirkuk, he established a firm bond between thetwo traditions in Iraqi Kurdistan. ‘Umar, whom we have met as the masterof both Muhammad Sa‘id of Baghdad and Amin al-Kurdi in Cairo, intro-duced the vocal dhikr into his branch and was known for his enthusiasm forscience, education, and poetry.During the first half of the twentieth century the Hawraman lineage wassuccessively headed by two brothers: Najm al-Din (d. 1918), who is mostremembered for his refusal to receive a monthly stipend from Sultan Abdül-hamid, and ‘Ala’ al-Din (d. 1954), who supported the Kurdish nationalstruggle in Iraq. With the latter the Naqshbandi and Qadiri traditions werefully merged. The last master in this lineage, ‘Uthman Siraj al-Din II, was areligious scholar, a poet, and a practicing physician. He left Iraq in 1959following the military coup that put an end to the monarchy. Residing fortwo decades in Iranian Kurdistan, he returned in the wake of the IslamicRevolution in 1979 after organizing a resistance force from among his fol-lowers. ‘Uthman spent the last years of his life in Istanbul, where he died in1997 without appointing a successor.40 There have recently been reports thatAnsar al-Islam, an Islamist group connected with al-Qa‘ida, desecrated thelodges and tombs of the Naqshbandi masters in Hawraman and drove thepopulation out of their homes.41‘Ubaydallah of Nehri, the leader of the first Kurdish rebellion withnationalist overtones in 1880, belonged to a saintly family that boasted des-cent from the Prophet and from the founder of the Qadiriyya brotherhood,‘Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani. In the early nineteenth century the family headbecame a deputy of Khalid, and in the 1840s his nephew Taha moved to thevillage of Nehri, on the Turkish-Iraqi-Iranian border. Concerned about theRussian southward drive, he participated in person in the jihad against it inthe Crimean war and apparently sent warriors to support the resistance inDaghestan. His son ‘Ubaydullah continued in the same line and was nomin-ated commander of the Kurdish tribal forces in the Russian–Ottoman warof 1877–1878.103SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Following the Ottoman defeat ‘Ubaydullah rebelled, and in 1880 sent anarmy across the Iranian border with the aim of establishing a Kurdish Sunniprincipality. The movement was suppressed within a few weeks, not beforethousands of Azeri Shi‘is were massacred in the city of Mahabad. Locallyhailed as a hero, ‘Ubaydullah was summoned to Istanbul and, under foreignpressure, was exiled to Mecca where he died in 1883. His eldest son wasallowed to return to Nehri, and his descendants continued to engage in thepolitics of Iraq, Turkey and Iran. Another son, ‘Abd al-Qadir, settled inIstanbul after the Young Turk revolution of 1908 and gained respect as themoral leader of the Kurdish community in the city. He was elected Presidentof the Ottoman State Council, but in the aftermath of the 1925 rebellion hewas hanged together with his son.42Shaykh Said’s revolt was the most consequential of the Naqshbandi-leduprisings in Kurdistan, and a turning point in the evolution of Kurdishnationalism. It expressed a reaction to the secular and anti-Kurdish policiesof Atatürk in general and to the abolition of the Caliphate by the TurkishNational Assembly in 1924 in particular. The explicit aim of the revolt was toestablish an independent Kurdish state in which Islamic law would berespected. Said was a scion of a saintly Qadiri family from Diyarbakr; hisancestor had been introduced into the Naqshbandiyya by a deputy ofKhalid and accompanied the great master to Syria before settling as hisdeputy in the village of Palu, north of Diyarbakr. His sons and followerslater dispersed among the Zaza-speaking Kurdish tribes, building their ownlodges and acquiring land.The groundwork for the revolt was prepared by the clandestine Azadi(freedom) organization, which had been founded by Kurdish army officers in1923. Said supported their move and, after their arrest, mobilized his fol-lowers in the Zaza plains under his own military command. The revolt brokeout in February and culminated in the unsuccessful siege of Diyarbakr. Itwas suppressed within two months. Said was intercepted at the end of Aprilon his way to Iran and was executed with many other leaders of the revolt. InDecember 1925 an official order was issued to close all Sufi lodges andshrines in Turkey. Kurdish rebels who fled to the mountains continued aguerrilla campaign for years to come, and only after two more majorrebellions, in Ararat in 1930 and in Dersim in 1938, was Turkish Kurdistaneventually pacified.43In view of their persecution in Turkey, many Sufi masters fled to theadjacent Jazira region in northeast Syria, which as a result witnessed a con-spicuous upsurge in religious sentiment during the 1920s and 1930s. Herethey were used by the French Mandatory authorities as a counterbalance tothe Kurdish nationalists. Others arrived in Damascus, where they were inte-grated into the lineage of ‘Isa al-Kurdi. Among the Khalidi masters whosettled in the Syrian Jazira was Ahmad Ghiznawi of Tal Ma‘ruf, who hadnumerous followers on both sides of the border. The rapid economic104SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"development of the region in the 1950s and 1960s greatly diminished theinfluence of these masters, though they kept their authority in less developedTurkish Kurdistan.44In Iraq the Kurdish struggle for autonomy is generally associated with theBarzani family. Its origins go back to the mid-nineteenth century, when ‘Abdal-Rahman was sent by his master, Taha of Nehri, to settle in the village ofBarzan, between Sulaymaniyya and Irbil. There he established a large follow-ing among the peasants of the region in the face of the hostile landlords.This social standing gained ‘Abd al-Rahman’s successors the unboundedloyalty of their disciples, who often came to consider them as Mahdis. On theother hand, they incurred the wrath of other Naqshbandi masters who pre-ferred to ally with the urban and tribal elites. The clash between the twocurrents came to a head after the formation of the Iraqi state in 1921. Thethen head of the family, Ahmad Barzani, was proclaimed God incarnate byhis disciples, to the indignation of rival Khalidi masters such as the influen-tial Baha’ al-Din Bamrani, who could count among his disciples the kingand the celebrated statesman Nuri Sa‘id. When the Iraqi government con-quered the Kurdish area Ahmad and his non-shaykh brother Mustafaescaped to Iran. Both took part in the declaration of the Kurdish Republicof Mahabad in 1946. Following the military coup of 1958 Mustafa wasinvited to return to Iraq, but as relations between the government and theKurds deteriorated he declared a war, which continued intermittently from1961 until his defeat in 1975. During the struggle his rival Bamranis sidedwith Baghdad and actively fought the Kurdish nationalists.45The North CaucasusAnother predominantly tribal area where the Naqshbandiyya-Khalidiyyastruck roots in the first half of the nineteenth century was the northeastCaucasus. Here, its orthodox-activist ideals were eagerly adopted by thepopulations of Daghestan and Chechnya as a response to the disruption oftheir socio-economic fabric and traditional way of life by the imperial Rus-sian advance. According to local tradition, the first Naqshbandi leader inthese regions was the Chechen Shaykh Mansour, who led the mountaintribes in jihad against the Russians between 1785 and 1791, but it is doubtfulwhether he belonged to the brotherhood.The Khalidiyya was introduced into the North Caucasus a quarter of acentury later by Isma‘il al-Kurdemiri, an indigenous deputy of Khalid whoestablished himself in Shirvan in today’s Azerbaijan. His foremost deputy inthe neighboring land of Daghestan was the learned Muhammad al-Yaraghiwho, together with his own deputy Jamal al-Din al-Ghazi Ghumuqi, spreadthe path farther west to the more superficially Islamized Chechnya. Theaggressive anti-Islamic policy of the Russians ultimately forced Yaraghi in1829 to give his sanction to jihad. The war was conducted by three successive105SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Imams, the last of whom, Shamil, established an Islamic state in the territor-ies under his control and continued the resistance for almost three decadesuntil his final capitulation in 1859.46Kurdemiri, better known in his later life as al-Shirvani, was born in a smallvillage near Baku. He traveled extensively in search of knowledge, and in1813 became one of the first deputies of Khalid in Baghdad. He received athorough mystic training, was ordained as “absolute deputy” in 1817, andFigure 6.3The Naqshbandi-Khalidi lineage in the North Caucasus106SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"was then sent back to his native Shirvan. For more than eight yearsKurdemiri-Shirvani preached the path in these quarters as well as in neigh-boring Daghestan. His success was such that he felt justified to ask his dis-ciples to perform the rabita toward himself, though he repented after Khalidthreatened to expel him from the brotherhood. Working in a predominantlyShi‘i country, he did insist on abandoning his master’s animosity toward theSh‘ia in the name of Muslim unity. As the Russian government becameaware of Shirvani’s role in inspiring the religious movement in Daghestanand Chechnya it banished two of his deputies to Siberia, while he himself wasforced in 1826 to leave for the Ottoman Empire. He spent the last two dec-ades of his life training disciples in eastern Anatolia, whereas his sonsattained after him high posts in the Ottoman bureaucracy.47Shirvani’s message was first introduced into Daghestan by a certain KhassMuhammad, who had met the master while on a journey to Bukhara. Khasswas a student of one of the leading religious scholars in the country,Muhammad al-Yaraghi of Kurah, and it was he who in 1820 convinced theteacher to set off to Shirvan. Yaraghi was then introduced into the brother-hood and within a few weeks was made a deputy. On his return home hebegan preaching among his folk to repent, follow the shari‘a, and renounceworldly pleasures. His words fell on fertile ground and a wide religiousrevival soon encircled Daghestan. Subjected to severe economic depredationsperpetrated by the Russian forces, and especially afflicted by the moral deg-radation of the hapless local rulers who had given themselves to drink, thepeople came to see “a return to Islam” as the way to salvation. The Naqsh-bandi doctrine was disseminated in the North Caucasus through Yaraghi’soutstanding disciple, Jamal al-Din al-Ghazi Ghumuki, who in 1824 left hisposition as secretary to the Khan of Kurah in order to follow the path. In atreatise he dedicated to the tariqa, Ghazi Ghumuki stressed the supremacyof the shari‘a and espoused the silent dhikr and the rabita, but he also maderoom for the vocal dhikr and especially restored the primary importance ofaccompanying the master (suhba).48Still, the majority of those who responded to Yaraghi’s call did so becauseof its political implications. His followers in the villages of Kurah andthroughout Daghestan overlooked his counsel to act with prudence in theface of the supreme Russian might, and to concentrate on the implementa-tion of the shari‘a; they chose confrontation. The Russians demanded of theKhan to stop the agitation, and in 1825 both Yaraghi and Ghazi Ghumuqiwere forced to seek refuge abroad. Meanwhile, the movement spread toChechnya, where many came to see Yaraghi in the image of Shaykh Man-sour. The Chechen revolt of 1825–1826 was led by a secular commander, butthe Naqshbandiyya provided its ideological underpinnings. The commanderhad visited Yaraghi before the revolt and took back with him one ofhis adepts, Muhammad al-Quduqli, who laid the foundations for theNaqshbandi network in Chechnya. Quduqli adjusted the Khalidi message to107SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"local messianic expectations, and promised the arrival of the Imam to heraldthe final war against the Russians. Later he announced that a fellowNaqshbandi and ultimately he himself was that Imam. The Khalidiinvolvement in the Chechen revolt remained mostly symbolic, providing animportant source for its legitimization.Following the departure of Yaraghi and Ghazi Ghumuqi in 1825, the cen-ter of Khalidi activity in Dagestan shifted to the less accessible rural com-munes of the mountains. In the following years, as Russia was preoccupied insuccessive wars against Qajar Iran and the Ottoman Empire, thesecommunes were interwoven into an elaborate network of lodges whichpropagated the brotherhood and orthodox Islam in general. From the villageof Gimra was to emerge the first Imam, Ghazi Muhammad, who turned theKhalidiyya into a religio-political movement in the face of the new Russiandrive to complete the subjugation of the North Caucasus. Taking the pathfrom Ghazi Ghumuqi, Muhammad returned to his village in 1827 andacquired the reputation of a religious reviver (mujaddid) owing to hisstruggle against corrupt rulers and un-Islamic customs.At the beginning of 1830 Ghazi Muhammad declared that the time hadcome to start the campaign to implement the shari‘a, and after securingYaraghi’s support against Ghazi Ghumuqi’s more circumspect view heunited the Khalidi masters in Daghestan and Chechnya behind him. Thecampaign soon turned against the Russians, who brought in massive forcesand by the end of 1832 took control of Chechnya and killed GhaziMuhammad in his native Gimra. His successor, the second Imam HamzaBek from the Avar Khanate, was elected for his military prowess although hewas not a Sufi master. He was assassinated in late 1834 in revenge for killingthe Avar ruling family.It took the third Imam, Shamil, several years to overcome the debacle,receive the recognition of rival Naqshbandi leaders, and reunite the peopleunder his banner. Born in Gimra and a close friend of Ghazi Muhammad,Shamil received his Sufi training from Ghazi Ghumuqi, who also gave himone of his daughters in marriage, and was ordained as a master by Yaraghi.He accompanied the first Imam on all his campaigns and was severelywounded in his last battle in Gimra. Following the death of Hamza Bek, thesecond Imam, in 1834 Shamil was elected as successor with the support ofGhazi Ghumuqi, initiating his term with a period of seclusion and of preach-ing to follow the shari‘a. Yet only after the renewal of the Russian offensivetwo years later were his Naqshbandi adversaries ready to consolidate theirforces behind him. Defeated and losing support in Daghestan, Shamil movedto Chechnya, where he resorted to guerrilla warfare and led a major revolt in1840. His successes allowed him to regain his position in Daghestan and totry to extend his authority over the Circassian tribes in the central andwestern Caucasus. His main deputy in these regions, Muhammad Amin,strove to organize local resistance on similar lines.108SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Imam Shamil embarked on a far-reaching course of reforms, whichundermined the local elites and led to the creation of the first unified statein Inner Daghestan and Chechnya. Faithful to the Naqshbandi legacy of hispredecessors, he strictly enforced the shari‘a, consulted the ulama and Sufimasters on important decisions, and sent deputies to the remotest cornersof the country to suppress local customs and mobilize support. Thesemeasures were augmented by regulations regarding the state’s administra-tion and the building of the army, in which Shamil followed the reformpolicies of the Tanzimat, and especially those of Muhammad ‘Ali in Egypt.By the early 1850s his enterprise began to founder due to both a new Rus-sian military drive and internal tensions, which were reflected in the emer-gence of an alternative Qadiri brotherhood. The final Russian assault led toShamil’s capitulation in 1859. Treated with full respect in his captivity, hewas finally allowed to make the hajj in 1869, and two years later he died inMedina. Shamil’s elder son and successor settled in Istanbul and foughtthe Russians as a Turkish commander in the 1877–1878 war, while theyounger son who remained in Russia found his place in the provincialadministration.49IndonesiaA third “peripheral” region in which the Khalidi offshoot, together with themother Naqshbandi-Mujaddidi brotherhood, was implanted in the nine-teenth century was the Dutch Indies. The Naqshbandiyya had been knownin the archipelago at least from the seventeenth century through pilgrimswho were initiated in Arabia. Most outstanding among these were Yusuf ofMakassar (d. 1699), who received the path in Yemen from a local deputy ofTajuddin ‘Uthmani, and ‘Abd al-Ra’uf al-Singkili (d. after 1693), a discipleof Ibrahim al-Kurani who attended lectures of both Tajuddin’s deputies andSirhindi’s son, Muhammad Ma‘sum. There is no evidence that on theirreturn home such men of religion formed Naqshbandi branches; the twomentioned masters are rather remembered as the respective founders of theKhalwatiyya and Shattariyya traditions in Indonesia.Allegiance to masters resident in Mecca, and continuing dependence onthem, similarly characterized the leaders of the various Naqshbandibranches that were established in Java and Sumatra from the middle of thenineteenth century. Most of these masters belonged to the Khalidiyya, somewere affiliated to the Mujaddidiyya (locally known as Mazhariyya), andthere was also a combined Naqshbandiyya-and-Qadiriyya brotherhood. Thefirst two branches arrived on the scene at a time of increasing colonialexploitation by the Dutch, and they usually allied with the new indigenouselites. The third branch was more popular and became involved in peasantrevolts. The conquest of Mecca by the Saudis dealt a severe blow to theIndonesian Naqshbandiyya, which was forced to adapt its organization and109SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"doctrines to the local situation. Still, to this day it is the most widespreadbrotherhood in the country.50The first master to introduce the Khalidiyya into the Malay world wasIsma‘il Minangkabawi from West Sumatra (d. 1857), who returned fromMecca in the early 1850s after a long sojourn of study and teaching in theHoly City. During that time he served as a deputy of ‘Abdallah al-Arzinjani,Khalid’s representative in Mecca, and acquired a reputation amongIndonesian pilgrims for his great learning and strict adherence to the shari‘a.Isma‘il landed at Singapore, which during his absence had been incorporatedinto the British sphere of influence, and engaged in propagating the path inthe colony and the adjacent lands. He was particularly successful in the self-governing Riau archipelago, where the ruling family became his disciples,and the king’s younger brother, Raja Abdullah (d. 1858), was ordained dep-uty. After Isma‘il’s departure his legacy was perpetuated by Abdullah, whoin due course ascended the throne, and by the latter’s son and successor,Raja Muhammad Yusuf, who became attached to the Meccan Mujaddidi-Mazhari master Salih al-Zawawi.Minangkabawi was apparently reluctant to go on to his native WestSumatra, which had come under direct Dutch control, and left for Meccawhere he spent his last days. But already during his lifetime the Naqshban-diyya began to spread into Sumatra as well as Java through the numerousIndonesian disciples he had initiated in Arabia. The influence of the brother-hood in the archipelago grew considerably after 1880, not least thanks toimproved sea travel, which increased the number of pilgrims visiting theHoly Places. Many became disciples of the different Naqshbandi mastersthen active in Mecca, particularly the Khalidis Sulayman al-Zuhdi and Aminal-Kurdi, who spent a decade in Mecca before settling in Cairo, and theaforementioned Mujaddidi master, Zawawi.51 The Indonesian deputies estab-lished numerous religious centers in their home regions, which became focalpoints for the propagation of the path among the local populations, andmore generally for preaching the shari‘a and combating popular customs.The following is a survey of the more important Naqshbandi masters andtheir regional centers.In Minangkabaw, Isma‘il’s place of origin, one of the earliest masters topropagate the Khalidi path was Jalaludin of Changking (fl. 1860s). He builta highly-regarded religious school in his native town and set out againstsyncretistic beliefs associated with the Shattari tradition. Many of the fol-lowers of the Minangkabaw Naqshbandi masters were sons of those whohad joined the puritanical Padri movement that fought Dutch colonial forcesfrom 1821 until its defeat in 1838. While perpetuating the orthodoxpreaching of their predecessors, however, the new generation of Khalidis wasintegrated into the emerging entrepreneurial elite of the island andemphatically opposed anti-colonial resistance. More than one sultan andmost of the local ulama were affiliated with the brotherhood.110SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"A similar attitude was adopted by the Naqshbandi masters in the northernpart of Sumatra. The foremost master in these regions was the MalayAbdulwahhab Rokan (d. 1926), Zuhdi’s principal deputy on the island andin mainland Malaya. During his long life Rokan ordained 120 deputies,including the Sultan of Langkat, near Medan. Under the latter’s patronagehe founded in the auspicious year 1300 AH (1883) the model village com-munity of Babussalam (lit. the gate of peace), which served as an importantfocus for the Islamization of the interior. This is probably the onlyNaqshbandi village in the world; to this day, all the inhabitants are requiredto join the brotherhood when they reach the age of fifteen. In the center ofthe village are the school, including a hall for dhikr and rooms for seclusion,and beside it the tomb of the founder.52Plate 6.2Main mosque in Babussalam, Sumatra111SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Disciples of Minangkabawi were probably also the first to carry theKhalidiyya to Java. Here, however, they were repressed by local rulers whoespoused a highly syncretistic form of Islam and were therefore inimical toreformist teachings. In the early 1880s a local deputy of Zuhdi, Abdulqadirof Samaranj, gained a large following among the lower classes on the island’snorthern coast. His success aroused the apprehensions of Yogyagarta’s aris-tocracy and led the Dutch to banish him in 1885 to one of the outer inlands.More fortunate was Muhammad Hadi of nearby Girikusumo and his sonMansur, who established a school in Solo and trained thousands of disciplesfrom all over Central Java. The network he erected numbers today, accordingto Van Bruinessen’s estimate, well over 100,000. In West Java the Khalidiyyabecame especially widespread in the districts of Cianjur and Bogor, mostnotably after a volcanic eruption in 1883 that awakened strong chiliasticexpectations. Eastwards, on the island of Madura, the Mujaddidi path waspropagated after 1890 by a local deputy of Zawawi.The hostile attitude of the Dutch toward the Naqshbandiyya perceptiblychanged at the turn of the twentieth century, after the administrator-scholarSnouck Hurgronje persuaded the authorities that Sufi brotherhoods werebasically religious organizations with no political aspirations. Such was notthe case, however, with the Naqshbandiyya-and-Qadiriyya, a distinctbrotherhood which combines the Qadiri lineage and practices withNaqshbandi elements such as silent dhikr and activation of the subtle centersof the body (lata’if). It was founded by Ahmad Khatib of Sambes, in westBorneo (d. 1878), who resided for many years in Mecca. Khatib had manyIndonesian disciples and appointed deputies to various parts of the archi-pelago, from Sumatra to Lombok. He was succeeded by the learnedAbdulkarim of Banten, under whom the Naqshbandiyya-and-Qadiriyyabecame extremely popular among the Javan villagers, and was implicated insome of their rebellions, especially the major uprising of Banten in 1888.After his death the brotherhood split into several separate branches, most ofwhich are still active today.112SCHOLARSHIP AND ORGANIZATION"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"7THE PERSISTENCE OF THE OLDERTRADITIONSThe orthodox-activist message of the Khalidiyya was successfully dissemin-ated in both the Ottoman lands and on the fringes of the Islamic world. Itfailed, however, to penetrate the original lands of either the Mujaddidiyya orthe erstwhile Naqshbandiyya. In India, leadership of the central lodge inDelhi was returned after Shah Ghulam ‘Ali’s death to the Mujaddidi family(Ahmad Sirhindi’s descendants). Concomitantly the Mujaddidiyya estab-lished a stronger presence in the largest Muslim princely state of Hyderabadin the Deccan. In the aftermath of the Great Revolt of 1857–1858 theMujaddidis took refuge in the Haramayn, but in the 1880s one of them, Abual-Khayr, made his way back to India and re-established the family authority.His progeny occupy his lodge to this day. At that time the brotherhood beganto spread to Muslim rural areas of northern India, especially in the Punjab.At the turn of the twentieth century, Indian masters such as Jama‘at ‘Aliadopted modern means to propagate the path, while other followers, to bediscussed in the last chapter, opted for altogether new organizations.In the Russian Empire, the Khalidiyya managed to gain a foothold duringthe nineteenth century not only in Daghestan and Chechnya, where time andagain it renewed its rebellion against Russian and later Soviet rule, but also inthe Middle Volga region and in Kazakhstan and Siberia. The foremost Kha-lidi agent in the latter lands was Zaynullah Rasulev, who took the path fromGümüs ̧hanevi in Istanbul. Along with him operated in the Volga region thepuritanical reformist Vaisi movement, which branched off the Mujaddidiyyaand protested both infidel rule and Muslim deviation. In the Central Asiankhanates, however, the Naqshbandiyya of both the original type and theMujaddidiyya remained supreme. Most cases of resistance to the Russianimperial advance in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were organized byNaqshbandis. But others, like Muhammad Jan’s disciples in the Volga andthe Babakhanovs in Tashkent, proved to be the most loyal servants of theCzarist and Bolshevik governments.In China, the Khojas of the Afaqi lineage retained a dominant positionamong the population of the Tarim basin, which became part of the pro-vince of Xinjiang. It was then challenged, however, by another pre-Mujaddidi113"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"branch, which was brought to China proper from Arabia by the puritanicalMa Mingxin. The two factions came to be known respectively as the Khu-fiyya and the Jahriyya, or the Old and the New Teachings. Both factionswere involved in the following century in a series of revolts against theQing dynasty. Partly revived after its fall in 1912, they were suppressedand silenced after the establishment of the Communist regime in 1949.British and postcolonial South AsiaFollowing the death of Ghulam ‘Ali in 1824 leadership of the Delhi Mujad-didiyya was returned to the progeny of Sirhindi. This was a deliberate deci-sion by Ghulam ‘Ali, who to consolidate the position of his lodge sent forShah Abu Sa‘id, his deputy in the Mujaddidi family in Rampur, and urgedhim to come to Delhi and take charge. He also sought the approval of thereligious dignitaries of the city for the appointment. Abu Sa‘id and evenmore so his son and successor Ahmad Sa‘id chose to ignore the British colo-nial government and the surrounding Hindu society, and focused on thegrowing criticism of the Sufi tradition emanating from the reformist schoolof Shah Waliullah. Ahmad in particular, not unlike Diya’ al-Din Khalid andhis followers in their response to the Wahhabi-Salafi challenge, dealt withsuch disapproval by combining Sufism and scholarship and by engaging,often in the reformists’ terms, in scholarly polemics to prove that Sufism waspart of “true” Islam. He claimed to have established a spiritual connectionwith founders of the principal brotherhoods in Delhi of his time, notably theQadiriyya and Chishtiyya, though without relinquishing the primacy of hisNaqshbandi-Mujaddidi affiliation. On the other hand, Sa‘id emphasized theimportance of the “external” sciences, most particularly hadith in whichWaliullah and his successors specialized, and added his own criticism of Sufipractices that were incompatible with the religious law.1Deputies of Ghulam ‘Ali established new centers for the Mujaddidiyya inregions that in the wake of the British occupation superseded Delhi as loci ofMuslim identity on the subcontinent. Such was Hyderabad, capital of thelargest (Muslim) princely state in British India. The brotherhood was intro-duced here by Shah Sa‘dullah, a native of the Punjab, who after the master’sdeath set out for the hajj and upon his return had a vision that directed himto Hyderabad. His principal deputy, Miskin Shah, established a family lin-eage which was integrated into the state’s elite and enjoyed the patronage ofthe Nizam. One of Miskin’s deputies, Nur Muzaffar Husayn, established asecond Mujaddidi lodge in the city center, apparently to cater to the needs ofthe common people. To this family lineage belonged ‘Abdullah Shah, a twen-tieth-century Sufi and distinguished scholar of hadith, jurisprudence, andtheology. Both Hyderabadi branches, which still await study, have continueduninterrupted to this day.2 Other major deputies of Ghulam ‘Ali were activein the Punjab and the Northwest Frontier Province.3114THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Figure 7.1Mujaddidi lineages in Delhi, Rampur, and Hyderabad"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"In the wake of the bloody suppression of the Indian revolt, Ahmad Sa‘idwas compelled to leave Delhi in 1858 and spent the last two years of his lifein Medina. One of his grandsons, Shah Abu al-Khayr, returned with hisfather to India, and in 1885 took charge of the Mazhari lodge. Relying onfamily connections and old loyalties, as well as on the Memon merchantcommunity of western India, he was able to make a place for himself in theMuslim society of Delhi and renew and further expand the lodge, whichsince then has borne his name. Abu al-Khayr was anxious to re-establish hisfamily connections with the Afghan communities of north India, and stillmore with people from Afghanistan. Fusfeld explains this preference as areflection of his hostility to the British and as a strategy to maintain politicalindependence.From 1900 on, Abu al-Khayr divided his time each year between Delhiand Quetta, near the Afghan border. He forged links with the modernizingKing Amanullah (1919–1929) and the Afghan elite, thereby fulfilling themaster’s role as a mediator which was no longer possible in India. In a kindof reversed mediation, in India itself he had to rely on the intervention of hisAfghan disciples when approaching the British government. Deploring theweakness of the Muslim world in his time, Abu al-Khayr called for religiousunity and solidarity which included even the Shi‘a and, in the spirit of theage, elicited in his followers a strong sense of spiritual identification with theMuslim world at large.4Plate 7.1The Abu al-Khayr lodge in Delhi116THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The reactivation of the Mujaddidi lodge in Delhi was part of a largerrevival of Naqshbandi activity at end of the nineteenth century in northernIndia, from the Northwest Frontier Province to East Bengal, and beyond toAfghanistan and Nepal.5 This revival bypassed the burial place of AhmadSirhindi and his sons in Sirhind, which after its destruction in 1764 wasrebuilt as an overwhelmingly Sikh town. The lodge was enlarged in the 1920sand continues to be maintained by Sirhindi’s descendants who attend tovisitors and organize the anniversary of the saint’s death.6By contrast, in the Muslim princely state of Rampur, the third center ofthe Mujaddidi family, a palpable expansion of activity was felt, albeit notaccomplished by the family directly. The foremost master of the Rampurfamily branch during the second half of the century was Irshad Husayn, adeputy of Ahmad Sa‘id who followed him to Medina but after a year wasordered to return to India and resume the training of disciples. Under thepatronage of the Nawab, he built in Rampur a new lodge as well as a schoolin which, in an embodiment of the Mujaddidi postulate that the shari‘a pre-cedes the tariqa, students were instilled with the religious sciences beforeembarking on the Sufi path. This was also the educational course of Shah‘Inayatullah Khan, Irshad’s foremost deputy and founder of the leadingNaqshbandi line in Rampur during the twentieth century.Maulana Irshad Husain . . . arrived at Rampur from MadinahMunawwarah and he stayed in a mosque near Shah Inayatullah’shouse. For resolving an issue of Shariah, Shah Inayatullah called onhim along one of his friends . . . [Hazrat Irshad Husain] told him:“Why don’t you learn it yourself.” To this Shah Inayatullah replied:“I am now grown up. My father wants me to assist him in his busi-ness. Moreover, I feel somewhat embarrassed in studying elementaryworks on Shariah. Hazrat Irshad Husain said: “you need not feelembarrassed. I will teach you a book which has not been studied byanyone so far.” . . . Gradually he learnt a great deal of the Arabiclanguage and attained an ability to follow works in Arabic. Later onhe studied works on Tafseer (Qura’n exegesis), hadith, Fiqha (sic.,jurisprudence), Usul-e-Fiqha, and other Islamic sciences.One day Hazrat Irshad Husain asked him in an unusual fashion:“You should now learn spiritual lessons in NaqshbandiyyaMujaddidiyya order.” In accordance with this directive of his men-tor Shah Inayatullah pledged oath of allegiance at his end and tookto studying Tasawwuf and gaining spiritual lessons.7Upon the death of the master ‘Inayatullah, an Afghan by extraction,superseded all members of the Mujaddidi family and established himself assuccessor. He built a lodge on his own lands, the Khanqah-i ‘Inayatiyya, andfor more than thirty years trained numerous disciples, mostly from117THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Afghanistan and some from Russian and Chinese Central Asia. ‘Inayatullahestablished a family lineage that still exists today. The present master,‘Ubaydullah ‘Inayati, complained to me about the decline in the number andquality of seekers of the path in the modern age, in which people have nei-ther time nor energy to spare for spiritual perfection. In the dhikr session Iattended there were only fifteen participants. Still during his father’s lifetime‘Ubaydullah had published a brochure in English, from which the abovequote is taken and which concludes with an open invitation to “sincere per-sons of whatever nationality and country” (religion is not mentioned) tospend a few months in the lodge and try to derive spiritual benefits from it.The same invitation was extended to me although I identified myself as a Jewfrom Israel.8Most spectacular was the consolidation of the Mujaddidi presence in thetowns and villages of the northern Punjab, in today’s Pakistan, whichbecame a major center of Naqshbandi activity in post-1857 India. Animportant factor in the success of the brotherhood was the ability of itsmasters to bridge the gap between strict orthodox behavior that they hadimbibed in Delhi and Rampur and the local culture of shrines on which theyhad been brought up. The Mujaddidis of rural Punjab took active part in thedefense of Sufism against the multiple antagonistic forces that gained groundin the province from the 1880s onwards: Anglicization, Christian missionarywork, Hindu revivalism, the Ahmadi movement, and the fundamentalistAhl-i Hadith trend. As against their detractors, the Sufi masters werePlate 7.2Master of the ‘Inayatullah lodge, Rampur118THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"anxious to show that they follow the Sunna of the Prophet in all its minutiaeand stressed the duty to pledge allegiance to a perfect master who realizes theideal. To better cope with the new challenges they entered the public spherethrough religious associations, magazines, and the active recruitment ofdeputies.The most prominent Mujaddidi master in the Punjab during the colonialperiod was Pir Jama‘at ‘Ali (d. 1951), who belonged to a landlord familyfrom the Sialkot district with Qadiri and Naqshbandi affiliations. Jama‘at‘Ali acquired extensive religious education, studying among others with theMujaddidis Irshad Husayn of Rampur and Fadlurrahman Ganj Murada-badi, whom we shall meet as a major influence on modern Indian reformisttrends. Thereafter he followed the Naqshbandi path and, after receivingpermission to guide disciples of his own, he began going on foot to propa-gate Islam in the villages and towns of the Punjab. To expand his activities allover India, in 1904 Jama‘at ‘Ali founded the Anjuman-i Khudam-i Sufiyya(the association of the servants of Sufism), the principal aim of which was tounite the Indian Sufis against their “Wahhabi” rivals. He was assisted in thisenterprise by another Mujaddidi master, the English-educated Anwar ‘Ali(d. 1920), who edited the association’s magazine.Moreover, rather than waiting for disciples to enter his lodge Jama‘at ‘Aliexploited the Indian railway network to travel the length and breadth ofthe country to propagate his path. This reversal of method entailed aredefinition of the master’s role from a personal guide to a mass spiritualleader. His association held an annual meeting, and in the 1920s added to itsaims fighting the Arya Samaj, a Hindu revivalist movement which hadlaunched a campaign to “reconvert” Muslims to Hinduism. Jama‘at ‘Ali’slifework for the cause of Islam received public recognition when in 1925 hepresided over the first All-India Sunni Conference, and ten years later whenhe was declared “leader of the Muslim community.” Unable to influenceBritish religious policy in favor of his constituency, in 1946 Jama‘at ‘Ali, likemost other Punjabi masters, switched to the Muslim League which movedtoward the creation of Pakistan. He died five years later, leaving behindnumerous deputies and followers throughout the country and amongimmigrants to Great Britain and the United States.9In the Mujaddidi lodge in Delhi Abu al-Khayr was succeeded by his sonShah Abu al-Hasan Zayd Faruqi, who was initiated into the path at the ageof eleven. Subsequently he acquired a thorough religious education, com-pleting it at al-Azhar in Cairo. Abu al-Hasan assumed the direction of thelodge in 1934. He decided to stay in India after partition in 1947, to take careof the lodge, while his brothers settled on the family lands in Quetta, now inPakistan. Like other members of his family,10 Abu al-Hasan’s outlook wasbasically conservative. He boasted of his multiple Sufi affiliations and wasinimical to the anti-Sufi Ahl-i Hadith, but also to the more moderateorganizations. Most of his disciples came from Pakistan and Afghanistan.119THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Abu al-Hasan was a prolific writer, who dedicated his work to Naqshbandidoctrine and history and to polemics against “Wahhabis.” He was particu-larly averse to the “Muslim nationalist” image that Sirhindi acquired duringthe twentieth century, claiming, as a matter of self-legitimization, that hisancestor followed the trodden path of the Indian Sufis and that he was notinherently hostile to the Hindus, but only to those who rebelled against theMughal state. Abu al-Hasan did confirm the political activity of Sirhindi,which he felt unable to follow in the realities of the Hindu-dominated secularIndian state.11Perhaps a reflection of a sense of decline of his family tradition in India,during the long term of nearly six decades that Abu al-Hasan Zayd Faruqimanaged the lodge in Delhi he ordained only a handful of deputies. Hemaintained that the rank of khilafa required lofty merits that only few couldattain. Among those qualified was his grandson and the present head of thelodge, Abu al-Nasr Anas Faruqi (b. 1971). In his thirties, Abu al-Nasr claimsto have more than 100 devoted disciples from Delhi, Agra, and other cities inIndia. He conducts an evening dhikr session every day and a larger meeting(khatma) once a week. Some forty people participated in the session Iattended, and it included blessings, dhikr, recitation of the Naqshbandilineage, and a religious lesson. An atmosphere of sobriety reigned over thewhole meeting.12The ongoing project of the Naqshbandiyya in Pakistan is recorded in anPlate 7.3Dhikr in the Mujaddidi lodge in Delhi120THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"anthropological study that adopts a regional cult analysis approach in exam-ining one particular branch in NWFP.

Zindapir was conscious ofthe reformist critics of Sufism and therefore stressed the shari‘a and pro-hibited extravagant celebrations at shrines. He practiced the loud dhikr butforbade the playing of music, as well as radio and television. On the otherhand, Zindapir followed local customs and professed to live in harmony withnature. He showed a tolerant attitude toward non-Muslims, who were alwayswelcomed in his lodge.In more than forty years’ activity Zindapir built a regional cult thatstretched over most of Pakistan. He enjoyed much popularity in the armedforces and the civil bureaucracy, and was courted by national politicians atelection time. Zindapir’s branch acquired a transnational dimension whenone of his deputies, Sufi Sahib, was sent in 1962 to guide Pakistaniimmigrant workers in England in the precepts of their religion.13 The head-quarters of the British brotherhood in Birmingham include a magnificentmosque and a Quranic school, and provide various communal services. In1973 Sahib initiated annual processions on the Prophet’s birthday, whichhave attracted thousands of followers from all over the country, most notablyLondon and Manchester. Other affiliations of Zindapir’s Naqshbandibranch were established in the Middle East, South Africa, and more recentlyEurope and the USA. The followers in all these places are almost exclusivelySouth Asian migrants and their descendants.14Monarchical AfghanistanEthnic Afghans constituted an important part of the Mujaddidi followingfrom the very inception of the brotherhood in the days of Ahmad Sirhindiand Muhammad Ma‘sum. These included Afghans who immigrated to theIndian subcontinent and inhabitants of the lands which in the eighteenthcentury became Afghanistan. At that time a great grandson of Sirhindi,Ghulam Muhammad Ma‘sum II, was invited by Ahmad Shah Abdali (1747–1773), founder of the modern Afghan state, to go and settle in his capitalQandahar. Ma‘sum preferred to send one of his sons, who was later followedby two brothers. When Abdali’s son Timur (1773–1793) moved the capital toKabul he granted the Mujaddidi family lands and a residence in the ShorBazar district of the city, where they set up a large lodge and a school. Otherbranches of the family were established in the regions of Qandahar, Herat,and Kohistan. Under their leadership the Mujaddidiyya became the mostinfluential and widespread brotherhood in Afghanistan, surpassing the localQadiri and Chishti traditions and the original Naqshbandiyya, whichretained a presence in some local lodges in the west and north of the country.15121THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Despite the proximity of the Hazrat Shor Bazar, as the Mujaddidi familyof Kabul came to be known, to the royal court, during the nineteenth cen-tury its heads focused on spiritual guidance and religious preaching. Duringthat time they created a wide network among the ulama, who favored theNaqshbandi orthodox bent, and among the Pashtun tribes on the Indianborder, among which they served as arbitrators. They became involved inpolitics during the reign of King Amanullah, when the then head of thefamily, Fazl Muhammad (d. 1925), supported the jihad against the Britishthat the monarch declared upon his ascension. He accompanied the troopsto the front, en route encouraging the tribesmen to join the struggle. Yetwhen Amanullah embarked upon an ambitious program of modernizationalong Western lines, Muhammad’s brother and successor, Fazl ‘Umar (d.1956), took up residence in Pakistan, from where in 1928 he organized thefirst popular rebellion against the king. Unable to prevent General NadirKhan from assuming the throne after Amanullah’s abdication, he changedhis position in time to be appointed minister of justice and head of thecommittee of religious scholars that was set up to supervise legislation. Hisbrother Sadiq was appointed ambassador in Cairo.Fazl ‘Umar played a key role in the crisis that followed the assassination ofNadir Shah in 1933, when he proclaimed his son Zahir, still a boy, successor.During the latter’s long reign, from 1933 to 1973, the Hazrat Shor Bazarcontinued to receive state favors and married into the royal family, but theirpolitical influence, and the role of Sufism in the country in general, graduallydiminished. ‘Umar himself resigned from the government three years afterhis appointment and dedicated himself to the affairs of the brotherhood. In1947 the government paid no heed to the Hazrat call for jihad to conquerKashmir for Pakistan, and during the 1950s it went on with its plans toremove female veiling and to establish relations with the Soviet Union des-pite their protests. When Zahir Shah finally took the reigns of power into hishands in 1963, Muhammad Ibrahim (d. 1979), the new head of the Mujad-didi family and brotherhood, emerged as leader of the conservative factionin parliament, which staunchly supported the monarchy. Consequently, inthe wake of the 1973 coup he lost all political power, and a year after theMarxist takeover in 1978 he and all male members of the family living inKabul were arrested and executed.16Czarist Russia, the USSR, and beyondThe Naqshbandiyya was strongly represented in the three major Muslimareas in the Russian Empire: the Middle Volga, the North Caucasus, andCentral Asia. Yet, there was wide divergence in the trajectory of thebrotherhood in each of the areas in terms of historical development, socio-economic basis, and actual resistance. Among the Tatars of the MiddleVolga region, who had been under Russian rule since the sixteenth century,122THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"the Naqshbandiyya gave birth in the nineteenth century to the modernistJadid movement, as well as to the schismatic Vaisi sect. At that time theKhalidiyya was also introduced into the region and was taken farther afieldto the Kazakh lands and Siberia. In Daghestan and Chechnya, as we haveseen, the Naqshbandiyya-Khalidiyya spearheaded the jihad against the Rus-sian conquest in the first half of the nineteenth century. Later on it waspartly superseded by the Qadiriyya but continued to be involved in many ofthe recurrent rebellions that still defy the government in Moscow. In theCentral Asian khanates, by contrast, the Naqshbandiyya, of both the ori-ginal type and the Mujaddidiyya, failed to organize resistance to the Russianconquest in the second half of the nineteenth century, though the few localrebellions that did erupt were conducted by its followers. Succumbing to theanti-religious Soviet regime, it begins to recover in independent Uzbekistan.17The Naqshbandiyya was introduced into the Volga-Urals region duringthe fifteenth century, apparently from Bukhara, the religious point of refer-ence for local Muslims. Under Russian rule the brotherhood absorbed exist-ing Kubrawi and Yasawi groups and came to dominate the religious andcultural life of the Tatars and Bashkirs. It was followed in the eighteenthcentury by the Mujaddidi offshoot, which was likewise disseminated fromCentral Asia. Among its earliest representatives in the Volga basin was aTatar deputy of Habibullah, who had implanted the path in Transoxiana.Later in the century two Mujaddidi lineages became active among the Tatars.One consisted of disciples of the Kabuli master Fayz Khan ‘Ata (d. 1802),the other comprised followers of Muhammad Niyazquli, whom we have metas the most impressive Sufi master in Mangit Bukhara. The best-knownfigure in the first group was Muhammad Jan, who in 1789 was appointedfirst head of the religious administration in the Volga region. Not particu-larly learned or pious, his main advantage in the eyes of the Russian author-ities seems to have been his servile loyalty. Most of Jan’s successors to thepost were like him affiliated to the Naqshbandiyya. The foremost figureamong Niyazquli’s Tatar disciples was Abunasir Kursavi, the forebear ofJadidism.18One of the latest offshoots of the Mujaddidiyya in the Volga basin was thepuritanical Vaisi sect, also known as God’s Regiment of Vaisov. It wasfounded in 1862 by Baha’uddin Vaisi (d. 1893), a merchant from Kazan whoformed contacts with Naqshbandi masters during his business travels toCentral Asia. He took the path from a master belonging to Fayz ‘Ata’slineage, and after the latter’s death returned to Qazan and built “a house ofprayer.” This became the focus of a protest movement against both Russian“infidel” rule and compliant Muslims, including Naqshbandis employed inthe Russian religious administration. Most followers of the Vaisi sect wereartisans and peasants, and it had neither distinctive dress nor a particularform of dhikr. “Vaisism” gradually turned into a puritanical reformistmovement, compared by Quelquejay to the militant Bareillis in India. It123THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"called for a return to original Islam and rejected both innovations (bid‘a) andthe Jadidi call for rational discretion.The ultimate aim of Vaisi was to establish “a Bulghar state,” and heordered his followers to reject Russian identity cards and refuse to pay taxesand submit to conscription. This was enough for the Russian authorities,which in 1884 destroyed the movement and sent Vaisi to a psychiatric hos-pital. The brotherhood was renewed, and further radicalized, by his son‘Inanuddin, who adopted Marxist ideas and took an active part in theOctober Revolution on the side of the Bolsheviks and against the “Tatarbourgeoisie.” He was killed in 1920 by Tatar nationalists and the movementquickly disappeared.19During the nineteenth century the Muslims of the Volga-Urals regionunderwent a partial reorientation; their ties with Transoxiana were loosenedin favor of more contact with major centers of learning in the Ottomanworld. One such center was the Haramayn, where Tatar pilgrims, like theirIndonesian coreligionists, grouped around various Mujaddidi and Khalidimasters. On their return many engaged in propagating the path in theirhometowns. The undisputed leader of the Naqshbandiyya in the Volga basinduring late Czarist Russia, however, was the Bashkir Zaynullah Rasulev (d.1917), who was introduced into the Khalidiyya by Gümüs ̧hanevi in Istanbul.From the Orenburg province, Rasulev acquired a thorough religious educa-tion and began his career as a teacher. In 1859, following local custom, hesought Sufi initiation and chose a Mujaddidi master. Eleven years laterRasulev passed through Istanbul on his way to the hajj and then metGümüs ̧hanevi. He was so impressed that he asked for a second initiation, atwhose end he was appointed “full deputy.”Back home, Rasulev’s rapid success aroused the animosity of the estab-lished masters, who in 1872 denounced him to the Russian authorities forheresy and distortion of Islam. He was summoned for interrogation,imprisoned, and sent into exile that lasted for almost a decade. ThereafterRasulev settled in Troitsk on the edge of the Kazakh steppe, which thanks tohim became a principal center of learning and a base for the further diffu-sion of the Khalidiyya. The school he established in the city, known as theRasuliyya, acquired a reputation as one of the best Muslim institutions inRussia. The school used new pedagogical methods and incorporated secularsciences in the curriculum, striking a middle course between the modernistJadidis and the traditionalists.Although he stayed away from political activity, Rasulev was sympatheticwith the aspirations of the Tatars and other Muslims of the Russian Empire.He sent his greetings to the Third All-Russian Muslim Congress in 1906 andgave his blessing to the moderate Ittifaq al-Muslimin association, which wasled by his follower and presumed successor, ‘Alimjan Barudi (d. 1921).Barudi was director of the reformist Muhammadiyya school in Kazan, thelargest educational institution in Russia at the time, and became Mufti of124THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Ufa and head of the Religious Directorate in 1917. His predecessor as well assuccessors in these offices were also followers of Rasulev, though underSoviet rule the vitality of the Naqshbandiyya in the Middle Volga was con-siderably diminished. The successors were Rizauddin (d. 1936), who paiddearly for his refusal to attest that religious freedom prevailed in the SovietUnion, and ‘Abdulrahman Rasulev (d. 1952), the master’s son, who in 1941called the Muslims to support the war effort against Nazi Germany.20Zaynullah Rasulev’s influence extended well beyond the Volga-Uralsregion, especially into Kazakhstan and Siberia. His numerous disciples inthese lands came from among students of the Rasuliyya school and its affili-ates or through the students he sent out to teach the tenets of Islam amongthe people of the steppes. The Naqshbandiyya was introduced into thekhanate of Siberia as early as the sixteenth century at the invitation of its lastruler, who wanted to spread Islam in his realm, though legend has it thatalready Baha’uddin Naqshband had sent followers for that purpose. Adeptsof the brotherhood from the Central Asian khanates continued to beattracted to this frontier, and their legacy is attested by the aristocraticKhwaja families that still live in these regions.The presence of the Naqshbandiyya in Kazakhstan and Siberia wasenhanced during the nineteenth century with the improvement of communi-cations, which made it easier to travel to the Muslim centers of the RussianEmpire and to make the hajj. Among the leading Siberian Naqshbandis inthe first half of the century was Khwaja Virdi (d. 1856), a prominent scholar,many of whose disciples served as imams in the mosques of Siberia. Theimpact of Rasulev in the region was such that in 1906 the Russian authoritiestook measures to limit the Tatar presence among the Kazakhs.21The defeat of Shaykh Shamil in 1859 and the subsequent incorporationof the North Caucasus into the Russian Empire, with massive migration ofCaucasian Muslims to the Ottoman lands, considerably weakened the localNaqshbandiyya. Its leadership had been challenged already during the1850s with the introduction into the region of a Qadiri branch preachingdetachment from worldly affairs and acceptance of infidel dominationamong the war-weary mountain people. Its excessive type of vocal dhikrwas also abhorrent to the Naqshbandis. Still, only a few years afterShamil’s capitulation the Qadiriyya too became hostile to the oppressiveRussian rule and adopted many features of the Naqshbandi doctrine andorganization.The two brotherhoods cooperated in the great rebellion of 1877–1878, theNaqshbandis taking the lead in Daghestan and the Qadiris in Chechnya.After the bloody suppression of the revolt the idea of jihad was temporarilyabandoned, but the two brotherhoods experienced spectacular expansion,the Naqshbandiyya attracting the aristocratic and learned elites and theQadiriyya gaining popularity among the peasants. Together they defied Rus-sian efforts to eradicate the shari‘a by forming an alternative system of125THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"administration. Masters banished to the Volga Basin or Siberia helpedspread the path in these regions.In the wake of the Soviet revolution in 1917 Shamil’s legacy was revivedwhen Najmuddin of Hotso was proclaimed Imam of Daghestan and Chech-nya. During the revolutionary years 1917–1921, which were particularlybloody in the North Caucasus, the Naqshbandiyya was thus once more atthe forefront. The declared aim of Najmuddin and his colleagues was toreconstitute the rule of the shari‘a, expel the Russians, and liquidate Muslimswho cooperated with the infidel rule. They gathered an army of disciples, andin 1919 defeated the White forces and declared a liberated North Caucasusamirate. Following the Bolshevik occupation a year later, Najmuddin andother Naqshbandi masters led the great revolt of Chechnya and Daghestan, apeasant uprising in the name of a grandson of Shamil. The revolt lasted overa year; only in 1925 was it wholly suppressed, its leaders being caught andexecuted.In the course of the struggle the Bolsheviks launched an anti-religiouscampaign closing shari‘a courts and liquidating the local “clerical leader-ship.” The mass purges of Sufi masters and adepts provoked a new wave ofrebellions in the 1930s, in which Naqshbandis and Qadiris fought side byside. In 1944 the entire populations of Chechnya and Ingushetia weredeported to Siberia and Kazakhstan. Those who survived were allowed toreturn after Stalin’s death, but persecution of Sufism resumed in the late1950s and 1960s, during which Naqshbandi masters were tried as mere“bandits.”22Following the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Sufis of theNorth Caucasus reemerged to champion a gradual re-Islamization of theregion. The Naqshbandiyya is particularly strong in Daghestan, whichsuffered less under Soviet rule. Here the controversial Sayyid EffendiChirkeevski of the dominant Avar ethnic group was able to acquire con-siderable political influence and secure the highest religious posts in thecountry to his disciples and protégés. Chirkeevski’s alliance with the authori-tarian regime, his deficient religious knowledge, and his evident corruptionwon him the animosity of many distinguished religious scholars and Sufimasters, including rival Naqshbandis such as the highly respected TajuddinRamazanon. In Chechnya, Naqshbandi masters distanced themselves fromthe radical nationalists who led the armed struggle against Russian rule. TheQadiris first lent their support to the resistance, but from 1999 the twobrotherhoods joined hands in advocating peace in the face of the nationalistsand their ‘Wahhabi’ allies.23Fully integrated into the ruling elites of the Mangit and other CentralAsian khanates, the Naqshbandiyya failed to organize resistance to theRussian advance into the region in the second half of the nineteenth century.Still, the few attempts to shake off Russian rule were led by Naqshbandisbased particularly in the Ferghana valley, where peasants and small traders126THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"were adversely affected by Russian economic policies. The only rebellion toreceive scholarly attention so far is the short-lived rebellion which broke outin 1898 in Andijan. This was associated with the Mujaddidi masterMuhammad ‘Ali Dukcˇi Ishan.In a book he had published earlier, Dukcˇi condemned the religiousscholars for turning their vocation into a source of unlawful profit, and Sufimasters (locally known as Ishans) for favoring rich disciples and robbing thepoor. He was even more severe with the great Naqshbandi Khwajas families,who in his view had abandoned the tradition but still used its prestige toacquire followers. Attentive to the complaints of his followers about Russianoppression, Dukcˇi took upon himself the task of organizing jihad, but cau-tioned that it be postponed until the whole Ferghana was mobilized. Muchagainst his will he was crowned as Khan, after which the unruly crowd setout for Andijan where it fell upon government buildings and killed somesoldiers and civilians. Four days later Dukcˇi Ishan was caught and executedand the rebellion was quelled.24Naqshbandi-Mujaddidi masters from Ferghana similarly opposed theimposition of Soviet rule in Central Asia and supported the Basmachimovement between 1918 and 1928. Consequently, many of them were exe-cuted while others escaped to Eastern Turkistan. By then the Naqshbandiyyawas divided into two branches, the Khafi and the Jahri, according to theform of dhikr they used. The latter was frequently connected with theQadiriyya.25 On the other hand, as in the Volga-Urals region Naqshbandisproved to be among the most loyal servants of the Russian and Sovietregimes and were rewarded with high posts in the religious administration.The Spiritual Board for Central Asia and Kazakhstan based in Tashkent,one of the four boards set up by Stalin after the Second World War, washeaded by three generations of the Naqshbandi chief muftis of the Baba-khanov family. In the late 1950s Ziya’uddin Babakhanov published a seriesof legal opinions in which he condemned pilgrimage to saints’ tombsand Ishanism in general as alien to Islam.26 A little earlier Naqshband’smausoleum, already in a dilapidated state, was converted into a museum foranti-religious propaganda.27Imperial and communist ChinaThe conquest of Eastern Turkistan by the Chinese in 1759 did not under-mine the position of the Naqshbandiyya among the Muslims of what cameto constitute the province of Xinjiang, as well as in other parts of China. Inthe oasis cities, the Afaqi line of the Makhdumzade continued to hold prideof place among the local population. They were left to administer theirdomains in accordance with Islamic law and regarded themselves as thelegitimate rulers of Kashghar. Members of the family who fled to neighbor-ing countries, especially the khanate of Kokand, time and again invaded127THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Xinjiang to regain their possessions. The Ishaqiyya faction, by contrast, per-ceptibly weakened by the events of the Chinese conquest, adopted a policyof loyalty to the government and some of its members were sent to Peking tojoin the imperial aristocracy. In the northern parts of Eastern Turkistan theKhojas of Kucha continued to exert considerable influence upon the popula-tion. The Mujaddidiyya penetrated Xinjiang in the early nineteenth century,establishing centers in Yarkand and Kashghar.The most formidable challenge to the Afaqiyya emanated from a newbranch of the Chinese pre-Mujaddidi Naqshbandiyya which establisheditself in the province of Gansu. Its founder, Muhammad Ma Mingxin, hadreturned to his homeland in 1761 after a twenty-year sojourn in Yemen.During this long stay, as Fletcher discovered, he became a disciple of ‘Abdal-Khaliq al-Mizjaji (d. 1740), who had combined the Naqshbandi lineage ofIbrahim al-Kurani in Medina with that of the Indian Tajuddin ‘Uthmani. InChina Mingxin engaged in spreading the blend of orthodoxy and politicalactivism he had imbibed in Arabia in the face of the Afaqi Naqshbandis,whose popular practices of saint veneration and tomb visitation he con-demned. His challenge was symbolically articulated by the use of the vocaldhikr, which he may have adopted from his erstwhile adherence to the Yasawibrotherhood.28 Consequently the two branches came to be known respect-ively as the Khufiyya and the Jahriyya;29 non-Muslim Chinese writersreferred to them as the Old and the New Teachings, appellations that were tocause much confusion in later years.30Mingxin’s great success among the Hui and Salars, and the inner-Muslimtensions he caused on the frontier, aroused the apprehension of the Chineseauthorities. He was arrested in 1781, and executed after his followers rose upin arms. His mausoleum in Lanzhou has been only recently restored. Sub-sequent rebellions of Ma Mingxin’s disciples, one led by the scholar Tian Wuin 1784, and the White Lotus Rebellion of 1796–1805, were suppressed withthe aid of followers of the Old Teaching. As a result of these events Chinesereligious policies became increasingly anti-Muslim.31During most of the nineteenth century adherents of both the Old and theNew Teachings were involved in a series of rebellions against the Qing dyn-asty. In 1826–1828 an invasion by an Afaqi Khoja from Badakhshan stirredthe population of Kashghar to rise, and the ruler of Kokand to invade EastTurkistan. When the Chinese army arrived the Khoja offered no resistancebut fled, not before his forces plundered the local population. By the middleof the nineteenth century the New Teaching, which spread from Gansu toother parts of the Chinese Empire while losing much of its reformist import,took the lead. This was a period of growing weakness of the Qing at thecenter, and of religious friction in many of the provinces. The then grandmaster of the Jahriyya, Ma Hualong, who established himself in the pro-vince of Ningsia, led the great Northwest Hui rebellion of 1862. This was theprelude to the great rebellion of Xinjiang, which apparently broke out in128THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Kucha two years later. It was conducted in the name of Khoja Rashidin, theattendant of the saintly family shrine. Not unlike Dukcˇi Ishan three decadeslater in Andijan, he may have inspired the jihad but was then declared by theinsurgents as their khan and hurried to battle against his better judgment.32The rebellions of the 1860s marked the apex of militant Naqshbandi activ-ity in China. Lack of coordination and harsh suppression led to the demiseof the older groups while those who remained were forced underground. In1865 the Kokandi officer Ya‘qub Beg established an Islamic state in EasternTurkistan after defeating Khoja Rashidin of Kucha and the Mujaddidi‘Abdurrahman Hadrat of Yarkand. Under his rule the last of the Khojas wasexpelled and the family lost its predominant position in the local politics ofthe oasis cities, which it was never to regain.33 Farther east in Xinjiang and inGansu, the rebellion was bloodily suppressed after Ma Hualong was cap-tured and executed with his entire family in 1871. The Chinese re-conquestof Xinjiang was completed in 1877, following the death of Ya‘qub Beg, andthe province was re-organized in 1884 under Peking’s vigilant eye. The Jahriline was perpetuated by a daughter of Hualong, who married a disciple ofher father, Ma Yuanzhang (d. 1920), in exile in Yunan. This succeeded afterhe had been allowed to return to Gansu to reassemble the remnants of theJahriyya and to gain recognition as successor.34The fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912 allowed the Jahriyya to come out intoFigure 7.2Naqshbandi trends in Chinese Islam129THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"the open again. Subsequently, Yuanzhang’s leadership was contested by agrandson of Hualong named Ma Jinxi, and after the grand master’s death in1920 the brotherhood split into several sub-branches, reflecting personalrivalries and regional differences. At the same time, the Naqshbandiyya wasrevitalized in Eastern Turkistan by Uzbek masters from the Ferghana valley,who fled Soviet persecution. These belonged to both the Khafi and Jahribranches of the Russian Naqshbandiyya-Mujaddidiyya. Among themQamruddin of Namangan (d. 1938) of the Khafi trend founded theThaqibiyya branch, a learned grouping of ulama-Sufis influenced by theIndian Deobandi school, who were opposed both to “Wahhabism” and topopular Sufi practices. His charismatic successor, Ayyub Qari (Ziyauddin al-Yarkandi, d. 1952), established a prestigious school on the edge of theYarkand oasis, through which he spread the orthodox message all overthe region. Concomitantly, ‘Abdullah of Andijan (d. 1978), who belonged tothe Jahri trend and practiced a more popular form of Sufism, establishedhimself in Yarkand itself. With his son and successor, ‘Ubaydullah (d. 1993),he set up a network of lodges in many of the oasis cities, most particularly inHotan.35The situation of all Naqshbandi branches in China deteriorated followingthe institution of the Communist regime in 1949. Khoja Afaq’s mausoleumin Kashghar, in which his father and mentor along with 56 of his male andfemale descendants are buried, had survived all previous upheavals but wasnow made a museum. Afaq was depicted as an ignorant master, and thePlate 7.4The Afaq Hoja mausoleum in Kashghar130THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Khojas were denounced as the sons of “spiritual feudalism.”36 Partiallyrehabilitated in recent years, the site is officially presented today as the rest-ing-place of Kashghar’s past rulers while overlooking their Naqshbandiaffiliation. Still, on religious occasions multitudes visit the place to payhomage to the Afaq family and pray at the adjacent mosques.37In Yarkand, Ayyub Qari disappeared and died in mysterious circum-stances in 1952, and subsequently his school was closed down and partlydestroyed. Today only its mosque has remained.38 His successors learned tocompromise with the Communist regime, and they continue to cherish bothUighur and Chinese disciples. ‘Abdullah Andijani’s lineage also survived,and it is currently led by his grandson, Hidayatullah, a physician by trainingwho conducts the dhikr in a Qadiri manner at his home.39 In China proper,during the 1950s Ma Zhenwu, a son of Yuanzhang, who was based inGansu, succeeded in reuniting most Jahri branches under his authority, butin 1958 he came under attack as an “ultra-rightist” and his “crimes” wereexposed at a Muslim people’s forum.40 Subsequently the Jahriyya again spiltinto two main branches, one led by Zhenwu’s son and the other is of MaJinxi’s lineage. The center of the Khufiyya is located at the mausoleum ofMa Laichi in Linxia, which was restored in 1986, and it has more thantwenty affiliates throughout China.41 At the shrine the litanies of Muham-mad ‘Aqila, Laichi’s Meccan master, are still regularly read, but the dhikr isbasically that of the Shadhiliyya.42131THE PERSISTENCE OF OLDER TRADITIONS"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"8MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ONTHE PATH (SEVENTEENTH TOTWENTIETH CENTURIES)The Naqshbandiyya, and especially its Mujaddidi and Khalidi offshoots,played a major role in the formulation of brotherhood Sufism’s response tothe challenge of modernity. In the early modern period (sixteenth to nine-teenth centuries) Naqshbandi teachings continued to be disseminatedthrough pious preaching and advice to rulers. From the second half of thenineteenth century novel strategies had to be forged to cope with the newrealities engendered by the growing impact of the West. The spread ofrationalist thought, the consolidation of colonial and subsequent authoritar-ian Muslim States, and the rise of Islamic modernism and fundamentalismplaced Naqshbandi masters and adepts before an acute dilemma. While thebrotherhood’s emphatic orthodox outlook meant adherence to Islamic trad-ition, its activist legacy entailed accommodation to the new circumstances.Subsequently Naqshbandi masters were to move between two opposingpoles, the one conservative and the other modernist-fundamentalist. Mostjoined the conservative camp in a quest to preserve the Islamic and Sufitraditions. This endeavor, however, compelled them to take part in the hege-monic Western-dominated discourse and to collaborate with governments.As against them, some adepts of the brotherhood who were more attentiveto changes brought about by the rising rates of literacy and popular partici-pation moved to re-imagine Islam in the light of modern ideals and models.These justified themselves through a new myth of origins by which theycould direct their rational-critical discourse toward both unseemly aspects ofthe tradition and the oppressive state. Concomitantly their brotherhoodswere transformed into new forms of collective action such as cultural andeducational associations, social movements, and political parties. This chap-ter deals with the early Naqshbandi-related thinkers and associations fromtheir beginnings to World War I. In the following concluding chapter we willexamine various innovative Naqshbandi branches and Naqshbandi-relatedorganizations of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.Antecedents to the modern transformation of the Naqshbandiyya can befound in all major arenas of its evolution, often in reaction to the weakening132"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"of the political power. In the evermore feeble Ottoman Empire of the six-teenth century the puritan Naqshbandi-influenced scholar Mehmed Birgevigave inspiration to the militant Kadizadeli movement, which in turn drewsome Naqshbandi masters to its ranks. In the rapidly disintegrating MughalEmpire of the eighteenth century Naqshbandi soul searching was articulatedeither through the resigned philosophy of Nasir ‘Andalib and his son MirDard or in resorting to hadith studies of Shah Waliullah and his progeny.These Indian masters were affiliated to both the original Naqshbandiyya andthe indigenous Mujadidiyya, and from the latter line sprang the jihad move-ment of Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi. Their Arab contemporary Muhammad ibn‘Abd al-Wahhab, founder of the ultra-orthodox Wahhabi movement, mayhave had some Naqshbandi-Mujaddidi connection too. In Bukhara and theadjacent Tatar lands already under Russian rule at the turn of the nineteenthcentury, the Mujaddidi scholar Abunasir Kursavi went a step further byadvocating a return to the scriptures and the use of a rational mode ofijtihad.A Naqshbandi background is likewise discernible among major figures ofthe early Islamic modernist and fundamentalist trends of the late nineteenthand early twentieth centuries. The father of Indian modernism, AhmadKhan, spent his childhood in the Mujaddidi lodge in Delhi before enteringthe service of the East India Company. His contemporary Siddiq HasanKhan, a major figure in the fundamentalist Ahl-i Hadith movement locatedin the Muslim princely state of Bhopal, also claimed to belong to theNaqshbandiyya. The Young Ottoman movement was formed amongprotégés of the Khalidi-inspired bureaucrats of Istanbul, who had imple-mented the religiously-oriented early Tanzimat reforms. Khalidi influence iseven more apparent in the case of the Salafi trend in the Arab provinces ofthe Ottoman Empire, despite their turn against the brotherhood. Amongthe prominent Salafis with roots in the Naqshbandi tradition we findNu‘man Khayr al-Din al-Alusi of Baghdad and Rashid Rida, who editedthe influential journal al-Manar in Cairo. Shihabuddin Marjani too,founder of the Jadid movement in Central Asia, was initiated into theNaqshbandiyya.Unlike the previous chapters, I do not purpose to reconstruct the mainideas and trajectories of the various modern thinkers and organizations thatin one way or another were connected with the Naqshbandiyya. My aim ismore modest, namely briefly to characterize each such individual or group,trace their specific Naqshbandi background, and examine to what extentthey departed from the legacy of the brotherhood and what they retained.The literature of and about these thinkers and organizations, especially thosewith a modernist or fundamentalist thrust, is abundant, though their connec-tions with the Naqshbandiyya are often concealed. The primary literatureencompasses the traditional types of sources we have already met – manuals,polemical treatises, biographical dictionaries etc. From the late nineteenth133MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE PATH"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"century, it is augment by a new substantial source, namely the press, thevalue of which will be demonstrated here by the example of al-Manar.AntecedentsThe role of the Naqshbandi brotherhood in the formation of modernIslamic trends first became apparent in the Ottoman Empire as early as thesecond half of the sixteenth century, as the Sultanate went into crisis andsuffered military defeats. From the religious point of view political degener-ation was the result of deviation from the shari‘a and was to be remedied byeliminating un-Islamic practices. An early expression of this tendency isevinced in the work of the puritan preacher Mehmed Birgevi (d. 1573), espe-cially his idea of the Prophetic Way (tariqa muhammadiyya). Birgevi’s careerwas closely connected with the Amir-i Bukhari lodge, the principal Naqsh-bandi institution in Istanbul at the time, and two of its head masters. He wasadmitted to the ranks of the scholarly estate thanks to the patronage of thebrother-in-law and disciple of Shyakh Abdüllatif, and later was installed inthe College of Birgi, from where he derived his name, through the patronageof Sultan Selim II’s tutor and disciple of Shaykh Sha‘ban.1 Through theconcept of the Prophetic Way Birgevi sought to transcend the multiplicity ofthe existing brotherhoods and condemned practices prevalent among themsuch as tomb visits and the mystical audition.2Despite his censure of the Sufi brotherhoods, Mehmed Birgevi’s teachingswere taken up by several Naqshbandis of Istanbul who supported hisemphatic orthodox outlook. Most prominent were Mehmed Ma‘rufTrabzuni (d. 1594), translator of Kashifi’s Rashahat ‘ayn al-hayah intoTurkish, and Ahmed Tirevi (d. after 1620), head of the Hekim Çelebi lodge.In the seventeenth century, Birgevi’s writings were a major source of inspir-ation for the ultra-orthodox Kadizadeli movement.3 Named after MehmedKadizade (d. 1635), who was appointed preacher at several imperial mosquesin the Ottoman capital in the 1620s, the movement came out against what itregarded as deviations from the path of the Qur’an and the Prophet’s Sunna.These included popular Sufi beliefs and practices like tomb visits, music anddance during the dhikr, and Ibn ‘Arabi’s teachings, along with social prac-tices like the use of coffee and tobacco. Kadizadeli militancy was directedagainst the Sufis, particularly of the influential Khalwatiyya. It mobilized alarge following in the principal Ottoman cities, demanding of their congrega-tions to “enjoin the right and forbid the wrong” by actively seeking outsinners and forcing them back to the straight path. Critical also of the Otto-man bureaucracy and scholarly hierarchy, its leaders gained considerableinfluence in the court and enlisted official support for the implementation oftheir agenda.Actual Naqshbandi involvement in the Kadizadeli movement was mani-fested in the case of Osman Bosnevi (d. 1664), Tirevi’s disciple who was both134MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE PATH"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"administrator of the Hekim Çelebi lodge and preacher at several ofIstanbul’s imperial mosques. Bosnevi used the pulpit to propagateKadizadeli principles and promoted its campaign against Sufi excesses. Asagainst him Feyzullah Effendi of Erzurum (d. 1703), a future s ̧eyhülislamwho had begun his career as a protégé of the last Kadizadeli leader, decidedin the 1680s, as the movement was petering out, to join Murad al-Bukhari,who had recently arrived in Istanbul to disseminate the new Naqshbandi-Mujaddidi path from India.4 Mehmed Birgevi and the Kadizadelis drewinspiration from the orthodox thrust of the Naqshbandiyya in general, andits abhorrence of practices transgressing the shari‘a in particular. Theydeparted from it, however, in both the reach of their denunciations, whichcame to include Ibn ‘Arabi’s teachings and tomb visits, as well as in theirresort to violence in the effort to eradicate them.The Prophetic Way comes up once again, though with considerably differ-ent meanings, among the Naqshbandis of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century India. Acutely aware of the rapid disintegration of the MughalEmpire at the time, but with no central authority to rely on, various mastersin Delhi of both the original Naqshbandiyya and the indigenousMujaddidiyya were left to fend for themselves. In Chapter 4 we encounteredMazhar Jan-i Janan, head of the major Mujaddidi lodge in the Mughalcapital, who abandoned any pretensions to influence the rulers to concen-trate on safeguarding the interests of the Muslim community within theHindu environment.5 Muhammad Nasir ‘Andalib and Mir Dard, originatorsof the Indian tariqa muhammadiyya, combined a similarly detachedapproach toward the state with a millenarian hope for the advent of theMahdi. As against them, an activist interpretation of the Prophet’s examplewas embodied in the work of Shah Waliullah and his progeny, who wereprimarily revered as scholars of hadith. One offshoot of their efforts was theJihad movement of Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi, which also defined itself as aMuhammadan way.Nasir ‘Andalib (lit. the nightingale, d. 1759) was a descendent ofBaha’uddin Naqshband and disciple of Sirhindi’s third successor in theMujaddidiyya. His ancestors had arrived in India in Emperor Awrangzeb’sday, married into the Mughal family, and were given important positions inthe administration. ‘Andalib himself, however, gave up a military career andchose a life of contemplation and poverty. Upon his master’s death in 1740he claimed to have received divine inspiration to found a new path, with theaim of reviving the pure state of Islam as it had existed at the time of theProphet. The founding document of the movement, Nala-i ‘Andalib (Lam-ent of the Nightingale), was a compilation of lectures published the sameyear in reply to questions addressed to him by ulama and Sufis, as well asHindu philosophers and Yogis.The teachings of Nasir ‘Andalib were disseminated by his son andsuccessor Mir Dard (lit. the prince of pain, d. 1785), especially through his135MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE PATH"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"vast compendium of 111 treatises which he published in 1765 under the title‘ilm al-kitab (the science of the book [the Qur’an]). Dard advised his follow-ers to bear with patience the upheavals of the day and concentrate on prayerand good deeds. On the other hand, he described his father as the renewer ofthe eleventh Muslim century and, moreover, a reviver of the imama, thespiritual perfection that had lain dormant since the disappearance of thetwelfth imam, as believed by the shi‘a. His adherents concluded that he andhis father ‘Andalib were indeed Mahdis – the awaited ones. Dard regardedthe Naqshbandiyya-Mujaddidiyya as a superior Sufi brotherhood and theMuhammadan Way as its offshoot. Still, he blamed his fellow Mujaddidimasters for failing to penetrate the depth of their tradition and added inter-pretations of his own to its teachings. Moreover, contrary to the Mujaddidispirit Dard, who was an accomplished poet in both Persian and Urdu,organized mystical auditions which were attended by leading Muslim andnon-Muslim musicians of Delhi.6 He justified the practice:My sama’ is from God, and God is every time witness that thesingers come on their own and sing whenever they want; not that Iwould call them and consider it as worship to listen to them, asothers do; but I do not refuse such an act. However, I do not do itmyself, and my creed is that of the masters [the Naqshbandis].7Shah Waliullah (d. 1760), in many respects the most outstanding Islamicscholar in eighteenth-century India, derived from the example of the Propheta more activist and this-worldly lesson. At the age of fifteen Waliullah wasinitiated by his father into the Naqshbandi branch of Khwaja Khurd, son ofBaqi Billah, along with the Chishtiyya and Qadiriyya. Later he developed apreference for the Mujaddidiyya, which he came to regard as the most illus-trious and pure brotherhood in India. He had firm ties with the branches ofMuhammad Ma‘sum and of Adam Banuri, Sirhindi’s formidable deputy inthe Punjab. Still, Waliullah was to be known as a scholar of hadith ratherthan a Naqshbandi master. This development was the result of a journey heundertook when approaching thirty to the Hijaz, during which he completedhis studies with the leading ulama of the Haramayn. His foremost teacherwas Abu Tahir, son of Ibrahim al-Kurani, who taught both Sufism andhadith in Medina.8 Contemplating remaining in the Hijaz, Waliullah hadvisions at that time which persuaded him to return to India and assume thetask of reviving its religion.9Unlike his contemporary Mujaddidi masters, Shah Waliullah developed apolitical vision for India, in which rulers and religious scholars were to worktogether to restore a stable Muslim government. Seeking actively to guide therulers, he wrote letters to Mughal provincial administrators, and even to theAfghan king, to come and save Delhi. The appropriation of Waliullah as aprecursor of the communal idea of Pakistan, as in Sirhindi’s case before him,136MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE PATH"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"is nonetheless unwarranted, since he basically propagated the traditionalIslamic political theory and had no intention of overturning the Mughalsociopolitical order or mobilizing the Muslim masses.10 Waliullah’s reputa-tion rested on his scholarly endeavor to bring about a synthesis of thereligious sciences of his day, embodied in his monumental work Hujjat Allahal-baligha (The Conclusive Proof). At its center lay the discipline of hadith,which was to serve as the basis for judgment in legal disputes among the fourschools of law (ijtihad) and enhance the unity of the Muslim community ingeneral. Walliullah therefore writes in the introduction,The pillar and head of the absolute sciences, the edifice and founda-tion of the religious subjects is the science of hadith. In it are men-tioned sayings, deeds and reports about what was issued from thebest of messengers [Muhammad] . . . These are the lights in darknessand the signs of guidance. They are like the radiant full moon. Hewho follows and pays attention to them is on the right path andreceives much good, he who turns away and avoids them goes astrayand is misguided.11Concomitantly Waliullah advocated a literal interpretation of the Qur’an,which he translated into Persian in the face of the criticism of the officialscholars. His ecumenical attitude is apparent in the attempts to resolve thecontroversy over the Sufi doctrines of wahdat al-wujud and wahdat al-shuhudand to accommodate the Shi‘a.12The practical adjustment inherent in Shah Waliullah’s teachings becamemore pronounced following the conquest of Delhi by the British in 1803. Hisson and successor ‘Abdulaziz (d. 1824), who kept his allegiance to theMujaddidiyya and to Sufism at large,13 published a fatwa in which he impliedthat India had become the abode of war (dar al-harb). As Metcalf hasshown, however, by giving India this status ‘Abdulaziz did not mean to callfor military action against the British, which he knew was futile, but to makeit possible for the Muslims to enjoy the economic advantages that such astatus entailed, for example, collecting interest. In subsequent fatwas‘Abdulaziz, contrary to the position of his contemporary Mujaddidimasters, permitted Muslims to learn English and work for the British.14Following a similar logic, the popular Jihad movement that formed in thenorthern Indian countryside in the 1820s did not direct its energies againstthe British. Instead it sought to purify Islam of popular practices adoptedfrom the Hindus and to create a basis for an ideal independent Muslim state.The leader of the movement, Sayyid Ahmed Barelvi (d. 1831), a native of theShi‘i state of Oudh, studied with ‘Abdulaziz in 1807–1811 and enlisted thelatter’s nephew, Muhammad Isma‘il (d. 1831), who formulated the basicdocuments of the movement in his al-Sirat al-mustaqim (The Strait Path)and Taqwiyat al-iman (Strengthening the Faith). In 1822 Barelvi and his137MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE PATH"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"associates performed the hajj, during which he seems to have been influencedby Wahhabi ideas. This is evident in the rejection of popular practicesassociated with the saints’ tombs:Visiting graves by males without any specification of date, year andparticular congregation is desirable, rather than permissible . . . Butto make long journeys to visit a grave with specification of date andtime, to organize a fair or form a congregation, to light a lamp there,to build a mosque in the graveyard because of that grave, for a femaleto visit the grave, for one to write an obituary and some verses fromthe Qur’an on the grave or mausoleum, to say prayers near the grave,thinking it to be a better act, etc., are all unlawful, undesirable, andinnovation.15Far from rejecting Sufism as such, however, the Barelvis claimed torepresent a synthesis of the three major Indian brotherhoods: theNaqshbandiyya, Chishtiyya, and Qadiriyya, along with the exoteric tariqamuhammadiyya embodying the unity of God and strict adherence to theshari‘a. They were highly successful in disseminating their puritan teachingsamong the Muslim populations in the Indian towns and villages. But theirattempt to carve for themselves a territory in the Punjab ended in debaclewhen Barelvi, Isma‘il, and many of their followers were killed in a battleagainst the Sikhs in 1831.16The legacy of the Jihad movement lingered on in India; however, followingthe bloody suppression of the Great Revolt and imposition of direct colonialrule in 1857–58 the movement lost its militant zeal. Still, its activist approachgave inspiration to several reformist trends which continue to dominate theIslamic scene of India to this day, from the traditionalist Deoband chain ofschools to the quasi-fundamentalist organization of Nadwat al-Ulama. Inthe first case, the Barelvi tradition was transmitted by the influential Sufimaster Hajji Imdadullah (d. 1899), the Sufi preceptor of the founders ofDeoband, who was initiated into the Naqshbandiyya by Barelvi’s successorin the jihad movement. The Naqshbandi connection of Nadwat al-Ulama isdiscussed below.There is no reason to doubt the attachment of ‘Andalib and Dard to theNaqshbandiyya-Mujaddidiyya. Their millenarian and ecumenical overtureswere in line with the teachings of Sirhindi, the renewer of the second millen-nium, and of their contemporary Jan-i Janan, who also accepted Hindus inhis circle. Dard’s predilection for mystical audition was indeed a deviation,but this may be regarded as part of the attempt to adjust to the deterioratingsituation in Delhi. It was their critique of their contemporary Naqshbandimasters and the concomitant claim to have direct inspiration from theimams, which set ‘Andalib and his son apart from the main body of theIndian Naqshbandiyya. Shah Waliullah and his successors took a step138MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE PATH"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"further by making their Naqshbandi affiliation second to the study of hadithand then transcending it altogether through their project of a purifiedMuslim state. Gaborieau maintains that such reformist ideas were importedto India from the Wahhabis of Arabia by the Barelvis, a view that seems torest on the quietism of today’s leaders in Delhi.17 But the fact remains thatthose who adopted this kind of reformism had a firm footing in theMujaddidi tradition, which from its very beginning stressed the importanceof strict adherence to the shari‘a, as well as the duty to guide the rulers on itspath.Indeed, even in the case of the Wahhabiyya we find some Naqshbanditraces in the background, although the main influence on Muhammad ibn‘Abd al-Wahhab (d. 1792) was undoubtedly the writings of the medievalHanbali theologian Ahmad ibn Taymiyya. As Voll has shown, during hisstudies in Medina in his youth Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab studied with the Indianhadith scholar Muhammad Hayah al-Sindhi (d. 1750), who himself studiedwith Abu Tahir al-Kurani, and, like many others of the Madinese scholarlynetwork, was initiated into the Naqshbandiyya. Besides Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab, his students included three prominent Naqshbandi masters of thetime: Isma‘il al-Uskudari of Medina, ‘Ali Muradi of Damascus, and ‘Abdal-Rahman al-‘Aydarus of Yemen.18In Central Asia and among the Tatars of the Volga Basin, the beginningsof a modern critical approach to popular practices are associated with thename of Abunasir Kursavi (d. 1812). Hailing from the province of Kazan,Kursavi, like many of his compatriots under Russian rule, set out in the firstdecade of the nineteenth century to complete his studies in Bukhara. Here hebecame a disciple of the oppositional Mujaddidi master MuhammadNiyazquli,19 and possibly under his inspiration began to preach direct reli-ance on the scriptures and rejection of latter-day traditions. His ideasaroused the animosity of the religious establishment, which was dominatedby more conservative Naqshbandi masters. Kursavi was summoned to anofficial interrogation by Amir Haydar, in the wake of which he was com-pelled to repent and his books were publicly burnt. The intervention ofNiyazquli secured his return to his native village, where Kursavi re-assertedhis ideas and called for rational deliberation. Again meeting with fierceindignation, he decided to leave for the hajj and died on the way in Istanbul.Kursavi’s teachings were taken up by several Tatar scholars and subsequentlyformed the basis of the modernist Jadid movement.20Early modernism and fundamentalismAlthough the trends of Islamic Modernism and Fundamentalism are com-monly associated with the modern assault on the Sufi aspect of Islam, manyof their early thinkers had a reformist Sufi background.21 In the Indiansubcontinent, the Ottoman Empire, and Central Asia such thinkers were139MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE PATH"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"generally connected with the Naqshbandiyya brotherhood. Both trendsemerged in parallel in the second half of the nineteenth century when, fol-lowing the Industrial revolution and the development of new means ofcommunication, Western political and cultural colonialism entered a newand more aggressive phase. In response to the mounting challenge, indi-viduals and groups of intellectuals from various parts of the Muslim worldappropriated modern Western points of view and sought ways to reformtheir political and religious traditions in their light. The difference betweenModernists and Fundamentalists was initially a question of emphasis. Whilethe former tended openly to refer to Western ideas and values, the lattersought to ground their borrowings in the Muslim faith through a re-imagination of the original myth of Islam. Consequently, while IslamicModernism has remained an elitist intellectual group, Fundamentalismcould gain a large following among the Muslim masses and becomeenmeshed in politics.In British India, Sayyid Ahmad Khan (d. 1898), the founding father of theModernist trend, dedicated himself to the dissemination of Western cultureand sciences among his Muslim compatriots. He was born in Delhi to anaristocratic Mughal family, and both his parents were closely attached toGhulam ‘Ali. The intimate relation between them is vividly described byAhmad’s biographer:When Sir Sayyid Khan was born, his father requested Shah Ghulam‘Ali to name the child. Shah Sahib had already named Sir Sayyid’selder brother Muhammad and therefore he chose the name Ahmad.Sir Sayyid’s paternal grandfather had died before Mir Muttaqi [hisfather] married, and so the children always called Shah Sahib dadahazrat (‘grandfather’). Shah Sahib was also very fond of them andtreated them as if they were his own children. He had never had afamily of his own and would say that although the Almighty Godspared him the ordeal of raising children, he had been granted thelove of the children of Mir Muttaqi.22As a young man Ahmad also attended the monthly meetings in the lodgeof Muhammad Nasir (d. 1845), successor of Mir Dard in the Prophetic Way.Ahmad Khan’s early religious outlook was shaped by these Naqshbandi-Mujaddidi connections, as well as by the religious teachings of the Waliullahischool and the practices exercised in the Jihad movement of Ahmad Barelvi.In a book he penned in 1846, Khan accordingly praises the inhabitants ofDelhi for adopting tariqat-i sunnat-i Muhammadi, foremost among them themasters of the Mujaddidiyya. Six years later he composed a defense of theSufi practice of tasawwur-i shaykh (visualization of the spiritual master) atthe request of followers of Ghulam ‘Ali, in which he tried to show that it wasa proper and legal means to develop a love of God in the heart of the adept.140MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE PATH"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Still within the confines of the Naqshbandi tradition, in other treatises hedenounced deviations from the Sunna and excessive submission to the Sufimaster within the popular brotherhoods.23At that time however, contrary to the position of Ghulam ‘Ali, AhmadKhan took a post in the East India Company. The Great Revolt of 1857, towhich he was opposed, completed his transformation and led him to dedicatehis energies to bringing about a rapprochement between the British rulersand their Muslim subjects. Khan was deeply troubled by the deplorable stateof the Indian Muslim community of his day and believed that the adoptionof Western civilization would enable the Muslims to compete with the Hindumajority. He rejected the tradition and reduced the essence of Islam to theQur’an, which was reinterpreted in light of modern reason and science.Social practices that did not conform to Western liberal standards were simi-larly rejected. Following a prolonged visit to England in 1870, Khan estab-lished the journal Tahdhib al-Akhlaq (Refinement of Morals) to disseminateWestern thought and sciences and founded the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh, which was designed to train young Muslims forservice in the colonial administration.24The leaders of the Indian Fundamentalist trend, the Ahl-i Hadith, likewisehad some connections with the Naqshbandiyya. This seems to have been thecase with their foremost figure, Siddiq Hasan Khan (d. 1889), who claimedto belong to the brotherhood and to follow the path of Shah Waliullah.Others were disciples and followers of Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi. Motivated byPlate 8.1The Aligarh Muslim University141MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE PATH"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"the feeling that the end of the world was imminent, Ahl-i Hadith intellectualsstrove to create a single standard interpretation of the faith based on theirown rational deliberation (ijtihad); they bitterly rejected the schools of law,Modernists such as Ahmad Khan, Sufi brotherhoods, and all kinds of popu-lar practices. Hasan Khan insisted that Sufism be confined to the privatesphere, that theosophical speculation be wholly rejected, and that theNaqshbandi practice of rabita be eliminated.25In the Ottoman capital the representatives of early Islamic Modernismwere generally known as the Young Ottomans. This group of religious-minded intellectuals and bureaucrats supported the state program of mod-ernization known as the Tanzimat, but objected to the Westernizing turn ittook during the 1850s under the high-handed conduct of the Sublime Porte.An early expression of opposition to the Reform Edict of 1856, whichpromised equality to non-Muslims, was organized within three years by theKhalidi master Ahmad of Sulaymaniyya.26 The Young Ottomans, who wereorganized in 1865 as a secret society, were influenced, though less directly, bythe orthodox ideals of the Khalidiyya. Many of them were protégés ofGrand Vizier Mustafa Res ̧id, the architect of the early religious-orientedpart of the Tanzimat reforms. Their foremost protagonist, Namik Kemal (d.1888), also followed the lead of contemporary poets affiliated with thebrotherhood.27 In contrast to the emerging autocratic state, the Young Otto-mans resorted to Western notions of freedom and fatherland, claiming thatthey were actually Islamic. Helping to bring about the Constitution in 1876,they were suppressed by Sultan Abdülhamid II and gave way to thesecularized movement of the Young Turks.28Islamic Modernism penetrated the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empireboth through the agency of the Young Ottomans and through Egyptianreligious reformers, most notably the celebrated Muhammad ‘Abduh (d.1905), who spent some years in exile in Beirut. Here it combined, in variousdegrees, with the fundamentalist trend of the (modern) Salafiyya, whichemerged in the late 1870s in Baghdad and spread during the 1880s to Syria,from where it was subsequently taken to Egypt and other parts of the Arabworld.29 The early Salafis were mostly middle status men of religion whoopposed Abdülhamid’s autocratic regime in general, and his encouragementof popular Sufi brotherhoods and conservative ulama in particular. Theyhad firmer roots in the Khalidi tradition than their colleagues in Istanbul,but they also more sharply detached themselves from the current leaders andpractices of the brotherhood in favor of the teachings of Ibn Taymiyya.The rise of the modern Salafi trend was heralded by the publication in1881 of a lengthy treatise in defense of Ibn Taymiyya by the Baghdadischolar Nu‘man Khayr al-Din al-Alusi (d. 1899). The work combined asharp critique of the Sufi practices of saint worship and tomb visits with anew rationalist notion of ijtihad. In his anti-Sufi diatribes, Khayr al-Dinfollowed in the footsteps of his father, Abu al-Thana’ al-Alusi (d. 1854), who142MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE PATH"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"had imbibed Wahhabi ideas prevalent in early nineteenth-century Baghdadwhile also belonging to the circle of Shaykh Khalid, the founder of theNaqshbandiyya-Khalidiyya.30 Abu al-Thana’s admiration for Khalid hadnever waned, but his quarrel with the master’s successors led him later in lifeto incline to a peaceful version of the Wahhabi teachings. Khayr al-Din’sadoption of a rationalist ijtihad was inspired by his acquaintance with theideas of the Indian Ahl-i Hadith leader, Siddiq Hasan. Consequently, Khayral-Din targeted the Khalidi practice of rabita, which both had agreed was anunlawful innovation with no basis in the Qur’an or Sunna. The main adver-sary of the Salafis of Baghdad was the conservative scholar Da’ud ibn Jirjis,the leading contemporary Khalidi master in the city.31In the course of the 1880s the focus of Salafi thought shifted to Damascus.Its principal protagonists in that city, ‘Abd al-Razzaq al-Baytar (d. 1916) andJamal al-Din al-Qasimi (d. 1914), were likewise descendents of local disciplesof Khalid. Unlike their colleagues in Baghdad, however, they maintainedclose relations with Khalid’s local successors, the Khanis. All three familieswere part of the mystic circle of Amir ‘Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza’iri who, as wehave seen, had himself received the Khalidiyya in his youth. On arrival inDamascus in 1855, following his defeat in Algeria and imprisonment inFrance, ‘Abd al-Qadir became immersed in the teachings of Ibn ‘Arabi,through which he tried to accommodate modern Western ideas.32The major adversary of the Khanis over the leadership of the Khalidiyyain Damascus, As‘ad al-Sahib, was also a bitter enemy of the Salafis.33 In anumber of treatises Sahib undertook to defend the practice of rabita andorthodox Sufism at large and repeatedly sought to incriminate his rivals withthe Ottoman authorities. As against him Qasimi, the mouthpiece of theearly Damascene Salafiyya, propagated the principles of rational ijtihad andunity of the Muslim umma but, like his Iraqi counterparts, refused to con-demn Ibn ‘Arabi and described shar‘ia-oriented Sufism as the moral basis ofIslam.34Khalidi influence was less conspicuous in Aleppo, but here too thebrotherhood had a hand in the formation of a combined Modernist-Salafitrend. The roots of several of the major intellectuals of the city can be tracedto the circle of Husayn al-Bali (d. 1855), a native of Gaza who was invited toAleppo in mid-century after being initiated into the Khalidiyya by a seniordisciple of Muhammad al-Khani in Damascus. Bali spent only six years inAleppo before his premature death, but his legacy was carried on by dis-ciples, who raised his minor son, the future historian Kamil al-Ghazzi (d.1933). He and his step-brother, the linguist Bashir al-Ghazzi (d. 1921), had akeen interest in literature and science, and they associated with Europeansand local Christians to acquire knowledge. ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi (d.1904), among the most eloquent religious reformists in late Ottoman Aleppoand Syria at large, belonged to this group, being the son of one of Bali’sforemost disciples.35143MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE PATH"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Like their colleagues in Baghdad and Damascus, the Aleppine Modernistand fundamentalist scholars adopted an oppositional stance on AbdülhamidII’s autocratic rule and criticized conservative ulama and popular Sufiswho were ready to be harnessed to the Sultan’s populist policies. Their atti-tude was clearly articulated in the writings of Kawakibi, especially his Ummal-qura (a name of Mecca), in which he proves himself well acquainted withthe principles of the Naqshbandiyya. One of the participants at the imagin-ary Islamic conference described in the book is al-Shaykh al-Sindhi. Afterlistening to the speeches of his colleagues about the ills of the Muslim ummahe is made to confess thatI am from among the deputies of the Naqshbandi brotherhood, asmy late father transmitted this brotherhood to the eastern andsouthern regions of India. I succeeded my father as the source for allits deputies, and then I made repeated journeys to those destinationsand to the lands of Kashmir, Kazan, and even Siberia and their like.Because our endeavors to spread our path, it became very popularand widespread among the Muslims of these lands.It is well known that our brotherhood is among the closest tosincerity and the least deviant from the letter of the Law. It isfounded on the silent recollection and the reading of the Khwajaganlitany, meditation on the guide and asking the help of the spirits. Itnever occurred to me that in the recollection and the reading of thelitany in this way there was any suspicion of innovation or additionto the faith, or that in meditation and asking help from the spirits ofthe prophets and saints there was a hint of association with God(shirk), until I attended these blessed meetings, heard [your words],became convinced, and am prepared to renounce [such practices],praise be to God.36Naqshbandi-Khalidi background is even more clearly evident in the caseof Muhammad Rashid Rida (d. 1935), who more than anyone else is associ-ated with the consolidation of the modern Salafiyya. In an autobiographicalsketch Rida recollects how at his youth in Tripoli he followed the path undera Naqshbandi master, whose name he omits, and gained extraordinary spir-itual experiences.37 Within the orthodox framework of the brotherhood hebecame critical of popular Sufi practices, and was especially dismayed by thedancing and singing he witnessed in the Mevlevi dhikr. This criticism inten-sified after Rida left in 1898 for Egypt, where he came under the influence ofthe Modernist ‘Abduh and the works of Ibn Taymiyya and launched hisfamous Salafi journal al-Manar.As Hourani has shown, under the impression of the popular festivals ofsaints (mawlid) prevalent in Egypt, Rida’s critique of Sufism exceeded thetraditional bounds. He now doubted the possibility of most Muslims144MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE PATH"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"reaching the advanced stages of the path, and rejected the total obediencerequired of the disciple toward his master, as well as of the chain of initiationat large.38 In his journal’s section of legal opinions (fatawa al-Manar) Ridatook the opportunity presented by two questions sent from Singapore andMalaysia to sum up the Salafi position on the Naqshbandi practice of therabita:I say that tawajjuh [concentration of master and disciple on eachother] and rabita have nothing to do with religion and it is impermis-sible that they pass as lawful worship in Islam. I do not hold thatevery person who practices or will practice them is an unbeliever, butI fear that those who follow this brotherhood [the Naqshbandiyya]without knowing the Law and realizing the truth of the soul arecloser to idolatry than to monotheism in what happens between themaster and the disciple. Moreover, in my judgment there is a certainopen or secret association with God in it . . . The disciple who knowsPlate 8.2Muhammad Rashid Rida145MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE PATH"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"the Muslim doctrine can combine monotheism and the imaginationof his master during the recollection of God most high by imaginingthat he sits in his circle, and that he [the master] supervises his man-ners and the presence of his heart in His recollection.

Like his predecessor, Marjani studied in Bukhara, where he wasinitiated into the Naqshbandi path by Niyazquli’s son and successor, ‘Ubay-dullah (d. 1852). Marjani inspired a generation of seminar-trained Modern-ists in Bukhara before he returned to take office as preacher and teacher inthe Grand Mosque of Kazan. Like the Arab Salafis, his most ardentopponents were conservative Naqshbandi masters, who objected to hisdepartures from the basic tenets of their brotherhood.40 The Sufi affiliationsof other early Mujaddidi intellectuals, especially from the Crimea and theCaucasus, need more research.146MODERN TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE PATH"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"9THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATIONDuring the twentieth century and into the present Naqshbandi mastershave developed a variety of strategies to face the challenges of modernityand postmodernity. These have normally involved collaboration with oneor another of the dominant forces of the age: the nation-state and itsupper classes, Islamic modernism and fundamentalism, Western culture,and globalization. Masters of the Naqshbandiyya, the Mujaddidiyya, andespecially the Khalidiyya are thus able to continue to voice their vision ofIslam in the national and global public spheres. This, however, is done at theprice of major modifications in their modes of operation and in their generalcommitment to the orthodoxy of the brotherhood. Such modifications mayinclude turning the dhikr into a sober religious lesson or its abandonmentaltogether, propagating the message to Muslims as well as non-Muslims, andthe substitution of the personal contact between master and disciple with themost advanced mass means of communication.In India, Naqshbandi-Mujaddidi endeavors to face the empowerment ofthe Hindu majority gave birth in the late nineteenth century to two dia-metrically opposed movements. One was Nadwat al-Ulama (the Council ofReligious Scholars), which strove to unite the various Islamic trends inBritish India and tighten connections with the Arab world. The Council’shead and all-India Muslim leader in the second half of the twentieth century,Abu al-Hasan ‘Ali al-Nadwi, combined his role as a Naqshbandi master withclose relations with fundamentalist elements in the Middle East, includingthe Saudi government and the Muslim Brothers society. The other movementwas a Hindu Naqshbandi branch, in which the path has been transmittedamong Hindu divines.Turkey remained a major arena of Naqshbandi and Naqshbandi-inspiredactivity even after the demise of the Ottoman Empire, despite the banimposed on Sufi activity by Atatürk’s secularizing regime in 1925.Naqshbandi masters were forced to go underground or into exile but duringthe 1970s, as state inspection was relaxed, the brotherhood re-surfaced andgained a new prominence. A powerful branch was established at that time inIstanbul by the Khalidi Zahid Kotku, head of an informal educational147"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"institution which appealed to religious-minded elements among the elite.Earlier in the century the modernist thinker Said Nursi, an adept of theKurdish Khalidiyya, founded the Nurcu movement, in which reading anddebating his writings replaced the guidance of Sufi masters. Today a widenetwork of Nurcu schools is spread all over Turkey and among the Turkicpeoples of Central Asia and immigrants to the West. This educational enter-prise has been further expanded and updated by the Gülen and Sulaymançimovements.Almost nothing is known about the Naqshbandiyya-Khalidiyya in theSunni Arab parts of Iraq, whereas in Egypt, as we have seen, it has remainedrelatively marginal. In Syria, by contrast, the brotherhood has come to play amajor role since the rise of the Ba‘th to power in 1964 in both the religiousestablishment and the Islamist resistance. Ahmad Kuftaru, Grand Mufti ofSyria for more than forty years, was also the founder and head of theKhalidiyya-Kaftariyya, the largest Sufi organization in the country. Servingfaithfully President Asad throughout his life, he was rewarded with a freehand in promoting his cherished agendas of securing Islamic education inSyria and preaching a global inter-faith dialogue. On the other hand, Khalidiinfluence is apparent in the formation and direction of the northern branchof the Muslim brothers, the backbone of the Islamist opposition to the‘Alawi-dominated authoritarian Ba‘th regime. Many leaders of theresistance and its major ideologue shared a Khalidi background.In Uzbekistan, the heart of Central Asia, the Naqshbandiyya has wit-nessed a conspicuous revival since the demise of the Soviet Union and theestablishment of independent states. Masters of the brotherhood in Tashkentand Bukhara continue to serve the state, while those in the Feghana valleyfollow their tradition of resistance to its secular policies. In Afghanistan,Sibghatullah Mujaddidi, scion of the leading Naqshbandi family in thecountry, had been influenced by the Egyptian Muslim Brothers during hisstudies at al-Azhar in the 1950s. Following the Soviet invasion of 1979 hefounded his own Islamist resistance organization, the National LiberationFront, and in 1992 he was nominated the first mujahidin’s president. InIndonesia, various Khalidi and Mujaddidi offshoots ranging from the con-servative to the modernist disseminate the path to ever new regions, often incollaboration with the upper and middle classes of the country.In the last few decades Naqshbandi masters and adepts are to be found atthe forefront of Sufi endeavors to adapt to the global setting. This is under-standable in the case of the unorthodox or less orthodox branches of thebrotherhood, such as the Hindu branch, which was carried to Britain by aWestern convert and formed the basis of the Sufi Golden Center in theUnited States. Of a similar mold is Subud, a syncretistic spiritual techniquewhich likewise has been integrated into the New Age culture. Developed byan Indonesian Naqshbandi adept, it is being taught today to all interestedpeople, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, in many corners of the world. As148THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"against both, the Haqqaniyya, apparently the most visible Sufi brotherhoodon the current global scene, remains deeply committed to the Naqshbanditradition. Its founder and head, the Khalidi Cypriot Nazim al-Haqqani,holds a basically conservative ideology with eschatological overtones and is abitter enemy of the fundamentalists. Still, he spreads his message throughthe most advanced media, including the Internet, and accepts non-Muslimdisciples in the hope of converting them in due course to Islam.While learned books are still occasionally produced by Naqshbandi mas-ters and followers, these are increasingly superceded by the various modernmass means of communication. The main sources for the study of the cur-rent situation of the Naqshbandiyya include popular books, pamphlets andjournal articles that explore the principal tenets and rites of the brotherhood,audio and video cassettes that record the discourses of its masters, and mostrecently the Internet.Internationalism and syncretism in IndiaAmong the various Islamic reformist trends that emerged in late nineteenth-century India, particularly associated with the Naqshbandi tradition wasNadwat al-Ulama. It was founded in 1892 in the town of Kanpur U.P. by agroup of religiously-minded government officials, local notables, andreligious scholars, most of whom were followers of a local Naqshbandi-Mujaddidi master, Fadl al-Rahman Ganj Muradabadi (d. 1894). Their firstleader was his deputy, Sayyid Muhammad ‘Ali Mongiri (d. 1927). Alarmedby the Western challenge and particularly by Christian missionary activity inIndia, Mongiri had founded a cultural society and two journals in which headvocated reform of the traditional Muslim institutions of learning. TheCouncil was unable to unite the Indian ulama under its banner, so in 1898 itestablished its own college in Lucknow which specialized in the teaching ofArabic language and culture.1After some vicissitudes, in 1914 the directorship of Nadwat al-Ulama wasgiven to ‘Abd al-Hayy al-Hasani (d. 1923), another follower of GanjMuradabadi and a close associate of Mongiri, who turned it into an actualfamily patrimony. Hasani’s ancestors had been affiliated to Sayyid AhmadBarelvi and further back to Sirhindi. His descendents, who came to beknown as the Nadwis, continued this connection to the Mujaddidiyya. Thiswas particularly the case with Abu al-Hasan ‘Ali al-Nadwi (d. 1999), whoduring the second half of the twentieth century figured not merely as theCouncil’s head but as a distinguished leader of the entire Muslim communityof India in the face of insurgent Hinduism. Nadwi became acquainted withSirhindi’s Maktubat at the age of seventeen,2 and then followed the pathunder two Mujaddidi masters. He remained a Mujaddidi master all his life,combining it with close contacts with fundamentalist elements in the MiddleEast, most notably the Muslim Brothers Society of Egypt and Syria. A149THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"remarkable articulation of the new Sufi-fundamentalist synthesis that Nadwiwished to create appeared in an article he published in the 1950s in the organof the Syrian Muslim Brothers:Terms and names of things that are in vogue among the people oftenoffend truths. This offense has a long story in every profession andlanguage, every literature and religion. It generates another thing,which raises doubts, brings about controversies, and creates factions.Arguments and proofs are produced and fierce verbal fighting ragesaround them. If we renounce these invented terms and customarynames and return to the past and to words through which suchtruths were expressed in a simple and convenient way, to what wasspoken by the first generation [of Islam] and the early ancestors (al-salaf), the difficulty would be resolved, the situation would becomeeasy and the people would be put on the right path.Among these terms and common names that have spread amongthe people is Sufism . . . There is no trace of it in the Qur’an or theexample of the Prophet, it does not appear in the words of his con-temporaries or their followers, nor in the reports on the first century.Everything like that is from among the invented deviations. Battleshave raged between its followers and detractors, supporters andopponents, who created a huge literature beyond any imagination.Plate 9.1Leisure time at Nadwat al-Ulama, Lucknow150THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"If we were to abandon this term, which emerged and spread in thesecond century, and return to the Qur’an, Sunna and the era of theCompanions and followers, and if we were to look at the Qur’an andhadith, we would find that the Qur’an indicates a religious branchand a Prophetic task that is called purification (tazkiya) . . . purifica-tion of the souls, their instruction, adoration of virtues and releasefrom vices.3Nadwi was a founding member of the international Saudi-sponsoredMuslim World League and the founding chairman of the board of trusteesof the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies.4An entirely different course was followed by spiritual descendents of ShahNa‘imullah Bahraichi, Ghulam ‘Ali’s main rival for the leadership of theMujaddidi lodge in late eighteenth-century Delhi. This line, also located inthe Lucknow region, rested on the tolerant attitude of Jan-i Janan towardsnon-Muslims, and in one case was moved to transmit the teachings andmethods of the path to Hindus. This utterly unorthodox step was initiated bythe otherwise orthodox master Abu al-Hasan Nasirabadi (d. 1856). In hislast years, just before the incorporation of the Oudh state into the BritishEmpire, Nasirabadi assigned to one of his deputies in the rural area the taskof not merely accepting Hindu “infidels” to his circle, but actually handingover to them the spiritual authority to perpetuate the path among them-selves. His instruction was realized only in the 1890s by a deputy from therural hinterland of Lucknow who began to initiate into the path Muslim aswell as Hindu deputies.The first adept among the Hindu disciples was Ramchandra Saksena (d.1931), who in due course was ordained as deputy and founded a HinduNaqshbandi spiritual lineage. Ramchandra and his successors combined theMujaddidi doctrine of the seven subtle centers of the body (lata’if) and thepractice of tawajjuh on the one hand, with elements pertaining to the HinduVais ́nava tradition, including abstention from wine and meat consumptionand ritual ablutions, on the other. They regarded themselves as following theway of Kabir, one of the forebears of the Sikh religion. Under the next headof this Hindu Naqshbandi branch, Brja Mohan Lal (d. 1955), its center ofactivity moved to Kanpur, and then to Delhi. After his death a gradualprocess of dispersion set in and led to the emergence of several distinctassemblies which carry on the tradition.5Education and politics in TurkeyIn the wake of the bloody suppression of the Shaykh Said revolt in 1925 andthe resulting ban on organized Sufi activity, the Turkish Naqshbandiyyawas forced underground. Kemalist ideology portrayed it, and the Sufibrotherhoods at large, as a threat to the modern and secular character of the151THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"republic. Persecution was intensified in the aftermath of the Menemenincident of 1930, a disturbance in the Aegean region which according to theofficial version was instigated by local Naqshbandis.6 In the following dec-ades various Naqshbandi groupings transformed themselves from purelyreligious networks into informal educational and cultural associations. Thestrategies adopted by their masters included a new emphasis on the ortho-doxy of their tradition, abandonment of the lodges and taking positions asimams in mosques, and a recast of the practice of suhba into a religiousconversation directed by the master. With the institution of democracy in thecountry after 1945, and still more following the liberalization of the 1980s,the Naqshbandiyya, which has remained the most popular brotherhood inTurkey, was able to renew its public activity and regain influence in thepolitical arena.7Among those arrested in the wake of the Menemen incident were twoprominent Khalidi masters from Istanbul. One was the aged Mehmed As‘adIrbili,8 who after the founding of the republic gathered his disciples in pri-vate. He abandoned the Naqshbandi dhikr and initiation ceremony and con-fined himself to suhba, teaching the articles of faith, and reading works ofIbn ‘Arabi. Yavuz claims that the whole incident was in fact orchestrated bythe state in order to kill this master. Irbili died, or was poisoned, in jail in1931, and his son was executed.9The other master was Abdulhakim Arvasi (d. 1943) from the Hakkariprovince, who arrived in Istanbul after the First World War and revived theKashghari lodge in Eyüp. Arvasi showed special interest in Sirhindi’sMaktubat and continued to guide disciples along the Naqshbandi and Qadiripaths even after 1925. Following his release from prison he abandoned thelodge, but continued his Sufi activity in private and through his books.Arvasi was a source of influence for many religious-minded intellectuals inIstanbul, among them the eminent poet Necip Fazıl Kısakürek who cour-ageously defended Islamic values on the pages of his journal, and HüseynHilmi Is ̧ıq (d. 2001), who was recognized as the successor a decade after themaster’s death. He is the founder of the Is ̧ıqji movement which, according toZarcone, strives to realize the spiritual legacy of the Naqshbandiyya whiledispensing with the traditional framework of the tariqa. The movement hasparticular appeal among students and it is backed by influential financialcircles.10In the long run, more important were the branches belonging to the line ofGümüs ̧hanevi, the principal Khalidi master in late Ottoman Istanbul.11Among his deputies, Abdulaziz Bekkine (d. 1952) worked as imam whilecontinuing the guidance of disciples in clandestine. In his lineage the vocaldhikr was preferred over the silent dhikr.12 Bekkine was succeeded byMehmed Zahid Kotku, apparently the most influential Sufi master in repub-lican Turkey. Kotku was born in Bursa in 1897 and followed the Naqshbandipath in Istanbul. After the closure of Sufi lodges he returned to his152THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"hometown, until in 1952 he was called back to take Bekkine’s place. Six yearslater Kotku received a post in the Iskenderpas ̧a mosque in Fateh quarter.Enjoying the more auspicious atmosphere of the 1950s, he turned it into akind of “open university” which attracted students from all over Turkey.His popular lectures blended mystical interpretations of hadith in Gümü-s ̧hanevi’s spirit with advocacy of economic development checked by a Sufi-Islamic morality.13 His writings include the five-volume Encyclopedia of SufiMorals, in which he stresses the importance of finding a true spiritualmaster and laments the closure of the Sufi lodges in Turkey:Many years ago, there were dergahs called tekke (dervish convents),which provided spiritual training and education to the people. Sincethere were perfect and perfecting teachers available then, thoseattending these places could attain as good moral and spiritualprogress as their destiny permitted. At the same time dergahs werecommunity schools of social and personal training. Many moral andspiritual practices, as well as teaching, to enlighten the inner worldof people and to develop in them beautiful attitudes, manners andvirtues, used to be carried out there. . . In time some of those tekkeslost their originality and became degraded. The defective ones beingconsidered to have undesirable social effects, they were all banned.The vacuum created by their physical disappearance was filled bycafés, discos and taverns.14Kotku’s ideas could be implemented in full only after his death in 1980,which coincided with the military coup that led to reduced state interventionin social affairs. Among his followers were several prominent academics andpoliticians who were to assume leading positions in the country in the 1980sand 1990s. These included Turgut Özal, the leader of the Motherland Partyand Prime Minister and President of Turkey from 1983 until his death in1993, and Necmettin Erbakan, who established with Kotku’s backing thefirst political movement based on Islamic ideology in Turkey, soon to benamed the National Salvation Party. Erbakan advocated a “just economicorder” based on moral considerations and private initiative, which won himthe support of provincial businessmen and artisans. He joined two coalitiongovernments before being appointed, as head of the successor Welfare Party,Prime Minister of Turkey in 1996. Erbakan held office for a little more thana year until the army intervened to remove him and dissolved the party. Itreappeared yet again as the Virtue party.15In the brotherhood itself Kotku was succeeded by Esad Cos ̧an (1938–2001),16 his son-in-law and professor of theology in Istanbul University.Exploiting the new space opened up in the 1980s, he turned the Iskenderpas ̧amosque into the hub of educational, economic, and communications net-works, while advocating peaceful adjustment to the modern state and the153THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"capitalist market. Cos ̧an attracted wealthy businessmen and merchants, andwith their help developed economic enterprises and religious endowments forthe benefit of the community. His moral economic vision was propagatedthrough his own magazines and radio station, and later also through theInternet. At the same time Cos ̧an became critical of Erbakan’s focus onpolitics,17 and suggested the formation of a council encompassing allNaqshbandi-related associations in Turkey.18 He was also active in propagat-ing the path abroad, notably in Australia, where he died in a car accident.19Under his son and successor, Nuruddin Cos ̧an, the headquarters of theorganization moved to a prestigious neighborhood on Istanbul’s Asian side.From there it continues to run a network of schools, various economic firms,two hospitals, and a radio station, and is associated with the Common Senseparty, which has some members in parliament. Yavuz’s observation that to acertain extent the brotherhood had become secularized and that its path wasmodified by profane concerns was brought to me on a visit to the place in thesummer of 2005. I could hardly have anticipated the business-like modernpremises where I arrived. As Cos ̧an himself was in Australia at the time I wasreceived by the General Coordinator, who spoke fluent English and evenuttered some Hebrew words he had picked up in his previous job in thetourist resorts of Antalia. In the ensuing conversation little was said aboutIslam, the focus being on the endeavors of the organization to provide needyMuslims with worldly and moral help.20As against the pragmatic accommodation of the Iskenderpas ̧a group,Plate 9.2The Iskenderpas ̧a mosque in Fateh, Istanbul154THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"which puts the stress on the activist side of the Naqshbandiyya, Istanbul alsohosts one of the most orthodox branches of the brotherhood in Turkey,headed by Mahmud Ustaosmanog ̆lu in the Ismail Aga mosque in Çars ̧ambequarter. His followers come mostly from the lower strata of society and fromthe countryside. These prefer the traditional gown (black among women) toWestern clothing and refrain from watching TV.21 Unlike the Iskenderpas ̧agroup, at the Ismail Aga mosque I was asked to convert to Islam before aninterview would be granted with the master or any of his lieutenants. Grudg-ingly I was allowed to watch from afar the evening dhikr, which was basicallycomposed of chanting verses from the Qur’an and a religious lesson. Aboutone hundred people attended this meeting.22Less information is available on the Turkish branches operating outsideIstanbul. A clue to the generally adaptationist strategies of local masters isexemplified in the biography of Osman Hulusi Ates ̧ (d. 1990), from a smalltown in the province of Malatia. The son of a Khalidi family that lost itsfortune following the founding of the republic, Ates ̧ had to contend himselfwith a modest religious post. With the relaxation of the 1950s, he gatheredaround him a group of followers. His standing was enhanced in the 1970sand 1980s with the incorporation of the area into the national market andmigration to the big cities. Ates ̧ became patron of the local population andused his client networks to establish ties with bureaucrats and political partymembers on the national level.23Of a different mold was the radical group that operated in Konya in thePlate 9.3Ismail Aga mosque in Çars ̧ambe, Istanbul155THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"1980s. Its militant fundamentalist stances can be gauged from its monthlyjournal. Exhibiting a sense of superiority over all other brotherhoods, theauthors denigrated worldly concerns, stressed their political commitment,and rejected “materialist” Western culture, science, and technology. TheKonya Naqshbandis portrayed a world in which non-Islamic governments,capitalist America and communist Soviet Union, all backed by Zionism,strive to weaken the Muslims. In response they evoked the Sufi great struggle(jihad al-akbar) to suppress evil desires and concentrate on the one God. Thisentailed withdrawal from the non-believing society, resigning from govern-ment jobs, and abandoning democracy and political parties. It was to befollowed by the smaller struggle (jihad al-asghar) of retaliation, anuncompromising attack against the infidels to be conducted by the party ofGod (hizbullah), consisting of those ready to sacrifice their lives for thecause.24The Naqshbandiyya-Khalidiyya remained strong in the Kurdish regionsof Turkey, despite the cruel persecution in the early days of the republic. Itspresence is particularly felt in the small towns and rural areas, where itsmasters keep closer to traditional Sufism. The main center of the KurdishKhalidiyya is located in the village of Menzil near Adyaman. The founda-tions were laid by Abdulhakim Huseyni (d. 1972), who in 1938 establishedthere a school and a lodge after he had received the path from AhmadGhiznawi in Syria.25 His enterprise was consolidated by his charismatic son,Mehmed Res ̧id Erol (d. 1993), who disseminated the path among both Kurdsand Turks. His enormous popularity aroused the apprehension of the mili-tary, and following the 1980 coup he was banished for two years to the shoresof the Sea of Marmara. Subsequently, with the restitution of party politics,Erol was often courted by political parties seeking his vote.26 Menzil hasbecome today a major pilgrimage site. Thousands of followers from all overTurkey and Turkish émigrés to Western Europe arrive daily to visit the mag-nificent mausoleum built over the graves of Erol and his elder son and toattend and receive the blessing of the younger son, the present master of theAdyaman branch.27While the aforementioned groupings generally remained within the fold ofthe Naqshbandi tradition, the Nurcu movement and its offshoots tran-scended it. The Nurcu is the most powerful faith movement in contemporaryTurkey. It derives its name from the Qur’an commentary (Risale-i Nur – TheEpistle of Light) of its founder, Said Nursi (d. 1960), one of the most ori-ginal and innovative Islamic thinkers in the country.28 Born into a religiousfamily from the mostly Kurdish province of Bitlis, Nursi was raised in a Sufienvironment and studied with several local Khalidi masters. Though respect-ful of them, he rejected the brotherhood framework, claiming instead thespiritual patronage of ‘Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani. Nursi then moved to the townof Van, where he became acquainted with modern scholarship. He was con-vinced of the need to enlighten the masses in the new fields of learning, but156THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"also to demonstrate the truths of religion in the face of modernity. At thatstage he was given the sobriquet of Bediüzzaman (the wonder of the time).In 1907 Said Nursi went to Istanbul to seek the support of SultanAbdülhamid II for a Kurdish university combining rational and Islamicstudies, but to no avail. He espoused the ideas of constitutionalism and free-dom, although he was opposed to the positivist inclinations of the YoungTurks. His articles against them in the wake of the 1908 revolution, pub-lished in the Naqshbandi-led paper Volkan, led to his first arrest. Followingtwo years in Russian captivity during World War I, Nursi returned in 1918 toIstanbul and was invited by the Khalidi seyhülislam Musa Kazim to join acommittee set up to suggest ways for religious reform. At that time Sirhindi’sMaktubat helped him overcome a spiritual crisis.Initially supporting Atatürk, Nursi was soon disappointed by the authori-tarian style and secular policies of the Turkish nationalist leader, and in 1923he left for Van. He abandoned politics and began writing his Qur’an exegesiswhich, in Yavuz’s apt expression, was aimed at returning God to the publicsphere. His work gained him many admirers as well as the constant harass-ment of the authorities. Nursi was repeatedly arrested and tried on spuriousaccusations, from involvement in the Shaykh Said revolt, through conspiringto establish an illegal Sufi organization, to declaring himself the Mahdi.Most of his later life was spent in prison or exile. On his death in 1960 hisbody was exhumed and re-interred in an unknown place.Plate 9.4The congregational mosque, Adyaman157THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The unfinished project of the Risale-i nur consists of 130 sections, whichexpand from commentaries on Qur’an verses to logical and metaphysicaldiscussions. Nursi regarded The Epistle as emanating directly from theQur’an, and its method as following the early Muslim generations. In amodernist vein, it also affirms the prediction by the Qur’an of moderntechnological innovations and asserts that its interpretation depends on cir-cumstances of time and place. By these means Nursi sought to meet thechallenge of Western rationalism and protect the Qur’anic message againstmodern materialism and positivism.29Nursi’s Risale was designed to substitute the Sufi tariqa mode of religios-ity, which he believed had become obsolete in the critical condition of themodern age. In a letter to his followers during one of his prison terms heexplains the relations between them:Someone who has a shaykh before entering the Risale-i Nur circlemay keep his shaykh or guide after entering it. But one who does nothave a shaykh beforehand, may only seek a guide within the circle.Moreover, the knowledge of reality taught within the circle of theRisale-i Nur, which gives the effulgence of the legacy of Prophet-hood, “the greater sainthood,” leaves no need for the Sufi ordersoutside that circle. Unless of course they be self-indulgent peoplewho misunderstand the way of Sufism, are addicted to pleasantdreams and imaginings, lights and spiritual pleasures, desire worldly,fanciful pleasures, which are different to the virtues of the Hereafter,and want a rank where people have recourse to them.30Still, Nursi fully acknowledged the Sufi-like inspiration of his work, par-ticularly under the spiritual influence of Jilani and Sirhindi. He also regardedhimself as heir to Khalid, and in 1940 he was proud to receive and wear thefrock bestowed by Khalid to one of his deputies.31 Through Sirhindi andKhalid, Nursi related himself to the Naqshbandi tradition of religiousrenewal, to which he added the task of employing new methods of explan-ation and new means of persuasion. He insisted, however, that it was Risale-inur rather than he himself who fulfilled this task.32 Realizing the importanceof print culture and the media for modern society, Nursi applied these meansto transform his “brotherhood” into a mass religious movement.33The Nurcu movement began to form in the 1920s, as faithful disciplescirculated manuscripts of the Risale in secret. The message spread at break-neck speed, gaining new momentum after the liberalization of 1950. Readingcircles known as dars ̧anes were organized to discuss Nursi’s ideas and pre-pare followers to take part in public debates on religion and science. As Nursidesignated no successor, after his death the movement was pluralized alongethnic, class and regional lines, though keeping a sense of collectiveidentity and moral orientation. It has no rites of initiation or an overall158THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"organizational structure. Nurcu branches compete over the interpretation ofthe text and in their contribution to the message. Having no authoritativeinterpretation, Nursi himself is depicted as friend (dost) rather than as themaster; each member is invited to be a religious authority to himself.Since the 1960s the Nurcu leaders have collaborated with the state in itsstruggle against both Communism and radical Islam. They have absorbedthe modern discourses of democracy, human rights and market economy,and are at the forefront of efforts at interfaith dialogue. Today the loosenetwork of Nurcu centers numbers more than five thousand, with around sixmillion members. Such centers have also been built in the Muslim republicsof Central Asia, among Turkish worker communities in Western Europe,and in the Balkans.34The most outstanding of the Nurcu circles is the movement of FethullahGülen. Popularly known as Hocaeffendi, Gülen (b. 1938) follows Nursi in hiswritings in combining religion and science, tradition and modernity. A nativeof Erzurum, the most influential personality in his early education was alocal Naqshbandi master. Gülen then moved to Izmir, where he worked asa teacher and preached in public places, developing his unique abilities as areligious-moral storyteller. The Fethullah Gülen distinguished itself from theoverall Nurcu movement in backing the military coup of 1980. It incorpor-ated an intricate network of businesses, which helped it build its ramifiededucational enterprise, with several universities and colleges, and a vastcommunication empire. Gülen advances state-centric Turkish nationalism,the free market, and educational work based on the Sufi-like ideals of discip-line, asceticism, and sacrifice. His new brand of Turkish Islam includes Turksof the Balkans and Central Asia, while being critical of the Arabs and Iran,who are blamed for creating a negative image of Islam. He is also opposed topolitical Islam as represented by the Welfare and its successor Virtue party,and eventually supported the deposition of Prime Minister Erbakan by thearmy in 1997.35Another Turkish missionary organization that descended from theNaqshbandi brotherhood but no longer considers itself as part of its trad-ition is the Sulaymançi. This organization was founded by the Mujaddidimaster Sulayman Hilmi Tunahan of Silistra (d. 1959), a deputy of Salahud-din Sirajuddin of Bukhara (d. 1927), who himself had received the path fromone of Ahmad Sirhindi’s descendants in Medina. Tunahan completed hisreligious studies in Istanbul and remained there as a preacher. His studentscame mostly from a rural background and were sent back to propagate thereligion in their villages. In the face of the Kemalist persecution Tunahandecided to discontinue his branch, but held on to some Naqshbandi tenets: asilent dhikr, solitude in the crowd, awareness in breathing, and watching thesteps. His son-in-law and heir, Kemal Kaçar (d. 2000), proceeded after himto consolidate the preachers’ work and created a worldwide administration.He was particularly successful among the Turkish émigrés in Germany,159THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"where the numerous local prayer circles were united in 1973 under TheIslamic Cultural Center in Köln. However, their attempt to get officialrecognition as a religious community arose much opposition on the partof the secular Turks of Germany, who set out to incriminate the organizationand brought about its resignation from the public sphere.36Today, the Sulaymançi is led from Istanbul by Tunahan’s grandson,Ahmad Arif Denizolgun. His work focuses on building boarding schools to“rescue the souls of Turkish children.” The organization has 350 centers allover Europe, the majority of them in Germany with 20,000 registered mem-bers. These are regarded as “civil servants in the service of Muhammad.”The Sulaymançi has developed a dual organization – spiritual and economic,and its followers constitute lay communities of brothers (ikhwan) with equalstatus and a common cause of spreading the message of Islam. In thesecommunities the Islamic precept of imitating the prophet is realized inpersonal conduct rather than in subsistence in God, as the Sufi pursuit ofspirituality gave way to the more worldly concern of renewing the religioussociety.37State and opposition in SyriaFollowing the rise of the Ba‘th to power in Syria in 1963, Naqshbandi mas-ters distinguished themselves both at the head of the religious establishmentof the country and in the Islamist opposition. As early as 1964 a Khalidimaster, Ahmad Kuftaru (d. 2004), was nominated by the new rulers asSyria’s Grand Mufti, a position that he was to hold until his death.38 OfKurdish extraction, Kuftaru was the son and successor of ‘Isa al-Kurdi’slatest deputy and imam of the Abu al-Nur mosque in north Damascus.39Concluding that only alliance with the authoritarian state could safeguardthe Islamic faith, Kuftaru showed servile loyalty to the Ba‘th despite thesectarian-heterodox provenance of its leaders. As a reward his branch,the Kuftariyya, was given a free hand and became the most powerfulbrotherhood in Syria.40During Hafiz al-Asad’s long presidency Kuftaru further extended hisactivities through the Abu al-Nur Islamic Foundation. He established a net-work of schools throughout Syria and exerted political influence. He alsoforged connections with Muslims of other countries; among his initiates wasWarith Deen Muhammad, the Afro-American leader of the American Mus-lim Mission. The Kuftariyya has a female wing led by a daughter of themaster, who cultivates her own following among educated Syrian women.41In accordance with the late master’s will, the leadership of the brotherhoodafter his death was passed down to his son, Salah al-Din al-Kuftaru, to beassisted by a consultative council.42Faithful to the reformist tradition of the Naqshbandiyya, Kuftaru soughtto adapt its path to the modern situation by propagating a learned and160THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"discreet form of Sufism based on the Qur’an and the Prophet’s example. Inthe face of the current fierce Salafi critique of Sufism, he eventually provedready to adopt much of the discourse of his rivals and, under the apparentinfluence of Nadwi, even to do away with the Sufi terminology in favor of astrictly Qur’anic vocabulary.43 On the other hand, in propagating Islamamong Westerners Kuftaru adopted an intentional ambiguity, as indicated inthe title of his official website – Abrahamic religions.44 While subscribing tothe orthodox position that Islam is the final and most perfect religion,Kuftaru also maintained that the three monotheistic religions stem from acommon source and even that all denominations are different traditionsof the one universal religion. On this basis he could engage in interfaithdialogue, take part in various conferences around the world and hostdelegations, especially of Christian clergymen, in his mosque.45A similar duality characterized Kuftaru’s attitude toward the funda-mentalist movement, as he clarified in one of his interviews:My relations with the generality of the Islamists are vast on both thelocal and international levels. They are maintained by cooperation,dialogue, mutual understanding and brotherhood . . . In the courseof my long experience I found that the Islamists generally follow oneof two directions: There is a minority of Islamists that work within afanatical partisan framework which rejects all others. From them,groups split off that adopt violence and radical positions becausethese are the values on which they were raised. But there is aPlate 9.5Ahmad Kuftaru meets Pope John II161THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"multitude of Islamists who work within the framework of the da‘wa(calling) to God in wisdom and good advice. They adopt positivemeans and keep away from disputes and doing wrong to others. Theyfollow the principle: let us cooperate in what we agree . . . and remainsincere in what we disagree. They strive to promote the intellectualsituation among the Muslims, relying of the science of shari‘a and itsintentions, and fulfill the duties of education, purification and jihadal-da‘wa.46The cultivation of the Kuftariyya by the Ba‘th regime seems to have beenprimarily designed to weaken the hold of the militant Islamic opposition ofnorthern Syria. This was attached to another branch of the Khalidiyya,which returned to Abu al-Nasr Khalaf of Homs (d. 1949). Khalaf, notunlike Jama‘at ‘Ali in India, took to extensive traveling in the towns andvillages of the north in an effort to attract new disciples. His success wasremarkable, turning the Naqshbandiyya into the most popular brotherhoodin the country. Some of Khalaf’s learned spiritual descendents who com-pleted their studies in Egypt in the 1930s and 1940s came under the influenceof Hasan al-Banna, and on their return were instrumental in founding localbranches of the Muslim Brothers Society. Most notable among these were‘Abd al-Fattah Abu-Ghudda of Aleppo (d. 1997) and Muhammad al-Hamidof Hama (d. 1969).47 Under the Ba‘th regime, Abu-Ghudda emerged as theleader of the Brothers’ militant northern faction, while Hamid’s follower,Sa‘id Hawwa (d. 1989), distinguished himself as the movement’s principalideologue.48Sufism permeates the entire oeuvre of Hawwa, who conceived of a grass-roots organization, a popular supra-brotherhood as it were, that would uniteall Islamic forces in the country and lead them in the struggle for religiousrevival in general, and against the secular tendencies of the Ba‘th in particu-lar.49 His scheme which, alluding to Sirhindi’s epithet as Imam Rabbani, hecalled the revival of the Rabbaniyya, consisted of four elements:1. Recollection of God. 2. Religious knowledge. 3. A supportiveenvironment. 4. Propagation and educational activity. Recollection isessential for reaching the spiritual stations of certainty and inherit-ance of the Prophetic state. Knowledge is a condition of the rab-baniyya . . . and it must be noted that the studies of the rabbaniyyunare many. A supportive environment so that the rabbani student willgrow in knowledge, deed, and spirituality. Sitting with the people ofknowledge and people of virtue enhances the rabbani student’sdesire to reach [the spiritual goal] . . . Propagation and educationalactivity is also a condition. The rabbani must transcend his selftoward reform by teaching, preaching, and enjoining good andforbidding evil.50162THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"President Asad’s brutal suppression of the Islamic uprising of Hama in1982 shattered any such scheme, leaving Kufatru’s accommodating collabor-ation the only alternative open before the Syrian Naqshbandis.Revival in UzbekistanSince the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 the Naqshbandiyya has re-surfaced as the most popular brotherhood in Central Asia in general,Uzbekistan in particular. Its revival was affected through local branches thatsurvived Soviet rule and foreign branches that gained a local following.Among the former is the Husayniyya branch, an orthodox and learned lin-eage of the Khafi type. Its leading masters are Ibrahimjan of Kokand, anerudite scholar and charismatic master with thousands of followers in eastUzbekistan, and his deputy Qurban ‘Ali, who is based in Tashkent andworks to spread the brotherhood in Kazakhstan and Russia. More mastersof this offshoot are located in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Other active off-shoots are the Jahri group in Andijan and various popular masters, whoadminister the tomb shrines of their ancestor saints, including that ofBaha’uddin Naqshband in Bukhara. Foreign masters from Turkey andPakistan who visited Central Asia after independence also acquired localfollowers, while Uzbek students in Turkey brought home the path of Res ̧idErol of Adyaman.State policies were no less a factor in the revival of the Central AsianNaqshbandiyya. In Tajikistan Sufi masters were allowed to join the party ofpolitical Islam and some of them were appointed to official positions. Thestand of the Uzbek government was more mixed. On the one hand, itenlisted Sufism in the construction of national identity. The Naqshbanditradition was presented as cherishing precious values such as work and dis-cipline, and was supported as a counterweight to militant Islam. Baha’ud-din’s mausoleum was accordingly rehabilitated and the 675th anniversary ofthe saint was celebrated in 1993 in the presence of the President of theRepublic. Mukhtar Abdullaev, the chief mufti and head of the SpiritualBoard of Uzbekistan in 1993–1997, was affiliated with the Naqshbandiyya,although, disturbingly reminiscent of the Soviet era, his servility apparentlysecured his promotion and he had neither Sufi knowledge nor disciples. Onthe other hand, the authorities have remained inimical to the tariqa form oforganization, and are wary of Naqshbandi political activism. The anti-religious campaign launched by the government after 1998 was conceived asa threat to all believing Muslims and resulted in a major uprising in theNaqshbandi-dominated Ferghana.51163THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Resistance in AfghanistanThe Naqshbandiyya was the most active of the Sufi brotherhoods in theresistance to the Communist coup and subsequent Soviet invasion ofAfghanistan in 1978–1979. Mobilization to jihad was carried largely withinthe traditional framework of Sufi networks among the Afghan tribes, andrelied on the habitual obedience of disciples to their masters. Especially inthe north of the country, Naqshbandi lodges became the hubs of resistanceuniting all local Islamic forces, though lack of efficient organization andmilitary coordination made it easy for the government to crush them. Mas-ters who were not killed or arrested fled the country, their lodges destroyed,and many of their disciples slain.52A representative of the traditional Naqshbandi camp is AkundzadaSayfurahman (b. 1928), scion of a Pashtun family of ulama who was in-troduced into the Mujaddidiyya and made deputy in Kunduz. He alsoclaimed to have Uwaysi permission to initiate disciples in the Qadiriyya andChishtiyya. “The pir of Kunduz” set about organizing and expanding hisbrotherhood, attracting followers from all over Afghanistan and evenneighboring Tajikistan. In 1978 he was forced to flee to Pakistan and joinedthe Islamic Revolutionary Movement, the leading organization of the earlyphase in the anti-Soviet jihad, which was headed by one of his deputies. Thismovement represented the ulama wing of the resistance which called for areturn to the shari‘a rather than demanding an Islamic state. Sayfurahmanmobilized fighters among his followers in north Afghanistan, many of whomperished in battle. With the demise of the Revolutionary Movement in 1982,he founded a lodge in the Northwest Frontier Province which, like Zindapir’slodge which wasn’t far away, became a center of a regional cult, and engagedin polemics against detractors of Sufism. Initially supportive of the mostlyPashtun Taliban, Sayfurahman distanced himself from them once he realizedtheir radical thrust.53Of more lasting impact on the Afghan resistance was the NationalLiberation Front of Sibghatullah Mujaddidi (b. 1925), a survivor of thedecimated Hazrat Shor Bazar family.54 Sibghatullah attended a secular high-school in Kabul, but opted for Islamic law. While completing his studies atal-Azhar, he became involved in the activities of the Egyptian MuslimBrothers and was arrested for a time. Upon his return to Afghanistan Sib-ghatullah became known as an ardent anti-Communist, and in 1959 wasjailed for an alleged conspiracy to assassinate Soviet President Khrushchevwhile on a state visit. At that stage he also became critical of the tariqaorganization of his family, maintaining that Hazrat Muhammad ‘Umar hadbeen the last actual master in the lineage.From 1973 to 1978 Sibghatullah lived in exile, first in Saudi Arabia andthen as head of the Islamic community in Denmark. Following the Com-munist takeover, he returned and established the headquarters of his front in164THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Peshawar, where he capitalized on the saintly authority of his family amongthe ulama and the tribes but also developed a more modern hierarchicalstructure. Constituting part of the moderate wing of the Afghan resistance,Sibghatullah was appointed head of the interim government in 1989 and firstPresident after the fall of the Communist regime in 1992. He was eclipsed bythe Taliban, but re-emerged after the demise of their regime, and today fillsvarious mediating roles under the presidency of Hamid Karazai, whohimself had apparently belonged to the National Liberation Front.55Adaptation in IndonesiaThe Khalidi and Mujaddidi masters spread over the Indonesian archipelagocame during the twentieth century under increasing attack. This derivedabove all from the Islamic modernist trend, which became extremely popularin Indonesia, more than in any other Muslim country. The Naqshbandiyyawas further weakened by the Saudi conquest of the Hijaz in 1925 and thesubsequent ban on Sufi activity in the Haramayn, which deprived it of itsprincipal source of legitimization and recruitment. Concomitantly the popu-lar base of the brotherhood was undermined by the emergence of massnationalist organizations, while the official nationalist philosophy of fiveprinciples (pancasila) adopted by the independent state after 1949 failed tomention Islam altogether. In consequence, many Naqshbandi masters weredriven onto the defensive, and into alliance with traditional religious forceswhich they had hitherto opposed. This was particularly the case in Java,where they joined the conservative organization of Nadwat al-Ulama inresponse to attacks by reformist societies such as the Muhammadiyya. Onthe other hand, we find a son of Jalaludin of Changking, the foremostNaqshbandi master of West Sumatra, editing the first modernist Malaymagazine and later as a leader of the Malay fundamentalist Salafiyya.These adverse circumstances notwithstanding, the Naqshbandiyya hasremained a viable force in Indonesian Islam, spreading to new regions of thecountry and forming various religious and political associations. Its foremostmaster after independence was Jalaluldin of Bukittinggi (d. 1977), who tookthe path in Mecca from Sulayman al-Zuhdi’s son. Around 1945 Jalaluldinfounded the Political Party of Tariqat Islam, which was joined by manyNaqshbandi masters. The party enjoyed the patronage of Indonesia’s firstpresident, Sukarno (1945–1967), as well as of Vice-President MuhammadHatta, whose grandfather was a Naqshbandi master. Jalaluldin had numer-ous deputies who spread the path in Java and Sumatra, to South Sulawesiand Kalimantan, and to Malaysia. In addition he authored more than 100pamphlets explaining and defending the path. Still, rival Naqshbandi mas-ters condemned him for his unconventional Qur’an exegesis, his assumptionof the title of Professor, and the ease with which he bestowed the path.56Other masters helped spread the brotherhood to regions in which hitherto165THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"it had been virtually absent. Muhsin ‘Ali al-Hinduan (d. 1980), an Arab fromMadura, propagated the Mazhari brotherhood among the local communitiesof the island and other ethnic minorities. Muda Wali introduced the Khalidipath into Acheh, on the northern tip of Sumatra, in the 1940s, and estab-lished there his own school. He strongly disapproved of the Achenese revoltof the 1950s, and the central government rewarded him by appointing hisfollowers to official and educational positions, which allowed them to spreadthe brotherhood still farther. More recently, within the general Islamicrevival of the 1980s and 1990s, Prof. Dr. Kadirun Yahya (d. 2002) dis-tinguished himself by attracting to the Naqshbandiyya upper and middleclass elements in Jakarta and other urban centers. A professor of physics andmathematics in the University of Medan, Yahya’s special blend of metaphys-ics and high mystical accomplishment with scientific knowledge provedparticularly appealing to university graduates and students.57The global settingThe information revolution of the late twentieth century, generally subsumedunder the title of globalization, has both posed dangers and offered newopportunities for the Sufi movement in general, and the Naqshbandiyya inparticular. It led to marginalization and at times disappearance of localbranches, while on the other hand allowing some masters to create networksand spread their message in new lands, including Western Europe and theUnited States. This extension was shared by many of the organizations dis-cussed in this chapter, such as the Indian Nadwat al-Ulama, which helpedfound the Oxford Center for Islamic Studies,58 the Iskenderpas ̧a group fromTurkey with its special ties in Australia, or the Kuftariyya brotherhood ofSyria, which is involved in interfaith dialogue and runs an affiliate college inBaltimore, Maryland.59 Other Naqshbandi groupings have substituted theirlocal bases for transnational activity, either within the framework ofthe brotherhood or through a radical transformation of the path and itsintegration into the New Age movement.The most visible among the contemporary Naqshbandi branches, andarguably Sufi brotherhoods at large, on the global scene is the Haqqaniyyabranch. Its founder and head is Nazim ‘Adil al-Haqqani (b. 1922),60 a Turk-ish Cypriot who travels constantly among his followers around the world.Haqqani was attracted to the Khalidiyya in the 1940s while studying chem-istry in Istanbul. Undertaking a journey through Syria, he encountered anumber of masters until in Damascus he joined ‘Abdallah Fa’iz al-Daghestani (1891–1973), whose lineage goes back to Imam Shamil’s mastersin the north Caucasus. In the circle of this master Haqqani met his Tatarwife Anna, a Naqshbandi mistress in her own right who until her recentdeath led the women’s wing of the brotherhood. Following Daghestani’sdeath Haqqani established a small community in Tripoli, Lebanon, then166THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"embroiled in a civil war, and forged a lifelong connection with the notableQabbani family. At that time the distinct features of his path came to thefore: avoidance of politics, sharp animosity toward the Muslim Brothers andIslamic fundamentalism, and a unique millenarian teaching.61Despite initial modest success, Haqqani came to believe that he had amission from the Prophet to spread the light of Islam throughout the world,including among Westerners. His first community in the West was foundedin 1972, during his master’s lifetime, or in 1974, shortly after his death, inLondon. Since then Haqqani established a tradition of spending the monthof Ramadan in that city, making it a focus of pilgrimage for admirers fromall over the world. His community has steadily grown, attracting three dis-tinct elements: South Asians impressed by the master’s charisma, ethnicTurks who regard him as a Sufi scholar able to interpret Islam for thoseliving in a modern secular environment, and Western converts seeking spirit-ual enlightenment. Haqqani’s preaching differs in accordance with the needsof the specific group he addresses. All his followers practice the loud dhikr,beginning with rabita (binding the heart) toward him. Among the Indiansthe ceremony is ecstatic in nature, while among Westerners it resembles aperformance in which women take active part.62 There are local groups inmany other British cities, most notably Birmingham and Sheffield.63Flexibility and openness in matters of doctrine and practice allowedHaqqani to extend his operations in the 1980s and 1990s to other Europeancountries and North America. Branches of the brotherhood were also estab-lished in the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia. These were integratedinto a transnational network of local Sufi centers, each engaged in edu-cational work, charity, and preaching of the message in accordance withlocal circumstances. The whole enterprise is supported by religious-mindedbusinessmen and politicians as well as technical experts in various fields, andit propagates itself through a line of publishing houses and magazines. Still,as Nielsen et al. have observed in their fieldwork, “the tariqa only fully existswhere Shaykh Nazim is . . . at all normal times, i.e. when Shaykh Nazim isnot visiting, it is the autonomy of the local group that is most characteristicof the tariqa.”64 In USA during the 1990s Hisham al-Kabbani, Haqqani’sson-in-law and deputy in the western hemisphere, founded Naqshbandi cen-ters in twenty-three states and opened an office in Washington DC. Adaptingto the American system, he uses capitalistic marketing strategies and themedia, including a strong presence on the Internet, to propagate the religionamong both Muslims and non-Muslims. Here one can learn about whatHaqqanis regard as Islam in general and about the Haqqani lineage in par-ticular, as well as buy books, cassettes, rosaries and perfumes in America andworldwide.65Nazim al-Haqqani’s teachings reflect a successful adaptation of theNaqshbandi combination of orthodoxy and activism to the era of globaliza-tion. More than three decades of work in the West has not changed the167THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"basically conservative outlook that the master had developed in his earlydays in Syria and Lebanon. Haqqani regards the twentieth century as thecentury of unbelief and atheism, and Western civilization as the acme ofbarbarity. He rejects modern philosophy and science, and describes the uni-versities as a tool in the hands of Jews and Christians to distract MuslimsPlate 9.6The Haqqani homepage168THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"from their faith. He is particularly opposed to humanism for placing man atthe center at the expense of God, and to liberalism, which he views as thereason for the rising rates of divorce.Politically, Haqqani wishes to see the Ottoman Caliphate restored. Hedenounces the Turkish Republic for its secularism and depicts MustafaKemal not as Atatürk (father of the Turks) but as the anti-Christ, who soldout their country to the West. Democracy for Haqqani is but a foolish idea,since power derives from God and not from the people. Still, he believes thatpractically one should respect the legitimate authority of his state. Finally,Haqqani shows unbridled animosity to all forms of “Wahhabism,” a termwhich for him denotes the enemy of Islam within and the source of all itspresent troubles. The anti-Sufi Wahhabis cause people to flee Islam, and sullyits name in the eyes of Europeans and Americans. In one of his discoursesHaqqani explains:I was reading an article in a newspaper. The editor is saying: “I amfearing the sword of Islam.” What an innocent, square-head editor.She is saying this and she is not fearing the atom and hydrogenbombs and missiles? Ma Sha Allah! You may defend yourself againsta sword but not against a rocket, that may kill hundreds and thou-sands of people in a second. They are showing Islam in a bad way.The wildest creature for the non-Muslim is a Muslim. Blame forMuslims that they make this fundamentalism and do everythingagainst Shariat-u-llah and make Islam to be blamed. You are cominghere from European countries. You know what is happening there.People are not looking to you with good eyes, but they think that youare like wolves, wild animals, that may kill and eat them. That imageis coming to the whole Muslim world through no mind Muslims,that have studied and have been prepared in Europe, in Westerncountries. Then they come to the East and do what Christians aredoing, and make Islam in such a hated vision. Therefore now theIslamic world is also going to be cleaned. Allah Almighty is asking toclean Muslim countries from those bad ones who act against Islam.They must be killed and taken away. And S. Mehdi a.s. is only com-ing for that.66In this spirit, Kabbani did not hesitate to declare in 1999 before the USState Department and on other occasions that most Muslim organizations inAmerica were extremist and called for violence. These comments evoked anuproar among the American Muslim leadership. Haqqani activities wereboycotted while some went so far as to claim that Kabbani is a Zionistagent.67As against such strict orthodox stances, on the practical level Haqqaniemploys a strategy of accommodation. This is demonstrated not only in the169THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"use of modern communication technology, but also in his openness to allpeople, Muslims as well as non-Muslims, in his flexible attitude to theobservance of the religious Law, and in his tolerance of women in thebrotherhood. On some issues Haqqani comes closer to contemporary West-ern critiques of modernity, such as New Age spirituality and the pro-environment Greens. His pluralistic attitude was exemplified in his visit in1999 to Glastonbury, the center of alternative spirituality in Britain. Here hecalled people to aim for eternity without regard to their religion, and associ-ated himself with the local Christian tradition that Jesus had visited theplace. Subsequently a Haqqani community was established in the town,engaging itself in holding dhikr meetings, which include musical perform-ances and even the Mevlevi whirling dance, and “Sufi meditation”workshops.68Accommodation is no less manifest in Haqqani’s unique millenarianteachings. He believes that the coming of the Mahdi is imminent and giveshis followers the impression that he is in constant spiritual connection withhim. His vision combines traditional Muslim eschatological ideas withChristian-universal symbols and is updated in accordance with internationaldevelopments – the Gulf War, the collapse of Communism, or the year 2000.At that time England will peacefully convert to Islam, hidden saints willoperate in Germany and China, America will impose a global peace before athird world war will erupt around Turkey, to be concluded by a reign of loveand peace precipitating the Day of Judgment.69Other Naqshbandi groupings that have done well on the global level comefrom the non-orthodox margins of the tradition. Such is the Golden SufiCenter based in California. The center was founded by Irina Tweedie (d.1999), who had been attracted to the Hindi Naqshbandi-Mujaddidi brother-hood while on a trip to India in 1959. Her experiences along the path wererecorded in a spiritual diary, which was later published. After the death ofher master in 1966 Tweedie returned to England and began to guide disciplesin Europe and the USA.70 Her deputy and present head of the center,Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee (b. 1953), has remained loyal to the Hindi Naqsh-bandi tradition, combining it with a Jungian-type psychological dream work.He is a distinguished participant in the Sufi conference, which has convenedannually since 2001, “to create space where people could experience thedifferent forms of Sufism.”71Even remoter from the Naqshbandi tradition is the Subud movement,which is defined by its leaders as “a symbol of the possibility for mankind tofollow the right way of living.” This is one of the hundreds of syncretisticmystical movements that have flourished in post-colonial Indonesia. Itsfounder, the Javan Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo (d. 1987), popu-larly called Bapak (father), developed a special spiritual exercise of free-stylemeditation that is intended to lead to purification of body and soul and toawareness of God. Although Bapak tended to downplay spiritual influences170THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"on his shaping, much of his terminology and methods were derived from aNaqshbandi master named Abdurachman, his most important spiritualguide. Subud began to spread slowly in Java in the 1930s and, through theagency of a British disciple, was carried in the mid-1950s to England. Today,centers of the movement operate in more than eighty countries in the Eastand West.72171THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"NOTES1 THE CORE AND CONTOURS OF A SUFI BROTHERHOOD1 The most comprehensive overview of the Naqshbandiyya to date is Hamid Algar,“A Brief History of the Naqshbandi Order,” in Naqshbandis, 3–44.2 Muhammad Amin ibn ‘Abidin, Radd al-muhtar ‘ala al-durr al-mukhtar sharhtanwir al-absar fi fiqh madhhab al-imam al-a‘zam Abi Hanifa al-Nu‘man (8 vols.,1966–1969), 3: 295.3 Qur’an 33: 41–42.
