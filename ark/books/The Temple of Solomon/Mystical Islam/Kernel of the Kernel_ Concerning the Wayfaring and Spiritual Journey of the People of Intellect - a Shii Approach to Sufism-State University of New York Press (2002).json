This book is in fact perhaps the first of its kind to appear in the Eng-lish language. In order to understand what intellectual strand this work rep-resents, it is necessary to delve in a general way into the different manifesta-tions of Islamic esoteric teachings. The first and best-known crystallizationof the inner or esoteric teachings of the Islamic revelation is of course Su-fism, which has produced a vast treasury of writings ranging from practicaladvice to the lives of saints, from ethical treatises to poetry and from shortaphorism and letters to didactic works dealing with Islamic metaphysics,cosmology, psychology, and eschatology along with a number of other sub-jects. This latter category of writings is associated especially with the intel-lectual teachings of Sufism, dealing as it does with unitive knowledgeknown as gnosis or ⁄irf ̄an/ma ⁄rifah. Its greatest expositor was Ibn ⁄Arab ̄ ımany of whose works as well as those belonging to his school have nowbeen translated and studied in many European languages, especially Eng-lish and French.A second crystallization of Islamic esoteric teachings is to be found inIsm ̄a⁄ ̄ ıl ̄ ı philosophical and theological writings which, despite their specialcolor associated with a particular branch of Sh ̄ ı⁄ism, contain many teach-ings drawn also from the universal sources of Islamic esoterism. In fact his-torically Ism ̄a⁄ ̄ ılism was close to Sufism both in its origin and during its laterhistory after the Mongol invasion when at least in Persia Ism ̄a⁄ ̄ ılism ap-peared often in the dress of Sufism and there appeared Ism ̄a⁄ ̄ ıl ̄ ı commen-taries to well known Sufi works. During the Q ̄aj ̄ar period some of theIsm ̄a⁄ ̄ ıl ̄ ıIm ̄ams even received Sufi initiation. This category of writings isalso known in the West and many translations and studies of Ism ̄a⁄ ̄ ıl ̄ ı doc-trinal works have appeared in various European languages over the years."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"A third category is Twelve-Im ̄am ̄ ı Sh ̄ ı⁄ite gnosis ( ⁄irf ̄an-i sh ̄ ı⁄ ̄ ı),which has produced a vast body of works many, but not exclusively, inPersian, by such figures as Sayyid ÒHaydar ̄Amul ̄ ı, Ibn Turkah, FayÓdK ̄ash ̄an ̄ı, and Q ̄aÓd ̄ ı Sa⁄ ̄ ıd Qumm ̄ ı, not to speak of mystical philosophersand theosophers who combined philosophy and gnosis, such as Mull ̄aÓSadr ̄a and his followers during the past few centuries and down to ourday, including ÒH ̄ajj ̄ ı Mull ̄a H ̄ad ̄ ı Sabzaw ̄ar ̄ ı, who lived in the Q ̄aj ̄ar pe-riod, as well as many of the philosopher-gnostics of the present century.In fact, as far as Persia is concerned, the School of Tehran founded at theend of the eighteenth century, with the advent of the Q ̄aj ̄ars, possessedtwo branches from the beginning: one devoted to philosophy especially ofthe School of Mull ̄a ÓSadr ̄a and the second to pure Islamic esoterism in theform of gnosis. This latter school was founded by Sayyid RaÓd ̄ ı L ̄ar ̄ ıj ̄an ̄ıwho was given the title M ̄alik al-B ̄aÓtin, the “Possessor of the Esoteric,”and was the teacher of the most famous gnostic of the thirteenth/nine-teenth century in Persia, MuÓhammad RiÓd ̄a Qumsha‹ ̄ ı, called the Ibn⁄Arab ̄ ı of his day, who was followed by figures distinguished by their mas-tery of Ibn ⁄Arabian gnosis, and Islamic esoteric teaching in general, suchas M ̄ırz ̄a NaÓ s ̄ ır G ̄ ıl ̄an ̄ı, M ̄ır Sayyid Shih ̄ab al-D ̄ ın Nayr ̄ ız ̄ı, M ̄ırz ̄a AÓhmad ̄Ashtiy ̄an ̄ı, and three of my own most eminent teachers in the traditionalsciences, Sayyid Muhammad K ̄a ̄zim ⁄AÓsÓs ̄ar, MuÓhyi al-D ̄ ın Mahd ̄ ı Il ̄ah ̄ ıQumsha‹ ̄ ı, and Sayyid Muhammad ÒHusayn ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı. The teachings ofthe latter figure constitutes the original material for this present work. Tothis list must also be added a number of figures well versed in ⁄irf ̄anbutcelebrated more in other domains, such as jurisprudence and politics, in-cluding Ayatoll ̄ah Khumayn ̄ ı whose commentaries on the works of Ibn⁄Arab ̄ ı are well known in Persia and have now gained some fame in theWest.The writings of the figures in the field of gnosis cited here are not,for the most part, known in the West although they are now gaining someattention in the outside world, thanks to the efforts of Henry Corbin anda number of other scholars. In Persia, at least as a result of religio-politicaltensions between the later ÓSafavid religious scholars and the establishedSufi orders, especially the Ni ⁄matall ̄ah ̄ ı, the term “Sufi” became anathemain Sh ̄ ı⁄ite religious circles and the term “gnosis” or ⁄irf ̄an, came to replacetaÓsawwufin many contexts. While during earlier periods as leading aSh ̄ ı⁄ite scholar as Sayyid ÒHaydar ̄Amul ̄ ı identified himself openly with Su-fism, from the latter part of the eleventh/seventeenth century onward theFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage xivxivForeword"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Sh ̄ ı⁄ite ⁄ulam ̄a’ distanced themselves for the most part from ordinary Su-fism, which they referred to as taÓsawwuf-i kh ̄anaq ̄ah ̄ ı(literary Sufism asso-ciated with Sufi centers). Moreover, this parting of ways did not includeonly those exoteric ⁄ulam ̄a’who were opposed to the esoteric as such butalso those who were attracted to the esoteric and who were in fact in-wardly totally immersed in the world of Sufi gnosis, associating them-selves with the works of the great Sufi masters such as Ibn ⁄Arab ̄ ı, R ̄um ̄ ı,and J ̄am ̄ ı.The question arises concerning the source of esoteric knowledge ofthese men all of whom were pious and many of whom were saintly. Didtheir knowledge involve only theoretical learning? Were they led by theHidden Im ̄am and/or the mysterious Prophet KhaÓdir? Did they have ahuman master and receive initiation and spiritual guidance as is the casewith Sufism? These question have been debated a great deal concerningsuch famous figures as Mull ̄a ÓSadr ̄a, as well as others. I remember dis-cussing this issue for years with Corbin concerning Mull ̄a ÓSadr ̄a. Corbinbelieved that he had no human teacher whereas I believed and still believethat he had a human teacher who initiated him into the knowledge of theDivine Mysteries (asr ̄ar-i il ̄ah ̄ ı).In any case, most scholars dealing with the Sh ̄ ı⁄ite world believe thatin addition to the Sufi orders, such as the Dhahab ̄ ı and Ni⁄matall ̄ah ̄ ı whichare kh ̄anaq ̄ah ̄ ıand similar to the great Sufi orders in the Sunni world withtheir regular initiatic chain (silsilah)linking master to disciple over the cen-turies and reaching back to the origin of the Qur‹ ̄anic revelation, there isalso the general esoteric aspect of Sh ̄ ı⁄ism that bestows a gnostic characteron certain Sh ̄ ı⁄ite works as well as the presence of spiritual guidance by theIm ̄ams, especially the Twelfth in the case of at least a number of figurespossessing esoteric knowledge of the highest order.What has not been studied seriously until now is the presence withinTwelve-Im ̄am ̄ ı Sh ̄ ı⁄ism of a fourth category, which includes those who be-long to an initiatic chain linking master to disciple but without the formalorganization that characterizes the well-known Sufi orders. This chain maybe called a Sufisilsilah,without the name Sufi, but involving regular trans-mission of initiatic power, spiritual direction, spiritual practices and thelike all resembling Sufism. Such lines of transmission were preserved in se-cret mostly among the class of Sh ̄ ı⁄ite ⁄ulam ̄a’and are the reason for the ap-pearance of a number of eminent gnostics and saints belonging to the⁄ulam ̄a’class. A somewhat similar situation may be said to exist in the SunniFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage xvForewordxv"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"world, for example, at al-Azhar University where there is a very secretbranch of the Naqshbandiyyah Order tailored especially for the ⁄ulam ̄a’ofthat eminent Sunni center of learning.This regular chain of transmission in Sh ̄ ı⁄ism was and remains veryhidden. Its methods and disciplines are taught only orally and those whoare its masters select a few among their usually large number of religiousstudents to initiate them into this path of spiritual perfection parallel withteaching them the major texts of theoretical ⁄irf ̄an. In the various religiousschools (Óhawzahs)of the Sh ̄ ı⁄ite world, whether it be in Persia, Iraq, Pak-istan, India, or elsewhere a number of students advance enough to be ac-cepted in classes in which the works of Ibn ⁄Arab ̄ ı, ÓSadr al-D ̄ ın Qunaw ̄ ı,and others are taught. But not all students who reach these levels; eventhose who study the most advanced texts, such as the MiÓsb ̄aÓh al-unsof al-Fan ̄ar ̄ ı, are permitted into the inner circle of initiates. In order to receiveinitiation there is also the necessity of the presence in the being of the dis-ciple of spiritual virtue, spiritual will (himmah), a deep yearning for theDivine and thirst for the realization of metaphysical knowledge.The book of ⁄All ̄amah ÓTihr ̄an ̄ı is a fruit of this hidden tree of Islamicesoterism. Being itself a recension of the oral teachings of his master⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı, the work is a fine example of the kind of writingwhich, in the context of Sh ̄ ı⁄ite traditions and commentaries upon theQur‹ ̄an, discuss the stages of the spiritual path and reveal glimpses of thatunitive knowledge that lies at the end of that path. An earlier example ofsuch a work is the Sayr wa sul ̄uk(“Spiritual Wayfaring”) by the eminentQ ̄aj ̄ar religious scholar and authority on esoteric knowledge BaÓhr al-⁄ul ̄um,who was also a master of this secret and hidden esoteric chain. ⁄All ̄amahÓTihr ̄an ̄ı himself mentions his esoteric teachers whose chain can be summa-rized as in the chart that follows.All these figures were eminent teachers in Persia and Iraq and re-spected highly as not only religious scholars, but also as saintly men tosome of whom miracles were attributed. But only those who were initiatedand guided inwardly by them became aware of their inner reality and wereable to gain access to the treasury of Divine Mysteries whose keys they held.I studied for some twenty years with ⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı and became awarethrough him of the rigorous spiritual discipline that “their path” requiredand also of the inner reality of at least one of the masters of this “hiddenÓtar ̄ ıqah.” He once told me that he had studied the FuÓs ̄uÓsof Ibn ⁄Arab ̄ ı foryears in Persia and thought that he knew this central work of Sufi gnosisFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage xvixviForeword"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"well before he set out to continue his studies in Najaf. Once in that city hedecided to attend the private lessons being given by M ̄ırz ̄a ⁄Al ̄ ıQ ̄aÓd ̄ ı on theFuÓs ̄uÓs. The venerable and saintly ⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı told me that duringthe first hour of the course his whole state (Óh ̄al) began to change and heheard the walls of the room echoing Shaykh al-Akbar’s words. He realizedthat until then he had only known the outward meaning of the words ofthe text and was only now beginning to understand what they reallymeant. The master later initiated the young ⁄All ̄amah, who began to un-dergo, parallel with his formal studies, rigorous spiritual discipline withlong fasts of silence that affected his presence for the rest of his life. Onecould not be in his presence, even when he was teaching, without experi-encing something of the holy silence from which all words worthy of thename proceed and to which they all return.While teaching at Qum for over thirty years, ⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ıtaught regular courses on Ibn S ̄ ın ̄a’s Shif ̄a‹ and Mull ̄a ÓSadr ̄a’sAsf ̄ar. Onweekends he taught a smaller number of students in a private gatheringtexts of⁄irf ̄an,such as the works of Ibn ⁄Arab ̄ ı and Ibn Turkah. Then hehad an even more select circle of students who were initiated into the mys-teries of gnosis and spiritual wayfaring.

The work represents therefore the moreesoteric aspect of the teachings of ⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı whose other workson the Qur‹ ̄an, Sh ̄ ı⁄ism, and Islamic philosophy are well known, some al-ready translated into English. This work in fact reveals the inner aspect ofthe teachings of one of the greatest Islamic scholars of the twentieth centuryand is also the first specimen of this kind of writing, belonging to the hid-den initiatic line already mentioned, that has been rendered into English.For historical reasons a word must also be said about MurtaÓd ̄aMuÓtahhar ̄ ı, for whom ⁄All ̄amah ÓTihr ̄an ̄ı wrote the introduction to thiswork. MuÓtahhar ̄ ı was one of the most gifted students of ⁄All ̄amahÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı, and a close friend of mine with whom I participated in manyintellectual and religious endeavors. He possessed a keen philosophicalmind but was also an activist. ⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı wanted him to be lessactive outwardly and devote more time to serious philosophical studiesand contemplation. MuÓtahhar ̄ ı had written a commentary on the firstthree books of ⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı’s UÓs ̄ul-i falsafa-yi ri‹ ̄alizm(“The Prin-ciples of the Philosophy of Realism”) but years had passed and he had notsucceeded in finishing the commentary claiming always that he was toobusy. One day when both of us were in his presence, ⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ıturned to me without looking at MuÓtahhar ̄ ı and said, “Please tell ̄Aq ̄aMurtaÓd ̄a [i.e., MuÓtahhar ̄ ı] to make fewer speeches and devote more time tointrospection and to finish the commentary.” But the word of the masterwas to no avail and despite his closeness to his teacher, MuÓtahhar ̄ ı showedlittle interest in a more contemplative life and in the master’s esotericteachings. Early in the 1960s, however, he was arrested and imprisoned for acouple of months. Prisoners were allowed to ask for books and the firstwork that he asked his family to bring to him was the Mathnaw ̄ ıof R ̄um ̄ ı.Once out of prison, he told me how fruitful and calming that period hadbeen and that an opening had been created in his soul for philosophicalcontemplation and particularly ⁄irf ̄an in both its aspect of theory (naÔzar)and practice ( ⁄amal). Outwardly he continued to have an active life, whichwas to lead to direct political participation in the tumultuous events of1978 and finally to his tragic assassination in 1979. But inwardly he contin-ued to be drawn ever more to the esoteric tradition and the inner teachingsof ⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı, summarized in this short but pithy work, the Lubbal-lub ̄ab,which is truly the kernel of the kernel of the fruit of revelationand which is given a title that is also used by Ibn ⁄Arab ̄ ı in one of his well-Faghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage xviiixviiiForeword"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"known works. Something of the inner transformation of the late MurtaÓd ̄aMuÓtahhar ̄ ı is also present in this work and his spirit seems to have inspiredhis old friend ⁄All ̄amah ÓTihr ̄an ̄ı to compile the work in its present form.Something also needs to be said in this preface about ⁄All ̄amahÓTihr ̄an ̄ı himself. The publication of his complete works in recent years re-veals his astonishing output in both quantity and diversity. His worksrange from those dealing with the Qur‹ ̄an, Im ̄amology, eschatology, andother theological issues to those concerned with the esoteric and mysticaldimensions of Islam. In contrast to his teacher ⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı, whorefused to write on current events and politics in the ordinary sense of theterm, ⁄All ̄amah ÓTihr ̄an ̄ı also wrote on contingent problems posed in theearly years of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, resulting in certain assertionsthat were to be challenged and opposed later by other religious authoritiesin Persia itself. This aspect of his work belongs precisely to the realm ofcontingency and is quite dated but it should not in any way cast a shadowon the vast body of traditional studies that he has left behind and that rep-resents one of the most imposing bodies of scholarly works produced by asingle author in the Islamic world during this century. Also the fact that⁄All ̄amah ÓTihr ̄an ̄ı was so encyclopedic in the scope of his knowledge didnot in any way detract from the depth of his scholarship and understand-ing. He exemplifies a case of a whole category of Islamic writers going backto F ̄ar ̄ab ̄ ı, Ibn S ̄ ın ̄a, and NaÓ s ̄ ır al-D ̄ ın ÒT ̄us ̄ ı, for whom extension ofbreadth did not mean in any sense the loss of depth.Aside from its historical and theological significance, theLubb al-lub ̄ab or Kernel of the Kernel stands by itself as a masterpiece in the field ofspirituality and gnosis. While naturally couched in the language and ter-minology of the Qur‹ ̄an and ÒHad ̄ ıth, it conveys a message of a universalorder meant for all human beings. It is a significant work not only becauseit makes known in the English language a hitherto unknown current of Is-lamic esoterism and gnosis. It is significant most of all because it deals withthe deepest metaphysical and spiritual realities, which should attract allthose persons, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, who are in quest of thespiritual treasures hidden within the inner teachings of revelation that alsolie deep within that primordial human nature which, although now hid-den and difficult of access to most men, still constitutes the very center ofour being.—Seyyed Hossein NasrFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage xixForewordxix"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Faghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage xx blank"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR’S INTRODUCTIONThe text that is presented in the following pages is one of the most impor-tant books written on Sufism from an Iranian-Sh ̄ ı⁄ite point of view in thetwentieth century.

Finally, the book demon-strates the meaning of the concept ofwal ̄ayat(Arabic Wa l ̄ayah) and therole of the Sh ̄ ı⁄ite Im ̄ams in transmitting esoteric knowledge and truthsabout tawÓh ̄ ıd(Divine Unity), their part in the Sh ̄ ı⁄ites’ spiritual life, andthe place of the Ahl al-Bayt(Household) of the Blessed Prophet of Islam inthe spiritual journey toward God.The Lubb al-Lub ̄abis in fact a product of love and the labor of twoscholars. ̄Ayatull ̄ah ⁄All ̄amah Sayyid Muhammad ÒHusayn ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı wasone of the most prominent Iranian ⁄ulam ̄aof the twentieth century and aprofessor of Islamic philosophy, jurisprudence, ethics, and gnosis in themadrasahsor seminaries of Qum for over thirty-seven years.

His spiritual life as well as his schol-arly achievements have been studied extensively in Persian and English inrecent years and need no further introduction.1The Lubb al-Lub ̄ab was originally a series of lectures that the⁄All ̄amah delivered to a select group of his students and disciples in Qumbetween 1368 ../1949 and 1369/1950. ̄Ayatull ̄ah Sayyid MuhammadÒHusayn Tihr ̄an ̄ı, who was then twenty-five years old and one of ⁄All ̄amahÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı’s most brilliant students, took extensive notes while he lec-tured.

Little is written aboutMuhammad ÓS ̄adiq’s life and career during the reign of RiÓd ̄a Sh ̄ah(1925–1941). There is much evidence, however, which points to his activeinvolvement in open oppositional activity against RiÓd ̄a Sh ̄ah’s govern-ment. Several observers, including ⁄All ̄amah Tihr ̄an ̄ı himself, testify thatlike many other members of the clergy, ̄Ayatull ̄ah Muhammad ÓS ̄adiqstrongly opposed secularization and Westernization of Iran. He was par-ticularly active in organizing and leading the government’s opponents inTehran against the law for unifiormity of dress introduced in December1928/1307 (solar), and the law for the abolition of women’s veil promul-gated in 1935/1314 (solar).

Tihr ̄an ̄ıstayed in Najaf for seven years, during which time he studied with ̄Ayatull ̄ahs ̄Aq ̄a Buzurg Tihr ̄an ̄ı, Sayyid MaÓhm ̄ud Sh ̄ahr ̄ud ̄ ı, Sayyid Abul-Q ̄asim Khu‹ ̄ ı, Shaykh ÒHusayn ÒHill ̄ ı, and several other scholars.4Several scholars and gnostics played important roles in ⁄All ̄amahTihr ̄an ̄ı’s spiritual life. As Tihr ̄an ̄ı himself has stated, his first teacher andspiritual guide was ⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı, who initiated Tihr ̄an ̄ı into gnosis( ⁄irf ̄an), took him under his spiritual guidance, and closely supervised hiswayfaring and spiritual advancement while he was studying in Qum. Untilthe end of his life, Tihr ̄an ̄ı constantly admired ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı and acknowl-edged his role in his intellectual and spiritual achievements. Thus, whenTihr ̄an ̄ı left Qum for Najaf, he had already started wayfaring and pursuingan active spiritual life.5During the years in Najaf, as ⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı had instructedhim, Tihr ̄an ̄ı was to seek guidance in spiritual matters only from ̄Ayatull ̄ah⁄A b b ̄as Q ̄uch ̄an ̄ı and whomever he deemed appropriate. ̄Ayatull ̄ahQ ̄uch ̄an ̄ı taught Tihr ̄an ̄ı further details and theoretical principles( ̄zaw ̄ahir)of the doctrine.

In that sameyear he met the great master. The young Tihr ̄an ̄ı’s soul was totally capturedby the spiritual eminence and charisma of Sayyid H ̄ashim ÒHadd ̄ad.6Tihr ̄an ̄ı’s acquaintance with Sayyid H ̄ashim ÒHadd ̄ad had a profoundimpact on his scholarly and spiritual life. From his first meeting withÒHadd ̄ad, the young Tihr ̄an ̄ı’s soul was greatly transformed. In ÒHadd ̄ad,Tihr ̄an ̄ı found a sincere Muslim, and a great spiritual master and guidewho had passed from the realm of multiplicity and was completely annihi-lated in Divine Unity (tawÓh ̄ ıd):. . . Sayyid H ̄ashim ÒHadd ̄ad was so absorbed in Divine Unity(tawÓh ̄ ıd) that words cannot describe his station and his personal-ity. He was beyond description and comprehension. He was oneof the most powerful figures in spiritual journeying who hadpassed beyond the realm of angels (malak ̄ut),had reached therealm of Divine Names (l ̄ah ̄ut) and Divine Invincibility(jabar ̄ut)and had been totally annihilated in the Divine Essence.7One can hardly exaggerate the impact that ÒHadd ̄ad had on Tihr ̄an ̄ı’sspiritual life. In R ̄uÓh-i mujarrad,Tihr ̄an ̄ı has described in detail ÒHadd ̄ad’sspiritual station and the way he trained his disciples in spiritual matters.Suffice it to mention that after acquaintance with ÒHadd ̄ad until the mas-ter’s death, Tihr ̄an ̄ı made considerable advancement on the path, to suchan extent that ÒHadd ̄ad honored Tihr ̄an ̄ı by granting him the title of“Sayyid al-ÒT ̄ai‹fatayn,”Master of two peoples (i.e., scholars and gnostics).8After seven years studying in Najaf and benefiting from SayyidH ̄ashim ÒHadd ̄ad’s presence and instructions, the master advised him to goback to Tehran. Despite his own desire, Tihr ̄an ̄ı reluctantly returned toIran and began his career as teacher, prayer leader, and orator in the Q ̄a‹immosque in Tehran. In the meantime, by ÒHadd ̄ad’s recommendation,Tihr ̄an ̄ı took spiritual guidance from Shaykh Muhammad Jaw ̄ad AnÓ s ̄ar ̄ ı,another prominent master who lived in the city of Hamad ̄an in westernIran.9For the next twenty-two years, Tihr ̄an ̄ı visited Najaf and other shrinecities in Iraq regularly and greatly benefited from association with ÒH ̄ajjSayyid H ̄ashim ÒHadd ̄ad. At the same time, he devoted most of his time andeffort to preaching and spreading the principles of traditional Isl ̄am as wellas teaching and training students who came to him from different parts ofthe country.

Some ofthese speeches were published later in Tehran or Mashhad.9Sayyid Muhammad ÒHusayn ÒHusayn ̄ı was a traditional scholar in thetrue sense of the term, and highly respected in scholarly and religious cir-cles in Tehran, Qum and Mashhad. Like his teacher and mentor, ⁄All ̄amahÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı, Tihr ̄an ̄ı can be considered a student of the school of MuÓhy ̄ ı al-D ̄ ın ibn al-⁄Arab ̄ ı, while at the same time being greatly influenced and in-spired by the ideas and writings ofÓSadr al-D ̄ ın Sh ̄ ır ̄az ̄ ı (Mull ̄a ÓSadr ̄a).

Frequently in his writings, Tihr ̄an ̄ı re-ferred to these thinkers and philosophers. In addition, he used verses fromthe Qur‹ ̄an extensively. Like ⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı, he uses the same tech-nique of commenting on and interpreting each verse with the help ofother verses. As Thir ̄an ̄ı states, this approach is based on certain aÓh ̄ad ̄ ıthofthe Prophet and raw ̄ay ̄at(narrations) of the Sh ̄ ı⁄ ̄ ı Im ̄ams, as well as on theNahj al-Bal ̄aghahof Im ̄am ⁄Al ̄ ı ibn Ab ̄ ı ÒT ̄alib:“Verily, some verses of the Qur‹ ̄an interpret and comment onsome others.”and,The Book of All ̄ah is the one by which you can see the Truth, saythe Truth and hear the Truth. Some of its verses interpret otherverses, some are witness and reason for others. The Qur‹ ̄an con-tains no contradictions in the affairs of All ̄ah and does not sepa-rate from All ̄ah whoever adheres to its injunctions.10Another feature of Tihr ̄an ̄ı’s writings is his dealing with social, politi-cal, historical, moral, and philosophical issues, in addition to purely reli-gious and metaphysical ones.

He wrote on meta-physics and a variety of Islamic subjects and expanded greatly our scope ofunderstanding the relationship between Sh ̄ ı⁄ism and Sufism. His writingsare characterized by their lucidity, originality and depth, and are indicativeof his mastery of the Qur‹ ̄an, Sh ̄ ı⁄ism, Sufism, and Persian and Arabıc lit-erature. His spiritual orientation and his esoteric ideas were particularly in-fluenced by teachings and instructions given to him by H ̄ashim ÒHadd ̄ad,as well as ⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı and Muhammad Jaw ̄ad AnÓ s ̄ar ̄ ı.

His devotion to theseSufi poets and thinkers is well reflected in his writings where he frequentlypresents relevant examples from their works. However, he was more out-spoken than his teachers in criticizing the opponents of Sufism. ̄Ayatull ̄ah ÒHusayn ̄ı Tihr ̄an ̄ı was a teacher, eloquent speaker, and pro-lific writer. He wrote, edited, and translated numerous works on differentaspects of Isl ̄am, Sh ̄ ı⁄ism, Sufism, eschatology and other related subjects.Like his teacher, Tihr ̄an ̄ı’s contributions to Islamic studies and gnosisearned him the honorable title of⁄Al l ̄amah while he was still alive. Notonly do these writings reflect the depth of his knowledge and mastery ofphilosophy, jurisprudence, theosophy, Sh ̄ ı⁄ism and the holy Qur‹ ̄an, theyare also indicative of the purity of his heart, faith, sincerity and genuineyearning for knowledge and truth.Another aspect of ⁄All ̄amah Tihr ̄an ̄ı’s life that has not been examinedto this day is his interest in politics and his participation in political activ-ity during the two decades that preceded the Islamic Revolution of 1979.The nature and details of Tihr ̄an ̄ı’s political activities before, during, andafter the Islamic Revolution are important issues that cannot be dealt withhere and must be studied separately. The available information suggeststhat despite his preoccupation with preaching, teaching and writing,Tihr ̄an ̄ı had turned his mosque into an active center of opposition againstthe Sh ̄ah’s government before the revolution; and a center for mass mobi-lization and political education after the establishment of the Islamic Re-public. In one of his publications, Tihr ̄an ̄ ı reports how he organized cer-tain members of the clergy into small groups and defied the Sh ̄ah’sgovernment and its reforms in the early 1960s, how he urged ̄Ayatull ̄ahFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage xxvixxviTranslator’s Introduction"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"R ̄uÓhull ̄ah Khomein ̄ı to issue declarations against the government andformed networks for their distribution, and how he met or communicatedwith ̄Ayatull ̄ah Khomein ̄ı and advised him on taking positions on differentoccasions. Of particular interest is Tihr ̄an ̄ı’s discussion of the events of 15Khordad, 1342/June 5, 1963 and his activities in support of Khomein ̄ı.When Khomein ̄ı was arrested by government forces and the rumors of hisupcoming execution spread, Tihr ̄an ̄ı maintains that he met many promi-nent ⁄ulam ̄aof Qum and wrote to others in cities throughout Iran askingthem to declare that Khomein ̄ı was an ̄Ayatull ̄ah and one of the country’ssources of emulation (marja ⁄-i taql ̄ ıd), and therefore, his execution was notpermissible according to the Constitution of 1905. As a result, instead ofexecution, ̄Ayatull ̄ah Khomein ̄ı was sent to exile first to Turkey and then toIraq. After the victory of the revolution, Tihr ̄an ̄ı states, he met with ̄Ayat-ull ̄ah Khomein ̄ı several times and presented the outline of a twenty-pointprogram for consolidation of the new regime including the establishmentof a new military force and suggestions to modify the new constitution.12Despite his interest in politics, before the revolution Tihr ̄an ̄ı concen-trated most of his time and energy on an extensive cultural campaign forpurification of Isl ̄am and Sh ̄ ı⁄ism from beliefs and practices he consideredcorrupt and non-Islamic. Concomitantly, he devoted himself to teaching,studying and practicing ⁄irf ̄anin a serious but quiet manner. We know thatin the late 1960s and the 1970s, when ⁄All ̄amah ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı conducted aclass for a select group of his students in Tehran, the young Tihr ̄an ̄ı, alongwith the late ̄Ayatull ̄ah MurtaÓd ̄a MuÓtahhar ̄ ı and professors Henry Corbinand Seyyed Hossein Nasr, attended those sessions and benefited from⁄All ̄amah’s knowledge and presence. During those sessions, important reli-gious and intellectual questions on Islam in general, and Sh ̄ ı⁄ism and Su-fism in particular, were discussed, and Professor Nasr acted as the maintranslator and interpreter.13After the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and theestablishment of the Islamic Republic, Tihr ̄an ̄ı settled in Mashhad wherehe devoted his time to teaching, writing and spiritual wayfaring.

The waves of these attachments constantly slap him in theface and draw him into the depth of the dark and terrifying ocean to theextent that his wailing and appeal fade away in the uproar of the waves.Regardless of which direction he turns, he realizes that anguish and re-morse, which are indispensable characteristics of perishable matter,frighten and threaten him. In the midst of all this, occasionally he is ca-ressed by the life-giving and refreshing breeze of Divine Attraction (jadh-bah). He feels that this loving breeze pulls him in a direction and toward anunknown destination.

The provisions(z ̄ad)required for this spiritual journey consist of spiritual and asceticpractices (riy ̄aÓdat)to discipline the soul.

For onecan willingly and deliberately retreat and isolate oneself and be saved fromdisturbance of and encounter with external multiplicities. But one cer-tainly cannot free oneself from the disturbance of temptations and imagi-nations of the carnal soul, for those enticements always accompany oneclosely and intimately.The traveler on the path of the Truth and the wayfarer on the way ofsincerity and servanthood to God is not frightened by these enemies. Hemakes up his mind and, with the help of that Holy Melody,1takes the roadtoward his destination and is determined to leave behind the realm oftemptations that is usually called the intermediate world (barzakh).How-ever, the traveler must be very alert and careful lest there remain any ofthose tempting thoughts in the corners of his heart.

But when the traveler reaches the spring of life and wants toquench his thirst from the fountains of wisdom, suddenly they attack himand finish him off with the sword of severity and indignation(qahr).The example of such a traveler is like that of a person who has filled apool in his house with water but has not touched it for some time. There-fore, all the dirt and impurities of the water have settled down at the bot-tom of the pool and the water seems clean and clear to him.

In addition, these and other similarverses of the Exalted Qur‹ ̄an make it abundantly clear that what is meantby the eternal and imperishable Image of God are, in fact, the DivineNames(asm ̄a’-i il ̄ah ̄ ıyah). This conclusion is substantiated by exposition inanother verse of the Qur‹ ̄an where God refers to His Imperishable Imageas His Names, which possess attributes of majesty and glory:Everyone which is thereon shall pass away, there shall remain butthe Majestic and Glorious Image of your Lord. (55:26–27)All commentators [of the Holy Qur‹ ̄an] unanimously agree that inthe verse mentioned above the word possessor (dh ̄u)stands as the adjectivefor Image (wajh)and means that only the Image of God, which possessesMajesty and Glory, is eternal. Since we know that the image of every pos-sible thing (shay‹)is that which one encounters, therefore, the image ofeach possible thing is the locus of its manifestation(ma ̄zhar).By the sametoken, the loci of manifestation(maÔz ̄ahir)of God’s Image are through HisNames whereby all creatures encounter Him.

Obviously, out-ward authority over the community by virtue of providing guidance inexoteric affairs or representing the Shar ̄ ı⁄ahwas not such an importantfunction that the Im ̄ams would describe it in such a manner. Rather,such a description depicts the very same station of annihilation in theUnicity of Divine Essence, which is a prerequisite for the Im ̄am to be theImage of God and the most perfect manifestation of His Attributes ofMajesty and Beauty; a station that is not comparable with any other func-tion and station.One of the most important elements of and requirements in thepath of wayfaring and spiritual journey is constant attention(mur ̄aqabah).From the first step that the traveler takes on the Path untilthe last step, he should never be negligent in observing mur ̄aqabah. Thisis one of the absolute necessities for the traveler. It should be known thatmur ̄aqabahconsists of various stages and levels. In the early phases ofwayfaring, the traveler practices a different kind ofmur ̄aqabah than atlater stages. The higher the stages and levels one traverses and the moreone advances toward perfection, the more intense and more profoundone’s mur ̄aqabahbecomes—so much so that if it were to be imposed on anovice in the initial stages of wayfaring, he would not be able to bear itand would abandon wayfaring entirely; or he would be burnt out andconsumed by it and perish. However, gradually and as a result of persist-ence and passing through preliminary stages, the traveler will be strength-ened and prepared to enter into higher levels ofmur ̄aqabah. At thesestages, many things that were permissible and lawful for him in the earlystages become unlawful and forbidden.As a result of persistent mur ̄aqabah,gradually signs of affection andlove appear in the inmost consciousness of the traveler. Because love fornondelimited [Divine] beauty and perfection (jam ̄al wa kam ̄al ⁄ala‹l iÓtl ̄aq)is primordial to man’s nature. It is a treasure that is deposited in man’s na-ture and engraved in his essence. But interest in material possessions andlove for multiplicities become a veil for this primordial love and preventsthis eternal light from manifesting itself. Through mur ̄aqabahthe veilsgradually turn thinner and eventually disappear, and that primordial loveFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 19Treatise on the Kernel of the Kernel19"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"manifests itself in one’s heart and guides him to that Source of Beauty andPerfection. In the terminology of the gnostics, mur ̄aqabahis referred to aswine(mey):I asked the old man of the tavern the path to deliverance,he called for a cup of wine and said,“guarding the secrets of [Divine] mysteries”! (ÒH ̄afiÔz)and,Guide me into that special retreat so that from now on with Thee I may drink sweet wine,and think no more of the world’s bitter woes. (ÒH ̄afiÔz)When the traveler carefully persists in his mur ̄aqabah, God, Exaltedis He, out of His love and grace, makes certain lights shine upon him asthe first glimmers of gnosis. In the beginning, these lights appear likeflashes of lightning and disappear as suddenly as they shine. However,gradually they become stronger, first like a small shining star that grows inbrilliance and then turns into the shining Moon and then to the Sun.Sometimes these lights appear like a candle or lantern. In the terminologyof gnostics this state and these lights are called gnostic nap(nawm-i⁄irf ̄an ̄ ı). These lights are from the category of beings that belong to the in-termediary world(barzakh).When the traveler observes the intricacies ofmur ̄aqabah in a consis-tent and intense manner, and becomes spiritually stronger, these lights alsobecome stronger in such a way that he sees the entire Earth and Heaven,from East to West, totally illuminated. This light is the light of the soul,which appears while passing through the intermediate world (barzakh).InΩQƒîf É«fO ºZ ônμjOh ƒJ ÉH ΩQƒN z≈e{øjRG ¢ù> ÉJ ÉªæH ºn°UÉN ¬nμJƒ∏N √GQ¿ó«°Tƒ> RGQ âØnch z≈e{ ΩÉL â°SGƒîHäÉ‚ √GQ â°ù« ̧ ¬c ºàØnc √óμ«e Ò> ¬HFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 2020Treatise on the Kernel of the Kernel"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"the early phases of this stage, when the traveler goes through the interme-diate world and the self-disclosure of his soul begins(tajall ̄ ıy ̄at-i nafs), hesees his soul in a physical material form. In other words, often he might seehimself standing before himself. This stage is the beginning of the processof disentanglement of the soul(tajarrud-i nafs).Our teacher and master, the late ÒH ̄ajj M ̄ırz ̄a ̄Aq ̄a Q ̄aÓd ̄ ı, may God bepleased with him, once said, ‘‘One day I left my room and went into theverandah, I saw myself standing silently in a corner. I looked very carefullyat my face and observed a mole on it. Upon returning to my room, Ilooked into the mirror and saw a mole on my face that I had not noticeduntil then.’’At times, the traveler feels that he has lost himself and no matter howhard he may seek he does not find himself. As it was mentioned, these vi-sions occur in the preliminary stages of the disentanglement of the souland are subject to time and space. But later on, with the help of God’sgrace, the traveler can witness the entire reality of his soul in its totally de-tached and cathartic state.An episode has been reported by ÒH ̄ajj M ̄ırz ̄a Jaw ̄ad ̄Aq ̄a Malik ̄ ıTa b r ̄ ız ̄ ı who, for fourteen years, was the student and close companion ofthe late ̄Akh ̄undÒHusayn Qul ̄ ı Hamad ̄an ̄ı, the master of gnosis and tawÓh ̄ ıd,may God be pleased with him. He said that “One day my master assignedthe task of training one of his students to me. The student was of highspiritual aspirations and was very determined in his learning. For six yearshe struggled in constant attention(mur ̄aqabah) and spiritual combat(muj ̄ahadah)until he reached a station which was the station of total capa-bility for understanding and disentangling the soul. I wished that this trav-eler of the path of salvation receive the grace of initiation at the hands ofthe Master and be dressed by him in this sacred garb. I took him to thehouse of our Master and brought up my request. The Master said, ‘This isvery simple.’ Then he made a gesture with his hand and said: ‘Disentangle-ment of the soul is like this.’ That student later told me that ‘Suddenly, Isaw that I had separated from my body and there was someone like myselfstanding on my side.’”It should be mentioned that witnessing the beings from the interme-diate world (barzakh)is not a noble experience or such an honor by itself.Rather, the nobility of that experience is witnessing the soul in its state ofcomplete detachment and perfect catharsis. Because it is at this state thatthe soul appears in its total detached reality, it can be seen as a being that isFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 21Treatise on the Kernel of the Kernel21"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"not bound by time and space and contains the East and the West in itself.In contrast to earlier visions, this vision is no longer particular, but is in thecategory of the perception of universal meanings.Another episode is related by the late ̄Aq ̄a Sayyid AÓhmad Karbal ̄a‹ ̄ ı,may God be pleased with him. He was one of the most prominent andwell-known pupils of the late ̄Akh ̄undÒHusayn Qul ̄ ı Hamad ̄an ̄ı. He said:⁄⁄One day I was resting in a certain place when somebody woke me up andasked me if I would like to see the Divine Light(N ̄ur-i isfahbud ̄ıyah).2When I opened my eyes, I saw an endless light that covered the East andthe West of the universe.” May God nurture our soul by this light. Thisphase is the same stage as the self-disclosure of the soul(tajall ̄ ı-yi nafs),which is seen in this form and in the quality of endless light.After putting this phase behind and as a result of persistence inmur ̄aqabah,in accordance with requisites of higher spiritual planes and re-quirements of those stations, the blessed traveler succeeds in having au-thentic visions of the Attributes of God, Exalted is He, and understandingthe Names of Divine Essence in their totality. At this stage, it may happenthat the traveler suddenly realizes that all creatures of the world, in fact,constitute a single body of knowledge. In other words, he may understandthat there is no other power, but a Single Power. This occurs at the stage ofwitnessing Divine Attributes (shuh ̄ud-i Ósif ̄at). But in the stage of witness-ing Divine Names (shuh ̄ud-i asm ̄a‹), which is still a higher plane than this,the wayfarer realizes that in the entire universe there is but one Knower,one Powerful, and one Living Being. This realization, which takes place atthe plane of the heart, is the most noble and most perfect station becausethe traveler attains a station where he does not see any power, knower, andliving being except God, Exalted is He.Because the wayfarer becomesand does not see any powerful,knowing, and living being except God, Exalted is He.This realization often takes place during the recitation of the HolyQur‹ ̄an. More often than not, the reciter perceives that someone else, and(≈ndÉn©nJ ¬s∏dG inƒp°S Év«nM n’nh ÉkªpdÉnY n’nh GkQpOÉnb inônj n’nh oípÑr°üoj n∂pdÉs°ùdG s¿C’Faghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 22one line short22Treatise on the Kernel of the Kernel"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"not he is the reciter. Sometimes he may realize that even the listener hasbeen somebody else and not he.It should be known that recitation of the Qur‹ ̄an plays a great part inreaching this station. It is appropriate for the traveler to recite the chapters(suwar-i ⁄az ̄a‹im)*while performing the night prayer. Because from thestanding position going into prostration before God is not without grace.Experience has shown that the recitation of the blessed S ̄urah ÓS ̄ad(chapter38) in the one-rak ⁄ah[Persian rak ⁄at]prayer (wat ̄ ırah) on Friday night isvery efficacious. The special grace of this chapter is clear from the tradi-tions narrated concerning the blessings associated with its recitation.When the traveler completes these stages with the help of Divinegrace and experiences these visions, Divine attractions(jadhab ̄at-iill ̄ah ̄ ıyah)surround him, and at every moment take him closer to real anni-hilation until Divine attractions totally take him over and his attention isfixed on nondelimited and Absolute Divine Beauty and Perfection. He for-gets [sets on fire] his own existence and all other beings, and will not seeanything else before his eyes but the splendid Face of the Beloved; as it hasbeen said:God was, and there was nothing else besides Him.In this state the wayfarer leaves the realm of separation and is immersed inthe infinite ocean of witnessing the Lordly Essence of God.3It must be born in mind that wayfaring and spiritual journey is notin contradiction with the traveler’s existence in and interaction with thematerial world. The multiplicity in the external world always remains as itis, and the traveler finds unity within that multiplicity. A prominent [gnos-tic] once said that “I lived among the people for thirty years. They thoughtthat I was in their company and had constant association with them,whereas throughout this period I did not see or know anybody exceptGod.’’ This is a very important and exalted state (Óh ̄al),for in the initialstages of wayfaring it may appear occasionally and for a short time, butgradually it becomes more intense, extending for ten minutes or more andthen one hour or more, and eventually, with Divine grace, it might passlA»n°T o¬n©ne røoμnj rºndnh o¬s∏dG n¿Éncone line shortFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 23Treatise on the Kernel of the Kernel23"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"beyond a state and become a station(maq ̄am).

When he was asked to describe the worldly life, hereplied that “Since I was born [lit. opened my eyes] I have not seen theworld so that I can describe it now.”4In the early stages of wayfaring, when this kind of vision is not verypowerful yet and is independent of the traveler’s will, it is called a state(Óh ̄al). However, as a result of persistence in mur ̄aqabah and with Divinehelp it passes from a state and becomes a station(maq ̄am). At this point itcomes under his control and will. Obviously, a [spiritually] strong traveleris the one who is conscious of his own state while at the same time is cog-nizant of the world of multiplicities and conducts the affairs of both withutmost care. This is an exalted and sublime station and is attainable onlywith great difficulty. Perhaps it is attained only by prophets and Friends ofGod (awliy ̄a‹ All ̄ah)and whomever God wills. The Prophet’s descriptionof his states can be noticed in such wayfarers when he said:Inwardly I have such exalted states with God which no angelbrought nigh encompasses,while outwardly, those states are the example of my human state, as men-tioned in the Qur‹ ̄an:I am only a mortal human being like you.

For instance, theyinterpreted those realities thatNo eye had seen, no ear had heard, and had not occurred toany heartin such terms as paradise, beautiful angels, magnificent palaces,and so on.Ultimately, however, they had to confess that reflection of the realities ofthose realms cannot be confined in human terms and description. The second group is a number of individuals who, by following thepath of the prophets are blessed and honored with a perception of these re-alities and Divine effusion in accordance with the degree of their intellectand preparedness.

In someverses of the Qur‹ ̄an, God, the Exalted, has identified righteousness(Ósal ̄aÓh)with action,as He says: (16-: 97)Whoever acts righteously . . . or, Whoever does righteous deeds. . . and.kÉëpdÉn°U kÓnªnY nπpªnY.ÉkëpdÉn°U nπpªnY røne.p¬pfÉn°ùd ≈ndEG p¬pÑr∏nb røpe pánªrμpërdG o™«pHÉnænj ränôn¡ nX kÉMÉnÑn°U nÚp©nHrQCG ¬s∏pd n¢ün∏rNCG røneÚp°ün∏rîoŸG p¬s∏dG nOÉnÑpY s’EGnøjuódG o¬nd nÚp°üp∏rîoe n¬s∏dG GhoóoÑr©n«pd s’EG GhoôpeoG Énenhone line shortFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 29Treatise on the Kernel of the Kernel29"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Those who believe and do righteous deeds . . .

Obviously, realization ofpurity at the plane of essence is contingent upon its attainment at theplane of action. In other words, unless one reaches the state of total sincer-ity and purity in his deeds and words, as well as in activity and passivity, hewould not attain the stage of purity of essence (ikhl ̄aÓs-i dh ̄at ̄ ı). God, Ex-alted is He, has said: Unto Him ascend good words, and the righteous act He exaltsit.

First of all, the devil(shayÓt ̄an)no longer has author-ity and control over him, as the Noble Qur‹ ̄anic ordinance affirms:By thy might, I surely will deceive them all, save Thy sincereand pure slaves. (38:83)It is evident that this exception is not a privilege ordained by theShar ̄ ı⁄ah. Rather, it is a prerogative emanating from the essentialauthorityof the sincere ones(mukhlaÓs ̄ ın)earned in the station of unity with God(tawÓh ̄ ıd) where the devil has no power and cannot reach because of his in-capability and weakness.Since the sincere ones have purified themselves for God, they seeGod in everything they behold. In whatever manner or form that Satanmay appear to them, they see it with Divine eye and treat him with Divineblessing. As a result, Satan admits his helplessness and submits to them.Otherwise, Satan inherently strives to deceive mankind and has no mercytoward anyone, and does not stop seducing and misleading him.Second, this group will be exempted from reckoning on the day ofResurrection and from attending the scene of judgment. It is mentioned inthe Noble Qur‹ ̄an:And the Trumpet shall be blown, and all those who are in theheavens and the earth shall swoon, save whom God wills. (39:68)It is safe to conclude with certainty from this verse that there is a group ofpeople who will be immune from fear and horror (faza ⁄ wa Ósa ⁄aqah) on the.o¬s∏dG nAÉn°Trøne s’EG p ¢VrQC’G »pa røneh päGnhÉnªs°ùdG »pa røne n≥p©n°üna pQƒt°üdG »pa nïpØofnh.nÚp°ün∏rîoªrdG oºo¡ræpe n∑nOÉnÑpY s’EG nÚp©nªrLCG rºo¡sænjpƒrZo’ n∂pJsõp©pÑnaFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 31Treatise on the Kernel of the Kernel31"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"day of Resurrection.7When one reads that verse in conjunction with thenext verse:So they will surely be present, save the sincere slaves of God.(37: 127- 28)It will be clear that the group which will be exempted from the fearof the day of judgment includes all sincere slaves of God(mukhlaÓs ̄ ın).Forthe sincere slaves of God, in fact, never commit any act for which theymust reckon on the day of judgment. On the contrary, through persistentmur ̄aqabah and ascetic practices in the struggle against the carnal soul(jih ̄ad-i anfus ̄ ıyah), they have died and attained eternal life, and have thustranscended the Greater Resurrection of the soul. Their account has beenscrutinized in the course of their spiritual combat (muj ̄ahadah).Since theyhave died in the path of God, they have been dressed in the robe of eternallife before God and enjoy special sustenance from the Divine Treasure. AsGod, the Exalted has said:Consider not dead those who were killed in the path of God;Nay, they are alive and have their sustenance with theirLord. (3:169)Moreover, calling one(iÓhÓd ̄ar)[to the presence of God on the day ofjudgment] implies one’s absence [before God]; whereas this group of peo-ple (mukhlaÓs ̄ ın) has always been present [before Him], long before thedawn of the day of resurrection, and have been conscious of all states; asGod, Exalted is He, has said:they have sustenance with their Lord..n¿ƒobnRrôoj rºp¡uHnQ nóræpY.n¿ƒobnRrôojrºp¡uHnQ nóræpY lAÉn«rMCG rπnH ÉkJGnƒreCG p¬s∏dG p π«pÑn°S »pa Gƒo∏pàob nøjòsdG sønÑn°ùrënJ n’nh.nÚp°ün∏rîoªrdG p¬s∏dG nOÉnÑpY s’EG n¿hoôn°†rëoªnd ºo¡qfpÉaFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 3232Treatise on the Kernel of the Kernel"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Third, whatever rewards one may be entitled to and enjoy on theDay of Judgment will be in consideration of one’s deeds, save this class ofHis slaves for whom Divine munificence is far beyond the ordinary rewardfor acts. As He says:You will be rewarded nothing save for what you did, exceptthe sincere slaves of God. (37:39–40)If it is argued that this verse addresses only those tormented andchastised souls(mu⁄adhdhab ̄ ın) who will be rewarded [or punished] in ac-cordance with their acts, and not God’s virtuous servants whose reward isnot in accordance with their deeds but is based on God’s generosity andmunificence; we shall say that the meaning of this verse is absolute and isnot particularly addressed to the group of the chastised (mu⁄adhdhab ̄ ın).Moreover, God’s rewarding His creatures in accordance with His grace andgenerosity does not preclude [His] rewarding them for their deeds. For thequality of generosity(faÓdl)implies that the Generous Lord will grant a dis-proportionately large reward in return for insignificant deeds. In otherwords, He will consider minor deeds as very important indeed. Neverthe-less, rewards will still be in return for one’s deeds, whereas the meaning ofthe noble verse cited above is something else. It means that the sincere ser-vants of God are not at all recompensed in return for their deeds. Also it isstated in another verse that:There they shall have all they desire, and there is more [forthem] with Us. (50:35)As this verse points out, not only shall they [the sincere slaves ofGod] receive what they desire, there will also be additional rewards forthem before God. Hence, it is obvious that they shall receive such gifts ofDivine generosity more than what they will or desire and far beyond theirimagination or expectation.

(37:159–160) This is the ultimate perfection of a creature and the highest possible sta-tion one can achieve.We can conclude from what was discussed thus far the types of priv-ileges and effusions associated with the last station of spiritual journey,which is the station of themukhlaÓs ̄ ın. However, it should be clear that at-tainment of these attributes and perfections, and actualization of these re-alities will not be possible unless the wayfarer dies in the process of spiri-tual combat (muj ̄ahadah)in the path of God. He will become intoxicatedby those Divine effusions only when he drinks from the cup of martyr-dom. What we mean by death and martyrdomin this context is, of course,disentanglement of one’s soul and its detachment from one’s corporealbeing and the severance of one’s love for bodily attachments and anythingassociated with it. In the same manner that in the middle of the battlefielda martyr uses his sword to liberate his soul from bodily concerns, the way-farer too uses his inward sword in the battle against his carnal soul; andwith the help of the power of the All-Merciful liberates his spirit from itsattachment to his corporeal being.In the beginning of the spiritual journey, by resorting to asceticism(zuhd), contemplation on and awareness of the heedless and transient na-ture of the world and the futility of attachment to it, the traveler in thepath of God should sever the chain of attachment to the world of multi-plicity. Since asceticism results in detesting worldly affairs, the wayfarerwould not rejoice in occurrences that result in his outward and materialgains; neither would he grieve for those events that bring him material loss..rºoμn«JBG ÉnªpH GƒoMnôrØnJ n’nh rºoμnJÉna Éne ≈n∏nY Grƒn°SCÉnJ nÓr«nμpdnÚp°ün∏rîoŸG p¬s∏dG nOÉnÑpY s’EG n¿ƒoØp°ünj ÉsªnY p¬s∏dG n¿ÉnërÑo°SFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 34one line short34Treatise on the Kernel of the Kernel"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":". . . that you grieve not for the sake of what escapes you, norrejoice over what you are given. (57:23)This resignation and lack of longing [for the world] is not in contra-diction with feelings of happiness and/or sadness in God. Because thiskind of happiness does not derive from the love of wealth, or fame andother contingent affairs; it emanates from one’s finding himself immersedin the ocean of Divine munificence and generosity.After passing through this stage, the traveler will find out that he hasa strong interest in and attachment to his own soul and likes himself to thepoint of extreme love ( ⁄ishq).He will realize that all his efforts and spiritualcombat(muj ̄ahadah), in effect, emanate from his excessive love for his ownsoul. Since a human being is selfish and egocentric by nature; he loves him-self and sacrifices everything for the love of his own soul, and does notavoid destroying anything for his own survival. Struggle against self-centeredness and elimination of this natural instinct is the most difficult ofall difficult tasks. Unless this passion is totally eliminated and this instinctkilled, the light of God will not manifest itself in one’s heart. In other words,so long as the traveler does not free himself of himself, he will not join God.By pleading for Divine Grace and continuous help and mercy of theMost Merciful, the traveler must gradually weaken the ties of self-love andself-centeredness, and eventually sever them all. He must recant this inneridol, which is the source of all vices; and consign it to oblivion once andfor all so that all his deeds would be definitely for the sake of Sacred DivineEssence only, and his love for himself would be transformed into the loveof God. This can only be attained through spiritual combat.After traversing this phase and having severed all his ties, the travelerno longer has any attachment to his corporeal being and its needs, even tothe bondage of his soul. Now, whatever he does is for God’s sake. If heearns a living and obtains means of livelihood to meet his needs to a rea-sonable extent, it is because his Eternal Beloved wills him to live. Other-wise, he would not take a single step for maintaining this earthly life. Ofcourse, the traveler’s desire to live is in verticality with God’s Will, and nothorizontal and parallel to it. Therefore, he should not expect unveiling (ofthe Truth) or miracles and take steps to actualize them, nor pray and in-voke with the intention to discover invisible things or read minds and mys-teries, or acquire such powers as the ability to walk around the earth(Ótayone line shortFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 35Treatise on the Kernel of the Kernel35"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"al-arÓd).He should not undertake ascetic practices to strengthen and/ordisplay special mental and psychic power in any way and form, becausesuch a person no longer worships God or travels on the path of theBeloved and cannot be sincere. On the contrary, it is his own soul that heworships and whose needs he meets and whose powers he actualizes, al-though he never confesses with his tongue to this evil act and claims thatall his prayers are for God’s sake. Such a person is the one who turns hisown soul into an object of his worship. He, in fact, worships his whimsand desires as the following noble verse of the Qur‹ ̄an indicates:Have you seen him who has made his desire his god? (25:43).The wayfarer must pass beyond this phase and leave it behind, and aban-don his soul which always claims “I-ness”(an ̄an ̄ ıyah). God willing, we shalldiscuss this issue later.Ultimately, when the traveler passes beyond this station, he graduallyforgets that he once loved himself for the sake of God, the Exalted. He nolonger sees his own self or any other face except the Infinite and EternalBeauty of the Beloved. Gradually he will be drawn into that endless oceanwithout leaving any sign or trace of himself.It must be borne in mind that the traveler should be alert in the bat-tle against the carnal soul to assure that he defeats the army of Satan com-pletely, wipes out the temptations of the carnal soul ( ̄ath ̄ar-i nafs ̄an ̄ ıyah),and removes their roots from the hidden corners of his heart. For if an iotaof love for wealth, glory, and status, or for pride, ambition, and self-loveremains in his heart, he will never attain perfection.Often, it has been noticed that many aspirants from among the“perfect men”(kumm ̄al ̄ ın) fail in the battle against the carnal soul and donot reach the station of perfection even after years of ascetic practices(riy ̄aÓdat)and spiritual combat. The reason for their failure is that theroots of certain traits survive in their hearts, while they imagine that theyhave completely wiped them out. Consequently, when they face God’strial and are confronted with temptations of the carnal soul and its effects,those roots suddenly bloom and grow, and finally defeat the wayfarer..o√Gnƒng o¬n¡ndEG nònîsJG røne nârjCGnônaCGFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 36one line short36Treatise on the Kernel of the Kernel"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Success in overcoming the carnal soul and its forces is contingentupon Divine solicitude and special Grace of the Lord of lords(Rabb al-arb ̄ab); for it is not possible to traverse this stage without His special graceand assistance.It has been reported that one day some pupils found the late SayyidBaÓhr al-⁄Ul ̄um,8may God be pleased with him, smiling and in a joyousmood.

Hence, should you come across a person whoclaims to be a spiritual traveler but who does not observe all rituals and du-ties set by the Shar ̄ ı ⁄ah, or is not committed to piety and abstention fromsin, or deviates even slightly from the straight path of the trueShar ̄ ı ⁄ah; beaware that such a person is a hypocrite(mun ̄afiq), unless it is proved thathe commits unintended errors or is forgetful.It has been heard from some people who say that after the wayfarerreaches advanced stations and enjoys Lordly effusions and blessings, he isfree from all obligations [to observe the Shar ̄ ı⁄ah]. This is a prevaricationand a false assertion. For even the Prophet, who was the most perfect andnoblest of all creation observed all sacred precepts [of the Shar ̄ ı⁄ah] untilthe last moments of his life. Therefore, exemption from religious obliga-tions in this sense is false and an inaccurate assertion. But one can interpretthis statement in a different manner, which those who make such an asser-tion do not understand. That is, performing rites and rituals of worship isa means for the human soul to grow to perfection. Man’s faculties and ca-pabilities are transformed from potentiality to actuality through his com-mitment to prayers and observation of rites of worship. Therefore, for thosewho have not yet actualized all their potentials in every respect, rites andprayers are necessary in their quest for perfection. But for those who havealready achieved complete actualization of all their potentials, performanceof rites for the sake of perfection and proximity [to God] is no longer rele-vant.

Through per-sistence in spiritual struggle, the traveler must try to completely eliminateall traces of the lower world that are concealed and hidden within hisbeing. Unless he can identify with the pure souls of the world, attainmentto such pure souls’ stations will be impossible for him. In fact, the slightestrelapse in wayfaring and spiritual struggle would bring the aspirant downagain to the lower world.

Only then is he expected to muster his resolution,and with the help of his inner and outer prophets (faculties), set out onthis journey and enter the battlefield of spiritual struggle (muj ̄ahadah)sothat he can achieve the honor of martyrdom on the path of God.

On the contrary, he must be aware that after cross-ing the preceding realms, if he fails to traverse the Greatest of those realms,he will become a prey of Satan who will prevent him from reaching his ulti-mate destination. Therefore, the traveler must have high aspirations andspiritual resolve and determination, and should not permit Satan to afflicthim with the Greatest Heresy (kufr-i a ⁄a ̄zam)or the Greatest Hypocrisy(nif ̄aq-i a ⁄a ̄zam).Rather, after traversing the stages of the Greatest Isl ̄amandGreatest ̄ ım ̄an,he must undertake the Greatest Migration (hijrat-i ⁄u ̄zm ̄a).By resorting to the Greatest spiritual struggle (muj ̄ahadah-yi a ⁄a ̄zam),heshould pass through the plain of the Greatest Resurrection of the soul(q ̄ ıy ̄amat-i ⁄u ̄zm ̄a-yi anfus ̄ ıyah)to enter the realm of the sincere(mukhlaÓs ̄ ın).May God, Exalted is He, grant us this blessing, God willing!Notes1.

However, since this state has not yet reached its utmost perfectionto take over the wayfarer’s total being and take charge of his entire corpo-real existence, material obstacles such as natural and ordinary physical pre-occupations may distract him from that state. As a result of involvementwith these affairs, he may lose [the state of ] direct witnessing and vision,and may be taken over by forgetfulness and negligence (ghaflat, Arabicghaflah).Therefore, the traveler must remain steadfast and determinedand transform that state into a second nature(malakah) to attain perfec-tion so that outward preoccupations could not capture him and distracthim from the course ofvision (shuh ̄ud). In other words, he must extendthis state(Isl ̄am-i akbar) from the plane of the heart to that of the spirituntil that transient and undifferentiated (ijm ̄al) state is transformed into adifferentiated (tafÓs ̄ ıl) one and, under the command of the spirit, expandand take over all his manifest and nonmanifest faculties, changing from apassing state and becoming a second nature to him.

For instance, [in such a society] it is usually assumed that someonewho sits silently in a scholarly gathering or debate, is ignorant.

This is in effect due to the relationship thatexists between spiritual traveling in Isl ̄am and the profound and blessedWord that“Al l ̄ah is greater than that by which He can be described”:For this reason, the earlier prophets themselves did not think of a sta-tion beyond that of witnessing Divine Names and Attributes so that theycould set out on the wings of determination and fly toward that designatednest. Hence, whenever they were afflicted with various kinds of trials in theworld, they would appeal to and find deliverance in the spiritual and super-sensory initiatic power(wal ̄ayat-i ma ⁄naw ̄ ı) of the Noblest Messenger,Im ̄am Am ̄ ır al-Mu‹min ̄ın ⁄Al ̄ ı, al-ÓS ̄ad ̄ ıqat al-Kubr ̄a F ̄aÓtimah Zahr ̄a‹ and herpure offsprings. It was this very station of the Greatest Spiritual and Super-sensory Initiatic authority (wal ̄ayat-i kubr ̄a-yi ma ⁄naw ̄ ıyah) which deliveredthose prophets from their afflictions and ordeals.Although undifferentiated characteristics ofwil ̄ayahwere perceived(mudrak) by prophets of earlier times and on the basis of that they ap-pealed to the exalted stations of the Pure Ones [Immaculate Im ̄ams];nonetheless, its qualities and specific details were unknown to them andremained so until the end of their lives. It is only from some verses of theNoble Qur‹ ̄an that one can find out that once or twice Abraham (peace beupon him) experienced a transient state—and not a perpetual station—that enabled him to witness higher realities and perfect Divine effusions.However, [as was mentioned before] that was a passing state and not a per-manent station. The real nature and quality ofwil ̄ayah,in fact, will be ac-tualized for him in the hereafter.Before we refer to the verses of the Qur‹ ̄an to elaborate and explainthis issue, we should mention that the station of sincerity possesses levelsand gradations. According to the explicit injunction of the Qur‹ ̄an, someprophets did indeed attain the station of sincerity. Nevertheless, there is amore superior and more exalted station than that of sincerity, which theydid not attain, and prayed and hoped to reach in the Hereafter.

Similarly, though Abraham (peace be upon him) did possess a highrank in the station of sincerity, in his supplication he would say:My Lord, grant me wisdom and unite me with the Righteous.(26:83)Hence, the status of the station of righteousness is higher than thatof the station of sincerity; and Abraham begged his Lord to connect himto those who had attained this station.

(37:160) And God, the Exalted, commands His Prophet to praise Him, where Hesays:Say (O Muhammad) praise belongs to God and Peace beupon His slaves whom He has chosen. Is God best, or whatthey ascribe as partners unto Him? (27:59)And He describes the praise of Abraham may peace be upon him:All Praise to All ̄ah, Who gave me Ishmael and Isaac in my oldage, and surely my Lord (rabb ̄ ı)is the Hearer ofsupplication.

Our conclusion is based upon two premises.First is the epithet ijtib ̄a‹.The word ijtib ̄a‹ means ‘selecting’ or‘choosing’ something from among many things that are from the same cat-egory and resemble one another. For instance, if someone picks up anapple for himself from a crate full of apples, his action is called ijtiba’. AsGod says in the above-mentioned noble verse “And We selected them (“waijtabayn ̄ahum”) it means that He chose them from among all His creationand human beings for Himself and set them apart in an exclusive station.Therefore, their judgment is different from that of all other mortals. Theyare persons who have been selected and set aside, and in the true sense ofthe word exist solely for God and enjoy His special grace. It is obvious thatthis selection by God was based on the very same trait of sincerity; for thesincere ones on their part are those who exist solely for God and have com-pletely severed all their ties to other creatures and have attached themselvesto His Sacred Precinct. .m º«p≤nàr°ùoem•Gnô ̆p°U ≈ ̆ndEG rº ̆ogÉ ̆næ ̆rjnó ̆ngnh rº ̆ogÉ ̆næ ̆r« ̆nÑ ̆nà ̆rLGnh rº ̆p¡ ̆pfGnƒ ̆ ̆rNGnh rº ̆ ̆p¡ ̆ ̆pJÉ ̆ ̆sjuQoPnh rº ̆ ̆p¡ ̆ ̆pFÉ ̆ ̆nHBG røpenh nÚpªndÉn©rdG ≈n∏nY Énær∏s°†na vÓocnh kÉWƒodnh n¢ùofƒojnh n™n°ùn«rdGnh nπ«pYÉnªr°SGnhBFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 6868Description of the Realms Preceding the Realm of Khul ̄uÓs"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Second, the term ijtib ̄a‹ in this noble verse is not exclusive to a certaincategory of individuals.

Therefore, the verse can be interpreted in anondelimited, or rather, universal sense, and one can infer from it the sta-tion of sincerity of all prophets.Notes1. ⁄All ̄amah Sayyid Mahd ̄ ı ibn Sayyid MurtaÓd ̄a al-ÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı al-Najaf ̄ ıknown as BaÓhr al-⁄Ul ̄um, Ris ̄ala-yi Sayr wa Sul ̄uk,edited and com-mented upon by ⁄All ̄amah Sayyid Muhammad ÒHusayn ÒHusayniTihr ̄an ̄ı, Mashhad: Iran, 1996/1417 ..2.

After affirmation of Di-vine Unity on the basis of knowledge or even by way of speculation, heshould depart from the state of disbelief and heresy (kufr)and enter therealms of the Lesser Submission(isl ̄am-i aÓsghar)and the Lesser Faith( ̄ ım ̄an-i aÓsghar).This undertaking is unanimously considered as the dutyof every individual who reaches the age of adolescence(mukallaf ) and be-comes mature and responsible. After much effort and search, if such a per-son [the mukallaf] fails to find preference [in a particular religion] andreach some degree of certainty, he must make a firm determination and per-sist in lamentation, weeping, and humility, and should not hesitate to resortto beseeching(ibtih ̄al)and pleading (taÓdarru⁄)until ultimately a path isopened for him as it was opened for the Prophet ÒHaÓdrat Idr ̄ıs and his disci-ples; may Peace be upon him and upon our Prophet and his Progeny.Faghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 7171"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The objective of beseeching and pleading is to have the wayfarer re-alize his helplessness and weakness, and ask for [Divine] guidance with asincere heart. Obviously, God, Exalted is He, would not ever abandonHis desperate and helpless servant who is in search of the Truth and theReality.And those who struggle in Us, We shall assuredly guide themto Our ways. (29:69)I remember that during the time that I was in Najaf Ashraf under themoral and spiritual guidance of the late ÒH ̄ajj M ̄ırz ̄a ⁄Al ̄ ıQ ̄aÓd ̄ ı, may God bepleased with him, one day at dawn while I was sitting on the prayer mat onthe veranda, I fell asleep for a short time and had a vision. I dreamt of twomen sitting in front of me. One of them was the Prophet ÒHaÓdrat Idr ̄ ıs—may peace be upon him and upon our Prophet and his Progeny—and theother was my dear and honorable brother ÒH ̄ajj Sayyid Muhammad ÒHasanÒTa b ̄aÓtab ̄a‹ ̄ ı1who resides in Tabr ̄ ız at the present time. ÒHaÓdrat Idr ̄ ıs began aconversation with me in such a manner that he would converse and com-municate his speech, but his utterances I heard from the tongue of mybrother.ÒHaÓdrat Idr ̄ ıs said that “terrible events and accidents occurred inmy life and resolving them seemed impossible to me by natural course ofevents and ordinary means. But they were all resolved unexpectedly. It be-came clear to me that a hand from the Invisible World and superior to or-dinary means and causes was solving these problems and removing diffi-culties.” This was the first transformation that connected the materialworld of nature to the supernatural realm for me. Our ties of connection[with Heaven] began from that point.At that time it seemed to me that what ÒHaÓdrat Idr ̄ ıs meant by thesetribulations were the hardships and afflictions of the days of his infancyand childhood. What I mean to emphasize is that if one pleads before hisSustainer in the matter of guidance with sincerity and truthfulness, Hewould certainly help and assist him. In those circumstances seeking thehelp of Qur‹ ̄anic verses that befit one’s state would prove very useful andefficacious.

Of course, one must bear in mindthat one must recite these prayers and verses with heart-felt sincerity andwith utmost attention and presence.Once one of our friends related this story to us. He said, “Once Itook a bus to go to Karbal ̄a‹ and had the honor of making a pilgrimage tothe shrine of Im ̄am ÒHusayn, may God’s greetings be upon him. My jour-ney was from Iran. Next to my seat there sat a clean shaven and Western-ized-looking young man. We did not engage in much conversation forsome time. Suddenly, the young man began weeping. I was very surprisedand asked him the reason for his crying. The young man said, ‘If I do nottrust to share [my story] with you, I can trust no one to share it with. I ama civil engineer. Since the time of my childhood years, I was raised in sucha manner that I had no faith in religion. I was a materialist and did not be-lieve in God or in creation and resurrection. But in my heart I felt stronglove and affection for pious and religious people, whether they were Mus-lims, Christians, or Jews. One night I attended a party arranged by myfriends, most of whom were of Bah ̄a ̄ ı‹ faith. For several hours we were busydancing and having fun and so on. After some time I felt ashamed of my-self and felt disgusted with my behavior. I left the room and went upstairs.There, alone, I cried for some time; a prayer arose from within me as if de-scending from Heaven: O God! You are the only God that there is! Helpme! Then after a while I came downstairs. The night party came to an end,and we dispersed. The next day I set out for a technical assignment alongwith the railway chief and some senior officials. Suddenly, I saw aSayyid(a.nøjpôu«nënàoªrdG nπ«pdnO Énj ,oìÉsàna Énj.oÜƒo∏o≤dG tøpÄnª r£nJ p¬s∏dG pôrcpòpH n’BGone line shortFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 73Undifferentiated Description of the Path Toward God73"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"descendant of the Prophet, peace be upon him) with a luminous face at adistance coming toward us. He approached me and greeted me. Then hesaid that he needs to see me and talk to me about a business. I promised tovisit him the next day in the afternoon. Incidentally, after he left, one ofmy companions told me that the Sayyidwas a saintly man and criticizedme for returning his greeting so indifferently. I said it was because whentheSayyidgreeted me, I thought that he was a begger and needed some-thing and came to see me for that purpose. In the meantime, without ad-vance notice, the railway chief ordered me to go to a certain place the nextafternoon and assigned me to carry out a duty as he instructed, exactly atthe same time that I had promised to meet the Sayyid. I concluded that Iwould not be able to visit the old man.The next day when the time of my assignment was approaching, Ibegan to feel sick. Gradually I was struck with such a high fever that I hadto be hospitalized. They brought a physician to examine me. Naturally Ihad to excuse myself from the assignment given to me by the railway chief.Soon afterward when the man who was sent to me by the railwaychief had left, I realized that my fever subsided and my condition returnedto normal. I found myself perfectly healthy once again. I concluded thatthere must be a mystery to this strange event. Therefore, I got up and wentto the residence of thatSayyid. As soon as I sat down with him, he gave mean eloquent speech on the principal doctrine of the faith and with con-vincing reasons and proofs. His talk was so convincing that in no time heturned me into a believer. Then he gave me some instructions and askedme to return the next day. For several days I continued to meet him regu-larly. One day when I was in his presence, he described all the events of myday to me precisely as they had occurred. He also reflected in detail on allmy acts and intentions that I never shared with anyone before and nobodywas aware of except myself. At any rate, some time passed in this manneruntil one day I was compelled to attend a party with some friends. There,I was pushed to join them in gambling. The next day when I visited theSayyidI found him furious. Without any introduction he turned to meand said that I must be terribly ashamed to have committed that mortaland capital sin again. I began to cry out of regret, admitted that my act waswrong, and promised to repent once and for all. He told me to go andmake the Greater ablution, repent, and never commit that sin again. Healso gave me some more instructions. In short, he changed the very courseof my life. This incident occurred in Zanj ̄an.

This isthe journey that I am making at the behest of that Sayyid.’2Our friend said: “In the vicinity of the border of Iraq, once again Inoticed that the young man suddenly burst into tears. Again I asked himwhy he was crying. He told me that ‘just as we entered the territory of Iraq,ÒHaÓdrat Ab ̄a ‘Abd All ̄ah al-ÒHusayn, may peace be upon him, welcomed meand extended his greeting to me.’”My objective in narrating this episode is that if someone trulysearches for God and the Truth with sincerity and pure intention, andseeks guidance from God wholeheartedly, he would certainly receive guid-ance even if he doubts the very existence of God.At any rate, when the wayfarer succeeds at this stage, he should thenset himself to find the Greater Submission (isl ̄am-i akbar) and the GreaterFaith ( ̄ ım ̄an-i akbar). The first and most fundamental step at this point isto acquire the knowledge of the rules and injunctions of the Shar ̄ ı⁄ah,which he must learn from a jurist (faq ̄ ıh). When he has acquired suchknowledge, he should put it into practice. In practice, too, he must be per-sistent until his certainty in and knowledge of God (ma ⁄rifat)expands stepby step. For knowledge is an heir to action, and action in turn is the inher-itor of knowledge. If a person seriously has knowledge about and faith insomething, he will, of necessity, try to make his actions conform to hisknowledge and that which he perceives. The absence of action—in accor-dance with the law of cause and effect—indicates that one’s knowledge isuncertain and his conviction is not total. Rather, the knowledge and faithhe thought he possessed was merely reflection of illusion engraved in hisingenious faculty of imagination.If one ever possesses true knowledge that the One God is the Ab-solute Sustainer and Provider, one should not exhaust his energy and en-danger his life to accumulate wealth through every possible means.Rather, he should be content with making as much effort as has been en-joined by the Shar ̄ ı ⁄ah, and with utmost serenity and peace of mind, dohis best to provide livelihood for his family and himself. But if one strug-gles excessively in search of livelihood or is overwhelmed by apprehensionand anxiety, it is an indication that he knows God as a delimited ratherthan the Absolute Sustainer. He may believe that, for instance, God is theProvider only if he works hard and suffers hardships; as though God werehis Provider only if He gave him money or monthly allowance, and so on.Faghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 75Undifferentiated Description of the Path Toward God75"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Therefore, inward or outward anxiety is indicative of the lack of aware-ness that God is the Absolute Sustainer, or out of conviction that He isonly a delimited Sustainer. In other words, this is an indication that oneknows God to be a provider only under certain circumstances and con-ditions. This is what we mean when we say that action is the outcome ofand heir to knowledge. An example that action is the result of knowl-edge is when one observes and admits his abasement before God whenone recites:Glory belongs to my Lord, Exalted is He, and Him do Ipraise.3It is obvious that humility and lowliness cannot exist without exalta-tion. The humble will always stand in contrast to one who is exalted andmajestic. Therefore, he will inevitably come to perceive the station of Ab-solute Majesty and then he will understand that Majesty is accompaniedby knowledge and power. Hence, from a seemingly simple action, such asthis prayer recited in prostration [in daily prayer], one becomes aware ofthe Absolute Majesty and the Absolute Power and Knowledge of God,Blessed and Exalted is He. This is the meaning of action being the productof knowledge. God Almighty refers to this fact in the following verse:And the pious deed does He Exalt. (35:10)One must make utmost effort to observe obligatory duties and ab-stain from the forbidden(muÓharram ̄at).Because abandoning obligatory du-ties and committing the unlawful is in sharp conflict with traveling towardGod. All the efforts of the traveler will be fruitful only when these two prin-ciples are observed together. Otherwise, in the same manner that goldenadornment and ornaments are useless on a filthy body, so are the perform-ance of supererogatory and ascetic acts prescribed by the Shar ̄ ı⁄ahof nog.o¬o©narônj oípdÉs°üdG oπnªn©rdGnh.p√pórªnëpHnh ≈n∏rYC’G »uHnQ n¿ÉnërÑo°SFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 7676Undifferentiated Description of the Path Toward God"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"benefit for an impure heart and soul.

The tradition narrated by Muhammad ibnMuslim points to this fact:Faith cannot be [actualized] without action, and action is apart of it. Faith will not be established except with action.The spiritual traveler must therefore carry out every supererogatoryact at least once so that he may benefit from its spiritual joy and efficacy.Hence it has been mentioned in the sermons of Am ̄ ır al-Mu‹min ̄ın ⁄Al ̄ ı,may peace be upon him, that, ‘‘Perfect faith is the offspring of [perfect] ac-tion.’’ Hence the traveler on the path of God must not be negligent ofsupererogatory acts in his journey toward the station of the Greater Faith( ̄ ım ̄an-i akbar). Obviously, his faith will remain imperfect to the same ex-tent that he remains careless and negligent of performing these acts. Forexample, if a traveler purifies his tongue and all his bodily organs andmakes them observant of the sacred manner and etiquette in the full senseof the term, but is not generous in spending his wealth [on the path ofGod], he would not advance beyond a certain stage and his faith would re-main incomplete and imperfect. The very same imperfection would pre-vent his advancement to a higher station. Accordingly, he must have everybodily organ enjoy its share of faith until it achieves the degree of faith itdeserves and is entitled to. For instance, the heart, which is the sovereign ofthe body, must be kept engaged in contemplation (fikr) and invocation(dhikr). Dhikr means the heart’s remembrance of the Names and Attrib-utes of the Supreme Creator. Contemplation consists of deliberation andconcentration of the heart on ‘‘God’s signs on the horizons and in theirsouls’’4and reflection over craftsmanship and scrutiny of the realm andprocess of creation.

He can take charge ofthe traveler’s guidance and direct him toward the desired destination.However, one’s journey through these stages is contingent upon severalconditions that must be observed in the best possible and most perfectmanner.Abandoning Conventionalism, Habitual Practices, and CustomsThe first step for the spiritual traveler to take is to abandon the contingentaffairs (um ̄ur-i i ⁄tib ̄ar ̄ ıyah);those illusory and fictitious values, and con-ventional habits and practices that prevent him from traveling on the path.What we mean is that he should live in moderation among the people.Some people are constantly preoccupied with the rules and customs of so-ciety, and all their thoughts and efforts are centered on pleasing others andcultivating friendship. Such people are obsessed with formalities and wel-come all kinds of interaction with various people, whether meaningful orFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 8383"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"useless, for the sake of maintaining their social status. They habitually sub-ject themselves to these formalities in order to maintain their actual orimagined prestige, often exposing themselves to obligations and severehardships. In order to preserve that which is peripheral, they set aside thevery substance of life. They take common people’s admiration and/or dis-approval as criteria and waste their lives conforming to those standards.The vessel of their being is besieged with the tides of social habits and cus-toms, swept hither and thither by the waves of social decorums and valuesof the society. Not knowing themselves, this group of people have no willpower of their own, but are totally submissive to the will of society and fol-low that.In sharp contrast to this group, there is another group of people whowithdraw from society and people, renounce all kinds of social customsand norms, and free themselves from all societal obligations and privileges.They do not associate with or frequent the company of people, but live intheir peaceful seclusion to the extent that their very seclusion brings themnotoriety and recognition.In order to attain his desired goal, the traveler must always observemoderation, adopt a middle position, refrain from either extreme, andwalk on the straight path. This objective will not be achieved unless a rea-sonable degree of interaction is maintained with society. In such a situa-tion, should a discord inevitably arise between the spiritual traveler and or-dinary people as a result of the frequency and/or quality of theirassociation, it would not be very harmful to the wayfarer. Of course, sucha conflict will rarely arise because, while social intercourse is necessary andessential to a certain extent, the traveler would not under any circum-stances submit himself [to follow] the manners and practices of the com-mon people:And they do not fear the blame of any blamer [in mattersrelating to God]. (5:54)This verse in effect points to the traveler’s steadfastness in his pur-suit of the straight path and his fortitude in his beliefs and practices. Onthe whole, one can say that the wayfarer must examine every social issue,.m ºpFn’ nánerƒnd ]p¬s∏dG »pa[ n¿ƒoaÉnînj n’nhFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 8484Differentiated Description of the Path Toward God"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"evaluate its advantages and disadvantages, and never submit to the moralvalues and modalities of the masses of the people.Steadfastness ( ⁄Azm)When the traveler enters the arena of spiritual struggle, he will experiencedifficulties with and unpleasant behavior from ordinary people and ac-quaintances who are driven solely by their own whims and social ambi-tions. They blame him and disapprove of him with their words and deedsin order to dissuade him from his path and goal. They are particularly dis-turbed with the divergence and gap that appear between them and thewayfarer’s lifestyle. They blame him and resort to various means to dis-courage the novice and stop him from pursuing the path. Of course, thetraveler will encounter new problems at every stage of his journey thatseem impossible to overcome without patience and determination. By re-sorting to the power and blessing of God, the traveler must have suchstrong will power that he can withstand all these difficulties, and with theweapons of patience and trust in God (tawakkul) annihilate them all. Inconsideration of the magnitude of his objective and goal, he should neverbe frightened by those terrible storms that are impediments and obstacleson his path toward God. In short, he should never let fear find its way intohis heart, as the Holy Qur‹ ̄an says:And in God let the believers put their trust. (3:160)And in God let the trusting put their trust. (14:12)Compassion and Forbearance (Rifq wa Mud ̄ar ̄a)These are among the most important qualities that a traveler must cherishand possess. Not only will the slightest negligence in this regard hinder hisadvancement, it may even cause his permanent expulsion from wayfaring..n¿ƒo∏ucnƒnàoªrdG p πscnƒnàn«r∏na p¬s∏dG ≈n∏nYnh ¿ƒoæperDƒoªrdG p πscnƒnàn«r∏na p¬s∏dG ≈n∏nYnhFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 85Differentiated Description of the Path Toward God85"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"During the initial stages of his spiritual journey, the traveler may find anextraordinary degree of ferver and longing (shoor va shawq)in his heart, ormay experience exceptional love and yearning when theophanies of Divineforms of Beauty (tajall ̄ ıy ̄at-i Ós ̄ur ̄ ıya-yi jam ̄al ̄ ıyah)manifest themselves. As aresult, he may resort to excessive prayer and invocation. He may spend agreat deal of time in praying and wailing, doing every spiritual act andlearning words from whoever he can and nurturing his soul with all kindsof spiritual nourishment. Not only is this kind of practice ineffective, itcan also be harmful. Because as a result of imposing a heavy burden on hissoul, the wayfarer’s soul will react in a negative way and will hold back.Hence he will achieve no positive result and will eventually lose interest inperforming even the most minor supererogatory prayers.The mystery behind this exaggeration and the subsequent disap-pointment and withdrawal is that the wayfarer takes a temporary intellec-tual intuition and transient spiritual yearning as his criteria and motiva-tion to perform those supererogatory rites and prayers, and places a heavyburden on the soul before preparing it. As soon as this transient longingdisappears and the flame cools down, the soul feels exhausted and frus-trated. Consequently, it drops the load and abandons the path in the be-ginning or the middle of the journey. It becomes alienated and developsan aversion to continue the journey and bear its numerous requirementsand difficulties. Therefore, the traveler should never be deceived and mis-led by transient spiritual yearning. Quite the contrary, he should take intoconsideration his personal and professional condition, and realize his lim-itations and capacity with utmost care and foresight and undertake onlywhat he can fulfil. To be sure, the traveler should even engage himself inacts somewhat lighter than his capacity but be persistent, so that he canfully benefit from the efficacies associated with them.In consideration of this conclusion [we can say that] when the trav-eler is engaged in prayer, he should stop while he is still willing to con-tinue so that a desire to and thirst for prayer always remains in his heart.The example of the traveler in relation to prayer is like that of a hungryman in relation to food. He must select the kind of food that would suithis taste and stop consuming food before he eats to his fill, so that the ap-petite and desire for food always remains with him. The advice thatÒHaÓdrat ÓS ̄adiq, may peace be upon him, gave to one of his disciples, a cer-tain ‘Abd al-⁄Az ̄ ız Qar ̄aÓt ̄ ıs ̄ ı, addresses this issue and emphasizes modera-tion in prayers:Faghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 8686Differentiated Description of the Path Toward God"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"O ‘Abd al-‘Az ̄ ız, verily there are ten levels for faith and it is likea ladder which must be climbed one step at a time.

When he searched for the cause, he perceived orwas told that the ground was moaning because of separation from him!2Now that these preliminary remarks are made, we may say that,through perseverance in observing pertinent rites, the traveler must stabi-lize that pure angelic state in his soul so that he can transform his state intothe station of second nature (maq ̄am-i malakah). Through persistence inevery single spiritual act, he must be able to derive utmost spiritual joyfrom that particular act and should not give up until he achieves this. Thepermanent angelic station of every spiritual act can be attained only whenthe traveler, steadily and persistently, is engaged in [performing] every spir-itual act until the permanent effects of transient outward actions penetrateinto the depth of his soul and are engraved in his soul in a manner that canno longer be removed.Faghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 90one line short90Differentiated Description of the Path Toward God"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Hence the traveler must try to choose only those spiritual acts andrites that are compatible with his capacity and chemistry; and if he is notdetermined to continue, he should not choose any act at all.

May God beour refuge [from such state].The meaning of confrontation (mukh ̄aÓsamah) [in this context] isthat when a traveler abandons a spiritual practice, in reaction the reality ofthat practice abandons him and takes away its efficacy and grace. Since aspiritual act is in essence good and luminous, when the soul is emptied ofits effects, the void created in the soul of the wayfarer will be filled withdarkness and evil. The fact is that “Nothing but good is found in God. Asto the evil, ugliness, and darkness, they come solely from our own souls.”Accordingly, every evil and ugliness that may arise is derivedfrom our own souls and cannot be attributed to God.And evil is not from You.As this statement indicates it becomes clear that Divine emanationsare not exclusive to certain people; rather, because of His kind Lordshipand infinite mercy, they are extended to all human beings whether Mus-lims, Jews, Christians, or Zoroastrians, and even the worshipers of fire andidols.

At the early stages ofwayfaring, mur ̄aqabah means avoiding the frivolous and abstaining fromanything that is of no benefit either to one’s religion or one’s worldly life. Italso means refraining from deeds and words that are in conflict with God’sWill and His Pleasure. Gradually, however, mur ̄aqabahbecomes more in-tense and exalted step by step.

God willing, its details and stages will be explained in the com-ing pages.It should be known that mur ̄aqabahis one of the most important re-quirements of spiritual traveling, and all prominent masters have placedconsiderable emphasis on it.

Therefore, aslong as mur ̄aqabahis not undertaken, meditation and invocation will re-main ineffective.

Aslong as the sick person does not purify his body and refrain from consum-ing foods that do not suit his condition, medicine will remain ineffective,or may even produce adverse effects.

Compassionand kindness toward God’s creatures in accordance with their station andrank, whether human beings or animals, is indeed a sign of love for God.As it has been stated in traditions, the most important aspect of faith islove and compassion toward God’s creation.O my God, I beseech You to grant me Your love and the love ofthose who love You.Because of loving her, I love the sand dues of NajdAnd I would not be infatuated with them, if not for her longing.In longing for Layla, I humble myself to her folks,And bear the humble and the noble among them.4Proper Manner (Adab)Adabmeans proper manner and reverence before God, the Lord ofMajesty and His vicegerents. It is different from the love and devotionmentioned above. For reverence means being careful of and attentive toone’s behavior and acts lest one trespass one’s limits and commit acts con-trary to the essentials of servanthood.

Therefore, the traveler’s quest must be sincere and pure:So [O believer] pray unto All ̄ah purifying religion for Him.(40:14)It is mentioned in many traditions that intention has three levels.

In fact, they worship them-selves, not God, Exalted is He, because their point of reference and themotives behind their worship are self-interest and appetites of the carnalsoul. Since self-worship is not congruent with worshiping God accordingto the first argument, this group of people deny God and are therefore nottrue believers. But the Noble Qur‹ ̄an explicitly describes the worshipingGod as primordial human state and rejects any kind of change and alter-ation in creation:So set your purpose for religion as a primordial believerupright by nature, the innate nature of All ̄ah in which Hehas created man. There is no altering in God’s creation.That is the right religion, but most people do not know.(30:30)Accordingly, man’s deviation is not from the path of worshipingGod, but from the path of Divine Unity. As a result, man does not seeunity in God’s acts and attributes, but assigns partners to Him. That is thereason the Holy Qur‹ ̄an frequently affirms the Unity of God and rejectspartnership in relation to Him. On this basis, the first two groups regardGod as an associate and a partner in their own personal objectives; whilethey worship God, they do not stop worshiping themselves. They carryout their acts of worship with two objectives in mind, and this is merepolytheism (shirk). In fact, these two groups are polytheist (mushrik ̄ ın)inrelation to God, Exalted is He, which according to the explicit text of theQur‹ ̄an is an unforgivable act:Verily, God does not forgive that a partner should be ascribedto Him, other than that He forgives whom He wills.

However, after traversing certain stations and attaining some de-gree of perfection, he feels that love and the Beloved are two distinct andseparate entities. Therefore, he tries to set aside love that had thus far beena necessary provision for his journey and spiritual advancement towardGod. He realizes that love, which was an effective means up to this point,is becoming harmful and an obstacle to his advancement on the path. As aresult, from then on the traveler has only the Beloved in mind and onlyworships Him as the sole Beloved.Still, when the traveler advances further on the path and passes someother stations, he understands that even this kind of worship is not freefrom the tarnish of polytheism, for in this type of worship he sees himselfas the lover and God as the Beloved. Being conscious of one’s selfhood andseeing the lover independent of the Beloved implies othernessand dualityand is in contradiction with loving the Beloved. Therefore, having theBeloved in mind while one carries the title of lover is in contradiction withworshiping the Sacred Essence of God. Consequently, from this point onthe traveler tries to discount love and the beloved as two so that he canovercome othernessand pass beyond the realm of multiplicity and enter theworld of Unity. At this time even intention (niyyat) disappears from theheart of the wayfarer because there is no longer a personal identity andselfhood from which intention would originate.Until the beginning of this station, the traveler had sought Gnosticvision (shuh ̄ud),unveiling (kashf ), and disclosure (muk ̄ashafah). At thispoint he becomes oblivious to them all, for he no longer possesses inde-pendent will to have any goal or objective in mind other than the Beloved.The wayfarer’s eyes and heart renounce the presence and/or absence of vi-sions, reaching or not reaching the goal, knowledge or ignorance, and ac-ceptance or rejection.

The first station is the renunciation of the world;the second is the renunciation of the Hereafter, the third is the renuncia-tion of the Master(mawl ̄a); and the fourth is the renunciation of renunci-ation. Reflect deeply upon this statement.Among the spiritual travelers the term “renunciation of greed”(qaÓt⁄-iÓtama ⁄) alludes to this station, which is a very important and arduous stage,and like a rugged valley, passing through it is a formidable task. For after somuch soul-searching and self-questioning, the traveler finds out that in allstages of his wayfaring he was never free of personal intention and objec-tive.

Because the very same struggle to attain detach-ment and catharsis(tajr ̄ ıd)implies the presence of attachment and is anindication of the wayfarer’s struggle for a special [personal] purpose. Theexistence of this purpose by itself is a sign of the absence of detachment ofthe soul.One day I discussed this mystery with my teacher and mentor, thelate ̄Aq ̄a ÒH ̄ajj M ̄ırz ̄a ⁄Al ̄ ı ̄Aq ̄a Q ̄aÓd ̄ ı, may God be pleased with him, andpleaded for [his help] to find a solution. He said: ‘‘This problem can besolved by resorting to purification through incineration(iÓhr ̄aq).The trav-eler must understand and accept the fact that God, Exalted is He, has cre-ated him a covetous being. No matter how much he struggles to overcomehis greed, he will not succeed, for greed is part of his innate nature. A de-sire to eliminate greed from the soul implies the presence of a greed of ahigher nature for which he abandoned the lower one. Therefore, when hefinds himself helpless and unable to free himself of greed, he will have toentrust his affair to God and set aside any thought of eradicating greedfrom his soul by himself. The admission of helplessness and weaknessburns down the very root of greed and purifies him.’’One should realize, of course, that experiencing this state is not pos-sible through discursive speculation. Rather, true understanding of thisnotion requires experiencing a special state and intellectual intuition(dhawq). If one can experience this state through intellectual intuitiononce in life, one would realize that all pleasures of the world could notmatch the joy of experiencing this truth.The reason for calling this method incineration is that it destroysand burns down the very roots of one’s identities, intentions, anxieties,and problems, and does not let an iota of their trace remain in the trav-eler’s being.There are references toiÓhr ̄aqin the Noble Qur‹ ̄an on several occa-sions. If one uses this method to attain the goal and move on the path, in ashort time one can traverse stations that would otherwise take several yearsto pass. One of the cases of reference to iÓhr ̄aqin the Glorious Qur‹ ̄an is theutterance of rememberance of return to God (istirj ̄a ⁄):.n¿ƒo©pLGnQ p¬r«ndEG ÉsfEGnh p¬s∏pd ÉsfEGFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 101Differentiated Description of the Path Toward God101"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Verily we belong to God and unto Him we shall return. (2:156)At times of adversity, difficulties, and affliction, man can consolehimself in several ways. For instance, he may remind himself that everyman is bound to experience misfortune or die; and in doing so, he cangradually comfort himself. By means ofiÓhr ̄aq ̄ ıyahand istirj ̄a⁄,however,God shortens the way and solves the problem once and for all. For if manreminds himself that his existence and whatever he possesses belong toGod who granted them to him when He willed and will take them awaywhenever He wills and no one else has any authority to interfere; if manrealizes that he, in fact, did not own anything from the beginning and hisownership of his wealth was metaphorical, he would not be distressed andsaddened by its loss. This realization will pave the way for him and willcomfort his soul and help him to bear his loss and deprivation.Realizing that God created man covetous from the beginning is likeperceiving that God, the nondelimited Possessor of wealth (ghan ̄ ı-ye al ̄a‹liÓtl ̄aq), created His servant poor from the very beginning, and placedpoverty in his nature. Therefore, there is no need for reason to proveman’s inherent poverty and his need to beg, which poverty necessitates.One cannot blame the begger when he begs, because poverty calls for beg-ging. Therefore, if the wayfarer on the path of God realizes his greed, hemust understand that God has created his being with this attribute andunder no circumstances can he free himself from it. On the other hand,since annihilation in the Divine Essence, which is founded on the basis ofthe prayer of the free-spirited men (aÓhr ̄ar) [sing.Óhurr], is not in harmonywith covetousness, the wayfarer feels totally helpless and anguished. Iron-ically, this very same feeling helps him go beyond the boundaries of hisselfhood,which is accompanied by greed. After passing through this stagethere is no longer I-ness (enn ̄ ıyat)and selfhood left to associate with greedand desire. [It is important] that one contemplates this point and under-stands it properly.Silence (ÓSamt)There are two categories of silence: (1) silence in general is called muÓd ̄af,and (2) absolute and particular silence is known as muÓtlaq.

Although particular retreat is spiritually beneficialat all times and during all kinds of prayer and invocation, it is especially re-quired during certain types of verbal invocations (adhk ̄ar-i kal ̄am ̄ ıyah) andpossibly in all of them, and is considered essential by the masters of thepath. There are several prerequisites that must be observed in this regard.These include withdrawal from the crowd and noisy places and avoidancefrom hearing any kind of disturbing voice and sound. In addition, theplace of particular retreat must be legally sanctioned by the Shar ̄ ı⁄ahto usefor that purpose, and must be of ritual purity(Ótah ̄arah)from the walls tothe roof. It should also be large enough to room only one person; and musthave nothing of worldly embellishments in it, because the small size of theprayer room and the absence of furnishings in it contributes to one’s con-centration and serenity.A man asked Salm ̄an F ̄ars ̄ ı12may God be pleased with him, for permis-sion to build a house for him, as he had not built a house for himself untilthat time.

One is the teacherin its ordinary and universal term (ust ̄ad-i ⁄ ̄amm); the other is the particu-lar teacher(ust ̄ad-i kh ̄aÓsÓs ). In the first context, a teacher is someone who isnot especially chosen or appointed to guide others [in spiritual matters].Seeking the advice of such a teacher falls in the broader context ofQur‹ ̄anic injunction to consult those who are people of knowledge,as is un-derstood in accordance with the general meaning of the following verse:Ask the people of the Remembrance if you do not know. (16:43)The need to refer to anordinary teacher is only at the initial stages ofspiritual journey. However, when the traveler is honored by authentic vi-sions and the theophany of Divine Attributes and Essence (mush ̄ahad ̄at watajall ̄ ıy ̄at-i Ósif ̄at ̄ ıyah wa dh ̄at ̄ ıyah),association with such a teacher is nolonger necessary. As to the particularspiritual teacher and master, he is theone who is specifically designated to guide people in spiritual matters.They are the Prophet of All ̄ah [Muhammad], and his true and legitimatesuccessors [i.e., the Sh ̄ ı⁄ite Im ̄ams] and vicegerents.

Obviously, what is meant by attachment and companionship(mur ̄afaqat)14is inward attachment and companionship of the Im ̄am withthe traveler, and not necessarily outward and physical association. Becausethe reality of the Im ̄am is none other than the station of his luminositythat dominates over the world and its inhabitants. As to the Im ̄am’s corpo-real being, even though it has its own nobility and grace in relation toother human beings, nonetheless, it is not the source of any consequenceor particular efficacy or dispensation in the affairs of the universe.To further clarify this point, it is important to mention that thesource of all that which finds concrete existence and manifestation in theworld of creation is the Divine Names and Attributes, and the reality ofthe Im ̄am is the same as the Names and Attributes of God. Therefore, it ison the basis of this fact that the Im ̄ams have said: “The wheel of the worldof being, the heavens, and the entire universe turns by our hands andeverything takes place with our sanction and permission”:It is through us that God is known and it is through us thatGod is worshiped.Accordingly, in the process of wayfaring, the traveler traverses withinthe planes of the Im ̄am’s luminosity. Any spiritual station he may ascend orstatus he may attain, the Im ̄am already possesses and accompanies thewayfarer in that plane and station.By the same token, the Im ̄am’s companionship and friendship is nec-essary even after the attainment of the desired spiritual goal of union(wuÓs ̄ul)with the Beloved, for it is he who must teach the traveler the rulesand manners of the abode of Divine Names (l ̄ah ̄ut).Therefore, compan-ionship of the Im ̄am in every situation is an important, and perhaps themost importantcondition and requirement of spiritual journey. There areprofound mysteries to this fact that cannot be confined in words and de-scription, but the traveler must discover them through discernment andintellectual intuition.One day, MuÓhy ̄ ı al-D ̄ ın [ibn al-]⁄Arab ̄ ı went to a spiritual master andcomplained about the spread of injustice and sin [on earth].

The teacher answered: ‘‘O the apple of my eye! Both answers are thesame. He invited you to the Friend (raf ̄ ıq), and I am inviting you to theWa y(Ótar ̄ ıq).’’We relate this story to demonstrate that wayfaring in the path ofGod and toward God is not in contradiction with wayfaring in the DivineNames and Attributes, which are essentially the same as the station of theIm ̄am. They are very close to one another and are indeed identical. In thatrealm, there is no duality to be found; rather, whatever exists there is a sin-gle light, which is the Divine Light. Ultimately, that light is described indifferent terms at different times; sometimes as Divine Names and Attrib-utes, and at other times as the reality or luminosity of the Im ̄am.Our descriptions are various, but Thy Beauty is one,it is to Thy Beautythat all of them allude.It is not possible to know the ordinaryteacher and recognize hisqualities except through one’s association and companionship with himin public and private until his truthfulness and total certainty (yaq ̄ ın)areunequivocally proven to the traveler.

One cannot rely merely on the theophanies of DivineNames and Attributes(tajall ̄ ıyyat-i Ósif ̄at ̄ ıyah wa asm ̄a‹ ̄ ıyah) in a teacherand regard them as indications of his perfection and union [with theBeloved].The meaning of the theophany of Divine Attributes(tajall ̄ ı-yi Ósif ̄at ̄ ı)is that the traveler observes Divine Attributes in himself and regards hisown knowledge, power, or life, as those of God. Thus, if he hears some-thing he would perceive that it is God who hears it because He is theAll-Hearing (Sam ̄ ı ⁄); when he sees something, he would understand that Godsees it because He is the All-Seeing (BaÓs ̄ ır); he would consider all knowledgeof the world as God’s, and would realize that the knowledge of all existenceis derived from or is the same as God’s knowledge.The theophany of Divine Names (tajall ̄ ı-yi asm ̄a‹ ̄ ı)means that thewayfarer would observe in himself those Attributes of God that are sup-ported by His Divine Essence, such as the Standing (Q ̄a‹im),the All-Knowing(⁄Al ̄ ım),the All-Hearing(Sam ̄ ı ⁄), the All-Seeing(BaÓs ̄ ır), theOmnipotent (Q ̄adir), and the like.

Orhe should understand that the Living One is one and that it is God, andthat he himself is essentially not living, except in God. In the final analysis,the wayfarer should understand that There is no powerful, knower, andliving being except God, Exalted and Holy is He.The Almighty, the All-knowing and the Living One is nonebut He, Exalted, the Sacred.Of course, it is possible that the theophany of Divine Names wouldbe manifested in one’s being in relation to certain Divine Names only.

(16:99–100)Litany (Wird)Wirdconsists of verbal invocations (adhk ̄ar) and litanies (awr ̄ad)(sing.dhikrandwird) the type and frequency of which are determined by thespiritual guide.For prayers and litanies are like medicines that are bene-ficial to some patients and harmful to some others. Sometimes it hap-pens that a traveler engages in two kinds of invocations, one of which di-rects his attention to multiplicity and the other toward Unity. Whenthey are recited together, they usually neutralize one another’s effect andproduce no result. Of course, the spiritual master’s special permission isrequired for recitation of those litanies that require special sanction.However, recitation of generally sanctioned litanies does not need specialpermission.There are four categories of litanies. [They include] manifested rec-ollection with tongue often concentrating on the invocation without at-tention to its meaning(dhikr-i jal ̄ ı orq ̄alib ̄ ı); and, silent or hidden invoca-tion where attention is focused on the meaning (dhikr-i khaf ̄ ı orqalb ̄ ı).Each of these two categories is either specific in number(ÓhaÓsr ̄ ı) or nonde-limited(iÓtl ̄aq ̄ ı). The outward invocation is not very important in the eye ofthe people of the wayfaring, for it consists of verbal chanting often withoutparticular attention to meaning. It is indeed the movement of the tongue.n¿ƒocpôr°ûoe p¬pH rºog nøjòsdGnh o¬nfrƒsdnƒnànj nøjòsdG ≈n∏nY o¬ofÉ n£r∏o°S ÉnªsfEG n¿ƒo∏scnƒnànj rºp¡uHnQ ≈n∏nYnh GƒoæneBG nøjòsdG ≈n∏nY l¿Én£r∏o°S o¬nd n¢ùr«nd o¬sfEGFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 113Differentiated Description of the Path Toward God113"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"(laqlaqah-yi lis ̄an).

Most people who fail to reach their spiritual destina-tion stop in one of these three stages where they quit wayfaring perma-nently or become prone to going astray. There are many dangers in thesephases, such as [turning toward] idolatry; worshiping stars, fire, and attimes to atheism, pharaohism, claims of incarnation (Óhul ̄ul), and unifica-tion(ittiÓh ̄ad)[with God]; renouncing obligatory rites; arbitrarily decidingwhat is permissible and what is forbidden by the Shar ̄ ı ⁄ah (Óhal ̄al waÓhar ̄am); and other similar practices. Of course, we shall discuss all thesedangers in due course. For the time being, however, we will examine two ofthe most important of those dangers, namely, incarnation (Óhul ̄ul)and uni-fication (ittiÓh ̄ad); dangers that the traveler will face as a result of purifyinghis mind through control and rejection of other incoming thoughts(nafy-i khaw ̄aÓtir).Since the traveler has not yet transcended the realm ofselfhoodandpersonal identity when Divine Names and Attributes manifest themselvesin him, he may fall into the trap of illusions and imagine that God hasreached unity with him and his self—may God be our refuge. This mean-ing of incarnation and unification is indeed identical with heresey (kufr)and polytheism (shirk); whereas the meaning of the concept of Unity ofBeing (waÓhdat al-wuj ̄ud) essentially and totally negates multiplicity, other-ness and distinctiveness, and regards all conceivable existents before Godas passing shadows and illusions. When the traveler realizes the station ofUnity of Being, he loses all his being, is denuded of his selfhoodand is to-tally annihilated in God. As a result, he cannot intuitively sense any otherexistent in the world of existence except His Sacred Essence:There is no one in the house save Him [who is] the Landlord..lQÉsjnO o√oôr«nZ pQGsódG »pa n¢ùr«ndnhFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 114114Differentiated Description of the Path Toward God"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The difference and distance between this state and incarnation and unionis from the earth to heaven.The concept of control of the mind and rejecting incoming thoughts(nafy-i khaw ̄aÓtir) denotes conquering the heart and governing over it sothat it may not say something or commit an act, or be preoccupied withthoughts and memories except by the permission and will of its master.Achieving this state is an extremely difficult task, as it is said that thoughtcontrol is one of the greatest purifiers of the inmost consciousness(a ⁄ ̄a ̄zim-i muÓtahhar ̄at-i sirr). When the traveler sets out to practice controlling histhought, he realizes that a shattering flood of memories, thoughts, fan-tasies, and dreams overwhelms him. Even memories that he never imag-ined would come to his mind, such as past events or unreal thoughts, andimaginations enter his mind and totally capture and preoccupy him. In asituation like this, the wayfarer must remain firm like a majestic mountain,and with the sword of invocation cut off every thought that comes to hismind and causes distraction. In situations like this, invocation consists ofnone other than Divine Names, upon one of which the wayfarer mustturn and focus his attention whenever his mind is distracted by thosememories. He must meditate upon a particular Divine Name ceaselesslyand focus upon it outwardly and inwardly (with his heart and his eye)until those memories are forced out of the abode of his heart. This is a verysound method to keep out thoughts solely with the help ofdhikr,which isnone other than remembrance of one of the Divine Names. God, Exaltedis He, has said:Verily, those who fear God, when a visitation from Satan trou-bles them, they do but remember All ̄ah and behold them seers.(7:201)In a treatise attributed to the late [ ̄Ayatull ̄ah Sayyid Mahd ̄ ı ibnÒHasan] BaÓhr al-⁄Ul ̄um15this practice has not been permitted.

According to BaÓhr al-⁄Ul ̄um: Many spiritual masters teach [their disciples] that the processof thought control should be carried out with the help of invo-cation(dhikr).Obviously, what is meant by invocation is med-itation and concentration on the heart, and not verbal invoca-tion for which the term litany (wird)is used. This is verydangerous. For the reality of the invocation consists of atten-tion to the Beloved and concentration on His Beauty from adistance. The vision of the Beloved is permissible only whenthe eye is completely blind to anything other than Him; for theBeloved is jealous (ghay ̄ur) and His jealousy (ghayrat, Arabıcghayrah)implies that it is not proper for the eye that sees Himto see anything other than Him. He will inflict with blindnessany eye that turns away from Him to view someone or some-thing else. Beholding Him while viewing other than Him is inconflict with His ghayrah.If seeing other than Him is repeated,it will amount to His contempt. The Beloved will respond bydelivering such a strong blow on one’s neck that he would loseboth his hat and head.And he who is blind to the remembrance of the Beneficent, Weassign unto him a Satan for companionship. (43:36)BaÓhr al-⁄Ul ̄um nevertheless states that:only one kind of invocation is permissible in the process ofpracticing thought control; and that is the type of invocationwhose objective is not to see the Beloved’s Beauty, but todrive away the Satan, like a person who wants to expel an in-truder from the meeting place with his beloved.

In such a case,the method used is that if a thought distracts the mind fromconcentration in such a manner that it becomes difficult to dis-pel it by other means, only then may one invoke Divine Namesin order to expel those thoughts. However, the method used bythose who have actualized their potentials on the Way andthose conscious wayfarers who have attained the ultimateunion [with the Beloved] is that in the process of teaching andguiding the novice, the spiritual guide should first instruct himto exercise mind control and then proceed to invocation. Toteach mind control, such masters instruct the traveler to con-centrate on a tangible object such as a stone or a piece of woodwith one’s inward and outward faculties and refrain as much aspossible from blinking the eye. It is better that one practice thismethod continuously for forty days after the obligatory morn-ing and night prayers and recite the threefold litanies of askingGod for refuge (isti ⁄ ̄adhah), asking God for forgiveness(istighf ̄ar),and the formula, O Active (Y ̄a Fa ⁄ ̄al) during that pe-riod. After this, the novice must focus on his heart and con-tinue this practice for some time, concentrating on it fully andnot allowing any other thought into his mind. Should anythought still distract his mind during the course of this prac-tice, he should take recourse in the Divine Name(All ̄ah)andthe formula “There is no existence except God” (l ̄a mawj ̄udaill‹all ̄ah). The traveler must be persistent in this exercise untilthere emerges in his mind a quality of selflessness (b ̄ ıkhud ̄ ı).BaÓhr al-⁄Ul ̄um further recommends thatthe appropriate prayer during this process is continuous recita-tion of the istighf ̄arand y ̄a Fa ⁄ ̄alformulae and the Divine NameO Expander (y ̄a Bas ̄ ıÓt).When the wayfarer reaches this stage, heis then permitted to complete the remaining phases of thoughtcontrol by imaginative silent invocation upon his soul(dhikr-inafs ̄ ı-yi khay ̄al ̄ ı)until his mind is totally cleansed and purified.BaÓhr al-⁄Ul ̄um concludes that, God willing, preoccupation withmemories and thoughts will gradually disappear as one advancesfurther in the process of contemplation and invocation.Faghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 117Differentiated Description of the Path Toward God117"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"It should be known that this method of mind control that BaÓhr al-⁄Ul ̄um has mentioned here is adopted from the practice in the Naqshband ̄ ıorder.

The founder and spiritual guide(murshid) of theorder was Khaw ̄ajah Muhammad Naqshband, hence the name of theorder, the Naqshband ̄ ıyyah.16The approach of the late ̄Akh ̄undMull ̄a ÒHusayn-Qul ̄ ı Hamad ̄an ̄ı,may God be pleased with him, was different. He and his disciples did notprescribe mind control without the practice of invocation. Rather, theirmethod was based on constant attention and seriousness and attentivenessin different phases of it. Earlier we referred to this practice briefly. Here weshall discuss it in more detail.The primary requirement ofmur ̄aqabahfor the traveler is to abstainfrom that which is forbidden by the Shar ̄ ı ⁄ah (muÓharram ̄at), and observeall obligatory religious duties(w ̄ajib ̄at), and never procrastinate in thesematters. The second step is the intensification ofmur ̄aqabah,wherein thetraveler makes every effort to assure that his acts are for God’s pleasureonly, and to refrain from matters that are considered vain and frivolous.When he completes this stage; it will become a possibility for him andwhereafter he will not be captured by anxiety or panic, and self-control willbecome his second nature(malakah).The third phase ofmur ̄aqabahis that the wayfarer constantly seesGod with himself and watchful over him, and gradually realizes that God,the Almighty, is present and watchful everywhere and concerned about allcreatures. This aspect ofmur ̄aqabahmust be observed in all states and atall times.The fourth and final stage is a higher and more exalted one than thethird stage. In this stage the traveler sees God’s presence and in an undiffer-entiated manner observes Divine Beauty.

It has been reportedthat one day someone knocked at his door. When asked who it was, thevisitor told him to open the door as he had business to conduct with him.When the late ̄Aq ̄a Sayyid ⁄Al ̄ ı opened the door, he saw a man whose ap-pearance revealed that he was a weaver. When asked what he wanted, theweaver told him: “Such and such judgment that you had issued in favor ofa person concerning the ownership of such and such property on the basisof the testimony of witnesses was not correct; and that the said property—in fact—belonged to a minor, an orphan.” He then added that the deed ofthat property was buried in such and such location.The weaver also told Sayyid ⁄Al ̄ ı ̄Aq ̄a that: “The path that you haveadopted is not the right one; this path is not for you.” ̄Ayatull ̄ah Sh ̄ushtar ̄ ıasked the man whether he had committed any wrongdoing or followedthe wrong way.

The following night the weaver again knocked at hisdoor and told him: “The true path is not the one on which you are travel-ing.” The third night the same episode was repeated in precisely the samemanner. This time the weaver also told him to sell his house and all hisbelongings as soon as possible, and go to the city of Najaf in Iraq andcarry on the tasks that he will assign to him.

The weaver gavehim some more instructions and disappeared. The late ̄Ayatull ̄ah took res-idence in Najaf Ashraf and carried out the weaver’s instructions until hereached a station that words cannot describe. May God be pleased withhim and may His peace be upon him.In Najaf Ashraf, out of reverence for Shaykh MurtaÓd ̄a AnÓs ̄ar ̄ ı,17 ̄Ayat-ull ̄ah Sh ̄ushtar ̄ ı attended the Shaykh’s lectures on jurisprudence (fiqh) andPrinciples (uÓs ̄ul).In return, Shaykh AnÓs ̄ar ̄ ı also went to Sh ̄ushtar ̄ ı’s class onethics. When Shaykh AnÓ s ̄ar ̄ ı, may God have mercy on him, passed away,Sh ̄ushtar ̄ ı, may God have mercy on him, took charge of the Shaykh’s chairand continued the lectures where the Shaykh had left. However, he did notlive for very long and after six months departed toward God’s eternalmercy. Once during that period, the late Sh ̄ushtar ̄ ı sent a message to one ofthe most outstanding pupils of Shaykh AnÓ s ̄ar ̄ ı, named ̄Akh ̄undMull ̄aÒHusayn-Qul ̄ ı Dargaz ̄ ın ̄ı Hamad ̄an ̄ı. Hamad ̄an ̄ı knew Sh ̄ushtar ̄ ı whileShaykh AnÓ s ̄ar ̄ ı was still alive and had benefited from his courses in ethicsand gnosis. He planned to continue teaching the same subjects thatShaykh AnÓs ̄ar ̄ ı had taught, and had compiled the Shaykh’s lectures and dis-courses. In that message ̄Ayatull ̄ah Sh ̄ushtar ̄ ı reminded Hamad ̄an ̄ı that thatposition (teaching) was not a perfect one for him, and that he should aimat attaining higher stations. This message transformed Hamad ̄an ̄ı andguided him to the abode of the truth.At any rate, the late ̄Akh ̄undHamad ̄an ̄ı, who had studied sacred sci-ences under the late ̄Aq ̄a Sayyid ⁄Al ̄ ı several years before the death of thelate Shaykh AnÓs ̄ar ̄ ı became one of the wonders of his time and superior tohis contemporaries in the fields of ethics, spiritual struggle, and sacred sci-ences. Moreover, he trained several outstanding disciples, each of whomwas considered a citadel of gnosis and a manifestation of Divine Unity.Among his most eminent pupils one can mention the late ÒH ̄ajj M ̄ırz ̄aJaw ̄ad ̄Aq ̄a Malik ̄ ı Tabr ̄ ız ̄ ı, the late ̄Aq ̄a Sayyid AÓhmad Karbal ̄a‹ ̄ ı Tihr ̄an ̄ı,the late ̄Aq ̄a Sayyid Muhammad Sa⁄ ̄ ıd ÒHubb ̄ub ̄ ı, and the late ÒH ̄ajj ShaykhMuhammad Bah ̄ar ̄ ı.Our revered teacher and master, the unrivaled gnostic, the late ÒH ̄ajjM ̄ırz ̄a ⁄Al ̄ ı ̄Aq ̄a Q ̄aÓd ̄ ı Tabr ̄ ız ̄ ı, may God be pleased with him, belonged tothe circle of pupils of the late ̄Aq ̄a Sayyid AÓhmad Karbal ̄a‹ ̄ ı.

As to the identity of theweaver and his connections or the source of his knowledge and instruc-tions, nothing is known.18Like our grand master and teacher ̄Akh ̄undMull ̄a ÒHusayn-Qul ̄ ı, theapproach of our master and teacher the late ̄Aq ̄a Q ̄aÓd ̄ ı Tabr ̄ ız ̄ ı, was basedon awareness and knowledge of the self(ma ⁄rifat al-nafs). In the initialstages, he always prescribed concentration on one’s soul in order to gaincontrol over mind and thought. According to his instruction, every day anovice traveler must devote a certain amount of time, half an hour ormore, just to concentrate on his soul and practice to control his mind andthought. As a result of this concentration, slowly he would gain [spiritual]strength and thoughts and other mental preoccupations will disappear.Gradually, he would attain knowledge of his soul, and God willing, wouldultimately reach his desired spiritual destination.Most aspirants who have succeeded in liberating their mind andcleaning and purifying it from memories and ordinary preoccupations toprepare it for the rise of the Kingdom of Gnosis(sulÓt ̄an-i ma ⁄rifat), havedone so in one of the two following states. The first is during recitation ofthe Glorious Qur‹ ̄an, contemplating and wondering who the actual reciterof the Qur‹ ̄an is, and ultimately feeling [being revealed to] that the reciteris none other than God Himself, Majestic is His Glory.Second is by pleading to (tawassul) and seeking the intercession ofÒHaÓdrat Ab ̄a ‘Abd All ̄ah al-ÒHusayn, may God’s blessing and peace be uponhim, because he is graciously instrumental in lifting the veil and removingthe obstacles on the path of God for the wayfarer.As was mentioned in our discussion in previous pages, two factorsplay important parts in the theophany of the Kingdom of Gnosis. Thefirst is constant attention (mur ̄aqabah) in its various forms and degrees ofintensity; and second is concentration on the soul. When the travelermakes every effort to focus his attention on these two principles, graduallyhe will realize that the multiplicities of this world originate from and arenurtured by one wellspring, and anything that finds existence in the worldderives its existence from one source. Any degree of light, beauty, glory,and perfection that may be present in any existing thing is derived fromthat single source that gives it the light of life, beauty, and majesty in ac-cordance with its inherent capability(q ̄abil ̄ ıyat-i m ̄ahuw ̄ ı).

Then he realizes that what-ever actions that take place in the external world derive from and are sup-ported by himself. In other words, his soul is the source of all his [external]acts. Soon, however, he realizes that his soul subsists in the Divine Beingand is only a gate for emanation of Divine Mercy and Grace; and therefore,all acts in the external world are supported by His Sacred Being.The second realmis the world of Unity of Attributes (TawÓh ̄ ıd-i ÓSif ̄at)and is revealed after the first realm. In this realm when the traveler hears,he does not regard the reality of hearing to belong to himself, but to God.Similarly, whatever he sees with his eyes, he perceives the reality of his sightas belonging to God. In short, he realizes that every kind of knowledge,power, life, hearing, sight, and everything else that he notices in the exis-tent things in the external world all emanate from and subsist in God, Ex-alted is He.The third realmis the world of Unity of Names (TawÓh ̄ ıd-i Asm ̄a‹)andit emerges after the second world. In this realm, the traveler understandsthat [Divine] Attributes subsist in His Essence. For example, he realizesthat only God, Exalted is He, is the [real] Knower (⁄ ̄Alim), the Powerful(Q ̄adir),and the Living ( ÒHayy).In other words, he realizes that his ownknowledge is, in fact, God’s knowledge; and believes that his power, hear-ing, and sight all belong to God and are in God. In general, he understandsthat in the entire universe there is only One who is Powerful, Knowing,Seeing, and Living and that is God, Glorious is He; and that every existentthing, in proportion to its own existential reality, alludes to and reflects acertain degree of the reality of the All-Knowing,the All-Powerful,the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing,and the Living.The fourth realmis the world of Unity of Essence (TawÓh ̄ ıd dar Dh ̄at),which is higher than the third realm and is revealed to the wayfarer throughthe theophany of the Divine Essence. That is to say, the traveler realizes thatthe Essence by which all acts, attributes, and names are supported is Oneone line shortFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 123Differentiated Description of the Path Toward God123"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Essence and One Reality in which they all subsist. At this point, the way-farer is no longer concerned about Attributes and Names but solely withthe Essence. This is realized only when he bids farewell to and leaves be-hind his derivative existence (wuj ̄ud-i ⁄ ̄ariyah wa maj ̄az ̄ ı) and loses hisidentity and selfhoodonce and for all and annihilates them in the SacredEssence of God, Exalted is He. This is the point of the theophany of theEssence. Of course, to name this station as the station of the Essence(maq ̄am-i dh ̄at), the reality of the Essence (Óhaq ̄ ıqat-i dh ̄at), or Unicity(aÓhad ̄ ıyat) or any other name is a waste of time and a meaningless and fu-tile effort. For whatever can be expressed by the tongue or written by thepen is not beyond definition. Whereas the Sacred Divine Essence is aboveall definitions. One cannot find a proper name or description for It, norcan It be conceived in terms of states and stations. In fact, it is even beyondthe boundaries of inability, for while inability implies negation, it still setsa limit for Him, and God the Almighty is above all limitations. When thetraveler enters this realm, he loses his own identity and selfhood. He will notknow himself, nor will he recognize any other person. In short, he will notknow anyone except God, because ultimately only God can know Himself.In the process of his journey in each of the fourfold realms, the trav-eler loses a part of his identity and selfhood—ultimately losing his totalbeing and existence. In the first abode where he reaches the station of an-nihilation in the Act, he realizes that it is not he, but God, who acts. Heloses all signs of his effects pertaining to action. In the second realm,thanks to the theophany of Divine Attributes, the traveler understandsthat knowledge, power, and all other qualities are exclusive to the DivineEssence, Glorious and Exalted. At this point he loses his own attributesand no longer sees any trace of them in himself. In the third realm, as a re-sult of the theophany of the Divine Names, the traveler understands thatit is God, the Glorious, who is the Knower and the Powerful. Here he loseshis names and no longer finds them in himself. Finally, in the fourthabode, which is the realm of the theophany of Essence, the wayfarer loseshis own existence and dispossesses his essence. He no longer sees himself,for the only essence that he sees is the Sacred Essence of God.This phase of witnessing, that is, the theophany of the Essence, is re-ferred to by gnostics as the Griffin (⁄Anq ̄a)or (S ̄ ımurgh),a mythical birdthat no hunter can trap. The S ̄ ımurghis that Pure Essence and AbsoluteBeing, which is called variously the world of Non-Being (⁄ ̄alam-i ⁄am ̄a‹),the Hidden Treasure(kanz-i makhf ̄ ı), the Invisible of all invisibles(ghaybFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 124one line short124Differentiated Description of the Path Toward God"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"al-ghuy ̄ub), and the Essence that has no name and no identity (dh ̄at m ̄a l ̄aisma lah ̄u wa l ̄a rasma lah ̄u).For another bird, go and set this snare, for the Griffin has a nest on inaccessible heights.It is interesting to see how well ÒH ̄afiÔz, may God’s mercy be upon him, de-scribed this profound [metaphysical] truth in his poetry and explained itin such a powerful metaphorical fashion in the following mathnaw ̄ ı:iQGO ¬fGO ônc ¬æH ≈eGO É«HiQGO ¬fÉÑfG QO ¬ ̧ ∂dÉ°S iG ¬c≈æ«°ûf √Q iófQ âØnc ¢ûØ£d ¬H≈æ«eRô°S QO ihôgQ iRhQ ¬cÉfÉªg õncôg ó°ûf º°TƒeGôaÉfGO Ò>RG OÉj â°ùg ºæ«æ ̧º«fGƒJQG º«jƒéH ºg OGôeº«fGóH ônμjóμj ∫ÉM ÉJ É«H¢ù>RG h ¢û«>RG Úªc âeGO h OO¢ùc ≈HhO ,¿GOôncô°S hO h É¡æJhO≈jÉæ°TBG øjóæ ̧ â°SƒJ ÉH Gôe≈jÉéc ≈°ûMh iƒgBG ’G¬fÉ«°TBG â°SG óæ∏HGQ É≤æY ¬c¬fôncO ÆôeôH ΩGO øjGhôHone line shortFaghfoory: Kernel of the Kernelpage 125Differentiated Description of the Path Toward God125"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Lo!
