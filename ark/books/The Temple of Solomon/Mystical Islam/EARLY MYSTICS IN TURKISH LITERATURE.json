D."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"viiiFOREWORDPerhaps the greatest testament to the importance of Mehmed Fuad Köprülü’sTürk edebiyatında ilk mutasavvıflar (Early Mystics in Turkish Literature) is the remarkabledegree to which it has shaped, during the nearly 90 years since its publication,both popular and learned ideas about the historical links between religious andliterary currents in Central Asia and their counterparts in Anatolia. Ironically,therein lies also the key to both the positive and negative aspects of the work’sscholarly legacy: it led the way in exploring the impact, in Anatolian Turkishsociety, of Central Asian Turkic religious and literary developments, yet in sodoing it helped to cement a tendency to view Central Asia through an Anatolianprism, rather than on its own terms and through its own sources. The factthat such a tendency was only exacerbated by the long isolation of Central Asia,and of the sources of its religious history, during most of the twentieth centurycan hardly be blamed on Köprülü’s work, of course. In a sense, Early Mystics maybe regarded as the first substantial statement of a “western” perspective on thecontinuities and discontinuities of Central Asian and Anatolian cultures, and thisstatement should have followed, or prompted, an equally substantial statementfrom an “eastern” perspective; the isolation of Central Asia during the Sovietera, however, and the impact of Soviet ideology – which stunted the academicstudy of religious life and straitjacketed the evaluation of “national” literature –ensured that there was no significant response to Köprülü’s work from a CentralAsian perspective. We are thus left with only one voice from what might havebeen, and should have been, an ongoing dialogue; and precisely because ofthe prominence of that one voice, and the expectation it fostered that Turkiccivilization in Central Asia could be understood on Anatolian Turkish terms, afundamental imbalance remains.Having spent considerable time with Köprülü’s Early Mystics while working onmy own study of the Yasawc nefc tradition, I had some misgivings when I firstlearned that plans were under way to prepare an English translation of the book.I had decided early on that a fresh approach to the Yasawc tradition was longoverdue, and that a new evaluation of that tradition would require starting fromthe ground up, with a substantially enlarged body of sources, new questionsto ask of them, and a willingness to challenge everything that had become the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ix“accepted wisdom” about Armad Yasawc and his legacy; revising or updatingKöprülü was precisely not the way to proceed. I am still firmly convinced of this,and I hope that the results of my efforts will soon be available; but I also becameconvinced that Köprülü’s work had attained an iconic status that made it essen-tial to acknowledge and take stock of the assumptions, arguments, and conclu-sions advanced in the book, even if wholly in the context of rejecting or challengingthem. Simply put, Köprülü’s Early Mystics underlies, in some measure, nearly everytreatment of the Yasawc nefc tradition in both scholarly and popular literaturethat has appeared during the past 85 years; while I believe it should no longer beregarded as authoritative, its influence is undeniable, and having it available inEnglish translation might underscore the usefulness of a fresh evaluation of where,in my view, Köprülü had gone astray, and where his pioneering work was still ofvalue. I also recognize that Köprülü himself, naturally, was not to blame for theoften uncritical repetition of his views that came to dominate scholarship, especiallyin Turkey, on the Yasawc tradition, and that there would be merit in revisitingwhat, precisely, Köprülü said and what he did not say – not only from a his-toriographical standpoint, but from the standpoint of marshalling evidence andarguments for or against particular aspects of Köprülü’s treatment – and in thisway resuming that interrupted dialogue.So, when Gary Leiser and Robert Dankoff graciously asked me to contributea foreword to the present English translation (and thereby gave me the opportunityto review the entire work without wading again through the 1918-era Turkish),I readily agreed. My conviction that many of Köprülü’s views are in seriousneed of revision cannot lessen the impact of the book in its time, or the value ofmaking it more widely accessible through a translation that is both remarkablefor its clarity and an improvement, in many respects, over the original.It should be noted at the outset that my comments are necessarily restrictedto Köprülü’s treatment of the Yasawc tradition, to which less than half of EarlyMystics is devoted; I must leave it to others to assess the continued value ofKöprülü’s study of Yenus Emre and his oeuvre, which comprises the bulk of thework, and serves as its real, central focus, for which discussion of the Yasawctradition was preparatory. Yet Köprülü’s work has in many respects held a morecentral place in the study of the Yasawc tradition than in the study of YenusEmre and other Anatolian Turkish poets and nefcs; scholarship on the latter hasgrown steadily since the appearance of Early Mystics, but scholarly attention tothe legacy of Armad Yasawc largely stagnated for nearly 70 years, with few newsources brought to light, and few new approaches adopted, beyond what Köprülüalready employed. It is, moreover, in connection with the Yasawc tradition, andits presumed legacy in Anatolia, that the absence of a Central Asian perspectivehas been particularly unfortunate, and that imbalance of voices referred to abovemay in itself justify limiting my remarks to the Yasawc tradition.The pioneering character of Köprülü’s work was evident soon after itspublication, in its warm reception by European scholars; the remarkable rangeof summaries and reviews in European languages attests to the interest andFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"xadmiration the work evoked. It had less impact, initially, in Turkey, as is dis-cussed in the preface to the work’s second edition, in Latin script (which appearedonly in 1966, nearly half a century after the original publication), but its reputa-tion and influence grew along with Köprülü’s status as the pre-eminent scholarof Turkey’s new republican era. Köprülü himself understood the work as animportant model for the application of critical methods developed in Europeanscholarship, and he stressed the value of the many primary sources first broughtto light in Early Mystics; the methods adopted and the sources utilized remainamong the most important and enduring contributions of the work (far more thanspecific arguments and conclusions), and Köprülü’s achievement is all the moreremarkable when we consider that he was only 28 years old when he completed it.Ironically, some of the clearest reminders of the pioneering character ofKöprülü’s work are to be found among the most obsolete of his long footnotes.When he wrote, he could not draw upon an extensive scholarly literature on nefcmystical philosophy, or on the history of the Turks, or on Central Asian poetry;such issues had not been explored, in some cases, any more thoroughly than hadthe life and legacy of Armad Yasawc, and while few would today cite much ofthe secondary literature he was compelled to consider on these and other subjects,much of which has been entirely superseded, we must acknowledge the breadthof his scholarship, as he addressed issues into which few had ventured beforehim, often supplementing his references to the relatively rare scholarly treat-ments of these topics with explorations in primary sources that up to his timehad remained largely unexamined. The same need to prepare ground that thenremained unworked no doubt reduced the time and space he could devote to themore specific subjects of his work; if we wish that Köprülü had delved moredeeply into specific narratives or issues raised in the work, for example, we mustremember that he felt constrained to deal with literary and religious develop-ments and currents for which a few citations to standard treatments not yetcreated in 1918 would suffice today.With due homage to the work and its impact, however, it will perhaps beuseful to outline what were, in my view, the chief shortcomings in Köprülü’sEarly Mystics, and to indicate where and how the most substantial correctionsor additions to Köprülü’s presentation are to be made; doing so will not onlysuggest where scholarship has gone since his work appeared – or, more often,where it still needs to go – but also suggest the extent to which the flaws in thebook were virtually inevitable given the state of scholarship at the time it wasproduced, rather than the result of scholarly deficiencies on Köprülü’s part.To begin with, there is little point in faulting Köprülü for the frequent nation-alist tone in the work, and the emphasis upon asserting the intrinsically Turkishcharacter of the cultural trends he sought to trace from Anatolia back to CentralAsia; he was quite open about the “national” purpose of his endeavor, insistingthat the “popular nefc literature” he believed was represented by both ArmadYasawc and Yenus Emre was an important element of the distinctive “nationalcharacter” of the Turks, whose noble cultural heritage had been too longFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xisubmerged, first by the dominance of Persian influence and later by Europeaninfluence. While we may disagree with that stance, with the conscious insertionof such views into scholarly research, and with specific approaches or conclusionsor judgments that seem to arise from these ideological foundations rather thanfrom a sober assessment of the sources, Köprülü was straightforward abouthis agenda, and readers can easily ignore or suspend the obviously nationalistinterpretations while still profiting from his analysis and the sources he adduced.It is also to Köprülü’s credit that he called, in his preface, for his work tobe received as “a modest guide for future research”; this reminds us that he ishardly to be held accountable for what was perhaps the most unfortunate andpernicious aspect of his work’s legacy, namely the slavish repetition of his viewsand the material he brought forward. No doubt Köprülü himself would havebeen dismayed at the elevation of his work as an unassailable scholarly icon, andat the tendency of later scholars to cite his “guide” as the final word on manysubjects; at its worst, this tendency has led many writers to ignore, and therebydishonor, Köprülü’s own example of seeking and bringing to light new primarysources, and has even seemed to discourage the re-examination of sourcesalready consulted by Köprülü, as if nothing more could be learned from them.Again, Köprülü can scarcely be criticized because the pioneering character ofhis work prompted the uncritical repetition of his views, and the wide-scaleneglect, especially among Turkish scholars, of sources on the Yasawc traditionbeyond those already cited by Köprülü; yet because so much of the subsequentdiscussion of Armad Yasawc and of the Yasawc tradition is simply derivative anduninspired, it is inevitable that a critique of the prevailing views will be targetedat Köprülü’s Early Mystics, the source, rather than at the more easily dismissiblerehashings of his work.By far the most important factor limiting the value of Köprülü’s presentationof the Yasawc tradition (including the life and legacy of the tradition’s eponym)was one largely beyond his control or remedy, namely his lack of access to thevast majority of essential sources produced in Central Asia among Yasawc nefccommunities and their Naqshbandc and Kubrawc rivals. For his material onYasawc history and the life of Armad Yasawc, Köprülü’s chief source was amanuscript, preserved in the library of Istanbul University, that contains, I believe,two works from the late sixteenth century by a Yasawc shaikh known as lazcnc,a native of litar (west of Dushanbe in present-day Tajikistan) who establishedhimself in Istanbul;1 in addition, Köprülü made extensive use of the importantNaqshbandc hagiographical compilation from the beginning of the sixteenthcentury, the RashaRAt-i “ain al-RayAt (though only through an Ottoman translationfrom the end of the same century), as well as a few small treatises producedin Central Asian Naqshbandc circles, and he had access to the sixteenth-centurypoetic anthology of Khwaja lasan “Nitharc” Bukharc, the Mudhakkir-i aRbAb,which includes interesting material on the Yasawc tradition. He was also able toconsult a printed version of an important popular hagiography devoted to lakcmAta, a figure typically cast as one of Armad Yasawc’s chief disciples. Otherwise,FOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xiiKöprülü relied on Bektashc narratives about Armad Yasawc as well as on Ottomanaccounts claiming Armad Yasawc’s spiritual ancestry of various Anatoliansaints, and, of course, on the collection of poetry ascribed to Armad Yasawc, theDCwAn-i Likmat.These sources retain their importance for the study of Yasawc history, butentire Yasawc lineages, and entire narrative cycles surrounding Armad Yasawc,would remain unknown (as they were to Köprülü) without access to a host ofother works. At the top of the list of sources whose absence from Köprülü’spurview severely limited his treatment of the Yasawc tradition is undoubtedly themost important single source on Yasawc history, the LamaRAt min nafaRAt al-quds,completed in 1035/1626 by an important Yasawc shaikh, Murammad al-‘flimal-niddcqc al-‘Alawc, known as ‘flim Shaikh of ‘Alcyabad; this work, thoughoccasionally cited from manuscript or lithograph copies, and published in facsimilein 1986,2 remains largely unexplored, but is of vital importance for the history ofthe Yasawc nefc communities of Mawarannahr (Transoxiana), and for traditionsabout Armad Yasawc himself.3Köprülü was also unaware of several sources produced before the sixteenthcentury, i.e. before the RashaRAt, whose account of the Yasawc silsila (genealogy ofspiritual affiliation) shaped the presentation found in nearly every subsequentsource produced outside Yasawc circles themselves. For instance, Köprülü wroteEarly Mystics without consulting the important Chaghatay Turkic work of Mcr‘Alc-Shcr Nawa’c, the NasA”im al-maRabba, a translation, with additions (includingprecisely the valuable accounts of the Turkic shaikhs), of Jamc’s NafaRAt al-uns;Köprülü later learned of Nawa’ c’s work and wrote a brief article outlining itsinformation on saints of the Yasawc tradition,4 but its material was not incorpor-ated into, or even acknowledged in, later editions of Early Mystics. Köprülü wasalso unfamiliar with many other works, of hagiographical and doctrinal orienta-tion, produced within various nefc communities of Central Asia during thefourteenth and fifteenth centuries, which must be taken into consideration whenoutlining this early phase of Yasawc history; of special importance are worksproduced within Khwajaganc communities, precursors to the Naqshbandiyya,which shed crucial light on the extremely complicated question of the relation-ship between the Yasawc and Naqshbandc traditions.Another extremely important early source on the Yasawc tradition is the Turkicwork of Israq Khwaja, the son of Isma‘cl Ata, which survives in two redactions,one of which bears the title LadCqat al-“ArifCn. This work, from the middle ofthe fourteenth century, is not only an important (and still virtually unknown)example of Central Asian Turkic prose, but is a vitally important source on oneprominent nefc community that traced its origins to Armad Yasawc. Manu-scripts of the two redactions are preserved in Tashkent and Kabul, and a frag-ment of the work, preserved in Uppsala, was mentioned by Köprülü in his laterarticle on Armad Yasawc in the Turkish edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam.5 Theimportant Kabul manuscript was noted briefly by Zeki Velidi Togan,6 but theTashkent copies have not even been described in a published catalogue (I firstFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiiilearned of them in 1984 while working in Tashkent, and published an article in1990 citing one copy;7 I have noted the work in two other articles on the Yasawctradition,8 and another copy has been cited in works by Ashirbek Muminov,9 buta full discussion of the work will appear in my forthcoming study of the Yasawctradition). The Isma‘cl Ata’c tradition reflected in the two redactions of this workis in fact reflected in a wide range of Central Asian hagiographical works producedfrom the fifteenth century to the nineteenth, but was completely unknown toKöprülü, and remains largely unknown in scholarship that has looked to Köprülüfor the last word on the Yasawc tradition; its study offers many correctives to ourunderstanding of Yasawc history, however, and I would argue that the work ofIsraq Khwaja b. Isma‘cl Ata should, and will, displace the problematical DCwAn-iLikmat as the most prominent Turkic-language legacy of the Yasawc tradition.Considering its continued obscurity, Köprülü can hardly be faulted for notknowing the work of Israq Khwaja, and the LamaRAt too appears not to berepresented in the rich manuscript collections of Istanbul; nevertheless, eitherone of these sources alone adds sufficient new material, and new perspectives, torender much of Köprülü’s treatment of Yasawc history utterly obsolete.While the body of sources produced within other (i.e. non-Isma‘cl Ata’c) Yasawclineages of Central Asia is not large, these sources too are obviously importantfor an internal perspective on the Yasawc tradition; none of them, however, wasknown to Köprülü. The earliest such work, produced within the best-knownYasawc silsila, is a treatise in defense of the vocal dhikr (remembrance of God ina nefc séance), the Ta“lCm al-dhAkirCn, completed in 947/1541, by a disciple of thepivotal Yasawc shaikh Khudaidad, and preserved in manuscript in St Petersburgand Bukhara; the corpus of specifically Yasawc hagiographical literature fromCentral Asia includes, beyond the LamaRAt, the Lujjat al-dhAkirCn of MawlanaMurammad Sharcf of Bukhara, completed in 1080/1669 –70 (represented inmanuscript collections of St Petersburg, Tashkent, and Istanbul), as well as theManAqib al-akhyAr, produced in 1036/1626 within a lineage descended spirituallyas well as naturally from the Yasawc saint Sayyid Ata, and known from twomanuscript copies, in London and Rampur.10Yet another body of important “internal” Yasawc sources is the larger reper-toire of works, in Persian and Turkic, by the same lazcnc who wrote the TurkicJawAhir al-abrAr and the acephalous Persian work preserved in the manuscriptfrom the library of Istanbul University that Köprülü used long ago; that manu-script has now been published11 (the JawAhir in transcription, the Persian work infacsimile), but lazcnc’s other works remain unpublished. They include the earlyJAmi“ al-murshidCn (in Persian, commissioned in Damascus by ‘Alc Chelebc Qïnalï-zade (d. 979/1572), finished in 972/1564 –5, and preserved in a unique manu-script in Berlin); the Lujjat al-abrAr (in Persian, completed in 996/1588, andpreserved in a unique manuscript in Paris, which contains also other short worksby lazcnc of biographical interest but less important for Yasawc history); and theTurkic Manba“ al-abRAr (written in 995/1587, preserved in a single manuscript inthe Süleymaniye Library in Istanbul).FOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xivLater non-Yasawc hagiographical works produced in Central Asia are alsovital for tracing the Yasawiyya into the middle of the eighteenth century (when itessentially disappears from our sources as a distinct nefc community); chief amongthese are the ThamarAt al-mashA”ikh from late seventeenth-century Bukhara; theAshjAr al-khuld, completed in 1139/1726 by a Kashmcrc author; the Tadhkira-iOAhir HshAn, compiled by a Khwarazmian author from the mid-eighteenth cen-tury; and the untitled work of Mcr Musayyab Bukharc, from the middle of thenineteenth century. Most of these works are preserved only in manuscripts heldin collections of the former Soviet Union, and were thus long inaccessible toscholars from outside the USSR; they were also generally uninteresting to Sovietscholars, given Soviet attitudes to religious matters, and the resulting neglect ofsuch sources, which continued into the 1980s, was clearly as much a factor in theslow pace of Yasawc studies as the dominance of Köprülü’s presentation of theYasawc tradition.To these sources, finally, we may add the growing body of texts reflectinggenealogical traditions linked to the family of Armad Yasawc; these texts,preserved chiefly in private hands in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, have onlyrecently begun to be discovered and published, thanks largely to the efforts oflocal scholars (above all Ashirbek Muminov and Zikiriya Zhandarbekov).Perhaps less consequential than the many primary sources unknown to Köprülü,but worth noting in any case, was his lack of access to important publications inRussian, in which the most substantial information on Central Asia, and on theYasawc tradition there, available in the years preceding the completion of EarlyMystics was published; Russian, naturally, was the language of scholarship inthe state to which Armad Yasawc’s homeland belonged when Köprülü waspreparing his work. Köprülü did occasionally have access to Russian scholarshipthrough translations into French (as in the case of Bekchurin’s importantdescription of the Yasawc shrine complex) or German (as with some of Barthold’sworks), but he could not consult, for example, the extensive discussions of Yasawc’sshrine and the practices related to it preserved in works of N. S. Lykoshin,and expressly lamented the inaccessibility of what was undoubtedly the mostimportant product of the pre-Köprülü phase in the study of the Yasawc tradition,the article of the Russian Orientalist K. G. Zaleman, in which he published,together with the entire text of an important and popular Turkic hagiographyon Armad Yasawc’s disciple lakcm Ata, excerpts from several Persian hagio-graphies dealing with Yasawc saints.12In addition to the essentially bibliographical shortcomings noted so far – whichone might reasonably argue were more than offset, for its time and for the firstserious, if tentative, examination of the Yasawc tradition, by the previouslyunstudied sources first introduced to scholarship in Early Mystics – there are otherproblems, of approach and method, that deserve to be noted.(I)In utilizing the material he was able to consult, Köprülü sought to applythe critical methods of European historical scholarship; in this he largely succeeded(though occasionally his handling of the sources is less than transparent), butFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xvinevitably, of course, the approaches and attitudes of 1918 seem dated today.This is especially true in the case of Köprülü’s approach to the material he castsas legendary; it combines a positivist historian’s clear demarcation of sourcesdeemed “legendary” from those deemed “historical,” on the one hand, with, attimes, a surprisingly uncritical attitude to sources of both (essentially artificial)classes. For instance, he immediately denounces the miraculous as a sign of amerely “legendary” narrative and source, but accepts straightforwardly storiesaffirming a relationship between two shaikhs, or presenting a chain of transmis-sion, or asserting a particular practice as normative; he seems not to have con-sidered that the retrospective construction of silsilas and relationships, for polemicalor even merely didactic purposes, might be as injurious to “historicity” as thepolemical or didactic use of miracle stories, and time and time again he missesopportunities to explore genuinely important and revealing historical issues byasking more fruitful questions of the rich narrative material to which he alludes(more fruitful, that is, than “did it really happen?”). In the same vein, he oftenlets literary merit and reputation cloud his approach to source criticism, as whenhe trusts the illustrious Jamc’s accounts from the NafaRAt al-uns over accountsby less exalted (or anonymous) hagiographers, without recognizing that Jamchimself adopted many of his accounts from precisely such hagiographical works(and often with evident disregard for fidelity to his source); likewise, one sensesthat Köprülü regarded “legends” recorded by Evliya Chelebi or Mutuafa ‘flcas somehow more valuable than their counterparts recorded in the anonymousvelAyetnAmes of Bektashc saints.We are fortunate, to be sure, that Köprülü had sufficient respect even for“legendary” sources, as evidence of the popular apprehension of a saint’s legacy,to recount the stories in his work (however much he abbreviated or “rationalized”the narratives); but by casting such narratives only as indications of a saint’spopular appeal, Köprülü evidently felt freed from the need to analyze themseriously, and so failed to explore the actual structure and content of the narrat-ives for clues to the issues that mattered to those who created and circulatedthe stories.At times, moreover, Köprülü’s handling of his sources is frustratingly vagueand imprecise. His presentations of Armad Yasawc’s “legendary” life, for instance,and many other expositions of narrative accounts, typically skip from one sourceto another without specifying which he is following at a given time; by failingeven to distinguish elements preserved in Bektashc tradition from those found inlazcnc’s work, Köprülü not only abdicated his own responsibility to contextualizeeach source and the material it adds to Armad Yasawc’s persona, but preventedeven his reader from taking up that task. Instead, he lumped together varioussources as “books of legends” and implied that their accounts are in agreement,or are fundamentally harmonizable: thereby he ignored, and obscured, theimportant historical evidence that may often be derived from the discrepanciesand contradictions among sources. A similar tendency is evident in his argumen-tation on literary history; he frequently insists, for example, that the “influence”FOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xviof one poet on another is “obvious,” and so never takes time to demonstrate it,or to explain the precise nature of the “influence” he has in mind.(II)The Anatolian Turkish prism used by Köprülü for viewing Central Asiawas noted at the outset of these remarks, but its consequences are worth fullerconsideration. His lack of knowledge of the history of Central Asia, and espe-cially of its religious history (above all in the period from the fifteenth century tothe nineteenth) is understandable given the time when he wrote, but it leftCentral Asia essentially a blank screen upon which Köprülü felt free to projectreligious, cultural, and literary developments known to him from Anatolia; inthis way he could insist that features of religious or cultural life among the Turksof Anatolia and the Ottoman realm that could not be traced to an essentialized“Islamic” source must go back, if not always to the pre-Islamic traditions of theTurkic nomads of the steppe (a source in fact invoked quite often), then at leastto the synthesis of Turkic and Islamic traditions (equally essentialized, in both cases)that Köprülü imagined had taken place in Central Asia. It is immediately evidentthat such an approach is faulty, but the reconstruction of Islam’s history in CentralAsia on the basis of such projections from the Turkish experience in Anatolia hasbeen far more common than the use of actual sources from Central Asia itself –certainly in Turkish scholarship, but also in European and American academiccircles, where familiarity with the Ottoman world was, and remains, far morewidespread than any direct acquaintance with Central Asia’s Islamic heritage.This approach continues to predominate among Turkish specialists, and colorsour understanding not only of the Yasawc tradition, but of the entire religioushistory of Central Asia as well. It was adopted even by scholars who followednot the views presented by Köprülü in Early Mystics (where he emphasized theYasawc tradition’s place in the mainstream of Sunnc nefc movements), but thosehe championed later, namely the notion that the Yasawc tradition, like theBektashiyya that supposedly sprang from it, was from its inception a “heterodox”movement shaped more by antinomian disregard for juridical norms, and by aneager receptivity to non-Islamic “influences,” than by “normative” Islam. Tosome extent it is Köprülü’s very use of such terms as “orthodox” and “heterodox”that is disturbing today, as students of Islamic religious history struggle to shakeoff the simple dichotomies such terms imply, but there is a more substantiveissue involved here even if we grant him his terminology: Köprülü was pavingthe way for projecting a “tainted” Islam, either rife with “shamanic” holdoversfrom pre-Islamic Turkic religion or colored by excessive compromises withpresumed “popular” religious tastes, as the wellspring of the Yasawc tradition,and, by extension, as the central religious profile of the Turks of Central Asia.Such a view is utterly indefensible from the standpoint of Central Asia’s religioushistory, and of the Yasawc tradition’s own sources, but it has nevertheless beenremarkably persistent in some scholarly circles (no doubt because it harmonizedwell with certain approaches to Islam in twentieth-century Turkey).(III)Through the sources he was able to use, his approach to those sources,and his lack of grounding in the Central Asian environment in which the YasawcFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xviitradition took shape, Köprülü in effect fixed in scholarly literature the key elementsof what became the standard view of Armad Yasawc’s life and legacy. Each ofthese elements would require extensive evidence, and extensive argumentation,to challenge; it may nevertheless be worthwhile briefly to review the mostimportant of them, and why they need revision, without here marshalling theevidence and arguments to be assembled elsewhere.(1)Chronology. Köprülü appears never to have questioned the reliability ofthe date, 562/1166 –7, given in some sources as that of Armad Yasawc’s death;at one point he credits “tradition” for this date, while elsewhere he claims that“all the different biographical dictionaries” are in agreement on this date. Ofthe sources Köprülü used, however, only the late (nineteenth-century) Indianhagiographical compendium of Ghulam Sarwar Lahawrc, the Khazinat al-aTfiyA,gives that date (neither the RashaRAt nor lazcnc gives any date at all); the datedoes appear in earlier sources unknown to Köprülü (though in none of Yasawcprovenance), but can be traced back no further than the second half of thesixteenth century (i.e. four centuries after the claimed date of the saint’s death).Köprülü’s lack of skepticism about this date, especially considering the source inwhich he must have found it, is remarkable; there has never been any goodreason to assume that it is reliable, and substantial evidence bespeaks a some-what later date for Armad Yasawc’s death. Nevertheless, Köprülü’s affirmationof 1166 –7 did much to entrench this date in subsequent literature ever morefirmly, and still today, following Köprülü’s example, scholars continue to makearguments about other issues – the political environment in which Armad Yasawclived, the reliability of specific traditions about his spiritual training, the linguisticand literary peculiarities of the poetry ascribed to him, the direction of literary orreligious influence, etc. – as if this date were incontrovertibly established.(2)Armad Yasawc’s family. In his discussion of the saint’s immediate fam-ily, Köprülü not only glossed over important, and telling, discrepancies betweenlazcnc’s account and that of the RashaRAt, for instance, but failed to consider theimpact of subsequent familial groupings on the presentations of Armad Yasawc’sfamily that came to be preserved in various sources. It is typical of Köprülü’streatment of the sources that lazcnc’s account of Armad Yasawc’s father, mother,and sister is accepted at face value, while the miracle tale for which these rela-tionships merely set the stage is relegated to the purely “legendary” material;a fruitful interpretation of hagiographical narratives, however, must not onlyexplore the historical circumstances reflected in accounts of the miraculous, butalso envision the possibility that specific formulations of familial connections, orof genealogy, or of spiritual lineages, might distort historical reality every bit asmuch as (or more than) miracle stories.(3)The role of Arslan Baba. Köprülü accepted the story that Armad Yasawcreceived his initial spiritual training from Arslan Baba, and regarded the latter asa historical nefc teacher. While Köprülü did not explicitly support some of themore egregious transformations of Arslan Baba – into a quasi-shamanic purveyorof pre-Islamic Turkic religious practices, or, more recently, into a representativeFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xviiiof a particular sectarian movement in Central Asia – his insistence that he was,in effect, a venerable teacher who trained Armad Yasawc in his youth helpedto set the tone of most subsequent treatments of Arslan Baba. In fact the extanttraditions about this figure most likely reflect very different religious currents,and it is quite unlikely that Arslan Baba should be thought of as a historicalnefc teacher.(4)Armad Yasawc’s spiritual training and nefc silsila. Köprülü acceptedthe story, found in the RashaRAt (and other sources), that Armad Yasawc’s nefcmaster was Yesuf Hamadanc, and that the latter was also the master of thespiritual ancestor of the Khwajagan and the Naqshbandiyya, ‘Abd al-KhaliqGhujduwanc. This in itself is not surprising, since nearly every scholar who hashad occasion to refer to Armad Yasawc’s place in nefc tradition has accepted thesame story. What is disturbing, however, is that Köprülü ignored the clearassertion by lazcnc that Armad Yasawc belonged to a Suhrawardc lineage (a pointunderscored by other “internal” Yasawc sources as well). The likelihood that theRashaRAt’s account reflected a contrivance to show Ghujduwanc’s superiority overYasawc seems clear enough from the story itself, but even if Köprülü did notthink to question this, he certainly should have acknowledged the possible signi-ficance of a quite different view of Armad Yasawc’s silsila affiliation, as found inthe very “internal” Yasawc source whose importance Köprülü rightly recognized;that he did not was clearly connected with his acceptance of the death-datediscussed above, and here we can begin to appreciate the web of interwovenassumptions and conjectures, which seem to support one another but in facthave no firm foundation, that fill Köprülü’s treatment of the Yasawc tradition.In fact, Armad Yasawc is portrayed as a pupil of at least two other shaikhs,besides Yesuf Hamadanc, and the tradition surrounding his relationship withYesuf Hamadanc is in many respects the most problematical of these, for a hostof chronological, historical, and textological reasons.(5)Armad Yasawc’s life as a nefc teacher. As noted, Köprülü weaves togethertraditions from several sources to create a seemingly seamless biography for thesaint; after returning to his hometown of Yasc/Turkistan and there training hisdisciples, the story goes, Armad Yasawc withdrew from worldly attachments atthe age of 63 and lived in his “retirement” cell (where he wrote much of hispoetry) until his death at an advanced age. Köprülü treats this as a relativelystraightforward account of the course of Armad Yasawc’s life, extracting it froma rich body of narratives circulated, in all likelihood, more to advance specificcompetitive or didactic agendas than to provide a simple biographical account;moreover, he presents it shorn of the miraculous elements he found so disturbing.For instance, what Köprülü interprets as the saint’s “retirement” is actuallypresented in the sources as his enclosure in a subterranean cell, in which hecontinues to perform various miracles; Köprülü mentions the miracles as part ofArmad Yasawc’s “legendary” life, assigns his “retirement” to his “historical” life,and invents the idea that he wrote his poetry in this historical retirement, withoutconsidering that the entire body of narratives might be explored not as a mixtureFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"xixof purely legendary elements and elements rooted in historical fact, but as amultivalent complex of symbols and traditions combined for specific religiouspurposes that did not include the confirmation of external biographical details.(6)The Yasawc order. Köprülü took it for granted that Armad Yasawc con-sciously intended to create a nefc order, which was maintained in an unbrokenline from the founder down to the latest affiliates Köprülü could find insources available to him; thus he assumed that the principles and practices of theorder outlined by lazcnc existed largely unchanged from the time of ArmadYasawc himself. In fact, the silsila of the Yasawc order known from the fifteenthto the eighteenth centuries is extremely problematical in its earliest phases,leaving the question of the order’s continuity, and the possible retrospectiveformulation of the silsila, fraught with uncertainty. To be sure, Köprülü’s treat-ment of the Yasawc order in Central Asia was perfunctory at best, comprisingless than a single page in his text, and the full ramifications of the variouslineages could have been understood only through the use of sources unavail-able to him; but it is unclear why Köprülü did not explore more carefully theinformation available to him in lazcnc’s acephalous Persian work, and in theRashaRAt, about the Yasawc silsila in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.(7)The Yasawc presence in Anatolia. Köprülü laid the foundations forthe most unfortunate aspect of what became the standard view of the Yasawctradition, namely the view that Armad Yasawc’s real legacy, both in nefism andin poetry, lay not in Central Asia, but in the Betkashc tradition of the westernTurkish cultural sphere, where it spread through the arrival, in the west, of“refugees” from the Mongol invasion. Köprülü was careful, in Early Mystics, todistance the historical Armad Yasawc from the later Bektashc tradition (and,indeed, to distance lajjc Bektash from that tradition); nevertheless, his emphasisupon Bektashc sources, and upon Anatolian traditions about saints incorporatedinto the Bektashc tradition, as the prime repository of Armad Yasawc’s memoryand legacy – an emphasis that was itself an artifact of the inaccessibility ofCentral Asian sources – served to cement the assumption that the way to studythe Yasawc tradition was to study the Bektashiyya, and more generally thecurrents of Anatolian nefism that were believed to have been shaped in CentralAsia. Inevitably, this tendency was only intensified by Köprülü’s much-heralded– but certainly, in my view, misguided – change of mind, when he concludedthat Anatolian works of Bektashc, laidarc, and Baba’c provenance were morereliable sources on Armad Yasawc and his legacy than were other works heimplicitly dismissed as dominated by Naqshbandc influence. This view, thoughchallenged in an important article,13 continues to shape the predominant under-standing of the Yasawc tradition in Turkish scholarship, and in much Europeanand American scholarship as well (it is perhaps best represented today in theworks of Ahmet Yazar Ocak and Irène Mélikoff ); it is at present a key obstacle,in my view, to improving our understanding of the Yasawc tradition.(8)Armad Yasawc’s poetry. The centerpiece, finally, of Köprülü’s treat-ment of the Yasawc tradition is, of course, the DCwAn-i Likmat. It was through thisFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"xxcompilation that Köprülü sought not only details of Armad Yasawc’s life andspiritual training, but the substance and spirit of his religious message; the DCwAnwas, for Köprülü, the encapsulation of Armad Yasawc’s central mission, namelythe spread of Islam among the Turks (and its adaptation to Turkic tastes). TheDCwAn, indeed, underlies the whole of Early Mystics, for the presumed influence ofArmad Yasawc’s poetry on that of Yenus Emre, which was in fact Köprülü’scentral concern, provided the rationale for the entire book.Köprülü’s understanding of the DCwAn is problematical in many respects. Hisassumption of a “missionary” purpose for a book of nefc poetry has been influen-tial, but is unconvincing, and in all likelihood obscures the actual audience forwhich the DCwAn was compiled. Similarly, his emphasis on a religious missiondefined in purely “national” terms is as anachronistic as his attitude to theDCwAn’s presumed audience is condescending. We are repeatedly reminded thatthe Turks whom Armad Yasawc was seeking to reach through the DCwAn weresimple and unsophisticated, and needed a dumbed-down version of Islam andnefism – which, luckily, Armad Yasawc was perfectly suited to provide, sincehe was, as Köprülü uncharitably characterizes him, not only a poor poet witha “very simple” imagination, but also a poor representative of what is best innefism. Indeed, Köprülü seems less intent upon a serious study of the DCwAn,which, he declares, lacks any “significant aesthetic value,” than upon holding itup, at a distance, as the presumed inspiration for – yet, ironically, as but a paleforeshadowing of – the vibrant poetry of Yenus Emre. Such a conclusion isborne out if we compare his treatment of the verse he ascribes to Armad Yasawcwith his treatment of Yenus’s poetry; the latter is quoted at length and subjectedto considerable stylistic and semantic analysis, but Köprülü never fully engageswith the DCwAn as a whole or even with a single poem contained in it (his citationsfrom the DCwAn are quite sparse, in fact, and are rarely analyzed in any depth).Köprülü’s dismissal of the aesthetic quality of the poetry ascribed to ArmadYasawc is naturally at odds with the contemporary rediscovery, or reassertion, ofthe presumed role of the Yasawc tradition as a bridge between Turkey andCentral Asia, and it underscores a somewhat discordant parochialism (shaped,perhaps, more by Köprülü’s views on Islam and nefism than by any consciousdeprecation of Central Asian culture); yet as Köprülü contrasts what he sees asthe rigid pieties and choked asceticism of the DCwAn-i Likmat with the sort offreewheeling and “broadminded” nefc poetry he obviously prefers, as exemplifiedby Yenus Emre’s verse, we may rightly suspect that the “national” mission heset for himself was indeed restricted to the western Turks, and did not includethe Turks of Central Asia, whose love for the dry and artless poetry ascribed toArmad Yasawc is implicitly belittled in Köprülü’s presentation.14Alongside all these problems in his treatment of the DCwAn-i Likmat, however,Köprülü failed to come to terms with a much more basic question: is the DCwAnindeed the work of Armad Yasawc? My own study of the Yasawc tradition hasconvinced me that it cannot be regarded as such in any meaningful sense; moredecisive, in my view, than the issues many others have pointed out – the clearlyFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"xxicompilative character of the DCwAn, the late date of surviving manuscripts, theanachronistic references to Yasawc’s shrine, the inclusion in it of verse by manypoets, and the wholly Chaghatay character of its language – is the simple factthat, until the nineteenth century, none of the many sources through which thehistory of the Yasawc tradition can be reconstructed ever affirms that ArmadYasawc was regarded as the author of an extensive body of mystical verse, or ofaphoristic sayings, much less of a collection of poetry called the DCwAn-i Likmat(by contrast, many sources affirm, quite early and consistently, that lakcm Ata,who is typically cast as Armad Yasawc’s disciple and whose very appellationlinks him, etymologically, with the utterance of Rikmats, was widely known for hisaphoristic sayings and mystical verse, and we can trace in the sources a numberof aphorisms ascribed first to lakcm Ata, or to the mashA”ikh-i turk in general, forwhich credit is later transferred to Armad Yasawc).Köprülü seems to have at least been aware of the irony to which he in factnever explicitly calls attention, namely that Armad Yasawc the poet, and hisDCwAn-i Likmat, go strangely unmentioned in the many Turkic literary worksfrom Central Asia that one might expect to have paid homage to the earliestTurkic nefc poet. His response to this silence is in effect an appeal to classwarfare. In an extreme version of the two-tiered view of “high” and “low”culture, Köprülü insists that Armad Yasawc’s verse reflected folk tastes, and thatthe court poets (and their anthologists) held those tastes in contempt and sofailed to mention the poets, or repeat the poetry, that appealed to them.15 Sucha claim is nonsense in many regards, but perhaps it will suffice to recall thesilence of Mcr ‘Alc Shcr Nawa’c – a creature of the court, but much enamored ofthe richness of Turkic as employed among all classes – about any poetic legacyof Armad Yasawc; as his MajAlis al-nafA”is shows, Nawa’c was more than happy toname a poet and cite his verse while belittling his metric skill. Similarly, thoughKöprülü did not know the work when he wrote Early Mystics, Nawa’c’s NasA”imal-maRabba – like the RashaRAt, which Köprülü did know – stresses lakcmAta’s renown for aphoristic sayings, but mentions neither verse nor sayings inconnection with Armad Yasawc.Köprülü, to be sure, went further than any of his predecessors in “distancing”Armad Yasawc from the DCwAn, acknowledging that not all of the poems in it,or even all the poems in it ascribed to “Armad,” could be the work of ArmadYasawc; he expressly rejected the naive tendency to accept the extant DCwAn-iLikmat as a simple collection of Armad Yasawc’s poetic production. Yet he neverseems to have questioned whether Armad Yasawc in fact wrote any poetry at all;on the contrary, Köprülü assumed not only that he did, but that poems addedto the DCwAn by later poets were inevitably modeled on Armad Yasawc’s verse,in form and content. Herein lies, I believe, the most breathtaking leap, and themost serious problem, in Köprülü’s treatment of the DCwAn – which, again,colors his entire discussion of that work’s presumed influence on Yenus Emreand Turkic poetry in general: even if we suspend our skepticism and accept thatArmad Yasawc must have written poetry of some sort, we might still protest thatFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"xxiiKöprülü never indicates how, precisely, we may judge which poems were ArmadYasawc’s and which reflected the work, or adjustment, of later poets;16 Köprülü’sanswer, in essence, is to insist that we need not trouble ourselves to make such ajudgment, for even if we cannot identify a single poem that has survived unchangedas the work of Armad Yasawc, we can be sure that the verse in extant versionsof the DCwAn-i Likmat genuinely reflects the “spirit” and “literary personality” ofArmad Yasawc.In this way Köprülü formulated a mechanism for, in effect, saving the connec-tion between Armad Yasawc and the extant DCwAn: starting from the assumptionthat Armad Yasawc wrote poetry (an assumption he never examines or questions),he declares that even if we do not have direct access to that poetry, we can knowwhat it was like on the basis of other poets’ contributions, since, Köprülü is sure,those other poets modeled their verse on Armad Yasawc’s. The reasoningis circular, of course: Armad Yasawc wrote poetry, his poetry influenced hisfollowers’ poetry, their poetry appears and may even predominate in the DCwAn,and so even if we cannot point to a single poem from the DCwAn as demonstrablythe work of Armad Yasawc (as in fact Köprülü never does), we can be certainthat the verse in the DCwAn closely reflects the missing verse of Armad Yasawc.It is, of course, doubly ironic that Köprülü takes the trouble to pursue thisdubious argument, with the aim of linking the DCwAn to Armad Yasawc, only todisparage the DCwAn as aesthetically deficient, and Armad Yasawc as an inferiorpoet. But by maintaining that the DCwAn reflects the “literary personality” ofArmad Yasawc, Köprülü felt justified, we may presume, in a wide range ofassertions about the place of the DCwAn in Turkic literary and cultural history.Thus, for instance, Köprülü writes with unblinking certainty that when (not if )an early copy of the DCwAn-i Likmat is discovered, it will reveal linguistic featurescharacteristic of the eleventh-century Kutadgu Bilig; but until such an early copy isbrought to light, Köprülü insists that we can still discuss the linguistic featuresit must have reflected on the basis of the period and environment in whichArmad Yasawc lived, and of our certainty that he wrote the “original” poetrythat inspired later additions to the DCwAn.In the final analysis, it is not Köprülü’s argument by itself that is particularlylamentable; had it provoked the debate that he himself no doubt would havewelcomed, it would not have had the stultifying effects on Yasawc studies thatit in fact did have. However, the conclusions based on this argument wererepeated again and again, with reference to the by-then-iconic Köprülü, incountless surveys of Turkish history, literature, and religion, in Turkish as wellas in European and American scholarship, and with only rare exceptions, thequestion of the authorship of the DCwAn-i Likmat was never seriously addressed.Indeed, on the contrary, the DCwAn became ever more inextricably linked withthe name of Armad Yasawc, and the assumption that he wrote poetry – andthat, however we choose to finesse the issue, the DCwAn-i Likmat is that poetry –became his central claim to fame, eclipsing not only the actual history of theCentral Asian nefc lineages, familial groups, and shrine constituencies that tookFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"xxiiitheir inspiration from Armad Yasawc (in most cases without ever paying atten-tion to the poetry he was supposed to have written), but even the rich body ofnarrative evocations of Armad Yasawc’s saintly persona preserved in literaryhagiographies and oral tradition from Central Asia.As a final indication of the importance of Early Mystics, and of the unfortunatestate of Yasawc studies resulting from the long reluctance to engage Köprülü’swork critically from a Central Asian perspective, we may note briefly howthin scholarly production on the Yasawc tradition has been since the work’sappearance. Between 1918 and the late 1940s, little of note was added to inter-national scholarship on the Yasawc tradition except for two articles, both bySoviet scholars, focused on the shrine of Armad Yasawc.17 Both studies includedinformation on oral tradition connected with the shrine, and on the organiza-tional aspects of the activities associated with it; they are of particular import-ance for reflecting the period before the intense assault against Islamic institutionsbegun by the Soviet government in the later 1920s.Two important articles from the late 1940s and early 1950s, one from theSoviet Union and one from Turkey, mark the next significant scholarly contribu-tions on the Yasawc tradition. The first, a study of the language of the DCwAn-iLikmat by A. K. Borovkov,18 formulated major elements of the case for rejectingArmad Yasawc’s authorship of the extant DCwAn, and made at least limited use ofseveral important Central Asian sources (the LamaRAt and the ThamarAt al-mashA”ikh)on the Yasawc tradition; unfortunately, this article was largely ignored in Turkeyand elsewhere, though its arguments were summarized in H. F. Hofman’s surveyof Chaghatay literature, from 1969.19 The other seminal article from this era, byZeki Velidi Togan,20 discussed several previously unknown sources, includingthe Lujjat al-dhAkirCn and another source, seemingly of great interest, that hasunfortunately been lost; Togan’s work, like Borovkov’s, pointed to importantnew directions for research on the Yasawc tradition, but there appears to havebeen virtually no serious response to the promise of either contribution.For nearly 40 years after this period, the Yasawc tradition suffered a particu-larly severe drought in substantive scholarly attention. In the Soviet Union, notunexpectedly, Armad Yasawc came to be decried, along with other nefcs, as anobscurantist deceiver of the masses, and the most substantial publication devotedto him was an antireligious tract entitled “The Shadow of the Middle Ages.”21Some attention was occasionally given to literary aspects of the DCwAn-i Likmat,and Armad Yasawc’s shrine was studied as an archeological and architecturalsite, but there was virtually no serious attention to the history and legacy of theYasawc tradition until the end of the Soviet era. In Europe and America, studyof the Yasawc tradition largely fell through the cracks of academic divisionsthat also harmed the broader study of Central Asia as a whole. Although thehagiographical legacy of the Yasawc order is overwhelmingly in Persian, Iranistslargely ignored what was repeatedly (if wrongly) cast as a purely “Turkic” tradition;meanwhile, students of Turkic language, history, or religion remained largelyunfamiliar (in part due to their reliance upon Köprülü) with the larger body ofFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"xxivsources relevant to Yasawc history, and limited their interest in the Yasawctradition to the DCwAn-i Likmat. Specialists in nefc studies, meanwhile, began toturn their attention to the Yasawc tradition in the 1970s, but almost entirely inconnection with its presumed links to the Naqshbandiyya.In Turkey, the Yasawc tradition continued to be noted as an importantelement of a Turkish religious and literary heritage, but writers were mostlycontent to parrot the conclusions of Köprülü, and there was little original workdone, even on the sources already identified by Köprülü. The manuscriptcontaining works of lazcnc that was used and cited so extensively by Köprülü,for instance, remained largely unstudied by scholars in Turkey, from the timeKöprülü wrote down to the 1990s. It was not until 1983 that a substantialselection of poems from the DCwAn-i Likmat was published, edited by KemalEraslan22 (whose 1979 publication of a transcribed edition of Nawa’c’s NasA”imal-maRabba was noted earlier); like Köprülü, Eraslan effectively dodged the issueof the DCwAn’s authorship, and like Köprülü’s work, Eraslan’s selections fromthe DCwAn seemed almost to discourage original work on the poetry ascribedto Armad Yasawc, as scholar after scholar chose to cite these selections for awide range of conclusions (about the DCwAn’s language, style, philosophical andreligious foundations, etc.), instead of exploring fuller printed versions, or actualmanuscript copies, of the DCwAn (this tendency continued even after the publica-tion of fuller versions of the DCwAn in the 1990s). European and AmericanTurkologists, it may be added, seem largely to have concurred with Turkishscholars on the virtual identification of Yasawc studies with the study of theDCwAn-i Likmat, and in any case cannot be said to have contributed significantlyto the study of any aspect of the Yasawc tradition.Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the expansion of contactswith scholars, and scholarly resources, in Central Asia, attention to the Yasawctradition has grown dramatically in terms of sheer bibliographical weight, butless so in terms of new approaches or the use of new sources. Several newversions of the DCwAn-i Likmat have been published in the former Soviet Union,with transcriptions based on modern Uzbek, Qazaq, Türkmen, and Tatar, andtwo Latin-script transcriptions have appeared in Turkey (the Türkmen publica-tion, issued in Moscow, and one of the Turkish versions are based on actualmanuscript copies, while the others are based on earlier printed versions of theDCwAn); the fundamental issues surrounding the DCwAn’s origins and development,however, remain essentially ignored. As for other aspects of the Yasawc tradition,the most important developments inevitably involve an increased attention topreviously unavailable Central Asian sources. Scholars in Uzbekistan andKazakhstan – above all Ashirbek Muminov and Zikiriya Zhandarbekov – havebegun uncovering valuable genealogical texts dealing with an important and stillunappreciated aspect of the Yasawc tradition, as noted above; at the same time,some increased attention to the study of Yasawc hagiographical literature fromCentral Asia is evident in works of Bakhtiyar Babadzhanov in Uzbekistan, FlorianSchwarz in Germany, and Thierry Zarcone in France.

A bright spot in this regard is the promising work ofNecdet Tosun, who has recently published two important sources relevant forYasawc studies.23 In his introduction to one of these, especially, Tosun reveals –alongside a persistence in several assumptions about the Yasawc tradition thatwill take some time to abandon – a far greater acquaintance with the broaderbody of sources from Central Asia than is evident in any other product of Turkishscholarship on Armad Yasawc.

The senseof deflation, upon discovering the eminent Turkish scholar’s dismissal of ArmadYasawc’s poetic gifts, was quite palpable.15 In fact, however, Köprülü’s hostility to the Persian influence in court poetry, andhis preference for the “simple Turkish” of the “folk poets,” reflected a dichotomy thatwas central in his time, but is increasingly recognized as overdrawn today; and in anycase, it was not a meaningful dichotomy in Central Asia (especially for poets, andtheir audiences, who had not yet learned the importance, so much a part of Köprülü’sage, of extracting the Persian and Arabic elements from their lexicons). In this regardit is worth recalling the appraisal, half a century before Köprülü wrote, of Vambéry,who said that the Persian and Arabic element was sufficiently strong in the poems ofthe DCwAn-i Likmat to cause the “uninstructed nomads” difficulty in understandingthem (A. Vambéry, “Muhammadanism (in Central Asia),” Encyclopaedia of Religion andEthics, ed. James Hastings (1908 –26; rpt New York, 1961), vol. 8, pp. 885 – 8 [ p. 887] ).16 Köprülü often implies that use of the syllabic meter is a marker of the early and moreprimitive stage of Turkic poetry supposedly represented by Armad Yasawc’s verse(even though Köprülü himself notes some confusion over whether certain poemsreflect syllabic meter or poorly executed “arEQ meters). It is interesting, in this regard,that the earliest version we have of a poem ascribed directly to Armad Yasawc andfound, still, in extant versions of the DCwAn-i Likmat appears in one of lazcnc’s worksfrom the latter sixteenth century; yet Köprülü himself acknowledged that this poemreflected the principles of the “arEQ system supposedly introduced only after the time ofArmad Yasawc. Köprülü would no doubt argue that this poem had been modernizedFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"xxviiand its meter adjusted; indeed, much else has been adjusted, inasmuch as extantversions of the poem differ substantially in structure and wording, and in lazcnc’swork it appears in distinctly Ottoman orthography, rather than in the Chaghatayform we would expect it to have if indeed written down in Central Asia. But when ourearliest known recording of a poem ascribed to Armad Yasawc reflects the “arEQsystem, the rationale for using that system’s presence or absence as evidence of the“originality” of specific poems is obviously dissolved.17 M.

A. R. Gibb as stating regretfully in 1942: “I have not yet seen a single bookwritten by an Arab of any branch in any Western language that has made itpossible for the Western student to understand the roots of Arab culture. Morethan that, I have not seen any book written in Arabic for Arabs themselves whichhas clearly analyzed what Arabic culture means to the Arabs.” Von Grunebaumthen goes on to say: “This statement could be extended to include the non-ArabMuslim and his failure to interpret his culture to both himself and the West. Itholds good today as it did when it was written, and it is likely to hold good forsome time to come.”1Gibb’s assertion was, perhaps, debatable, but von Grunebaum’s was mistaken,for in 1918 Köprülü had published Early Mystics in Turkish Literature, which,among other things, was meant to help establish the modern Turkish nationalidentity.2Mehmed Fuad KöprülüOur author was born in Istanbul in 1890. Through his father ysmail Faiz Bey, hewas related to the sister of the famous Ottoman Grand Vizier Köprülü MehmedPasha (d. 1661). She was also the wife of Kıbleli Mustafa Pasha, a vizier ofMehmed IV. His father was a civil servant and his mother was the daughter ofa religious scholar from yslimiye, present-day Sliven in Bulgaria.Köprülü attended the Ayasofya junior high school (rüZdiyye) and then Mercanhigh school (idâdî) in Istanbul. Between 1907 and 1910, he attended the Schoolof Law at Dârülfünûn, which later became Istanbul University, but he did notcomplete the course of study. Indeed, while in law school, he became interestedin Turkish literature, which soon became his passion and contributed to hisdecision to abandon law. In 1909 he joined the literary society Fecr-i Âtî, whichwas strongly influenced by French literature, and wrote poetry for the illustratedweekly Servet-i Fünûn. He also wrote about contemporary literary issues and,"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"xxixtaking a conservative position, was critical of the national literature and languagemovement. He later changed his position, however, under the influence ofTurkish nationalism. Between 1910 and 1913, he taught Turkish and Turkishliterature at various high schools in Istanbul. He was the first to organize aprogram in literature at Istanbul Lisesi and Galatasaray Lisesi. Meanwhile, hejoined various political associations, such as Türk Dernexi (The Turkish Associ-ation), Türk Yurdu Cemiyeti (The Turkish Homeland Society) and Türk Ocaxı(The Turkish Hearth). Coming under the influence of Ziya Gökalp (1875 or1876 –1924), the Turkish nationalist ideologist of the Ottoman Empire andexponent of the Turkism movement, he identified himself with the Turkishnational literature movement. Parallel to Gökalp’s establishment of the bases ofTurkish nationalism, Köprülü carried out scholarly research on the origins ofTurkish literature, or what he called Turkish national literature. He thus wentback to the earliest periods of Turkish history and examined the history andliterature of various Turkish societies. Contemporary political and social conditionsin the Ottoman Empire, the teachings of Gökalp, and the policies of the Com-mittee of Union and Progress all influenced him in this regard. In 1913 withGökalp’s help, he became instructor – at the age of 23 and almost completelyself-taught – of the history of Turkish literature in Dârülfünûn. Intensifying hisresearch, he published in the same year his ideas about how Turkish literatureshould be studied using European methods in an article entitled “Türk edebiyatıtarihinde usûl” (Method in the history of Turkish literature).With several friends, Köprülü tried to found the Türkiyat Cemiyeti (Societyfor Turkish Studies). He had Gökalp’s support, but the grand vizier, Sait HalimPasha, was opposed to the name, which was changed to Âsâr-i yslamiyyeve Milliyye Tetkik Encümeni (The Society for the Study of the Islamic andNational Culture). This society was launched in 1915. Its publication was MillîTetebbüler Mecmuası (The Journal of National Research). For the first issue, Köprülücontributed “Türk edebiyatında âzık tarzının menze’ ve tekâmülü hakkında birtecrübe” (An essay on the origin and development of Turkish minstrel poetry).Indeed, he began to publish on a wide variety of historical, literary, and intellec-tual subjects in many journals and newspapers. His first major work, Early Mysticsin Turkish Literature, which proved to be his masterpiece, appeared in 1918, whenhe was only 28, and earned him an international reputation. In 1920 –1, hepublished the first edition of Türk edebiyatı tarihi (The History of Turkish Literature),which further established him as a leading authority in Turkish studies. In 1922,he published “Anadolu’da islâmiyet” (Islam in Anatolia) and in 1923 Türkiyetarihi (The History of Turkey). Also in 1923, he became dean of the Faculty ofLiterature at Istanbul University. In the same year Gökalp published TürkçülüXünesasları (The bases of Turkism) and stated that Köprülü was very learned and a greatscholar in the field of Turkish studies and that he would shed light on Turkism.In 1924, Köprülü served for eight months as under-secretary in the Ministry ofEducation on the insistence of its minister, Vasıf Çınar. In the same year, hebecame director of the Türkiyat Enstitüsü (Institute of Turkish Studies), whichTRANSLATORS’ INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"xxxwas established by a decree of the Council of Ministers. In 1925, he began topublish Türkiyat Mecmuası (The Journal of Turkish Studies), its scholarly journal.As Köprülü’s fame spread abroad, he attended a number of internationalcongresses as Turkey’s representative: Paris, 1923; Leningrad, 1925; Baku, 1926;Oxford, 1928; London, 1929; and Tehran 1934. In 1925 he was made a corres-ponding member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences on the recommendation ofW. Barthold, I. Krachkowsky, and S. Oldenburg. He received honorary degreesfrom the University of Heidelberg, 1927; the University of Athens, 1937; and theSorbonne, 1939.In 1927 Köprülü was elected president of Türk Tarih Encümeni (The TurkishHistorical Society). The following year, he published, among other things, severalstudies on the pre-Ottoman Turkish principalities in Anatolia. In 1931 he foundedthe short-lived Türk Hukuk ve Yktisat Tarihi Mecmuası (Journal of Turkish Legal andEconomic History), in which appeared his long article “Bizans müesseselerininosmanlı müesseselerine te’siri hakkında bâzı mülâhazalar” (Observations on theinfluence of Byzantine institutions on Ottoman institutions). In 1935 he publishedLes origins de l’Empire Ottoman, which was a series of lectures given at the Sorbonnethe previous year. In 1937 he became ordinarius professor at Istanbul Univer-sity, where he served from time to time as a dean.In 1935 Köprülü began his political life. While still a university professor, hewas elected representative from Kars in eastern Turkey. Shortly thereafter hemoved to Ankara, where he taught medieval history in the Faculty of Language,History and Geography at Ankara University (1935 – 41). After 1941 he devotedmuch of his scholarly energy to the Yslâm Ansiklopedisi, the expanded Turkishversion of the first edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam, but still contributed tovarious journals, notably his “Anadolu Selçukluları tarihinin yerli kaynakları”(Local sources for the history of the Seljuks of Anatolia) and “Osmanlıimparatorluxu’nun etnik menzei meseleleri” (Problems of the ethnic origin of theOttoman Empire), both of which appeared in Belleten in 1943. In the same yearhe retired from his professorship and entered politics full time. He was one of thefounders of the Democratic Party in 1945. The following year he was electeddeputy from Istanbul. When the Democratic Party came to power in 1950, hebecame Minister of Foreign Affairs. With the exception of a brief period in 1955,he held this position until May 1956 and played an important role in Turkey’saccession to NATO. After a falling out with party officials, he resigned from theDemocratic Party in 1957. Several months after the coup against Prime MinisterAdnan Menderes on 27 May 1960, he was arrested and held on Yassıada forfour months. Upon his release in 1961, he briefly re-entered politics and thenwithdrew completely.Meanwhile Köprülü’s scholarly work continued to be recognized abroad. In1947 he was elected a member of the American Oriental Society. In 1959 hewas made an honorary member of the American Historical Society. BetweenSeptember 1958 and July 1959, he was a visiting professor at Harvard. In 1964he was made a corresponding member of the School of Oriental and AfricanTRANSLATORS’ INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"xxxiStudies at the University of London. Indeed, he never really ceased pursuing hisscholarly interests. Toward the end of his life, he worked with F. A. Tansel onupdating some of his earlier publications, including the one presented here. On15 April 1965 he was involved in a traffic accident in Ankara and on 28 June1966 died from complications arising from that accident. He was buried in theKöprülü burial plot opposite the tomb of Sultan Mahmud in Istanbul.Taking Turkish literature beyond the boundaries of the Ottoman state, Köprülüapproached it as a whole, from the heroic era to the present. In the process,using modern scholarly methods, he shed light on the main features of Turkishliterature. He introduced many poets and writers, such as Shayyad lamza,Armad Faqch, and Khwaja Dehhani, to the scholarly world. His books andarticles touched on many subjects: the history of Turkish literature, literarycriticism, Oriental studies, the history of Turkish civilization and culture,language, religion, art, music, political history, and ethnology. As with literature,he believed history should be approached as a whole. He worked to make theold concept of history in Turkey, which was military and political history, moreinclusive, incorporating religious, legal, economic, and social history as well. Hegenerally saw literary history as part of the history of civilization, and believedthat by studying all the literary products that revealed the intellectual evolutionof a nation over the centuries one could shed light on its spiritual life. Thus,because literary works were created by artists under the moral and materialinfluence of the society in which they lived, literary history included not only awork itself but also the life of the artist and the society to which he belonged.Altogether, Köprülü established the basis for the modern study of Turkishliterature and showed Turks how to do this themselves. He was a master atsynthesizing great amounts of information and published some 1500 books,articles, essays, and other writings.3Early Mystics in Turkish LiteratureThe appearance of Köprülü’s Early Mystics in 1918 caused a sensation amongknowledgeable European scholars. They had never seen anything like it. Forthe first time, a native Middle Eastern scholar had applied modern Westernmethods of research and analysis to sources that were, up to then, unknown orpoorly known in both Europe and the Middle East in order to study a numberof fundamental aspects of the origin of his own culture. As a consequence, hepublished a major work in his own language that shed light on many little knownor obscure subjects. At the same time, by describing the sources for his work, heopened new areas of research.What exactly did Köprülü do in this book? Briefly put, he described, bymarshalling a vast array of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish sources, the virtuallyunknown subject of the origin of Turkish literature and the role of mystics ornefcs in the development and spread of this literature in the area stretching fromCentral Asia, the original homeland of the Turks, across Iran to Asia Minor orTRANSLATORS’ INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"xxxiiAnatolia. In the process, he showed how this literature helped to create a nationalidentity for the Turks, and thus played a seminal role for Turkish culture in theMuslim world. This last point was very important. Köprülü had a nationalobjective in mind when he wrote this book. It appeared at the time of thecollapse of the Ottoman Empire and at the beginning of the Turkish nationaliststruggle for independence, which soon resulted in the emergence of the modernRepublic of Turkey. Köprülü sought to give the Turks, for the first time, aproper historical identity through their literature, one that was not lost or obscuredin Ottoman or traditional Islamic history. In short, he wanted to present to theTurks their true history as far back as the literary sources would allow. WithEarlyMystics, Köprülü became the founder of the modern study of Turkish literatureand history in Turkey. Indeed, this work had an important effect on Turkishstudies internationally.Köprülü divides Early Mystics into two distinct parts. He devotes the first toArmad Yasawc, whom he identifies as the first great Turkish popular nefc poet.According to Köprülü, Armad Yasawc was born in Sairam (Isfcjab), in modernKazakhstan, in the latter part of the eleventh century and died in 1166 –7. In thecourse of his life, he established a new genre in Turkish literature, namelymystical folk poetry, and founded a nefc brotherhood or UarCqa that spread histeachings. This brotherhood, the Yasawiyya, was the first to flourish among theTurks, and eventually gave rise, again according to Köprülü, to one of the mostpowerful UarCqas in the Muslim world, the Naqshbandiyya. After Armad Yasawc’sdeath, his tomb in Yasc, which was greatly embellished by Tcmer (Tamerlane),became an important place of pilgrimage for the Turks of Central Asia and theVolga region.Köprülü begins by describing the various cultural influences on the Turks inCentral Asia and what was known of Turkish literature before the appearance ofArmad Yasawc. He focuses on the spread of nefc mysticism among the Turks –how it was adapted to traditional beliefs and its role in the conversion of theTurks to Islam. Then he presents an account of the legendary life of ArmadYasawc as reflected in popular traditions and later nefc religious biographies.Köprülü follows the spread of the legends about Armad Yasawc throughoutTurkistan (modern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan), alongthe Volga, and eventually to Anatolia and the Balkans – spreading to the lattertwo regions mainly as a result of the Mongol invasion and then being incor-porated into the Bektashc tradition. All this is evidence, asserts Köprülü, of thevery strong impression that Armad Yasawc made on Turkish literary and religiouslife. Our author then concentrates on Armad Yasawc’s literary imitators andspiritual successors to show how they compounded and magnified his influenceamong the Turks.Köprülü next describes Armad Yasawc’s literary works, i.e. his collection ofreligious poems known as DCwAn-i Likmat. He discusses its linguistic and literaryfeatures, comparing it to earlier Turkish works, such as the Kutadgu Bilig, as wellas to contemporary works. Köprülü emphasizes in particular how Armad YasawcTRANSLATORS’ INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"xxxiiiaddressed the common people in their own language. He also takes carefulaccount of the nefc element in the DCwAn, which was critical in making it a newgenre of Turkish literature.After this, Köprülü attempts to describe what was known of the actual historicallife of Armad Yasawc: his childhood, religious training, travels, and family. Thenhe discusses his historical spiritual successors. This naturally leads to a detailedaccount of the rules and religious practices of the Yasawc UarCqa, which in turnallows Köprülü to present a synthetic view of the origin and nature of Turkishmysticism in Central Asia. He then shows how Armad Yasawc’s influence, spreadby the Yasawiyya, prevailed for centuries among the Turks.Köprülü devotes the second part of his book to Yenus Emre, the greatest of allTurkish nefc poets, whose work has influenced Turkish literature up to moderntimes. Yenus Emre lived in the second half of the thirteenth century in CentralAnatolia. Like Armad Yasawc, who had a strong influence on him, this poetspoke to the people in a language they could understand, but, according toKöprülü, he was a much greater artist. His sublime poetry, which expounds themost difficult metaphysical problems in plain and unembellished language,not only furthered the development of Turkish mystical folk literature but alsohelped to spread nefism among the Turks in Anatolia.Köprülü begins by describing Turkish literature in Anatolia before YenusEmre, the development of the nefc movement in that region, and such notablemystics as Jalal al-Dcn Remc. Then he focuses on the rise of Turkish in Anatoliaas the national language of the Turks and on the appearance of folk literature,including such works as the Dede Korkut and OghuznAme. Next Köprülü discussesthe life of Yenus Emre. He starts with the view of Yenus in the Bektashc tradi-tion and then examines the historical person, assessing among other things hissupposed illiteracy and his fame, which was already considerable by the fourteenthcentury. Then Köprülü provides a detailed account of his collected poetry,comparing its linguistic and literary features to earlier works, including those ofArmad Yasawc, and contemporary products. Altogether, he shows how YenusEmre created a new style of Turkish literature that had a profound effect onlater poets. Köprülü stresses Yenus Emre the moralist and supreme artistwho was able to grasp and eloquently explain nefc principles and profoundmetaphysical questions in simple language. For Köprülü, the plain yet eloquentlanguage in the style of Yenus Emre represents the epitome of Turkish literarytaste. Thus Yenus Emre embodied the Turkish “national” genius. Finally, Köprülüdescribes Yenus Emre’s continuous influence on the development of Turkishliterature, his many spiritual successors and literary imitators, his key role in thedevelopment of the poetry of the Turkish nefc lodges, especially those of theBektashcs, and the creation of “Ashıq literature (that of wandering minstrels afterthe fifteenth century).Köprülü firmly believed that one had to study Turkish literature, from CentralAsia to Anatolia, as a whole, and that without understanding pre-Islamic Turkishliterature, it was impossible to describe that of the post-Islamic periods. AndTRANSLATORS’ INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"xxxivwithout knowing how Turkish literature developed in Central Asia and Anatoliaup to the formation of the Ottoman state, it was impossible to comprehend thedevelopment of Ottoman literature. With Early Mystics, Köprülü attempted tolay the foundation for the modern study of Turkish literature, from its verybeginning, within such a framework. He was remarkably successful in thisattempt. Indeed, despite some serious flaws, which have been highlighted in theForeword and the commentary in the notes, his book became a milestone in themodern study of Turkish literature and cultural history. It also stimulated manysubsequent works, such as those of Abdülbaki Gölpınarlı on Yenus Emre. Todaymuch of the background information in Early Mystics, such as that on theTurks, Islamization, and Sufism, is, of course, dated, but its assessments of ArmadYasawc and, especially, Yenus Emre are still central to modern research;although recently, as mentioned in the Foreward and the commentary in thenotes, Köprülü’s analyses of Armad Yasawc and his work have been seriouslychallenged. Nevertheless, for almost a century, this work has remained a stand-ard of modern Middle Eastern studies. It is still the starting point for research onthe cultural genesis of the Turks. Furthermore, this book is also of great import-ance for the study of the evolution of Islam in general and nefism in particular,and of the interrelationship and differences between Turkish literature andArabic literature, and especially between Turkish literature and Persian literat-ure. It lies at the heart, therefore, of the most fundamental areas of research inCentral Asian, Middle Eastern, and Islamic studies. Its significance to specialistsand general readers goes well beyond the scope of Turkish studies.Translators’ noteAs mentioned, Early Mystics was originally published in Istanbul in OttomanTurkish in 1918. A second edition, revised by Köprülü and transcribed into theLatin alphabet, appeared in 1966. A third edition prepared by his son OrhonKöprülü, who simplified the language a bit, corrected a few things, and madesome additions to the notes, was published in 1976. Since then, this third editionhas been reprinted a number of times. The translation presented here is basedon this edition, although we frequently compared it with the first edition, especiallyto clarify problems arising from changes in alphabet.We have attempted to translate this work into colloquial English. This meansin particular that we have tried to eliminate the redundancies and wordiness inKöprülü’s style, although some vestiges of these characteristics may remain. In afew cases, we have broken long paragraphs into shorter paragraphs; and wehave rearranged the order of a few notes required by the differences in Englishand Turkish syntax.Furthermore, the translation that follows differs in several other respects fromthe way in which the original text was presented. At the very beginning, in thetable of contents, Köprülü included the subheadings from all chapters. We haveeliminated them as unnecessary. In the narrative and notes – apparently believingTRANSLATORS’ INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"xxxvthat his readers were equally multilingual and well read – Köprülü frequentlyincluded passages in medieval Arabic, Persian, or Turkish without translatingthem and with little or no comment. We have translated all such passages intoEnglish with the exception of some chronograms in Chapter 4, some first linesfrom DCwAn-i Likmat in Chapter 5 that are cited for identification purposes, andthe poem cited in Chapter 9, notes 3 and 6, in order to illustrate textual andlinguistic matters.In addition, and just as annoying, Köprülü was inconsistent in his method ofciting sources, sometimes even giving different names to the same source. Inother instances, he was so brief or vague as to leave even a specialist reader indoubt. He also had a tendency to merge his sources and to make sweepinggeneralizations without proof. It is difficult to determine if these are signs ofhaste or simply carelessness. In any case, we have recast all of Köprülü’s footnotesaccording to modern English usage, giving a full reference to a work when firstcited, and author and short title thereafter. The full reference can, of course, alsobe found in the Bibliography.We have checked many of the original sources that Köprülü cites and havemade a number of corrections. Furthermore, we should point out in particularthat the use of quotations from Armad Yasawc’s DCwAn-i Likmat in “Westernized”form are not meant to imply that this work was in Ottoman rather thanChaghatay. This is the way in which they appear in the Latinized editions of theEarly Mystics. We should also state that for Evliya Chelebi’s SeyARatnAme, Köprülüused the Istanbul edition of 1314 –18/1896 –1900, which is unreliable for scholarlypurposes. We have cited instead the original Baxdat Közkü manuscripts. Köprülüfrequently mentions the Kirghiz, following Russian usage of the time, but withrare exceptions he really means the Qazaqs. Where appropriate we have changedthis designation to the latter. Lastly, we have added a minimum number of newreferences in an attempt to bring Early Mystics up to date. This minimalistapproach will not satisfy all readers, but given the breadth and complexity of thiswork, it would be impossible to introduce all the subsequent work on the subjectsraised by Köprülü that have appeared in many languages over the past century.As will be seen in the prefaces, Köprülü included in the first edition a “select,”rather than a complete, bibliography. In the second and third editions, it wasmerged it with the index. We have provided a separate and complete biblio-graphy of all works cited and a separate index. In the bibliography we have alsotranslated the titles of all Russian and modern Turkish works. Except for thecorrection of minor oversights, we have placed all changes and additions to, orclarifications of, the narrative and notes in braces { }. We have also added aglossary, two maps, and several photographs.Because Early Mystics covers both a vast period and a vast cultural area, andemploys so much Arabic and Persian technical terminology, not to mention,of course, Turkish, and because the same words frequently appear in all ofthese languages but often with different pronunciations, there is no satisfactorysystem of transliteration of this terminology into English that would reflect theseTRANSLATORS’ INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"xxxvidifferences and not cause confusion for the lay reader when moving back andforth among these languages. As a general rule, therefore, we have “Arabized”technical terms where possible and followed the system of transliteration used inthe Encyclopaedia of Islam, with the exceptions of q for s and j for dj, until themodern period, for which we have “transitioned” to modern Turkish ortho-graphy for Turkish names and words. Thus ö and ü are the same as in German,c = j, ç = ch, x is not pronounced but lengthens the preceding vowel, z = sh,and ı = gh in Edinburgh. It should also be mentioned that in modern Turkisha circumflex is used to indicate long vowels, but it is often left out. Thus aword may appear with this accent in the title of one work but appear withoutit in another. Inconsistencies were thus inevitable, especially because we havealso used the conventional English spellings for certain words, but should notbother the specialist or lay reader.Finally, we should mention that this is the first attempt to translate EarlyMystics into another language.4 Theodor Menzel published a very detailedsummary of the narrative part of this work as “Köprülüzade Mehmed Fuad’sWerk über die ersten Mystiker in der turkischen Literatur,” in Körösi CsomaArchivum, 2 (1926 –32), 281–310, 345 –57, 406 –22, but the narrative constitutesonly one-third of the work. The remainder consists of the notes.NOTES1 In Islam: Essays in the Nature and Growth of a Cultural Tradition, Memoire 81 of The AmericanAnthropologist, p. 185.2 Von Grunebaum’s oversight is curious. He knew Köprülü and contributed to hisFestschrift in 1953, by which time, as we shall see below, Köprülü had publisheda stream of fundamental articles and monographs in Turkish that laid the basis forthe modern study of Turkish civilization in its broadest sense. Moreover, a detailedGerman summary of the narrative part of Early Mystics had been published in 1932, onwhich see below.3 This sketch of Köprülü’s life comes from Gary Leiser’s introduction to his translationof “Bizans müesseselerinin osmanlı müesseselerine tesiri hakkında bazı mülahazalar,”as Some Observations on the Influence of Byzantine Institutions on Ottoman Institutions (Ankara,1999), and from “Köprülü, Mehmed Fuad,” in Türk Dili ve Edebiyat Ansiklopedisi(Istanbul, 1982–98).

F. Köprülü’s book entitledEarly Mystics in Turkish Literature is being published by the Office of the Chief ofReligious Affairs, which also published the second edition in 1966. This newedition has a history of four or five years. At first the Ministry of NationalEducation considered publishing it in the series One Thousand Basic Works, butwhen this series was ended the Cultural Secretariat of the Office of the PrimeMinister decided to issue this book among its publications. Upon this decision, Iwas asked to prepare this new edition. The Secretariat and I came to a mutualunderstanding on certain conditions and toward the end of 1973 the work wasready to be given to the press. At that point, the Office of the Chief of ReligiousAffairs made persistent entreaties to both me and the Cultural Secretariat ofthe Office of the Prime Minister as a result of which all parties mutually agreedthat the third edition would also be published by the Office of the Chief ofReligious Affairs.My late father had prepared the second edition of Early Mystics, but becauseof his untimely death resulting from a traffic accident, the final proof readingwas done by Fevziye Abdullah Tansel, who also wrote the preface to that edi-tion. In her preface, which I have included verbatim in this new edition, Tanselaccurately describes the conditions under which Early Mystics was written in1918, the great interest the book aroused at that time in Europe, the specialcharacteristics of the work that Köprülü did in various fields,1 and how thesecond edition came about. Consequently, there is no need for me to say anythingmore in these respects.I will simply try to describe here the principles that I followed while preparingthe third edition of Early Mystics. I have basically adopted the editorial methodthat Tansel used in the second edition, but I have taken a bit further her simpli-fication of the language and carried the process as far as one could with a workof this sophistication. For example, in place of the term müsteZrik {Orientalist},which would be difficult for today’s youth to understand, I preferred the wordZarkiyatcı, the meaning of which could at least be inferred by deduction. Insteadof the term muakkip {imitator}, I found it appropriate to say takipçi. And I useddoXu {east} and batı {west} rather than Zark and garp. If he were alive today, my"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"xxxixfather would have readily adopted virtually all the changes that I made in thelanguage of the third edition.Another way in which this edition differs from the second is that I haveextended Tansel’s effort to write the names of foreign books and articles intheir original form. The names of a number of foreign books and articleswere, in fact, left in their Turkish form in the second edition. With certainexceptions, I have tried to give all of these titles in the language in which theywere written. In order to distinguish the Leiden edition of the Encyclopaedia ofIslam from the Istanbul edition (i.e. the Yslâm Ansiklopedisi), I have written theformer as Encyclopédie de l’Islam {in the translation, we refer to the English versionthroughout}.While preparing the second edition, my late father added to the original notesonly a few of his publications that appeared after 1919. For the third edition,I have made additions to many of these notes.2 Thus, this new edition of EarlyMystics represents, to a certain extent, an improvement over previous versions. Inthe additions that I made to the notes, I followed two main principles. First, Iconcentrated on the works of Köprülü that appeared after the first edition ofEarly Mystics and I added to the relevant notes the results of those works towhich, if he were alive, he too would most naturally have referred. Second, as faras I could, I have added, where necessary, references to the works of otherwriters that are relevant to the original notes of the book.It will be understood from my brief comments here that the most noteworthyfeatures of the third edition are the additions that I have made to the notes. Inorder to distinguish them from the original notes, I have placed them withinbrackets [ ] {which have been retained in the translation}.As a result of the research that Köprülü carried out after completing the firstedition of Early Mystics, he changed his mind about certain ideas that he hadpreviously advanced. One change was the view he later held about ArmadYasawc and his UarCqa {nefc brotherhood, mystical path}. As Köprülü himselfexpressly stated, “I originally described both the nefc personality of ArmadYasawc and the nature of the Yasawc UarCqa exactly as the Naqshbandc sourcesportray them. However, the accounts of the Baba’c, laidarc, and Bektashc tradi-tions concerning Armad Yasawc are closer to historical reality.”3 Despite Köprülü’schange of view, it was not incorporated in the second edition of Early Mystics. Inthis new edition, though, I have used the occasion to clarify this matter.In his later writings, Köprülü also advanced views that differed from thosein the first edition on certain secondary problems, but there was no reflection ofthem in the second edition. He wrote in the first edition, for example, that thepen name of Mehmed Giray IV was ‘frif, but in an article that appearedin 1928, he stated that it was not ‘frif but Kamil.4 This minor error was leftin the second edition, but in the present version I have corrected it in therelevant note.In the first edition of Early Mystics, the name of a certain work is given as Hibatal-RaqA”iq. Although well known by this name at that time, it has now beenPREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"xlshown that this title was the result of a misreading. Rezid Rahmeti Arat latercarried out research in which he established that the name was “Atabat al-RaqA”iqand this reading has been universally accepted. Nevertheless, in the secondedition the title of this famous book is still given as Hibat al-RaqA”iq. In the thirdedition, I have given the correct name in both the text and the notes. Through-out the work, I have also found it appropriate to write certain personal namesthe way Köprülü later accepted them. For instance, in an article that he publishedmany years ago, he went to great length to explain that the name “Kutulmuz,”as it appeared in the second edition, must be read as “Kutalmız,”5 and many ofour other historians have agreed with him. In this new edition, I have thereforeused Kutalmız as the form of this name.I should like to state immediately here that the additions that I have madeto some of the notes in the third edition of Early Mystics are just a beginning.I hope and wish that for a future fourth edition a commission of specialistson various subjects will be formed who will be able to make additions to a greatmany more notes. I am sure that my father’s spirit would rejoice at such aproject.Another difference between the second and third editions of Early Mystics isthe method of transcription. In the new edition, proper names have been writtenas they are pronounced. In ending this brief description of the third edition, Ishould mention that I was in Istanbul while the book was published in Ankaraand thus pages were sometimes sent to the press without being proof read andthis led to a number of unavoidable printing errors. Those mistakes that cannotbe deduced from the context have been listed with their corrections at the end ofthe book {not included, of course, in this edition}.Istanbul, January 20, 1976Dr Orhan F.

The author of the work has greeted this decision with pleasure.Not only has it long been out of print – and when rarely found in second-handbookshops the price is high, 150 or sometimes even as much as 700 liras{$1 = 14 liras} – but it is also the publication to which he devoted the mostwork and therefore the one to which he gives the most value.Köprülü began his publishing career when only eighteen years old with a poementitled “[eyh Gâlibe.”1 Between 1908 and 1918 – before the appearance ofEarlyMystics – he published a number of poems as well as articles on language, history,literature, literary history, and other fields. Although some twenty of these articleswere translations from French, they are noteworthy for shedding light on hisartistic talent and his intellectual development and inclinations.2 The preparatoryphase of the studies that, in the event, formed a nucleus for the scholarly workthat he would later produce occurred in particular between the years 1913 and1918. In 1913, at the age of twenty-three, Köprülü was chosen for the position ofProfessor of the History of Turkish Literature at Istanbul’s Dârülfünûn {laterIstanbul University}. In the same year, he published an article entitled “Türkedebiyatı tarihinde usûl” {Bilgi Mecmuası, 1 (1329/1913), 3 –52; reprinted in hisEdebiyat araZtırmaları (Ankara, 1986), pp. 3 – 47} in which he not only criticallyexamined and explained the scholarly methods on which the Western world relied,but also established, based on his personal experience, the scholarly methodsthat were appropriate to the national structure of Turkish literary history. Theability to use these scholarly methods to their full extent, and the knowledge thathe acquired from his personal studies of our popular poets, are conspicuous in,among others, his articles “Ahmed Yesevî ve Çaxatay ve Osmanlı edebiyatlarıüzerinde te’sirleri,” which was published in Bilgi Mecmuası, 1 (1330/1914), 611–45, “Türk edebiyatı’nın menze’i” and “Türk edebiyatı’nda âzık tarzının menze’ vetekâmülü {hakkında bir tecrübe},” both of which appeared in MTM in 2 (1331/1915), 5 –78, and 1 (1331/1915), 5 – 46, respectively,3 whose director he becamein the same year. All this prepared him to establish the study of popular nefcliterature on a sound foundation and made it possible for him to write Early Mystics."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"xliiiComposed, therefore, after such a preparatory phase, Early Mystics attractedthe attention of European scholars to Köprülü, the founder of the science ofTurcology in our country, and his work. Professor Cl. Huart, a member of theInstitut Français, wrote the first review of this book. He begins his critical articleby saying “There is certainly something that has changed in Turkey. Less thantwo years ago, a large volume was published that is unlike anything that we havepreviously known. Not only does it reveal to us new events or fill gaps in ourinsufficient knowledge {of the history of Turkish literature}, but it is also presentedin an impressive manner. We discover here, with amazement bordering onadmiration, the application of the strictest principles of historical and literarycriticism as they are taught in the universities of Western Europe. Althoughwritten in Ottoman Turkish, one could say that it was thought in French. Indeed,alongside technical expressions taken largely from Arabic, which is the scholarlylanguage for the Muslim East as Greek is for us, one encounters others that aresimply calques on French terms.”4 Describing Köprülü in his article as “a writerknown for his patriotism,”5 Huart then presents his analysis of the book. Hepoints out that it focused on a field of early Turkish literature that had beenvery little studied since the conquest of Istanbul. He mentions other documentsthat confirm the information provided in this work and, thanks to it, shows howerroneous {our knowledge} has been of certain matters and would have to becorrected. Commenting on the richness of the published and unpublished sourcesin various languages that Köprülü used, Huart expresses a desire for the immediatepublication of the unpublished works that he mentioned and, at the end of hisarticle, reaches the following conclusions: “Not only the history of Asia Minorfrom the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries, but also that of the ideas in circulationthroughout the immense domain of the Muslim world during this and earlierperiods are still so little understood, even by Orientalists, that any serious workthat contributes to our knowledge can only be welcomed. Consequently, we arehappy to greet the publication of a volume, like the one Köprülü-Zâde MehmedFuad has written, which by its nature focuses attention on the problems thatneed resolving and that one can be optimistic about resolving, thanks to the newsources that he presents, which until recently have been inaccessible to research.”6In another review of this work, Huart states his opinion that “its author hasadopted the principles of European science; he knows French and probablyalso German; he knows our methods of criticism and applies them; he translatesinto Turkish our scholarly terminology whenever the language is appropriateand, if not, introduces it with Latin letters directly into his text. His work willopen a new era.”7After Huart, J. H. Mordtmann published a critical review of Early Mystics. Inhis analysis of the book, the heart of his article, he cites a few documents thatescaped the notice of our author and are related to {certain} details. Mordtmanndescribes the characteristics of Köprülü’s method and how his book was writtenfrom a new point of view, saying, “Among the exponents of the humanities inthe new Turkey, the author merits the rank of müctehid {an independent scholarPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"xlivof great erudition and diligence}. He approaches, with broad perspectives,various and great problems. He commands the relevant Western and Easternliteratures on an astonishing scale and establishes himself as a master in special-ized research. He has the skill to present the subject matter in an easily com-prehensible style that does not weary the reader. With special gratitude, we mustacknowledge that he, by means of accurate citations and detailed references,has met the demands placed on such works in the West. Notes of various length,which accompany the entire text, complete the presentation in the mannerin which European philology has been practiced for centuries. In contrast to hispredecessors in the East and West – the Ottoman tezkirecis {biographers},Hammer, Gibb, and others – he considers Ottoman literature as the result of thegeneral literary development of the Turkish peoples during the thirteenth andfourteenth centuries.”8 Mordtmann also describes the very rich contents ofthis work and then adds that “because of its size, which would surely make afull translation prohibitive, certain parts should at least be made accessible toEuropean colleagues.”9Let me state that, unfortunately, when Early Mystics appeared not a singlereview of it was published in our country. One reason for this is that the bookconstituted as much a turning point in our scholarly research in Turcology as itdid in the scholarly life of the author, and consequently our scholars had not yetattained a level of competence that would allow them to evaluate it. In theWestern scholarly world, however, following Huart and Mordtmann, J. Németh,Professor of Turcology at the University of Budapest, evaluated this work.The latter states, “In this work, Köprülü-Zâde Mehmed Fuad, Professor of thehistory of Turkish literature at the University of Constantinople, has, on the onehand, provided a synthesis of knowledge on the origin and early developmentof Turkish mystical poetry and, on the other, presented all the basic and a greatmany secondary problems of early Turkish literature related to his subject,which he has studied in a detailed and most critical manner. In both parts ofthe work, he has succeeded to a degree that one would hardly expect giventhe present state of research. European education, extensive study of Turkishliterature, mastery of philology, ability to express oneself clearly, rich resources(the libraries and manuscript collections of Constantinople), and the results ofearlier research have all contributed to the creation of this distinguished book.Köprülü-Zâde has produced a guide to this difficult field. It presents manyproblems in a clear light and will facilitate to a significant degree future research.”In the same review of Early Mystics, which he considered to be the harbingerof a bright future for research in Turkey on the history of Turkish literature,Professor Németh acknowledges Köprülü’s authority and ends by saying,“Altogether, thanks to Köprülü-Zâde and his school in Constantinople who havemade accessible to us the bases of their research (texts and other sources) ina philologically reliable manner, we hope that the history of Turkish literaturewill thus finally occupy its proper place as a worthy discipline in the ranks ofthe historical studies of other literatures. No one is more competent to lead thisPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"xlvwork, on the basis of his abilities and because of his position, than ProfessorKöprülü-Zâde.”10In 1925, Th. Menzel published an article entitled “Die ältesten türkischenMystiker,” based on Early Mystics.11 And in the same year, Köprülü was elected amember of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Before his election, professorsW. Barthold, S. Oldenburg, and I. Krachkovsky prepared a report in which theydescribed the value and originality of his scholarly books and articles publishedup to 1925 and gave perhaps the most prominent place to the ideas in EarlyMystics.12 In this report, they cite the opinion of the late Martin Hartmann, whohad usually been a severe critic of Turkish scholarly works, about the articles onpopular literature that Köprülü had first published in MTM and used as a basisfor writing Early Mystics. In Hartmann’s view, Köprülü’s works were in com-plete conformity with the European scientific method and contained profoundscholarly thought. Other characteristics of his works were his success in showingeverywhere in excellent fashion the relationships between the history of literatureand social life, and in providing new theories to shed light on historical events.Turning to the new ideas presented in Early Mystics, the report notes that thework was well received by French, German, and Hungarian reviewers. It goeson to state that the work was very important for revealing the close relationshipsbetween the nefc UarCqa of the Central Asian Turk Armad Yasawc and the BektashcUarCqa of Asia Minor. And according to the French reviewer Huart, Köprülü’sstudy would require a major revision in the ideas of European scholars aboutthe Bektashcs – as portrayed in both Georg Jacob’s famous book {Die Bektaschijjein ihrem Verhältnis zu verwandten Erscheinungen (Munich, 1909)} and R. Tschudi’sarticle in the EI1 on this subject {s.v. “Bektash”}. The report then goes on toanalyze Early Mystics.I believe that the material that I have presented to this point has revealed theimportance of Early Mystics with respect to its repercussions in France, Germany,Hungary, and Russia.13*When our author wrote Early Mystics, he was twenty-eight years old. He had notyet established his rich library, which today is connected by a corridor to the topfloor of his house in the Akbıyık section of Istanbul and which is also reached bya stairway from the garden.14 At that time, his library was in the large room onthe second floor of this house opposite the stairs. Köprülü has stated that hewrote Early Mystics in this room in a year and a half and then spent more thananother year revising it. In this work, which focused on subjects and problemsthat had been virtually unexplored up to that time, the author, following themost rigorous scholarly methods, demonstrated the ability to synthesize andpresent in Turkish the rich material that he had obtained not only frompublished sources in Oriental and Western languages but also from manuscriptsin the libraries of Istanbul and Europe and his own unique manuscripts andPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"xlvithose of his friends. Early Mystics constituted, in fact, a beginning, a turningpoint, for his subsequent scholarly research.Professor Köprülü always had a national objective in his research and it wasfor this reason that he divided Early Mystics into two parts: “Armad Yasawc andHis Influence {on Turkish Literature}” and “Yenus Emre and His Influence{on Turkish Literature}.” In this way, he wanted to prove that “the Turkishliterature of Anatolia had not developed separately and independently from theliterature of the Turks in other regions, that it was a continuation of the past {i.e.earlier Turkish literature}, and that, consequently, one could only write a historyof Turkish literature by studying it as a whole” (p. 3 of the first edition). Let meimmediately state that while the life, work, and influence of Armad Yasawc andYenus Emre – the first of whom lived in Turkistan in the sixth/twelfth centuryand the second of whom, who continued his tradition, lived in Anatolia – arestudied in Early Mystics, the book also sheds light on their milieus and on theirethnic, religious, linguistic, literary, and political characteristics. Indeed, althoughnefc literature from the sixth/twelfth century to recent times constitutes the coreof the book, the material presented on the influence of these two great Turkishmystics and their imitators includes information on the history and social,linguistic, and literary life of the period in general. Another valuable feature isthat, as in subsequent studies, the author is not content with simply providinginformation on these various topics, but also draws attention to scholarly problemsthat have not been investigated and need to be studied. For all these reasons – itscomprehensive coverage of the subject, the rich information that it contains,and its masterful composition based on the most rigorous methodology – EarlyMystics is a milestone of scholarship.*It is appropriate to give a brief account of how the second edition of Early Mysticswas prepared and to describe the differences between it and the first edition.Köprülü worked continuously between September and December of 1963 toprepare the second edition of this book. While I read the text that was typedwith the new letters {Latin alphabet}, Köprülü would follow along in the originalwork. On some subjects – for example, the linguistic characteristics of theDCwAn-i Likmat (pp. 107–24 of the second edition) – he would say, “What diffi-culties I encountered while writing this! At that time there was nothing writtenon this subject.” Furthermore, he placed marks at the required places for theadditions that he was planning to make at the end of the book. In fact, he hadalready put such marks in his personal copy and had even entered some notes.He said, for instance, that he had made a lot of notes on Luqman-i Paranda.Because of the essentially plain language of the book, we changed certain Persianphrases and foreign words that are no longer used today {in Turkish}. Therevisions and additions that Köprülü was going to make were to be placed at theend of the book, so nothing was added to the main body of the work exceptPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"xlviisome limited bibliographic information. {Fortunately,} almost all the booksin foreign languages that Köprülü had used were in his library in Istanbul.Nevertheless, writing the names of these books and their authors, all of whichhad been in the Arabic alphabet in the first edition, in their original form provedto be an enormous task. After four months of continuous work, the text wasready for the press. At the beginning of 1964, it was delivered to the Office of theChief of Religious Affairs.The following are the major differences between the first and second editionsof Early Mystics:1As the author stated in the preface {to the first edition} of his book, hewas not able to see certain studies despite making every effort to do so. Afterindicating that some of them were important, he said, “If I come across any ofthese sources while my book is in press, I will not hesitate to include them at thelast minute in the Corrections and Additions section.” It is clear from this that heplanned to work on the book even after it was given to the press. Indeed, inthe Corrections and Additions section that he attached to the end of the book,he explained, “The number of printing errors in my book was very low and, onthe whole, so obvious to the reader as to be of no significance. However, morethan a year passed between the time the book went to the press and the timeit appeared from the press. During this period, I continued my research andnoticed some mistakes in both the typescript and published text as well as a fewrather important omissions. It was possible, of course, to leave them to thesecond edition of the book, but there was considerable doubt about when theremight be a second edition. Consequently, I was compelled to add this shortsection containing major errors and omissions in order for the first edition ofmy book to have as few deficiencies as possible when presented for criticism.Nevertheless, in a study of this nature, which covers a broad and completelyunknown subject for the first time, there is no doubt that many errors anddeficiencies will remain. I hope to make up for them by benefiting from thecriticism to which my work will be subject.” After this, thirty-five entries aregiven (pp. 395 – 400). In the second edition, these corrections and additions havebeen inserted in their proper place in the text and notes, and therefore havebeen deleted from the end of the book.2The author also continued his research while the section called “Correc-tions and Additions” was being set in type. As he states, “After the ‘Correctionsand Additions’ section was printed, I came across some information on thefamous cauldron in the türbe {mausoleum} of Armad Yasawc and I could notavoid inserting it here.” He then attached one more page under the heading“Appendix” (p. 401). In the second edition, this section has been removed andplaced where it belongs in the book.3In the first edition, under the heading “Bibliography,” which was arrangedalphabetically, Köprülü explained, “While writing my book, I provided sufficientinformation on every page concerning the various sources to which I referred.There were, however, some works, mainly manuscripts, about which noPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"xlviiiinformation was given {in the text}. I therefore found it appropriate to give abrief description of them here. The works next to which there is an asterisk aremanuscripts. In my bibliographic entries, I did not consider it important whetherworks were in manuscript or published, or written in different languages. I listedthem alphabetically according to the name of the author. Works whose authorsare unknown were entered alphabetically according to their titles.” Then comesthe bibliographic data (pp. 403 –16). In the second edition, the author thought itbetter to place the information given on a work in the bibliography withinbrackets next to its title in the general index. This information comes immedi-ately after the numbers referring to the pages on which the work is mentioned inthe book. In this way, the information that had been given in the bibliography,which we have deleted, can be more extensively and easily used.4In the first edition, the bibliography was followed by the table of contents(pp. 417– 24). The author had taken great pains to arrange this section in orderof subject rather than by heading; and for the second edition he has placed itverbatim at the beginning of the book under the heading “Contents.” The pagenumbers for the table of contents have, naturally, been changed to correspond tothe new edition.5In the first edition, under the heading “General Index,” which containedthe proper names in the text in alphabetical order, Köprülü stated, “The namesof authors, whose works can be found directly under their names in the Correc-tions and Additions {i.e. bibliography} section are not included in this list. As Isaid in the preface, I had originally decided to have two separate lists, one forpersonal names and one for place names, but I later came to prefer the presentarrangement.” Thus the General Index contained historical names, with theexception of the names of authors, and geographical names (pp. 425 – 46). Thisindex also contained a limited number of technical terms. Alpler devri, for example,is included but alp-erenler is not. Following the author’s suggestion, this GeneralIndex was removed and replaced at the end of the second edition with one thatcontains everything that had been in the General Index plus the names of allworks and authors that were in the text or had been in the Corrections andAdditions and Appendix sections as well as all expressions and technical termsconcerning history, literature, language, religion, mysticism, etc.In both editions, the arrangement of the remaining parts is the same. Twodiagrams, entitled “The Yasawiyya Chain of Authority” and “The Zangc AtaChain of Authority,” and the musical scores for twelve of the hymns of YenusEmre are placed at the end of the book and separated from the text. In the firstedition, the illustrations “Turkistan: The City of Yasc” and “The Tomb of ArmadYasawc in Turkistan” were published as a supplement to the text {i.e. separately}.*The proofs of the book were first corrected by the Office of the Chief of ReligiousAffairs. Around the middle of September 1965, Professor Köprülü began toPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"xlixwork on correcting them a second time. As I read and corrected the proofs,he followed along in the first edition of his book. On Friday, October 15, he hadworked more than three hours in this fashion at Türk Tarih Kurumu {theTurkish Historical Society, in Ankara}. On that day, we had reached the end ofthe section on the rules {AdAb, etiquette, protocol} of the Yasawc UarCqa, whichbegan on page 80, in our corrections. In this section the duties of murCds {novices,disciples} to their murshid {spiritual guide} were discussed. Once while correctingthis section, Köprülü assumed a joking manner as he spoke of unpleasantmatters and said, “Do you see? The paths of discipleship are difficult.” And headded, “You shall complete what I have left half finished.” On Monday we weregoing to continue the corrections, but that evening while walking home from theTurkish Historical Society, he suffered that regrettable traffic accident. I visitedhim many times in the hospital and, although he said that I should continue thejob of making the corrections and that, in any case, he would soon be on his feetand then be able to work again, he was never able to get beyond the subject ofthe rules of the Yasawc UarCqa. To be sure, Early Mystics was a solid work withrespect to the fundamental material on which it was based and very little criti-cism of any kind was directed toward it that would cause any change in thismaterial. Nevertheless, Köprülü had continued his research {on this subject}during the almost fifty years that had passed since the book was published; andhe said that he had thought about providing an appendix at the end of the bookfor the notes that he had taken from this research because they would enrich thepresent material. What a pity that this was not possible!In 1964, while we were organizing his library in his home in Ankara, Pro-fessor Köprülü took Early Mystics from a shelf and, opening it to the first page,said, “Do you see? I wrote the death dates of my relatives here. This is the dateof my father’s death . . .” Because of its religio-mystical subject, this book had aspiritual value for him. This famous work, which attracted the attention ofWestern Turcologists to our country, was truly a turning point in his scholarlylife. Exerting an enormous effort, he had written it at the age of twenty-eight,an age that was young for one to be called a true scholar. On April 27, 1966, hesigned off on the proofs for the text of the second edition. This was the last workon which he was able to sign off for publication. Around the middle of thefollowing May, he was able to see the first volume of his Edebiyat araZtırmaları,which was published by the Turkish Historical Society,15 but he was not ableto see the second edition of Early Mystics, which he had wished so much to becompleted.Our esteemed and great teacher! The second edition of Early Mystics is nowfinished and has been published by the Office of the Chief of Religious Affairs,which is responsible for administering the religious affairs of our country.

In this article, Huart mentions the founding of the HistoricalSociety {Tarih Encümeni} in Istanbul and the beginning of research on new docu-ments, and then draws our attention to a very important point, namely that this work,which was written when the Ottoman Empire was on the verge of collapse, wasprepared with a national objective in mind, that of investigating the problem of theorigins of this powerful state.

Inaddition to the information given by Németh here on Köprülü’s book, he also statesthat among the manuscript collections of the Hungarian Academy there is a recentMS belonging to Armad Yasawc of which Köprülü was unaware.

Later he was also sent a diploma of membership. (For more information andthe text of the report, see TM, 2 [1926], 555 –9.) In 1948, Köprülü was expelled as acorresponding member because of his nationalism and the communist bias of certainmembers of this academy. This action stemmed from a letter – which was firstpublished in the communist newspaper in Tbilisi {in Georgia} and then in the majorSoviet newspapers, and broadcast on Soviet radio – signed by two members of theGeorgian Academy. Supposedly based on historical facts, it demanded that a largesection of Turkish territory be given to Soviet Georgia. Subsequently, in a series ofPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"liarticles, Köprülü attacked this letter, which was having repercussions in the worldpress. (See “Gürcü âlimlerine cevap – I. Tarih, yalancı zâhit olamaz”; “II. Tarih dexil,efsâne”; “III.

One must distinguish this popular {khalq} nefcliterature,which was clearly related to the pre-Islamic folk {qawmC} literature, from theabundant and artful compositions that Turkish poets – who translated, andskillfully and enthusiastically imitated, the nefc works of the Persians – wrote inthe “arEQ meter1 and most often in pompous language. Because these two currentscontinued parallel to each other for centuries, they naturally influenced eachother. Nevertheless, despite such mutual influence and the many Persian elementsthat were incorporated, it is possible, indeed essential, to study the popular nefcliterature – if one can use this expression – as a separate phenomenon.2Because we {Turks} forgot our distinctive national character in the middleages under Persian influence and, since the Tanzimat {the Ottoman reformmovement between 1839 and 1878}, under European influence, popular nefcliterature, like everything related to, or derived from, the people, has beenneglected, even regarded with contempt. Unlike the artists who wrote pompousworks in imitation of the Persians, the popular mystics, who tried to impart, withsimple and sincere hymns, the sacred fire that burned in the depth of their souls,were forgotten. Earlier generations, even if they did not allow these hymns anyaesthetic value, at least attributed to them a sacred quality. In recent times,because this view also has disappeared, no one even remembers who wrotethem. Among the trifling things that have been written on our literary historysince the Tanzimat, and that do not have any scholarly value, not a single linementioning the existence of the popular mystics can be found. However, thisnefc literature of the common people, which is closely related to early popularliterature and is very valuable in revealing the national spirit, has a long history.The Turks embraced Islam within a short time and of their own free will,unlike many others who were converted by the sword. And these Muslim Turksdid not refrain from making religious propaganda among their brothers who hadnot yet entered the Islamic fold or, if they had, did not properly conform to itsbeliefs and principles. These then were the spiritual conditions under which"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"liiiearly Turkish literature spread in Islamic form. A number of Turkish dervishes,animated by the desire to spread the new religion and its UarCqas, moved amongthe nomadic Turks and tried to propagate this new religious ideal in a languagethey could understand and in an aesthetic form they would appreciate. This isthe reason why the popular literature, which had prevailed among the Turksfor centuries, served as a model for the mystical literature whose foundationwas being laid. This mystical literature, which produced works that were ratherdry and simple in the earliest stages that we can discern – probably because itpursued a propagandistic goal – was increasingly refined over the centuries tothe extent that it acquired a special quality that revealed the Turkish nationalgenius. In fact, works were created that could compare with the most sublimePersian mystical compositions. This popular nefc literature, which is so charac-teristically Turkish that nothing like it is found among the Arabs and Persians, istherefore worthy of special and careful study.Up to now, the few general works and monographs that have been written inthe East and West on our literary history have been largely devoid of scientificvalue. Consequently, the problem of the general development of Turkish literatureis still an unsolved mystery for the scholarly world. I must say that, unfortu-nately, no one – from Joseph von Hammer(-Purgstall) to E. J. W. Gibb, or fromour old official biographers to the few rare scholars of today – has realized thatit is necessary to study as a whole the literary development, over at least thirteenor fourteen centuries, of the entire Turkish nation from Inner Asia to the shoresof the Mediterranean. In the hands of researchers who consider the variousbranches of the Turks to be separate nations with no connection to each other,who do not understand the bonds and relationships among them, and who seeno need to study the general history of the Turks in a comprehensive fashion,this important part of world history will remain a mystery forever. Fortunately,the historical research that has modestly begun in our country in the past six orseven years has revealed the error of this point of view, to which Orientalistshave been bound up to now, as well as the path that must be followed in orderto study the past and bring it to life.3 We will see in the future what importantresults this approach will have in the study of all branches of Turkish history.When a group of events are connected and have influenced each other, it willalways produce mistaken results to take into account some of them while ignoringthe rest, or to try to understand any series of events by completely neglectingtheir origin. Without understanding pre-Islamic Turkish literature, it is impossibleto explain that of the Islamic periods. Without knowing how Turkish literaturedeveloped in Central Asia and Asia Minor up to the formation of the Ottomanstate, it is impossible to comprehend the development of Ottoman literature.Indeed, it is a mistake to ignore any of the literatures that have appeared in eachperiod in the different geographical areas where the Turks have lived, and therelationships among these literatures. It is meaningless to try to understand, forexample, the period of Armad Pasha {Bursalı, d. 902/1496 –7} without know-ing {Mcr ‘Alc Shcr} Nawa’c {d. 906/1501}. In like manner, in order to graspPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"livscientifically the development of Turkish literature, it is also necessary to under-stand the special developments of popular literature and “Ashıq {minstrel} literaturein every period and region and the influences and reactions upon each other ofthe classes of literatures addressed to all these different levels of taste.4Once these requirements are clear – i.e. once these new points of view areaccepted – the first task is to write monographs on the different periods of ourliterary history, on the literatures in the various Turkish dialects and on variousimportant figures, in other words, to conduct meticulous and systematic analyseson literary phenomena, undertaken with a synthetic goal in mind. Indeed,history today is not a mass of endless and unconnected data, but a product ofsynthesis and composition. For historians who accept the notion that socialfactors determine the course of events, history is neither a work of art nor simplyan exercise in erudition. Consequently, in order for a historian not to be leftbewildered when faced with a mass of important events, he must rely on a set ofhypotheses derived from the systematic study of these events, i.e. he must com-bine, classify, and compare the data that he collects and then establish certainframeworks in his mind in order to be able to reach any conclusions from them.This approach – which is also what we call intuition – is possible as a result of ahistorian’s familiarity with, and affinity for, his subject over many years and iscompletely scientific. It has no connection with preconceived ideas, becausethese hypotheses and frameworks arise out of lengthy and systematic study ofthe events themselves, i.e. from meticulous and profound analyses. Given thateven mathematicians and specialists in the natural sciences have accepted thenecessity and importance of hypotheses in their work, it is impossible for anyscholar not to perceive the need for them in a more complex field like the socialsciences. Taking all these observations into account, it is easily conceded that fora true historian, who has complete command of his subject, erudition is not agoal, but it is a requisite condition. Simple syntheses that are not based onextensive and rigorous analyses, no matter how bright their apparent scientificluster, are doomed to collapse in the face of serious criticism.After this brief explanation of my views on literary history, I would like to saya few words about the nature of this modest monograph that I have presentedfor criticism. Some four or five years ago, I published a rather long study onKhwaja Armad Yasawc, the herald of popular nefc literature among the EasternTurks and their greatest representative, and another on Yenus Emre, who isconsidered the earliest and greatest popular nefc poet of the Western Turks.5The major thesis of those studies was that popular nefc literature among theWestern Turks was influenced by Armad Yasawc. In the study on Armad Yasawcin particular, I tried to support this hypothesis with the help of historical docu-ments, in addition to literary and linguistic comparisons, and I presented con-siderable material relating to his fame, his disciples, his miracles, etc. among theWestern Turks. In this way, I wished to demonstrate that the Turkish literatureof Anatolia had not developed separately and independently from the literatureof the Turks in other regions, that it was a continuation of the past {i.e. earlierPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"lvTurkish literature}, and that, consequently, one could only write a history ofTurkish literature by studying it as a whole. During this time, I was not evenaware that Mr E. J. W. Gibb had discovered some common points betweenArmad Yasawc and Yenus Emre. Nevertheless, I set out to prove a much broaderclaim than his and put forward the bold hypothesis that the popular nefc literarymovement among the Western Turks originated from the Eastern Turks andespecially Armad Yasawc.As a result of continuous work over the past four or five years, and as thefruit of investigating Turkish literature as a whole, I have arrived at some clearand specific ideas regarding the literary development of the Turkish nation. Ihave also engaged in detailed studies on the pre-Islamic literature of the Turks,the scholarly study of which up to now had been regarded as impossible. All ofthis has made it possible to defend much more forcefully and definitively thehypothesis that I made five years ago. For a historian, nothing more gratifyingcan be imagined than to be able to support a hypothesis made years earlier withnew documents that were discovered later. While studying the different periodsand branches of Turkish literature, I obtained a number of documents on ArmadYasawc, Yenus Emre, and popular nefc literature among the Turks. Thus Ifelt obliged to combine and synthesize these materials and to write this mono-graph on an aspect of Turkish literature that displays most clearly its nationalspirit and taste.I have published this book under the title Early Mystics in Turkish Literaturemainly because I have included extensive material on the life and works of thesetwo great personalities in addition to showing, in general, how popular nefcliterature began among the Turks and the various causes and influences underwhich it developed. The work is thus divided into two parts. In the first, Idescribe broadly Turkish literature up to Armad Yasawc and the spread of Islamand nefism among the Turks. Then I provide more detailed information onthe legendary and historical life of Armad Yasawc, on the rules of his UarCqa, onhis spiritual successors {khalCfas}, on his works and influence. Because this partconstitutes in itself a monograph on Armad Yasawc, all issues connected withhim – even a number of secondary topics that at first glance might seem extra-neous – are dealt with in full detail. Those who believe that such minute detailsare appropriate for any monograph will excuse the author. On matters notdirectly concerned with Armad Yasawc, such as his khalCfas and his poetic imit-ators, naturally I have not maintained the same degree of detail but have treatedthem in a more general manner. Nevertheless, this first part clearly showsthe general outline of popular nefc literature among the Eastern Turks and itshistorical development.As for the second part, which describes the origin and development of thistype of literature among the Western Turks, it constitutes a monograph onYenus Emre and, following the format of the first part, gives a fully detailedaccount of all issues connected with him, even if not touching directly on literaryhistory. An extensive description is given of Yenus Emre’s legendary life, hisPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"lvihistorical life, his poetry and its different characteristics, and his influence. Thena brief general account is given of his principal followers, their lives and works.But as with the first part, this second part also clearly explains the origin anddevelopment of popular nefc literature among the Western Turks. Although allsources and documents are given individually in the footnotes, I have found itnecessary to add a bibliography at the end of the book to facilitate the work ofresearchers and especially university students. Furthermore, I give short descrip-tions there of manuscripts, some of which are completely unknown to the scholarlyworld, as well as information that I regard as necessary and useful on many{published} sources or studies in different languages. Finally, I have added twoindexes {subsequently changed to one in the first edition of Early Mystics}, inalphabetical order, of personal names and place names, which should be offurther assistance to those working in various fields of history.A quick perusal of the bibliography will indicate how much attention to detailI have given in my book, even regarding secondary and tertiary issues, and howmany and varied sources I have consulted. Indeed, I can state that my bookpresents a canvas of many important historical problems that are still unknownto the scholarly world but are worthy of study, and that it provides the primarysources for studying them. If my book can serve in this fashion as a modest guidefor future research, this would be the greatest satisfaction that I could receivefrom my work. I must attribute the deficiencies in my book especially to the factthat there are very few works on the Eastern Turks in the libraries of Istanbuland that it was also almost impossible to find there works published in Europe. Forexample, Zeki Velidi {i.e. Ahmed Zeki Velidi Togan} stated in his Türk-Tatartarihi {Kazan, 1912} that the Russian Orientalists S. E. Malov, N. F. Katanov,and S. M. Matveev had made studies on Armad Yasawc and his khalCfas, butdespite all my efforts, I was not able to see them. Furthermore, I was unfortunatelyunable to examine K. G. Zaleman’s article on lakcm Ata and N. I. Veselovskii’swork on the türbe and mosque of Armad Yasawc, both of which are mentionedby P. M. Melioransky in the Encyclopaedia of Islam {EI1, s.v. “Armed Yesewc”}.Since Melioransky is silent about the Russian sources mentioned by Zeki Bey,this could be an indication that they are not of great importance. Whatever thecase, to see and review these sources would not have been without advantage. IfI come across any of these sources while my book is in press, I will not hesitate toinclude them at the last minute in the Corrections and Additions section. I canclaim, nevertheless, with strong conviction that any deficiencies arising from nothaving seen the aforesaid sources could not have a great effect on the work as awhole. If this small product of five or six years work sheds light on, and explainsin broad outline, a problem that has remained unknown up to now, namely theproblem of the origin and development of popular nefc literature among theTurks, I hope readers will excuse any errors and deficiencies in the details.Fuad KöprülüIstanbul, July 28, 1918PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"lviiNOTES1 {On this topic, see YA, s.v. “Arûz,” the sections on Persian and Turkish literature( M. F. Köprülü); and EIr, s.v. “‘are.” (L. P. Elwell-Sutton).}2 Here the word khalq is used as the equivalent of French populaire. It would be wrong toconclude, as some have done, that this term is used pejoratively. The works created bythis literature, which should not be confused with the products of folklore, were greetedenthusiastically not only by the common people, but also by the scholarly and refinedcircles of the upper classes. See the narrative of this book. {Köprülü’s distinctionbetween “popular” and “folk” literature is not always clear. He often uses khalq tomean both.}3 This view was described and defended in detail for the first time in my article “Türkedebiyatı tarihinde usûl,” Bilgi Mecmuası, 1 (1329/1913), 3–52. This same view was alsoclearly expressed in the introduction to my book Türk edebiyatı tarihine medhal {no suchbook was published, but the first part appeared as the article “Türk edebiyatınınmenze’i” – see the bibliography}, but in another fashion.4 For an understanding of my thoughts on this matter in broad measure, see the intro-duction to my article “Türk edebiyatında âzık tarzı’nın menze’ ve tekâmülü hakkındabir tecrübe,” MTM, 1 (1331/1915), pp. 35 – 46. {Reprinted in his Edebiyat araZtırmaları.}5 “Ahmed Yesevî ve Çaxatay ve Osmanlı edebiyatları üzerinde te’sirleri,” Bilgi Mecmuası,{vol. 1}, 1330/1914, 611– 45; and “Yenus Emre,” Türk Yurdu, 4 {1329/1913}, 612–21, and “Yenus Emre, âsârı,” 5 {1329/1913}, 922–30.PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Part IAlMAD YASAWh ANDHIS INFLUENCE ONTURKISH LITERATURE"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE2"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE BEFORE AlMAD YASAWh31TURKISH LITERATURE BEFOREAlMAD YASAWhA Pre-Islamic literatureThe literature produced by the Turks before their adoption of Islam consisted –with the exception of some insignificant translations made under Chinese,Indian, and Iranian influence – of popular poetry sung to the accompaniment ofthe saz {a Turkish stringed instrument, see EI2, s.v. “Saz” ( J. Cler)}. In all thesocial institutions of the Turks at that time, there was, moreover, a primitivegenuineness that revealed the spirit and personality of the people in language,religion, ethics, customs, and legal practices. Although the civilizations of China,India, and Iran had begun to have an influence on the Turks in some fields, this{cultural} penetration was very piecemeal and superficial. Because it never spreadfrom the center to the periphery, i.e. from the enlightened elite to the mass of thepeople, it was not able to have a real effect on society. Thus, the works thatconstituted the Turkish literature of that time were also, in conformity with theother elements of society, far from foreign influence and genuinely reflected allthe attributes of the people. Everyone, from the ruler to the most insignificantperson, sensed himself in the {popular} poetry. Poets in that period were uni-formly simple men with kopuz {ancestor of the saz} in hand. Wandering fromencampment to encampment, they would appear at public or private gatheringsand sing the exploits of the old heroes and recite the national epics, or fashionnew {folk} songs {s. türkü} about recent events. At the same time, they mightalso perform magic or do fortune telling with their kopuzes. And the poets werecertainly present at national hunting rites, called sıgır {properly, sagır, “royalbattue”}, at public banquets or Zölen, and at mourning ceremonies called yoX.All of this poetry was recited in the syllabic meter {hece vezni}, which wasnatural for Turkish. This metrical system had several varieties depending on thenumber of syllables, because Turkish syllables, while they are all precise andunvarying in length, naturally divide into groups with distinct pauses or caesuras.The oldest were the simplest, i.e. the ones with the smallest number of syllables.All of the poems of that period, whatever the subject, had a precise form. Inthese early forms of Turkish poetry, two main features are conspicuous. The firstis the paucity and specificity of the forms. The reason for this is that the literary"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE4personality in those primitive times could not develop freely, but every poethad to respect the existing forms with a kind of religious devotion. Second, instrophes of poetry, which were usually composed of four verses {i.e. quatrains},only the first three verses rhyme with each other while the fourth rhymes with{the fourth line of } all the strophes. It seems clear that this type of poetry waswritten to be sung and that the fourth verse always naturally maintained thesame rhyme, operating like the refrain of a folk song. In the works of this earlyperiod, when music and poetry had not yet been separated, the rules of rhymewere also very simple and basic, so much so that, in the modern sense, it wouldbe more correct to speak of assonance rather than rhyme. For them, it wassufficient for the last syllables of the verses to have a slight similarity, in order tocreate a rhyme, and this similarity was usually brought about by the inflection ofverbs, thus assuring the poets an ample ease of composition. In short, althoughthe literary products of this early period were of limited scope, simple, and basic,they sprang from the spirit of an entire people and expressed their joys andsorrows. This elementary, but lively and heartfelt literature, which spread withvigor and majesty across the steppes of Asia, was rich enough to show the roughand warlike and, at the same time, refined and profound spirit of the Turk in itsnaked glory.1B The Turks and IslamIn the sixth century ce, the Turks known as the Göktürks established a largeempire in Central Asia, stretching from Siberia to Lake Baikal, and began, onthe one hand, to threaten seriously China and, on the other, the Sasanid rulers.They even held discussions with the Byzantine Empire {about an alliance}against {the Sasanid ruler} Khusraw Aneshirwan. Problems of succession, how-ever, resulted in the division of this empire into two parts, known as the Westernand the Eastern Turks, in 581. In the eighth century, it almost seemed that theEastern Turks, or T’u-Chüe, would be able to re-establish the former Turkishunity, but at that time Arab armies propagating a new religion enteredTransoxiana under the command of Amcr Qutaiba {b. Muslim}. Both the West-ern and Eastern Göktürks resisted the Muslim invasion for a long time. The newreligion gradually advanced, however, sometimes by blood and iron and sometimesby peaceful means, and expanded its area {of dominance} toward the east.In order to invade Soghdia and Farghana, the Muslim armies that weremarshalled in Khurasan followed the old military road that passed throughMarw and Balkh south of the Amu Darya {Oxus} River. Despite the greatdisorders that the Turkish world then faced, it occasionally struck fairly successfulblows against the conquerors. In 712, a Turkish army entered Soghdia andrendered great assistance to the local population, who had risen in revolt afterQutaiba’s return to Marw, and left the Arabs in possession of only the city ofSamarqand. Nevertheless, the following year, the Arabs again carried outsuccessful conquests in the region. After the death of Emperor Mo-ch’o {716,"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE BEFORE AlMAD YASAWh5the ruler of the Eastern Turks}, the Western Turks again separated from theEastern Turks. But Su-lu, a leader of the Türgesh, who had formed a stronggovernment and had taken possession of the old provinces of the Western Göktürksbetween Talas {oaraz} and Tokmak, did not want to give up Transoxianaeasily. Consequently, for most of his life, he did not leave the Arabs in Soghdiain peace. Although the conquests of Qutaiba had advanced rather far to thenorth of the Amu Darya, the Turks, who had previously penetrated deeply intoIran, were able to hold out and entered the region of Gurgan via the corridorbetween the Amu Darya and the Caspian Sea.During the period of the Arab Umayyad caliphate, the situation in Transoxianaremained in doubt for a long time. If the plan of Caliph ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Azcz{d. 101/720} to build caravansaries and hospitals throughout his domainand establish a just administration, while not taking kharAj {land tax on non-Muslims} from converts, had been properly applied, Transoxiana would havebeen very quickly Islamized. The tyrannical and selfish policy of the Umayyadsprevented this, however, and war against the Turks continued for a long time.During this interval, the Chinese unjustly killed the ruler of Shash {Tashkent},who had surrendered to them. His son took refuge with the Muslims and soughttheir help. Although the Chinese dispatched a powerful army with the support ofthe Ikhshcd of Farghana, the army that Abe Muslim sent under the command ofZiyad b. nalir completely defeated it – because of the uprising of the Qarluqs.2This battle (133/751) then sealed the fate of Transoxiana, which, henceforth,would definitely be Islamized and enter the orbit of Islamic civilization. And,indeed, so it was.During the ‘Abbasid caliphate, the Turks were not able to carry out a majoroperation in Transoxiana, only some minor actions. As in the Umayyad period,there were no formidable masses of Turks to resist the Arabs. After the defeat ofthe Chinese and the collapse of the Türgesh state, two groups of Turks appeared.The Qarluqs conquered the entire province of Yedi-Su {Semirechy} and theregion east of the Syr Darya { Jaxartes} and in 766 took the capital {Seyab/Ordukent} of the Türgesh. Meanwhile, the Oghuz took the area west of theSyr Darya. These were the remnants of the Western Turks who had scatteredafter the death of Su-lu. It was these Oghuz who participated in the events ofthe ninth century, and they should not be confused with the Toquz Oghuz{i.e. Uighurs} of Eastern Turkistan. Although they were unable to conductlarge-scale operations, they occasionally pillaged the countryside, became involvedin uprisings in Transoxiana and came to the aid of local rulers or Arabs who hadrebelled. Large walls were built around cities like Bukhara and Shash as protec-tion from their depredations.Transoxiana became completely Muslim in the Samanid period. Most ofthe people of that region were probably already Muslim by the reign of Caliphal-Mu‘tatim {d. 247/861} and even carried out military expeditions {ghazA} againstthe unbelievers in the desert. As the people of Shash had done previously,the inhabitants of Isfcjab, north of the Syr Darya, also converted to Islam a short"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE6time after Ner b. Asad, the uncle of the first Samanid ruler Isma‘cl b. Armad,captured that city in 838. Furthermore, Caliph al-Ma’men, as a result of variouscampaigns, brought members of important local families to the capital of thecaliphate {Baghdad} and induced them to convert by bestowing upon themmajor gifts and other rewards. This sensible policy of Islamization was followedeven more vigorously during the reign of al-Mu‘tatim when Turks from theareas of Soghd, Farghana, Ushresana, and Shash were taken directly into thecaliph’s imperial guard. Al-Mu‘tatim built the city of Samarra for his Turkishbodyguard troops. After al-Mu‘tatim’s reign, not only did the number and influ-ence of the Turks in Iraq gradually increase, but this situation also contributedto the rapid Islamization of Turkistan.3 In 350 ah {961} nomads of 200,000tents – Qarluqs, Oghuz, and the remnants of the Western Turks – who lived,without recognizing Muslim rule, in territories on the Muslim side of the fortifiedfrontier between Shash and Farab accepted Islam. This religion also began tobe firmly established in the fourth/tenth century in the areas of Kashghar andBalasaghen. During the fifth/eleventh century, at any rate, virtually the entireTurkish world did become Islamized and fell under the influence of Islamiccivilization.4C The ∞§f¢ movementAs early as the second/eighth century, Islam had begun to differ significantlyfrom its original form. In fact, when various nations {s. millet} who had livedwith their own cultures and traditions for centuries in different parts of the worldentered the sphere of Islam, they inevitably introduced a great many changeseven on the most fundamental points. An old and rich civilization like that ofIran was thus able to defend at least its moral independence against the irresistibleforce from the desert. Subsequently, because of its rapid spread, Islam also cameface to face with civilizations and religions other than Iran. The influence ofIndian civilization (even if indirect), Judaism, Christianity (which had completelydominated Syria), intellectual movements that resulted from the translation ofthe works of the ancient Greek philosophers – these and many other factorsaffected the development of Islam. Consequently, throughout the Islamic realmthere were a great many religious doctrines {s. madhhab} and sects {s. maslak}that clashed sharply with each other.5 The old Sasanid dominion, which wasalready on the verge of collapse because of steadily increasing Turkish attacks,6initially submitted to the Arab sword; but then the Iranian spirit {Yrânîlik}, byconsidering the descendants of lusain {the grandson of the Prophet} to be theinheritors and successors of the Sasanids, struck terrible blows against the Arabnation and the Islamic religion under the screen of “defending the rights of ahlal-bait” {the family of the Prophet}. By insinuating Zoroastrian beliefs in aMuslim guise, the Iranian spirit asserted itself, demonstrating that an ancientcivilization could not easily be destroyed.7 In the fifth/eleventh and sixth/twelfthcenturies, various religious doctrines and practices held sway throughout the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE BEFORE AlMAD YASAWh7Muslim world and the personal and political ambitions of the rulers gave greatscope to their development.8One of the most striking things in many places in the Islamic world at thattime was the spread of mysticism {nefism} and the multitude of mystics {nefcs}.nefism hardly existed in the first centuries of Islam. It took shape under theinfluence of Iranian, Indian, and Greek ideas, and to some degree Christianity –albeit taking most elements from Islam – and soon spread throughout the Mus-lim world.9 Beginning with Abe Hashim al-Kefc {d. 161/777– 8}, who first tookthe name nefc and founded the first zAwiya {nefc lodge} in Syria, many greatnefcs – including Sufyan al-Thawrc (d. 161/778); Dhe ‘l-Nen al-Mitrc (d. 246/861), who grew up in Egypt, which had been the home of the early Christianhermits; Abe Yazcd al-Bistamc (d. 261/874 –5 or 264/877– 8) from Khurasan;{al-lusain b. Manter} al-lallaj (d. 309/922), about whom all sorts of ideaswere advanced; and al-Junaid al-Baghdadc {d. 298/910} – succeeded in spread-ing their doctrines despite all forms of opposition and imputations. In his fam-ous treatise {al-RisAla al-Qushairiyya}, Abe ‘l-Qasim ‘Abd al-Karcm al-Qushairc(d. 465/1072) tried to demonstrate that the nefc way of life was compatible withSunnc doctrine. Somewhat later, al-Ghazalc (450 –505/1058 –1111) succeeded,in many of his works, in convincing the Sunnc establishment that this was thecase. Afterwards, al-Suhrawardc al-Maqtel {d. 587/1191}, the author of Likmatal-ishrAq, Shihab al-Dcn al-Suhrawardc {d. 632/1234}, the author of “AwArifal-ma“Arif, ‘Abd al-Qadir al-Jclanc (d. 561/1166), and a great many other nefcswho fill the books of UabaqAt al-TEfiyya {nefc biographical dictionaries} gainedtremendous spiritual authority among thousands of disciples, as well as the generalpublic, as they expounded their doctrine.10 Many famous religious scholars{“ulamA”} attached themselves to the great shaikhs, and many rulers and com-manders {s. amCr} encouraged this movement – or, rather, were caught up in it– by sponsoring the construction of zAwiyas and tekkes {also nefc lodges}. Thus,shaikhs and dervishes were trained throughout the Muslim world and new socialgroups were, in effect, brought into being. Moreover, after the death of everygreat shaikh, he acquired a miraculous aura in the popular imagination. Suchflights of fancy fill not only the manAqib works {works of the legendary deeds ofnefc saints}, which are replete with superstitions of no historical value, but alsothose sources that are most valuable for the history of nefism.11D∞§fism in TurkistanKhurasan, which nourished the ancient traditions of Iran in its bosom, wasa primary, perhaps the primary, center of the nefc movement after the rise ofIslam. Consequently, after the Islamization of Transoxiana, it was quite naturalfor this movement to enter Turkistan by the routes that Islam had previouslyfollowed. And this is exactly what happened. In the third/ninth century, nefcswere abundant in Herat, Ncshaper, and Marw, while in the fourth/tenth centuryshaikhs began to appear in Bukhara12 and also in Farghana.13 Indeed, the Turks"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE8in Farghana gave their shaikhs the name bAb, or bAbA. nefcs also appeared amongthe Turks who traveled, in whatever capacity, to and from Khurasan. MurammadMa‘sheq oesc, whom the famous nefc Abe Sa‘cd Ibn Abc ‘l-Khair {d. 440/1049} greatly esteemed, and Amcr ‘Alc ‘Abe were pure Turks.14 In the event,influenced by various factors of this sort, the nefc movement slowly gained strengthamong the Turks as it spread from the great Muslim centers like Bukhara andSamarqand to the hinterlands, and as dervishes, armed with an ecstatic religiouslove, introduced new beliefs among the nomadic Turks.15The spread of nefism, which claimed roots going back to the Prophet via AbeBakr {the first caliph} or ‘Alc {the son-in-law of the Prophet and the fourthcaliph}; the de facto official recognition that it received from the political powersthrough the construction of tekkes; and the high regard that a great many notables,statesmen, and even sultans paid to the shaikhs – all these factors gave theshaikhs enormous moral influence. Both the Qarakhanids, who were so observantof {Islamic} religious norms {s. Rukm} that they would not drink wine, and theearly Seljuks, who defended Islam with enthusiasm and passion, showed greatrespect and reverence to religious scholars and shaikhs alike.16 On the otherhand, because the Turkish rulers were so devoted to Islamic beliefs,17 they hadaccepted lanafism with great vigor and conviction. This tendency, which essenti-ally arose from the social conscience of the Turkish nation, on the one handhindered the spread of heretical Shc‘c and Mu‘tazilc doctrines within Islam and,on the other, also as a natural result of this, created a profound and sincereharmony between legal religious norms and the nefc ideas that developed inTurkish circles.18In my view, by the time Armad Yasawc came on the scene, the Turkish worldhad already been accustomed to nefc ideas for a rather long time – probablysince the fourth/tenth century – and {word of } the legends and miracles ofthe nefcs had spread not only in the cities but also, to some extent, among thenomadic Turks. As for the dervishes, who recited hymns and poetry, who didmany good works for the people in order to please God, and who showed thepeople the ways to happiness and paradise, the Turks enthusiastically acceptedthem and believed what they said, likening them to the ozans {troubadourpoet-singers} whom they had endowed with religious sanctity since ancient times.In this manner, a number of the dervishes, who were called ata {father} or bAb{spiritual leader}, took the place of the old ozans. Well known among the peoplewere tales of such nefcs as Arslan Baba, who was depicted as a companion of theProphet; Korkut Ata,19 the famous patron saint of the ozans who, according tolegend, went from Turkistan to Arabia in order to learn about Islam and, aftermeeting with Abe Bakr, accepted the new faith; and Choban Ata.20 It seemscertain, then, that, at the time of Armad Yasawc, there were dervishes trying tospread Muslim beliefs and traditions among the nomadic Turks, who lived alongthe banks of the Syr Darya and in the steppes, by addressing the people in alanguage they could understand – simple Turkish. One must assume that ArmadYasawc was a greater and more powerful personality than the dervishes who"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE BEFORE AlMAD YASAWh9preceded him. Still, if the earlier generations had not prepared the way for him,his success could not have been as great.E The influence of IranBecause of their geographical location, the Turks were in continuous contactwith China and Iran from very ancient times. The early Chinese chronicles,which are reliable and comprehensive, show the relationship of the Turks withChina fairly clearly. The early relationship of the Turks with Iran, however, onlyenters the light of history – leaving aside the legends in the ShAhnAme – at the timeof the last Sasanid rulers. After the Turks had lived under the influence of thesetwo civilizations for centuries, Iran, which had accepted Islam, gradually broughtthem into its sphere of influence.21 Even during the development of the Uighurcivilization, which was the {Turkish civilization} most strongly influenced byChina, the attraction of the Turks to Iranian civilization, which had proven itsworth in art, language, and thought, was virtually unavoidable, especially after itwas invigorated with a new religion.22Even before it drew the Turks into its sphere of influence, Iranian civilizationhad had, in fact, a major effect on Islam. With respect to the concept of govern-ment and the organization of the state, the ‘Abbasids were attached not to thetraditions of the khulafA” al-rAshidEn {the first four caliphs} but to the mentality ofthe Sasanid rulers.23 After Khurasan and Transoxiana passed into the hands ofnative Iranian – and subsequently highly Iranized Turkish – dynasties with onlynominal allegiance to the ‘Abbasids, the former Iranian spirit, which the Islamiconslaught was not able to destroy despite its ruthlessness, again revealed itself.In the fourth/tenth century, Persian language and literature began to grow anddevelop in an Islamic form. This Perso-Islamic literature was influenced, to alarge extent, by the literature of the conquerors. Not only were a great manywords brought into the language via the new religion, but new verse forms, anew metrical system, and new stylistic norms were also adopted in great measurefrom the Arabs. Indeed, almost nothing remained of the old Iranian syllabicmetrical system, the old verse forms, or the old ideas about literature. Still,the Iranians, as heirs of an ancient civilization, were able to express their ownpersonality in their literature despite this enormous Arab influence. They adoptedfrom the “arEQ meters only those that suited their taste. They created or, perhaps,revived the rubA“C form {of verse}.24 They also introduced novelties in the qaTCdaform {of verse}, which can be considered an old and well known product ofArabic literature, and in the ghazal {lyric “love song”}.25 Above all, by reanimat-ing {their own} ancient mythology, they launched an “epic cycle” that wascompletely foreign to Arabic literature.26 These developments were on such ascale that the fifth/eleventh century witnessed the formation of a new Persianliterature in all its glory.The Turks adopted a great many elements of Islam not directly from theArabs, but via the Iranians. Islamic civilization came to the Turks by way of"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE10Transoxiana from Khurasan, the cultural center of Iran. Indeed, some of thegreat cities of Transoxiana were spiritually far more Iranian than Turkish. Also,the Iranians were no strangers to the Turks, for they had known each other wellbefore the appearance of Islam. For all these reasons, it was the Iranians whoguided the Turks into the sphere of Islamic civilization. This fact, naturally, wasto have a profound influence on the development of Turkish literature over thecenturies.To be sure, we do not know precisely how and to what extent Persianliterature at first influenced Turkish literature, but the earliest Turkish workrecognized by the scholarly world as a product of the post-Islamic period, theKutadgu Bilig written in Kashghar in 462/1069 –70 at the time of the BughraKhans {Qarakhanids}, clearly exhibits Persian influence in many respects. Thisis not the place to give a fully detailed description of this old Turkish composi-tion,27 but the Persian influence on it is striking, especially in language, meter,and form.Linguistically, the Kutadgu Bilig is full of Persian and Arabic words. If one takesinto consideration the longstanding relations of the Turks with the Iranians,the many concepts that the new religion introduced, and the new words thatwere used to express them, then the number of foreign words does not appearto be excessive. As for the question of meter, this composition – despite themistaken claims of certain European scholars – was not written in the syllabicmeter but was modeled directly after the meter of the ShAhnAme and, as in allPersian works of this type, the preferred form was that of mathnawC {rhymedcouplets}. The verse is very defective, because the Turkish of that time couldnot, of course, suddenly accord with the “arEQ metrical system, which was aliento its structure. This is one of the main reasons why some people considered itto have been written in the syllabic meter. With regard to subject matter,ideas, and metaphors, one encounters the influence, at the same time, of both{Turkish} popular literature and Chinese literature. But in the meter, especially,the strong influence of Persian literature is immediately apparent. Indeed, thisinfluence was so strong that within a short time it eventually was able to driveout all others.Like all Muslim works, the Kutadgu Bilig begins with a prose preface thatincludes the taRmCd {al-Ramdu li-”llAh, praise be to God} and taTliya {TallA “llAhu‘alayhi wa sallam, God bless him (the Prophet) and grant him salvation}. In theprologue to this work, the author Yesuf Khatt lajib finds the human aptitudesto consist of “justice, ability, comprehension, and contentment.”28 He then ani-mates each one in the form of a person and presents lengthy debates amongthem. With regard to its subject, this book is a variation on the Persians’ siyAsatnAme{advice for rulers} genre. One of these four aptitudes, Ögdülmish son of Qut{rather, he is the son of Ay-towdi who represents “Fortune” (= Qut)}, describesto the ruler, one by one, all the officials and classes who constituted Turkishsociety in Kashghar at that time and explains the qualifications they should haveand how the ruler should treat them. The book is full of such questions as “How"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE BEFORE AlMAD YASAWh11should one be a tapucu, i.e. a civil servant?” “How should one be a subaZı ormilitary commander?” “How should one treat the people?” “What should onedo for farmers, merchants, doctors, and sorcerers?” “How should one behavetoward women?” “What qualities should be sought in a good wife?” “Howshould the dynasty show respect to the mission of the Prophet?” There is also akaside in praise of Bughra Khan, following the example of Persian mathnawCwriters. Nevertheless, as regards the subject of the work – i.e. portraying thevarious human aptitudes through personification – as well as the simplicity andspecificity of its figures of speech and metaphors, nothing like it can be found inPersian literature. For these aspects, Chinese influence on the one hand andvestiges of {Turkish} popular literature on the other are much more significant.Even the ode in praise of Bughra Khan is closer to the products of early {Turkish}popular literature than to Persian examples.29This work, which was written in Kashghar in 462/1069 –70, should by nomeans be considered an isolated literary product. Indeed, there are references inthe preface that clearly reveal this point. If one considers that the Turks alreadyhad {various} scripts before Islam and that they had books composed in thesescripts, then it becomes immediately obvious that Muslim works would bewritten in Kashghar, which was an old center of Turkish civilization, soon afterthat city accepted Islam, and that one would not have to wait centuries beforethis occurred. When the Turks adopted Islam, they were not a barbarian peoplewho were strangers to writing, books, and education.30 Thus, we can assert thatby the fifth/eleventh century at least, Turko-Islamic works had begun to bewritten in Turkistan and that they were subject to Perso-Islamic influence. IfIranian influence had made an impact so quickly and vigorously in an easternregion like Kashghar, which was a center of the old Uighur civilization and hadbeen under continuous and strong Chinese influence, then naturally this influencemust have been felt on a much wider scale in regions further to the west andcloser to the cities of Khurasan. But unfortunately, ruinous invasions, wars, anda thousand other things over the centuries have destroyed the products of thoseearly periods and virtually nothing remains in our possession. Let me state clearlyhere, however, that such Turkish works that imitated Persian forms and werewritten under the influence of Persian literature in Muslim centers were notwidespread among the masses. They were only circulated among the learnedwho received a Muslim education in the madrasas {these colleges of Islamic lawbegan to spread in the fifth/eleventh century}.F Popular literatureWe know that the Turks possessed a rich popular literature in the fourth/tenthand fifth/eleventh centuries, and we also have some valuable examples of it.These works allow us to explain how, and with what kinds of compositions, theTurks were able to express their literary impulse in the time before ArmadYasawc. While the Kutadgu Bilig and similar works were read and studied by men"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE12educated in the madrasas of the cities of Turkistan, which had become strongcenters of Islam, the needs of the popular masses were met, as they had been forcenturies, by the simple products of the popular poets.31 Because popular literature,for various reasons, underwent hardly any perceptable change over the centuries,it preserved its basic pre-Islamic features into the Islamic period.Some of the surviving works from that period can be regarded as codes ofethics of a didactic nature. The evil of stinginess and envy, the obligation to gaina reputation for generosity among one’s people, the qualities of the hero, thegreatness of God, and the need to respect and obey one’s parents and elders areamong the items dealt with in these pieces in a simple and straightforwardmanner. The most valuable of these works, however, are the lamentations-elegies {s. sagu-mersiye}. These elegies were sung during mourning ceremonies orin general assemblies – regarded in pre-Islamic times as only a religious practicebut afterwards as more of an aesthetic one – to the accompaniment of the kopuzand were usually rather long. They describe the merits of the deceased, thevarious stages of his combats, how he attacked the enemy, where the battlesoccurred, and how grieved all the people were – indeed, all of nature was –because the hero died. The metaphors are simple and primitive but sincere andcolorful. Sometimes summer and winter are personified and, as in the KutadguBilig, engage in a debate. We find in them a rapturous feeling, not only towardnature but toward all manifestations of life. Saying that when summer comes thesnows will melt, the nightingales will sing, and happy couples will make love, thereciter of the elegy dwells on the joy of life. When he sees a beautiful slave girl,he likens her face to the moon and her neck to the juniper tree. Like all lovers,he speaks of the beauty of his beloved, her cruelty, and her bewitching eyesand he weeps profusely. The beauty of the countryside and the plains, the frostynights, the wild steppes, the misty hills, the ducks, geese, and small water fowlare all described in these elegies with a lively affection.32These elegies are expressed in quatrains, each verse having seven or eightsyllables. Sometimes the verses of the first quatrain all rhyme {aaaa}, sometimesall but the third rhyme {aaba}. As for the following quatrains, the first threeverses rhyme while the fourth returns to the rhyme of the initial quatrain {ccca,ddda, etc.}, thus forming a larger unit, whose rationale I explained above (sectionA {i.e. that this type of poetry was written to be sung and the fourth versemaintained the rhyme, like the refrain of a folk song}). The other poems, of adidactic nature, are occasionally in the form of quatrains with five, six, or sevensyllables per verse, but more often consist of couplets of 10, 12, 14, or 15syllables per verse {Köprülü is mistaken here. This should be 11 or 12}.Aside from poems, there existed among the people legends or sagas, such asthe Oghuz menkabesi {Legend of the Oghuz},33 that had survived from very earlytimes. Although they belonged fundamentally to the pre-Islamic period, a numberof these legends acquired an Islamic form and circulated in that fashion thanksto the efforts of the dervish poets who made religious propaganda in theIslamic period."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE BEFORE AlMAD YASAWh13This, then, was the level of literary development of the Turkish people whenArmad Yasawc appeared on the scene in the fifth/eleventh and sixth/twelfthcenturies.NOTES1 For detailed information with full documentation on the music, literature, and literarylife of the Turks before Islam, see the first part of my article “Türk edebiyatı tarihinemedhal” {only the first part of this study ever appeared, as “Türk edebiyatının menze’i,”MTM, 2 (1331/1915), 5 –78, reprinted in his Edebiyat araZtırmaları, pp. 49 –130}.

Carra de Vaux,however, while discussing the nefc poets of Iran, explains at great length that most ofthem were not pantheistic and that there is absolutely no connection between the{concept of } fanA” {annihilation, passing away from self and its replacement by apure consciousness of God} in nefism and nirvana in India (Gazali, p. 287) {see EIr,s.v. “Baqa’ wa Fana’” (G. Böwering)}.There are also those, like Blochet, who claim that Christianity had no influencewhatsoever on Islam, and those who think that the principles of nefism were whollyderived from the Koran and LadCth {Prophetic tradition}. Thus we can see how farwe are from solving this problem. Huart, unable to give a definite answer based onhistorical documents, makes very vague and general assertions, such as “The nefcmovement represents the victory of the Arian spirit over the Semitic mentality.”This is utter nonsense. The views of Dozy, A. I. Silvestre de Sacy, E. Trumpp, andF. A. D. Tholuck {Sufismus (Berlin, 1821)} on this subject cannot even be consideredas significant as those given above because they belong to earlier periods of Orientalism.There is certainly a great need in the scholarly world for a general history of nefismthat would show the influence of various sources on the different nefcs in their properproportions. Unfortunately it appears to be difficult to meet this need. {Since Köprülüwrote, an enormous amount of scholarly work has been done on nefism; see, e.g., EI2,s.v. “Tatawwuf ” (L. Massignon [ B. Radtke et al.] ).}10 The first biographies of nefcs were written in Arabic. In his introduction to {R.

Furthermore, al-Sulamc adaptedhis work from that of his master Abe Bakr Murammad b. ‘Abd Allah {al-Bajalc}al-Razc {known as Ibn Shadhan, d. 376/986}, { Jamc,} NafaRAt {al-uns}, {ed.

Ibn al-Athcr writesthat his vizier ‘Amcd al-Mulk {al-Kundurc} even had permission from him to curseboth the Rafiqcs and Ash‘arcs in the mosques of Khurasan and that Toghrıl Beg wasvery fanatical against the Shafi‘cs (al-KAmil, vol. 10, p. 11). Alp Arslan {the nephew ofToghrıl Beg} ordered Abe Sa‘cd Murammad b. Manter Sharaf al-Mulk al-Khwarazmcto repair the türbe and mosque of Abe lancfa in Baghdad and establish a lanafcmadrasa {Islamic law school} there ({Nivam al-Mulk,} SiyAsatnAme, ed. and Frenchtrans.

In Nivam al-Mulk’s SiyAsatnAme, thereis important information showing how severely Alp Arslan acted against the Shafi‘csand especially the Rafiqcs (see Chapters 21 and 42). Dozy also recognized that theTurks were ardent Sunncs (Essai, Turkish trans., vol. 2, p. 495). Indeed, we find this{attitude} among the Turks in Baghdad even before the Seljuks. The Turks didnot refrain from using any means to defend Sunnism against the Buwaihids whosupported Shc‘ism in Baghdad ({Zaydan,} Medeniyyet-i islâmiyye, vol. 4, p. 263). Theother Turkish states in Turkistan also always defended lanafcsm (Barthold, Turkestan).18 See the mystical views of the Turkish nefcs in { Jamc’s} NafaRAt and {nafc’s} RashaRAt.Very significant in this regard is the danger that Farcd al-Dcn ‘Auuar incurred inSamarqand around the end of the sixth/twelfth or beginning of the seventh/thir-teenth century. In his MaVhar al-“ajA”ib he had been very excessive in his praise of theTwelve ImAms {supreme leaders of Twelver Shc‘ism}, especially ‘Alc, and had demon-strated his belief in the expected mahdC {an eschatological figure similar to a messiah}.Consequently, one of the great jurists of Samarqand accused him of being a Rafiqc{heretic} and issued a fatwA {legal opinion} that his book should be burned and thathe should be executed. Farcd al-Dcn was able to save himself from this accusation onlywith difficulty (introduction to his Tadhkirat al-awliyA”, p. ). {It is now recognized thatMaVhar al-“ajA”ib was not among ‘Auuar’s authentic works.

Bab, 2). Iran edebiyatı {notfurther identified}, pp. 131ff.30 Both Byzantine and Chinese sources state that the Turks had their own writing beforeIslam and wrote books with it. According to Chinese historians, the Uighur Turks hadquite a brilliant and extensive literature in the fifth century ce {They do not fullyemerge in history until the eighth century; see Peter Golden, An Introduction to theHistory of the Turkic Peoples (Wiesbaden, 1992), p. 157.} Not only did they have proseand poetic works, but there were also chroniclers at the courts of their khAns {rulers}.Indeed, by this means all events were recorded from the earliest periods of the Uighursuntil almost the time of Chingiz Khan {d. 1227}. While mentioning that he cameacross a great many public libraries in the country of the Uighurs, the tenth-centuryce Chinese traveler Wang Yen-te does not state that this was anything remarkable. Infact, despite all the invasions that have befallen Turkistan, translations of a greatmany stories and religious works have survived from those early periods, and theOrhan Inscriptions, which the old Göktürks had written, also bear witness to the earlycivilization of the Turks. Because the Turks who went to the ‘Abbasid court in Baghdadwere mostly desert people who lived a primitive life, they did not occupy themselveswith learning and education. Thus, the Arab historians believed that the Turks weregenerally unfamiliar with learning and art. Ibn al-Athcr, for example, is surprised tofind that Qutalmısh, the founder of the Seljuk dynasty of Anatolia, was interested inastronomy even though he was a Turk ({Zaydan,} Medeniyyet-i islâmiyye, trans. vol. 4,p. 294). [In his article, “Türk onomastique’i hakkında,” Tarih Dergisi, 1 (1950), 227–30, Köprülü shows that the proper pronunciation of this name was Qutalmısh ratherthan the other forms {Qutulmush} in which it had previously been read.] The fact is,there were Turks who had preserved their early civilization at that time and lived acivilized life, and who had not left their country to enter the courts of the caliphs. Theerrors of the Arab historians are most obvious in this respect.31 While the Persian poets of the Turkish rulers who were under Iranian influence,such as those at the court of Marmed of Ghazna {d. 421/1030}, tried to developIslamic Persian literature and raise it to a high level, the army, which was composedmostly of Turks, satisfied its {literary} taste with popular folk songs {s. türkü} and epics{s. dastAn}. The same situation pertained in other Turkish armies. Gardczc {fl. mid-fifth/eleventh century} reports that during a battle between Marmed of Ghaznaand the Qarakhanids, Marmed’s troops began to sing Turkish songs when they sawthe Turkmen (Barthold, Turkestan, {English trans., p. 273, “Marmed’s soldiers ‘sang aTurkish song to a Khotanese melody’; on hearing the sounds the Turks threw them-selves in terror into the river, where part were drowned”}).32 For these works, see Marmed al-Kashgharc’s DCwAn lughAt al-turk {(Istanbul, 1333 –5/1915 –17), English trans. Robert Dankoff and James Kelly as Compendium of the TurkicDialects (Cambridge, MA, 1982–5)} written in 1077 {he began it in 464/1072 andcompleted it in 469/1077}.33 The Oghuz menkabesi, which had long been well known among the Turks, survives intwo main written versions. One is a piece written in the Uighur alphabet far fromIslamic influence. It reveals the earlier form of this legend (Radloff, ed. Das Kudatku-Bilik, vol. 1, pp. x–xiii). The Islamic form is first mentioned by Rashcd al-Dcn {d. 718/1318}, the vizier of Ghazan Khan, in his JAmi“ al-tawArCkh, and from there was trans-mitted to other works. If we take into consideration the similarity between the Uighurtext and the version recorded by Rashcd al-Dcn and the fact that Rashcd al-Dcn hadrecourse to early Turkish sources while composing his work, we can conclude that thisand similar legends have been recorded and written down from a very early period."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE18Indeed, before the appearance of the Ottomans, Abe Bakr ‘Abd Allah al-Dawadarc,an official of the Egyptian {Mamlek} ruler Murammad Qalawen {678 – 89/1279 –80}, says in his Durar al-tCjAn that there were two ancient sacred books, the Ulu Han AtaBitigji of the Qipchaqs and Mongols and the OghuznAme of the other Turks. He statesthat he saw a copy of the OghuznAme that had first been translated from Turkish intoPersian and then later, in 211/826 –7, was translated into Arabic by Jibra’cl b.Bakhtcshe‘, the chief physician of Haren al-Rashcd. It had come from the treasury ofAbe Muslim al-Khurasanc. According to the information provided by this author, thework contained such things as the legends of “Ulug Karadax,” “Altun-Han,” “Ulu AyAtajı,” “Ulu Ay Anajı,” “Türkler yemini,” “Chojuk,” and “Arslan.” It seems clear thatKitab-ı Dede Korkut {Book of Dede Korkut} was a later extract from this OghuznAme,and that the Islamic version found in the work of Rashcd al-Dcn and the Oghuzmenkabesi surviving in an Uighur text derived from the same source. Hence it is clearthat the OghuznAme is not, as some believe, a history, but a collection of legends. TheJAm-i jam AyCn, which was said by its author {Beyâtî Shaikh Mahmûd} to have beencompiled from the OghuznAme, is confirmation of this. In fact, already a century ago, J.Klaproth mentioned the striking unity in the Chinese and Persian accounts of theTurks as evidence for the existence of early Uighur chronicles recording all suchlegends and traditions.

Over thecenturies, as they pass from generation to generation, these legends grow largerand larger until it is difficult to distinguish the true character of the originalpersonality. In the Orient in particular, the nefcs had such a powerful influenceon the popular imagination that with each passing century new legends werefabricated about them while each day more was forgotten about their truehistorical characters. Because the early Oriental historians were not able, for themost part, to distinguish history from legend, they simply transferred to theirbooks verbatim the fanciful accounts that had been created in the popular imagina-tion. Therefore, although my ultimate goal is to try to establish the historicalcharacter of Khwaja Armad Yasawc, I will first describe the legendary personalitythat tradition has handed down to us. Being a creation of the social consciousness,this personality, even if it does not correspond to the historical personality, hasgreat social value and is worthy of study.A His childhoodIn the city of Sairam in Turkistan {Sairam is just east of Shymkent in modernKazakhstan}, there was a shaikh named Shaikh Ibrahcm, a descendant of ‘Alc.When he died, he left a grown daughter named Gawhar Shahnaz and a seven-year-old boy named Armad.1 From the time he was very young, Armad receivedvarious manifestations {of God’s grace} and displayed extraordinary qualitiesthat belied his age. In his work entitled DCwAn-i Likmat, he recounts successively,in a language appropriate to the nefcs, the spiritual powers that he had received.2At age seven, when he was orphaned by the loss of his father, Armad, who sincechildhood had received the guidance of Khaqir {a popular figure in Muslimlegend, often identified with Elijah, see EI2, s.v. “al-Khaqir” (A. J. Wensinck);Ahmet Yazar Ocak, Yslâm-Türk inançlarında Hızır yahut Hızır-Ylyâs kültü (Ankara,1985); and Patrick Franke, Begegnungen mit Khidr (Beirut, 2000)}, was raised byanother, spiritual father.

Guided"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"THE LEGENDARY LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh21by spiritual direction {mânevî iZâretiyle} from the Prophet, he went to Sairam tobecome Armad’s teacher.3According to legend, Arslan Baba was one of the foremost Companions {ofthe Prophet}. One well known report states that he lived to age 400, and anotherto age 700. His traveling to Turkistan and being charged to teach ArmadYasawc were based on spiritual direction. It seems that during one of the Prophet’smilitary expeditions, his noble Companions came to him hungry and pleaded forsomething to eat. The Prophet uttered a prayer and {the angel} Gabriel broughta dish of dates from paradise. One of the dates fell on the ground, whereuponGabriel said, “This date is the portion of a member of your religious communitynamed Armad Yasawc.” Because anything held in trust was naturally to be givento its owner {cf. Koran IV:58}, the Prophet proposed to his Companions thatone of them undertake this duty. But none of them responded except for ArslanBaba, who said that by apostolic favor he would be able to undertake this task.The Prophet then put the fallen date into Arslan Baba’s mouth with his ownhand and added a bit of his own blessed saliva. A covering immediately formedover the date and the Prophet instructed Arslan Baba how he would find ArmadYasawc and commanded him to devote himself to his education.4 Arslan Babathen went to Sairam (or Yasc) and, after completing there the task that he hadtaken upon himself, died the following year. It is recorded in the DCwAn-i Likmatthat “the Angel of Death took his soul, the RErCs {female denizens of paradise}cut out a shroud from silk garments, and 70,000 weeping angels appeared andtransported him to paradise.”5By age seven, Armad Yasawc had already advanced through a series of highspiritual stages and then, under the direction of Arslan Baba, the young Armadreached a high level of maturity and slowly began to win fame from everyquarter. His father Shaikh Ibrahcm had already been renowned in that regionfor performing countless miracles {s. karAma} and many legends were told ofhim.6 Consequently, it was recognized that, with respect to his lineage as well,this quiet and unassuming young boy, who always did his sister’s bidding, held aspiritually important position. Around that time an extraordinary event occurredthat spread Armad’s fame throughout Turkistan. A ruler named Yasawc wasruling as sultan in Transoxiana and Turkistan. He spent the winters in Samarqandand the summers in the mountains of Turkistan. Like all Turkish rulers, he wasfond of hunting and used to pass the time in this pursuit in the mountains ofTurkistan. One summer he wanted to go hunting on Qarachuq Mountain, butbecause it was so rugged, he gave up hope of doing so. He was never able tohunt on Qarachuq.7 Consequently, he wanted to get rid of the mountain. Hegathered together all the friends of God {i.e. the saints} in the lands that heruled and requested them to remove this mountain by the blessing of theirprayers. The saints of Turkistan agreed to the ruler’s request. They wrappedthemselves in iRrAms {the garb of pilgrims going to Mecca} and for three daysprayed and pleaded for this mountain to disappear. Contrary to expectation,however, all their prayers were in vain. Searching for the reason, they asked,"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE22“Was there anyone among the “Arifs {those who have knowledge of God} andsaints of the country who did not come?” It turned out that Shaikh Ibrahcm’sson Armad Yasawc had not been summoned because he was still very young.They immediately sent men to Sairam to summon him. The boy consulted withhis older sister and she said to him, “Our father had some testamentary advice{for you}. The thing that will show whether or not your time to appear hascome is a table cloth that is tied {in a knot} in our father’s place of worship. Ifyou can untie it, then go ahead {in response to the ruler’s summons}, for thatmeans the time of your appearance has come.” The boy then went to the placeof worship and untied the table cloth. This meant that his time to appear hadcome. He immediately took the table cloth and went to the city of Yasc.8 All thesaints were present there. He indicated {they should} pray over a piece of breadthat was on the cloth. They agreed and recited the FAtiRa {opening sEra of theKoran}. He divided the bread among those who were assembled and there wasenough for everyone. There were 99,000 people present composed of the saints,the ruler’s officers {umarA”}, and troops. When they saw this miracle, they had abetter understanding of the greatness of Armad Yasawc. {Meanwhile} ArmadYasawc expected that the answer to his prayer was inside his father’s dervishcloak. Suddenly, torrents of rain burst from the sky and all the land was flooded.When the prayer rugs of the shaikhs began to float on the waves, they pleadedand cried out. Armad Yasawc stuck his head from the cloak. The storm immedi-ately subsided and the sun appeared. And what should they see! QarachuqMountain had disappeared. Where the mountain once stood there is now a towncalled Qarachuq, where most of Armad’s descendants reside. The ruler Yasawc,who had witnessed this miracle, entreated Armad to ensure that his name wouldremain on earth until the Day of Judgment. Armad accepted his wish and said,“Whoever in the world loves me, may he recall me together with your name.”Thus, from that day forward, he has been called “Khwaja Armad Yasawc.”9B His fameThe books of legends {manAqib} agree {Köprülü assumes this} in stating thatArmad Yasawc went to Bukhara for a while on the advice of Arslan Baba andattached himself to Shaikh Yesuf Hamadanc, that city’s most renowned spiritualguide, and that after his death he spent some time in Bukhara carrying outreligious propaganda {halkı dâvete meZgûl} and then, commending all of his com-panions to Khwaja ‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc, went to Yasc on the spiritualdirection of the Prophet.10 While recounting successively, in a nefc manner, thekinds of spiritual manifestations that he exhibited between ages seven and fifty,Armad Yasawc says in the DCwAn-i Likmat “that he fell in love {spiritually, i.e.with God} at age twenty-six, that he fought on behalf of the divine countenance{dCdAr} like Manter {al-lallaj}, that he suffered various torments because hewas not able to find a pCr, and that he finally found a pCr at age twenty-seven andthen he escaped from his torments, and that it was then that he could be worthy"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE LEGENDARY LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh23of that dervish convent.” Indeed, one of the Rikmats {religious poems} has thefollowing refrain: “My great teacher, I came to take refuge with you” {Zâtı uluhoca”m, sana sıXnıp geldim}. One could guess that this refers to Yesuf Hamadancand that Armad attached himself to him at age twenty-seven.11Armad Yasawc was occupied continuously with teaching and providing guid-ance in the town of Yasc. The number of disciples who gathered around himincreased daily and his fame gradually spread throughout Turkistan, Transoxiana,Khurasan, and Khwarazm. He was superior to all the saints of his time in bothexoteric and esoteric knowledge. He lectured to his disciples on both types ofknowledge. He spent {virtually} all his time worshipping God and doing piousacts. In his free time, he carved spoons and ladles and sold them to earn a living{Köprülü takes this from Bektashc lore without citation}. He always kept com-pany with Khaqir, who had been his father’s old companion. Indeed, one day,Khaqir said to Armad, “I travel the seven climes seven times a day searching fora companion and there is no companion more capable and finer than you.”12Armad would not accept a single morsel from the endless gifts and votive offeringsthat were donated to his tekke {this term was not used in Central Asia}. Everyday {word of } his saintly powers spread a little further among the people. “It isreported that the celebrated khwAja {master} had an ox. It would go about thecity market with a saddle bag {on its back} in which spoons, ladles, and beggingbowls were visible. Those who wanted to purchase them would take a certainamount {of these goods} and leave what they cost in the saddle bag. The oxwould wander about every day until nightfall. Then it would go to the khwAja.He would take the contents {of the bag} in his blessed hand. If someone were totake something from the saddle bag without paying for it, the ox would followhim and would not go to another quarter {of the city} until he had returned themerchandise or paid for it.”13According to tradition, the erens {saints} of Khurasan held Armad Yasawc inhigh esteem, but they didn’t realize the true magnitude of his greatness. One daythey decided to hold a large assembly and invite the khwAja to it. One of themtook the form of a crane and set out to inform the khwAja. Learning of this matterthrough his inner power, the khwAja told his disciples that seven saints were comingand took some of his dervishes with him {to meet them}. He also took the formof a crane and came out to greet the saints. At a large river on the border ofSamarqand, the two groups met. The erens of Khurasan were amazed andhumbled by the khwAja’s power. While they were all together, the khwAja looked atthe river. A merchant was crossing it with all of his goods and animals. Suddenly,the water swept them all away. The merchant vowed that if he were rescuedhe would donate half of his goods {to his rescuer}. Hearing this, the khwAjaimmediately stretched out his hand and saved the merchant. He then immediatelychanged form and assumed the attire of an ordinary man. The merchant imme-diately clasped the hand of his rescuer and gave him half of his goods. Armadtook this merchandise and wealth and went to Khurasan where he gave all of itaway to the erens. He thus became the object of boundless reverence.14"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE24As the fame of Armad Yasawc spread and the number of his disciples grewinto the thousands, the number of his opponents and rivals, of course, alsoincreased. These hypocrites finally ventured a grave slander. Supposedly, womenwho did not cover themselves were attending the khwAja’s majlis {religious assembly,course of instruction} and mingled with men in the dhikr {nefc séance}. Thereligious scholars of Khurasan and Transoxiana, who strictly abided by thestipulations of Islamic law {SharC“a}, sent an investigator to determine if therewas any truth to this rumor. The information that he collected made it clear thatthis was simply a case of slander. Still, Armad Yasawc wanted to teach them alesson. One day, while sitting in a majlis with his disciples, he brought out aninkstand closed with a seal. Addressing the whole congregation he said, “Whoamong the saints has never, since reaching the age of discretion, touched awoman with his right hand?” No one was able to answer. While the shaikh wassaying this, one of his disciples, Jalal Ata, stepped forward. Armad Yasawc putthe inkstand in his hand and sent him in care of it with the investigators to thecountries of Transoxiana and Khurasan. All the religious scholars and upholdersof Islamic law in those countries got together and opened the inkstand. Insidewere a fire and some cotton, neither of which had any effect on the other. Thefire did not burn the cotton nor did the cotton extinguish the fire. At thatmoment, the religious scholars, who had sent out the investigators when thekhwAja was under suspicion, understood the lesson that he wanted to give themin all its clarity. Even if men and women gather in a meeting of the people ofGod and attend the dhikr and worship together, God Almighty is able to cleansetheir hearts of all spite and enmity. All the scholars were exceedingly ashamedand fearful and they tried to get their offense forgiven by sending gifts and votiveofferings.15C His khal≠fasArmad Yasawc had 99,000 disciples who came from the four corners of theworld.16 According to another tradition, he had 12,000 “dervish disciples whowere initiates of his sainthood, had the power to perform miracles, and who wereperfect and excellent {in all respects}” {velâyet-meâb, kerâmât-iktisâb, kâmil, mükemmelashâb-ı suffası vardı ki}, and who never left his presence. Not included amongthem were the khalCfas and shaikhs who were sent in all directions under hisguidance and by his permission. The following were his leading khalCfas: nefcMurammad Danishmend Zarneqc, Sulaiman lakcm Ata, Baba Machcn, Amcr‘Alc lakcm, lasan Bulghanc, Imam Marghuqc, and Shaikh ‘Uthman Maghribc.17The attachment of some of them to Armad Yasawc came about in a veryunusual manner. For example, before Baba Machcn joined Armad Yasawc, hewas, at age 400, a famous saint from among the nefc leaders of Khurasan. Everyday, in plain view, he would fly a distance of 24 parasangs {this is from theDCwAn-i Likmat}. Deluded by the spiritual level that he had attained, he was aboutto reprove Armad Yasawc for having men and women together in his majlis. On"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"THE LEGENDARY LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh25Armad Yasawc’s order, however, lakcm Ata and nefc Murammad Danishmendseized him and, tying him tightly to a column of the tekke, gave him 500 blows.But they had no effect, so they beat him again. A mark became visible on hisback and he began to weep. They then untied him from the column and he paidallegiance to his excellency the pCr and repented. “A powerful jinn {invisiblebeings, harmful or helpful, that interfere in the lives of mortals},” they said, “hadsettled on Baba Machcn’s back. Every day, he {the jinn} used to fly a distance ofsome parasangs {carrying Baba Machcn}. Hurt by the 500 blows, he finally leftBaba Machcn’s back and fled. The last blow therefore struck Baba Machcn andthus he was saved.” Afterwards, Baba Machcn underwent 40 days of penitence{arba“Cn} and solitary religious devotions {khalwa}. In fact, he retired privatelywith Armad Yasawc three times. Eventually, he became one of the most {spiritu-ally} advanced of the shaikh’s famous khalCfas.18Another important khalCfa was Imam Marghuqc (or Marghaqc, Marwazc, i.e.from Marw {rather, Marghuzc, as in other works by lazcnc, which may referto Marghah near Marw}). At first, he did not want to admit to the greatness ofthe khwAja, but later he could not escape his magnetism. At the time when thekhwAja’s fame was spreading in all directions, four students from Yasc settled inthe city of Urgench in the land of Khwarazm to study. Imam Marghuqc was themost renowned and learned professor {mudarris} in Urgench. These studentsnaturally went to his lectures. When the Imam learned where the students werefrom, he said to them, “We have heard that in Yasc Khwaja Armad Yasawc isbehaving contrary to the SharC“a. I wonder if there is any truth to this rumor.” Inresponse to this grave question, the young students said that they knew nothingabout the matter, only that the khwAja was a pious man and an upholder of theSharC“a and that he had 12,000 dervish disciples. The Imam could not allay hisdoubts and decided to go there himself and try to learn {the truth of } thismatter. Saying, “Up to now, I have memorized 12,000 mas”alas {points of law}.Surely I can go and ascertain {the truth of } this matter,” he set out on the roadtaking with him 400 eminent legal scholars {s. dAnishmand} and 40 muftCs {thosewho give formal legal opinions}. While this caravan was en route, Armad Yasawc,with the help of God, learned what was happening and said to his first khalCfanefc Murammad Danishmend, “Go see what is coming to us over the horizon!”nefc Murammad informed him that Imam Marghuqc was coming with 3000mas”alas in his memory. On the order of the shaikh, nefc Murammad thenerased 1000 of those mas”alas from the memory of the Imam. Later, he alsoasked Sulaiman lakcm Ata the same question. He said that Imam Marghuqc ofKhwarazm had set out with 3000 mas”alas, but 1000 had been removed, so nowhe was coming with the remaining 2000 mas”alas. Armad Yasawc ordered him toerase 1000 more and he did so. Thus when the Imam arrived in Yasc only 1000mas”alas remained in his memory. When Imam Marghuqc saw Armad Yasawc,the latter was wearing an old fur inside out on his back and a black conical hatmade of sheep skin on his head, and he asked him, “Are you the one who leadsGod’s slaves astray?” Unperturbed, Armad Yasawc replied that the Imam would"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE26first be his guest for three days and that afterwards they would be able to discussmatters. Three days later, they brought out a chair, which the Imam sat in. Theshaikh ordered lakcm Ata to erase his remaining 1000 mas”alas. Seated in theprofessorial chair, Imam Marghuqc could not remember a single mas”ala. Heleafed through his notebooks page by page, but every page was completelyblank. He then realized his own fault and got off the chair. He begged theshaikh’s forgiveness, and in the company of all his legal scholars and muftCs, wasinitiated into the order. After five years of retiring for solitary religious devotions,spending forty-day periods of penitence, and undergoing severe mortification ofthe flesh, he completed all stages {of spiritual development}. Finally, ArmadYasawc sent him and five of his other khalCfas to carry out religious propagandaamong, and instruct, the people of Khurasan. These five were Shaikh MurammadBaghdadc, Saif al-Dcn Bakharzc, Shaikh Kamal Shaibanc, Shaikh Sa‘d al-Dcn,and Shaikh Baha’ al-Dcn.19DChilla-kh–neSince childhood, Armad Yasawc had never fallen short in his attachment to anysunna {a saying or action} of the Prophet. Consequently, because the Prophetmigrated from this transitory world at the age of 63, Armad Yasawc wished to beburied as soon as he reached that age because he was attached to this sunna. Atone side of the tekke, they dug a pit into which one could descend by a ladder.They cleared a path and built a cell from crude sun-dried bricks. Thanks to thespiritual succor of {the prophets} Ilyas {Elias} and Khaqir, nothing has dis-turbed that structure for hundreds of years. Armad Yasawc dug out a place therein the shape of a sarcophagus and made it his abode. The more he chantedreligious formulas or prayers in that tight place, which resembled a sarcophagus,the more his knees rubbed against his breasts until both were worn through.For this reason, they called them {Chief of the Heart-Wounded}.20 According to one report, Armad Yasawc remained in that placeuntil age 120, according to another until age 133,21 and according to another, incirculation today in Yasc, until age 125; {in any case} he spent the rest of his lifein that tight narrow chilla-khAne {place where religious devotees shut themselvesup, lit. place of 40 (days)} exactly like the aTRAb-i qubEr {people of the tombs, i.e.the dead} engaged in mortification of the flesh and worshipping God.22Even while he was living in this chilla-khAne, there was no end to the miraclesthat Armad Yasawc performed. One day “that place of worship, which was likea sarcophagus, left a kind of fire and thirst in the bellies of the dervishes andmystics, and this made those in the majlis anxious. lakcm Ata was enjoined toprovide them with water. As he rose to get the water, the sound of streamingwater reached his ears. Amazed, he turned around and looked. The center of themajlis was like an oven or the stokehold of a bath. Flames were everywhereand the mystics and dervishes were roasting in that fire. lakcm Ata stood thereoverwhelmed and delirious {at the sight}. At that moment Armad Yasawc"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE LEGENDARY LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh27suddenly appeared with a drinking glass in his hand. He plunged the drinkingglass into the fire and gave everyone there a drink. lakcm Ata, who drank waterfrom that glass, reported ‘It was sweet as honey and cold as snow.’ In thismanner, the thirst of those in the majlis abated and then the shaikh of shaikhslowered the palm of his hand over the fire and it immediately disappeared. Bythe wisdom of God, however, an earthen jar appeared. The Yasawcs call it‘khum-i “ishq’ {the jar of love} and use it to derive omens. If one’s wish is to begranted, the wisher’s hand, no matter how short his arm, reaches the bottomand grasps a stone, a piece of straw, or the like. On the other hand, if the wishis not to be granted, the hand of the seeker, no matter how long his arm, cannotreach the bottom.”23Another legend describes an incident between a ruler named Qazan Khanand Armad Yasawc. Qazan Khan noticed that Armad Yasawc did not come tothe mosque for Friday prayer and sent word to him about this via the shaikh’schief confidant nefc Murammad Danishmend Zarneqc. At that moment, the callwas being given from the minaret for the Friday prayer. Quickly and fearfully,nefc Murammad entered the shaikh’s presence and was told, “Oh, nefcMurammad, come! Stick with me! Let us go together to the Friday prayer.” nefcMurammad obeyed the khwAja’s command. Instantly, he found himself sittingin a row inside a mosque. As soon as the Friday prayer was finished, nefcMurammad, bewildered by this extraordinary event, looked for the shaikh butcould not find him. He went in and out of the mosque door seven times withoutsuccess. The caretaker of the mosque was cognizant of this mystery, however,and said to nefc Murammad, “Hey there, dervish! This place is Cairo andthis mosque is the Mosque of al-Azhar. The friend for whom you search hasperformed the Friday prayer for a long time now.” After spending a week there,nefc Murammad found his shaikh and immediately was returned to his cell. ThekhwAja ordered him to go and relate what he had seen. nefc Murammad came{back to Qazan Khan} and recounted everything that had happened to him.The muezzins, however, had not yet finished making the call to prayer. QazanKhan and those in his retinue then properly understood the greatness ofthe khwAja.24The people of the town of nerc (Savran, Sabran {nerc and Savran/nabran aretwo different toponyms})25 in the environs of Yasc had concentrated their hatredof the people of Yasc especially on the person of Armad Yasawc. As the fame ofArmad Yasawc spread abroad, they became enraged. Finally, they hatched aplot by which they could accuse him of theft. They butchered a cow and secretlytook it to the tekke, where they left it. Because it was the summer season, thedisciples were spending time outside. Thus no one saw the butchered cow. Earlythe next morning, on the pretext of searching for their cow, the people ofnerc gathered in front of the tekke and told the shaikh that they wanted to lookinside. Addressing these hypocrites, Armad Yasawc said, “Enter, curs! Enter,dogs!” They went inside, but by the wisdom of God they were all immediatelytransformed into dogs and began to eat the cow, which they had butchered and"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE28placed inside the tekke. Their friends, who were observing all this from outside,became terribly frightened and immediately repented and begged the shaikh forforgiveness. The others were immediately returned to human form except fortheir tails, which remained in place as a memento of their evil deed and werepassed on to all of their descendants.26Despite all the spiritual blows that they suffered, the people of nerc simplycould not refrain from fighting against the khwAja. The khwAja had a son namedIbrahcm and also a beautiful horse. He said, “Whoever should bring word of thedeath of my son, I will give him this horse in thanks.”27 The people of nerclearned of this. One day, they found Shahzade Ibrahcm sleeping beneath a tree.They cut off his head, wrapped it in a towel, and laid it before the khwAja. ThekhwAja asked those who brought it, “What’s this?” They said it was a gift of freshmelon. Although the khwAja understood what was going on, he nevertheless gavethe murderer that horse and also his daughter so that no blood feud wouldremain between them nor would any hatred or blood money ensue. Accordingto the account of lazcnc, Shaikh {Farcd al-Dcn} ‘Auuar reported this anecdote inhis book ManUiq al-Uair. Now, every year blood is seen flowing from the placebelow the tree where Ibrahcm was murdered. The khwAja’s disciples and thosewho believe in him take that blood and, with God’s permission, use it to cure allsorts of illnesses.28 Among the Yasawc dervishes, there are many oral traditionslike this about the khwAja.E The miracles he performed after his deathKhwaja Armad Yasawc died after spending a long life in his chilla-khAne. Never-theless, he continued to perform miracles. Of these countless miracles, only a fewwere able to pass into the histories and books of legends. For example, accordingto one old legend, Tcmer’s {Tamerlane} building of a türbe and mosque over thekhwAja’s grave was the result of one of the khwAja’s miracles. The work entitledRisAla-i tawArCkh-i bulghAriyya records this legend in the following manner: “Finally,His Excellency Amcr Tcmer intended to go to Bukhara with Khaqir, peace beupon him. On the way, he stopped in Turkistan {i.e. Yasc}. Khwaja ArmadYasawc of Turkistan appeared in Amcr Tcmer’s dream and said, ‘Here there,brave young man! Go quickly to Bukhara! God willing, the death of the ruler{shAh} there is in your hands, and many things are bound to happen to you. Inany case, all the people of Bukhara are waiting for you.’ Amcr Tcmer awokefrom this dream and thanked God. The next day he summoned Neghaibaq{Noghay Beg} Khan, the ruler of Turkistan, and gave him a lot of money tobuild a shrine at the tomb of Armad Yasawc. As instructed, the ruler of Turkistanbuilt an ornate shrine that still stands in all its beauty.”29We know from other sources, in fact, that Tcmer believed very much inArmad Yasawc. Indeed, when he marched to Anatolia to wage war againstSultan Bayezid I {1402}, he took omens from the khwAja’s maqAmAt{“assemblies,”a literary genre}.30"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE LEGENDARY LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh29Naqshbandc tradition attributes the fact that the famous Sultan Abe Sa‘cdMcrza {r. 1451– 69}, of the Tcmerid dynasty, was honored by the favor ofKhwaja ‘Ubaid Allah {Arrar} to a miracle of Armad Yasawc. At a time whenSultan Abe Sa‘cd Mcrza had still no reputation or fame, Khwaja ‘Ubaid Allahwrote his name on a piece of paper and inserted it in his turban. His disciplesasked him who this Abe Sa‘cd Mcrza was. He answered, “The man who will bemy ruler, your ruler, and the ruler of Taskhkent, Samarqand, and Khurasan!”In fact, a very short time later, this came about as follows: around that time,Sultan Abe Sa‘cd Mcrza had a dream in which Khwaja ‘Ubaid Allah recited theFAtiRa to him as instructed by Armad Yasawc. Abe Sa‘cd Mcrza asked ArmadYasawc the name of the khwAja who was reciting the FAtiRa to him and learnedwho it was. When he awoke the next morning, he asked those in his retinue ifthey knew anyone named Khwaja ‘Ubaid Allah. He learned that there was ashaikh with that name in Tashkent and immediately set out for that city. Even-tually, he had an audience with the khwAja in Farkat and begged him for oneFAtiRa. The khwAja laughed and said, “The FAtiRa is one {Fâtiha bir olur}.”31In JawAhir al-abrAr, there is a description of one of the khwAja’s miracles con-cerning Humayen {the Mughal emperor, d. 1556}. Sayyid Manter Ata, theauthor’s shaikh and a khalCfa of the Yasawcs,32 once went to Turkistan, i.e. Yasc,and, visiting the khwAja’s türbe, spiritually had an audience with him. During theaudience, Armad Yasawc said, “The Chaghatay ruler – i.e. Humayen the son ofBabur – wants to capture Samarqand and take control of that country, but thegood spirits {saints?} are not pleased with this and want to direct him towardIndia. Remove an “alam {standard, badge} from my türbe and take it for hisvictories in that region.” Upon this order from the khwAja, Sayyid Manterremoved an “alam and went to Kabul, the center of Humayen’s government.Indeed, Humayen wanted to take Samarqand, the burial place of his grand-father Tcmer, and destroy the Chingizids. The ruler’s brother, Hindal Mcrzametwith Sayyid Manter for a rather long time in Kabul and, realizing his greatness,became a disciple. When Hindal Mcrza went back to Humayen, he related tohim what had happened to him. Humayen also had had a dream in whichhe saw a wonderful vision presaging this occurrence. They then summonedSayyid Manter. He came bringing the “alam that Armad Yasawc had given him.The ruler received him. Then a dhikr circle was organized and verses {s. manVEma}from the Rikmats of the pCrs of Turkistan were recited. Those who were listeningreached a state of ecstasy. Afterwards, he said to Humayen, “The saints ofTransoxiana bring you good news of the conquest of India. His excellencyArmad Yasawc sent this for victory. Please accept it.” Humayen was very pleasedwith this good news. He marched on India, invaded and captured it.33 In thismanner, Armad Yasawc performed another great miracle.In his JawAhir al-abrAr, lazcnc describes another miracle of Armad Yasawc thathe cites from his shaikh Sayyid Manter Ata {rather, Sayyid Manter}. WhenSayyid Manter first saw Armad Yasawc’s chilla-khAne, he was very astonishedhow he had endured living in this very depressing, small and narrow place for"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE30years. But suddenly, he looked around and noticed that one end of that chilla-khAne that he thought was very small was in the East and the other end was in theWest! He realized that what he had previously thought was mistaken and heonce again thoroughly understood that God never causes his beloved servants tosuffer from distress. He could make a small and narrow place that was a fewspans wide bigger than the whole world.34An American traveler named Schuyler, who stopped in Yasc while journeyingin Turkistan shortly after the Russian invasion, recorded another legend aboutArmad Yasawc that was in circulation among the people there. According to thislegend, Armad Yasawc, while still alive, went up the minaret of the mosque ofHazret {i.e. laqrat-i Turkistan}, took the white turban from his head, andshowed it to the people. The people interpreted this to mean that the city wouldsoon fall into the hands of the Russians and therefore they did not put up anyresistance to the Russian army.35 On the other hand, the same traveler writesthat because that mosque was considered to be the holiest mosque in CentralAsia, all the religious scholars and the populace gathered there before theRussian invasion and entreated God to drive away the enemy who was aboutto fall on them.36 Furthermore, there is a very famous Noghay legend that pre-sents Edigü, one of the ancient folk heroes of the Turks, as a descendant ofArmad Yasawc.37 And in the famous legend of Satuk Bughra Khan publishedby R. B. Shaw, there is mentioned a ritual that was held at the türbe of SuluanKhwaja Armad Yasawc.38There are many such legends concerning the miracles that Armad Yasawcperformed while he was alive and after his death. If we consider the profoundspiritual influence that he exerted, not just in Central Asia and among theNorthern Turks {this expression is no longer used} and the Qirghiz but in allthe Turkish countries, then we can better understand the origin and nature of thelegends concerning the many miracles that he performed even after his death.F His khal≠fas among the QipchaqsIt can easily be seen from the RisAla-i tawArCkh-i bulghAriyya,39 written by lusamal-Dcn b. Sharaf al-Dcn {Muslimc} in 992/1584, that Armad Yasawc enjoyedgreat fame among the Qipchaq Turks from a very early time and that theearliest shaikhs who appeared among them were directly or indirectly connectedwith him. In this work, which contains material of a legendary nature ratherthan of historical value, a number of the early shaikhs who were khalCfas ofArmad Yasawc are mentioned. One of them is Bayrash b. Ibrash nefc, an earlyshaikh of the Qazaqs. He was from the Jahriyya UarCqa and a student of ArmadYasawc. He was sent to the region of the Bulghars on the shaikh’s instructions.Ish-Murammad Teq-Murammad-oghlu from the avul {nomadic settlement} ofAday-Chermish on the banks of the Buri River was a disciple of Bayrash nefc.Bayrash nefc was a shaikh for 36 years and attracted many disciples. He wonfame under the byname Shaikh Baba. After this famous representative of the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE LEGENDARY LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh31Jahriyya UarCqa in the north died, that entire region was without a murshid for afull 20 years. There was no longer anyone who knew the rules of the nefc way.During this time, Shaikh Hidayat Allah, a disciple of Armad Yasawc, was inYarkand at the head of the Jahriyya UarCqa. One of his Bulghar followers was IdrcsDhe al-Murammad-oghlu from the avul of Terberdi Challı. He went to Yarkandand stayed with that shaikh for fifteen years. Twenty years after the death of nefcIsh-Murammad, Shaikh Hidayat Allah40 sent Idrcs Khalcfa to the region of theBulghars. Qasim Shaikh Ibrahcm-oghlu from Kazan was his khalCfa. In the avul ofBay Chura-Chermishi on the shore of the Aq-ydil {Volga} is the tomb of KhwajaAmcr Kalal another disciple of Armad Yasawc. This brief account clearly indi-cates the place of Armad Yasawc among the Northern Turks.41 In order toconvey the significance of Armad Yasawc among the Northern Turks, let meadd that there is an oral legend in that region that even attributes to him the firstuse of tea among the Turks.42The fact that we have so little information on the khalCfas of Armad Yasawcwho spread from the Qazaqs to the banks of the Volga results from the almostcomplete absence of documents that have survived from early times concerningthe history of that region. Otherwise, we might have had considerable informa-tion on the legends and miracles of Armad Yasawc’s disciples along the banksof the Volga. While simple and general works, like {the anonymous} SharA”iUal-CmAn, which are very widespread in that area, show that the khwAja is stillimportant for the {local} people, it is also clear from the famous Lakîm Ata kitâbıthat a number of legends about Yasawc dervishes have been current there for along time.43GKhal≠fas in the lands of the WesternTurks {R§m Diy™rı}According to tradition, the spiritual influence of Armad Yasawc continued for along time in all of the Balkans {Rumelia}, Asia Minor, Azerbaijan – in short,among the Western Turks generally – as a great many dervishes who claimedto be attached to him gradually began to enter those regions. In the variouscountries to which he traveled, Evliya Chelebi {d. c.1685} visited the türbes of anumber of saints who were considered to be connected with Armad Yasawc andhe lists them one by one:44 Avshar Baba, whose türbe in Niyaz-abad was a placeof pilgrimage;45 Pcr Dede, who was buried in, and had a tekke in, Merzifon;46Akyazılı, whose great tekke was in the Bat-ova plain on the Black Sea coast andwhose legends were famous;47 Kademli Baba Suluan, who was buried in Adatepeon the Filibe road;48 Geyikli Baba, who was buried in Bursa;49 Abdal Mesa;50and Horos Dede, who was buried in Unkapanı {in Istanbul}.51 All of them werekhalCfas of Armad Yasawc. In addition to the faqCrs of Armad Yasawc who arementioned by Evliya Chelebi, the historian ‘flc mentions someone named AmcrChcn Osman in a series of shaikhs from the reign of Sultan Orhan. AnotherkhalCfa of Armad Yasawc, he went to Rem after 600/1203 – 4 and built a famous"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE32tekke, called the Osman Baba Tekke, in the vicinity of the sancak {district} ofBozok.52 Evliya Chelebi, who says in various places in his book that he {himself }was a descendant of Armad Yasawc, also describes the tekkes and tombs of twoother Yasawc khalCfas who went to Rem. One was the tekke of Shaikh Nutrat. Itwas located on the plain of Zile, which was north of Arık-ova and just pastÇamlıbel. Shaikh Nutrat, who was from Khurasan, had once gone to this placein Rem on the order of his pCr {Armad Yasawc}. Evliya Chelebi says that hisextensive and flourishing tekke had about 70 faqCrs and all the people in the regionbelieved in the shaikh. Indeed, in front of the tekke stood an ancient mulberrytree that was used as a cure for fever (SeyARatnAme, Book 3, fo. 91a; {Evliyaexplains that they used a splinter from the bark of the rotted part of the trunk tomake a fumigatory}). The second tekke was that of Gajgaj {rather, Gıjgıj} Dedein Tokat, located on a small mountain that overlooked the city, a place to whichpeople made excursions. When Evliya Chelebi visited this tekke, it had a fewdervishes who were satisfied with very little. The founder of the tekke was GıjgıjDede, a saintly disciple of Armad Yasawc, who had gone to this place on hismaster’s instruction. He took the name Gıjgıj “because he looked terrifying androared (gıjılda-) like a dragon” (ibid., Book 5, fo. 21b).H The Bektash¢ traditionIt is fairly clear from the reports of Evliya Chelebi that the early arrival amongthe Western Turks of a number of dervishes connected with the Yasawc UarCqa– which is definitely confirmed before the tenth/sixteenth century {Köprülüapparently assumes this} – resulted in the creation of a Bektashc legend aboutArmad Yasawc and lajjc Bektash. Only in books that were written in the tenth/sixteenth or subsequent centuries – like {‘flc’s} Kunh al-akhbAr and Evliya Chelebi’sSeyARatnAme – does one come across stories that lajjc Bektash was a disciple ofArmad Yasawc. This fact confirms the accuracy of the report that ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade gives about lajjc Bektash.53 In any case, not a single word is to be foundon the relationship of lajjc Bektash with Armad Yasawc in either ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade or Tashköprü-Zade.54 Nevertheless, whatever its historicity, the Bektashctradition {i.e. the VelAyetnAme}, which, as mentioned, took form in the tenth/sixteenth century {more likely in the late ninth/fifteenth century}, providesconsiderable legendary material on Armad Yasawc. If it is combined with thereports by the historian ‘flc and Evliya Chelebi, it clearly shows that ArmadYasawc had exerted a great influence on the Western Turks for a long time.Therefore, in order to complete {our treatment of } the legendary life of ArmadYasawc, we must describe his place in Bektashc tradition.Present-day Bektashc tradition is still, for a variety of reasons, in a state ofdisorder. The various hagiographies (velAyetnAmes) that were written about lajjcBektash, and later about his many disciples, sometimes differ greatly from eachother. In the VelAyetnAme-i LAjjim SulUAn, for example, it is stated that lajjc Bektashwas a direct khalCfa of Armad Yasawc, while in the complete prose copies of the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE LEGENDARY LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh33VelAyetnAme-i LAjjC Bektash and the fifth volume of {‘flc’s} Kunh al-akhbAr it isrelated that lajjc Bektash was a disciple of Shaikh Luqman-i Paranda andthat this Luqman-i Paranda received permission to initiate people into nefismfrom Armad Yasawc or, according to another, rather weak, report from thekhwAja’s ancestor, the famous ‘Alid Murammad lanafc {i.e. Murammad Ibnal-lanafiyya}. Thus, the legendary accounts that in the VelAyetnAme-i LAjjim SulUAn,for instance, take place directly between Armad Yasawc and lajjc Bektash areshown in other works as taking place between Luqman-i Paranda and lajjcBektash. Furthermore, the velAyetnAmes of lajjc Bektash that contain the latterversion of this story also record a number of legends that directly involve ArmadYasawc and lajjc Bektash.55According to one legend in the velAyetnAmes of lajjc Bektash, Bektash Veliwas presented to Shaikh Luqman-i Paranda for his education while he was stilla child. Luqman-i Paranda was a khalCfa of Armad Yasawc and was a manthoroughly versed in exoteric and esoteric religious knowledge. He was initiatedinto the perendelik {flying like a bird} by Armad Yasawc, or, according to a reportby Murammad Ibn al-lanafiyya. Bektash Veli performed many miracles whilestill a child. One day when Luqman-i Paranda entered his presence, he wasamazed to see the room full of light. Looking around, he saw two luminouspersons, one to the left and the other to the right of Bektash. They were teachinghim to recite the Koran. As soon as Luqman entered, they disappeared. Luqmanasked the boy, “Who were they?” He explained that one was the Prophet andthe other was ‘Alc.56 On another occasion, Bektash Veli was reciting a lesson forLuqman. The time for prayer arrived and Luqman asked his pupil for somewater with which to perform the ablution. Bektash said to his teacher, “Whydon’t you arrange it so that a stream flows in here? Then there will be no needto go outside.” When his teacher said that his own power did not suffice for this,Bektash Veli immediately prayed to God, and Luqman-i Paranda said, “Amen.”At that moment, a little stream emerged from the middle of the school andflowed toward the door, and some beautiful irises {TETAm} bloomed at the sourceof the spring.57A short time after this event, Luqman went on the pilgrimage. He went up to‘Arafat {a hill near Mecca} and while his disciples turned toward the qibla{direction of Mecca} he said to them, “Friends! Today is the day before thereligious feast {arefe günü}. Now in our country foods58 are being cooked!” Thesewords, by the power of God, were made known to Bektash. Just then variousdishes were being cooked in the shaikh’s house. Bektash took a tray of the foodand instantly served it to Luqman. When they {Luqman and his disciples}returned to Ncshaper, Luqman told everyone of this miracle performed by theboy and gave him the byname lajjc {“Pilgrim”}. At about that time, the erensof Khurasan came to congratulate Luqman on his pilgrimage. When they sawthe stream flowing in the school, they were amazed and asked about it. Luqmansaid, “This is a miracle of lajjc Bektash” and he told the erens his numerousmiracles one by one. The erens of Khurasan thought that it was strange for such"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE34extraordinary things to be done by a child. lajjc Bektash, who was present,said to them, “I am a descendant of ‘Alc. Don’t think such things are too muchfor me. They are a divine gift.” The erens of Khurasan then asked, “If you arethe ‘possessor of the mystery’ where is your sign?” lajjc Bektash showed themtwo green moles on the palm of his hand and on his forehead. They all weredumbfounded and finally had to concede his greatness.59One day the erens of Khurasan assembled and asked lajjc Bektash who his pCrwas. lajjc Bektash replied that whoever spread a prayer rug over iris petals andprayed, he would become his disciple. They all laughed at this proposition andasked if he would be able to perform this miracle himself. When he performedthis miracle for them as well, they all removed their garb from their heads.His teacher Luqman also removed his. Saying, “AllAhu akbar” {God is mostgreat}, lajjc Bektash had them put their headgear back on. Around this time,Suluan Ibrahcm-i Thanc died. They offered the {spiritual} sultanate to lajjcBektash, but he would not accept it. He left it to one of his uncles, lasan, andwithdrew, preferring to do religious exercises {khalwa and “uzla} at a place ofworship. After reaching the age of discretion, he remained in this state for fortyyears.60 After this, there is no longer any mention of the name Luqman in theVelAyetnAme. Subsequently, we find lajjc Bektash associated with the aged shaikhArmad Yasawc.61In the VelAyetnAme, lajjc Bektash’s meeting with Armad Yasawc is presented ina very unusual manner. According to this legend, Armad Yasawc was the saintof all Khurasan and the shaikh of 99,000 disciples. Now, the territory ofBadakhshan was completely in the hands of unbelievers who continuously raidedthe realm of Islam. Finally, the people {of Khurasan} became tired of this andwent to Armad Yasawc, imploring him to help them. So he placed a tAj {“crown,”dervish headgear} on the head of his son laidar,62 who was only twelve yearsold, girded his waist with a sword and gave him horsetails and a standard.laidar then went to war with 5000 warriors. While sending his son, the shaikhfor some reason failed to mention the name of God, and so his army wasdefeated. laidar was taken prisoner and all of his men were put to the sword.laidar spent seven years in prison and the people of Khurasan were spared nosufferings from the unbelievers of Badakhshan. At last, they went to ArmadYasawc and implored him to help them. He made a fervent silent prayer to Godand suddenly lajjc Bektash appeared at the gate of his tekke. He entered, salutedthe Shaikh, and rubbed his face on the threshold. Armad Yasawc was very gladand said, “Behold! The possessor of the Kingdom has come.” After a meal,Armad Yasawc recounted all that had occurred. lajjc Bektash immediately turnedinto a falcon and flew away. Armad Yasawc’s disciples were angry that he hadshown favor to that naked abdAl {dervish} and left the tekke. But lajjc Bektashinstantly appeared with laidar, whom he had rescued from prison, and handedhim over to his father. All the dervishes then acknowledged his greatness.63 lajjcBektash was not satisfied with this, however, and by performing many wondershe converted the people of Badakhshan to Islam.64"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"THE LEGENDARY LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh35After this, lajjc Bektash was no longer going to remain in Khurasan. Onthe order and instruction of Armad Yasawc, he was going to go to Rem. But theVelAyetnAme explains at length that he acquired, by performing a number ofmiracles, some things that Armad Yasawc had held in trust, i.e. the tAj, khirqa{dervish cloak}, sofra {table cloth}, and sajjAda {prayer rug}.65 In this manner,Armad Yasawc turned these things, which he had kept for years, over to theirrightful owner, saying, “Oh, lajjc Bektash, you have now received your lot{nasibini aldın}. Congratulations that you have the rank of the chief of the greatestsaints {quUb al-aqUAb, “pole of poles”} and your authority will last forty years. Upto now authority has been mine. Henceforth, it is yours. In fact, the time for mydeath has come. Now then, go! I have sent you to Rem and placed you at thehead of the abdAls of Rem and appointed you their leader.”66In the VelAyetnAme-i LAjjim SulUAn, there is another legend that shows the rela-tionship between lajjc Bektash and Armad Yasawc: “His excellency SuluanKhwaja Armad Yasawc had a wooden sword. He brought it out, pronounced‘AllAhu akbar,’ and girded the waist of Suluan lajjc Bektash Veli of Khurasanwith it. In the hearth, wood from a mulberry tree was burning. He grabbed ahalf-burned piece of wood and flung it toward Rem. Then he said, ‘Be it knownthat I have sent this half-burned piece of wood in Khurasan, as an er, to Rem.Let them receive it in Rem.’ ” So that piece of wood was hurling through the air.Meanwhile, in Konya, there was a saint known as Suluan Khwaja Faqch. Heseized the wood and planted it in front of his cell. By the power of God, the half-burned piece of wood began to grow. The top of it was burned, but the bottomwas mulberry. Even now it is still bearing fruit. That night lajjim Suluan andlajjc Bektash Veli lay down on the prayer rug. A divine voice cried, ‘Don’ttarry! Go to Rem!’ They arose, performed the morning prayer, and completedtheir litanies, saying {Wherever you turn, there is the faceof God, Koran 2:115} and prostrated themselves to the friend {Armad Yasawc}.They requested permission {ijAza} from him. Then Khwaja Armad Yasawcb. Murammad lanafc {i.e. Murammad Ibn al-lanafiyya} b. ‘Alc ’l-Murtaqaand 99,000 khalCfas blessed them and at that hour on a blessed Wednesday theyset out on the road to the Ka‘ba.”67I The legend of Sarı SaltukIt is clear from Evliya Chelebi’s researches that there must have been a greatmany more legends telling how the great saint of Turkistan, Armad Yasawc,never forgot the Turks who went to Rem and continuously sent them assistants.The “Sarı Saltuk legend,” which has long been very famous among the WesternTurks, is very suggestive in this respect. According to the form of the legendrecorded by Evliya Chelebi, Armad Yasawc first sent lajjc Bektash {to Rem}and then sent Murammad Bukharc, known under the byname Sarı Saltuk, toassist him with 700 erens of Khurasan. Girding Sarı Saltuk’s waist with hisfamous wooden sword, he gave him the following advice: “My Saltuk Murammad!"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE36May my Bektash send you to Rem. Disguise yourself as Sarı Saltuk, the heretic,in the country of Poland, and kill that cursed one with a wooden sword! Earn aname for yourself and fame in Macedonia, Dobruja, and the land of the sevenkingdoms!” When Sarı Saltuk arrived in Rem, lajjc Bektash carried out hisshaikh’s order and sent him to Dobruja. Sarı Saltuk performed a great manymiracles in that region. He captured many places and converted their inhabit-ants to Islam. Evliya Chelebi visited the tekke of this Sarı Saltuk, whose legendshe narrates at length, in Silistria on the Black Sea coast.68J ConclusionIt is possible to reach some historical conclusions from the information that Ihave provided on the legendary life of Armad Yasawc. Until confirmed by otherhistorical evidence, however, these conclusions must be considered tentative{indeed, Köprülü’s dating for the spread of Armad Yasawc’s legend in variousregions is pure conjecture}. According to the information currently available,the legends about Armad Yasawc spread to three major Turkish areas: Turkistanand Qazaqstan (eastern central region), along the Volga (northern region), andAnatolia and Rumelia (western region).The legends in {lazcnc’s} JawAhir al-abrAr, which was written by a Yasawcdervish from Turkistan, and those that passed via the Qazaqs and spread tothe Northern Turks, and which exist in old, very simple popular books, like theLakîm Ata kitâbı, and the traditions that have been preserved to this day in thedervish convent in Yasc represent the oldest version of the Armad Yasawc legendand are the closest to historical reality.69 This influence passed through theregion of the Qazaqs and from there went even as far as the old Bulghar Turksand left prominent traces among them. It is a pity that so few historical documentshave survived from these Northern Turks. Consequently, we cannot adequatelydetermine the form in which the legend of Armad Yasawc spread amongthem. A number of works that have probably been in circulation among theNorthern Turks since fairly early times, such as {lusam al-Dcn Muslimc’s}RisAla-i tawArCkh-i bulghAriyya, the famous {anonymous} Lakîm Ata kitâbı, Bâqirghânkitâbı, and Âhir-zamân kitâbı {the last is attributed to Sulaiman lakcm Ata}, havekept the legends of Armad Yasawc and his disciples alive in that region forcenturies. And finally, when the legend of Edigü took shape among the Noghays,Armad Yasawc was incorporated into that legend as the grandfather of the hero{again, not exactly}. One can conclude from all of this evidence that by theninth/fifteenth century, the legend of Armad Yasawc was thoroughly familiar tothe Northern Turks.The legend of Armad Yasawc spread rapidly in the Syr Darya region, i.e. inYasc, Shash {Tashkent} and its environs, but this was not the case in Farghana,Bukhara, Samarqand, Khcva, and Khurasan. In these areas, we find that thelegend of Armad Yasawc only began to spread after the eighth/fourteenth century,i.e. after the growth and spread of the Naqshbandc UarCqa. The fact that Tcmer"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE LEGENDARY LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh37had a türbe and mosque built and dedicated to this great shaikh in 800/1397– 8does not contradict this assertion. Tcmer pursued a policy of supporting thekhwAjas and shaikhs in order to establish fully his influence over the people. Withthis goal in mind, he catered to the beliefs of the people in the Syr Darya region.Many of the shaikhs who appeared during the reigns of Tcmer and his descend-ants were members of the Naqshbandc UarCqa. It was only when they becameactive that the Yasawc legend began more or less to make itself felt in the regionsthat had been thoroughly imbued with Iranian culture – such as Khurasan andBukhara. But in the areas to the northeast where Turkish culture was morepredominant, the influence of Armad Yasawc spread, along with the fame ofnefcs who wrote excellent poetry in Persian, even before the establishment ofNaqshbandism.70The legend of Armad Yasawc had already spread among the Western Turkswell before the formation of the Ottoman Empire. The Mongol invasion, asit swept like a flood from east to west, resulted in the transfer of many thingsfrom their original homeland to the Turks in Anatolia. Indeed, this invasiondrove thousands of refugees before it. Among the people who went to Anatoliavia Khwarazm, Khurasan, and Azerbaijan, there were certainly dervishes andtravelers who belonged to the Yasawc UarCqa. And for this reason the Yasawclegend also began to thrive in Anatolia and spread among its people. Nevertheless,because the documentation related to life in Anatolia in the seventh/thirteenthand eighth/fourteenth centuries is so meager, we do not find the Yasawc legendthere in written form until after the ninth/fifteenth century, i.e. until after theBektashc tradition had firmly taken hold and become established.71 The Bektashcsfollowed a simple policy of taking over traditions that already existed among thepeople and inserting lajjc Bektash into them. In this way, they skillfully ensuredthat the legend in its new form did not appear completely foreign to commonlyheld ideas. Therefore, by taking over the traditions that existed concerning ArmadYasawc, the Bektashcs created a tie between him and lajjc Bektash.72 We canvigorously assert that the legend of Armad Yasawc flourished among the AnatolianTurks since probably the second half of the seventh/thirteenth century and that,in this Western area, the legend was more confused and further from historicalreality than it was in the Eastern and Northern areas.73NOTES1lazcnc’s JawAhir al-abrAr min amwAj al-biRAr, which describes the legends of ArmadYasawc {Hâlis Efendi Library now in the Süleymaniye Library in Istanbul}, uniqueMS, p. 66.

After relating this legend, the author says, “This story is re-counted at length in books and is narrated by trustworthy authorities.” In fact, in boththe {Turkish} translation of {nafc’s} RashaRAt and other books on the legends of thesaints, such as {larcrc-Zade} Kamal al-Dcn {Murammad’s} TibyAn-i wasA”il {al-RaqA”iq,Mulhak Fatih Library MSS 430–2} and {Ghulam Sarwar Murammad Lahawrc’s}KhazCnat al-aTfiyA {(Lucknow, 1322/1904 –5)}, it is related that Arslan Baba carried outthis duty of providing guidance {i.e. religious instruction} on the order of the ProphetMurammad (see the bibliography for information on these books). Indeed, it states in{Armad Yasawc’s} DCwAn-i Likmat that Arslan Baba was Sahâbeler ulusu hâss-ı bende-iKird-gâr {the greatest of the Companions and the noblest of God’s servants}, p. 173.This legend circulated for centuries among the Yasawcs. A Yasawc poet named Shamstells this legend in a poem {manVEma} that he wrote about Arslan Baba: “One day theProphet summoned Arslan Baba and gave him a date. Then he said, ‘After I die achild named Armad will come into the world. He will be the quintessence of myreligious community. Go see him and give him this date.’ With the blessing of theProphet’s prayer, Arslan Baba lived a long life. He searched continuously for the onewhose date he held in safekeeping. Finally, 400 years later, he arrived in Turkistan. Asusual, he sent word of his search in all directions. At last, he found him while on hisway to school in Yasc. Arslan Baba greeted the child and after the child returned thegreeting he asked, ‘Oh Baba, where is the object you hold in trust?’ Not expecting thisquestion, Arslan Baba was surprised and said, ‘Oh saint, how did you know aboutthis?’ The child replied, ‘God informed me.’ Arslan Baba then asked him his name."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"THE LEGENDARY LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh39He said that it was Armad and Arslan Baba surrendered to him what he had held intrust,” DCwAn-i Likmat, pp. 75 –7.

On the relationship of Armad Yasawc to Khaqir, see alsothe pages below. This issue of friendly conversation with Khaqir is not confined toArmad Yasawc. If we take a look at the nefc biographical works, we would finda great many stories about nefcs who met Khaqir. If we look, for example, at thecontemporaries of Armad, not only did Shaikh Yesuf Hamadanc continuously meetwith Khaqir (see ‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc, MaqAmAt-i YEsuf HamadAnC {this workis appended to larcrc-Zade’s TibyAn-i wasA”il al-RaqA”iq, Ibrahim Axa MS. 432 inthe Fatih Library in the Süleymaniye Library in Istanbul; see Chapter 3, p. 75, n.20for more on this author and his work, but we should note here that the attribution ofthe MaqAmAt-i YEsuf HamadAnC to Ghujduwanc is doubtful}) but ‘Abd al-KhaliqGhujduwanc also learned the dhikr-i khafiyya from him ({nafc,} RashaRAt, {Turkish}trans., p. 25). Indeed, he was also the one who taught the dhikr-i arra to ArmadYasawc (see Chapter 4, pp. 101–2) {these are silent and vocal dhikrs}.13 {‘flc,} Kunh al-akhbAr, vol. 5, p. 54. This legend was taken completely from theVelAyetnAme-i LAjjC Bektash Veli.14VelAyetnAme-i LAjjC Bektash Veli {Köprülü used the MS in his private library, for editionssee the bibliography; German trans.

He states that according to the legend of Imam Ja‘far oayyar {the flyer},whose {shrine – he has many – and} place of pilgrimage is in Chcra in the environsof Khotan, he flew to that place from Mecca. According to Grenard, thereis a great similarity between these miracles and the legends of the Buddhist saintsdescribed by {the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim} Hsüan Tsang {fl. first half of the seventhcentury}. In fact, he narrates a Buddhist legend resembling this flying story and alsostates that some of the tombs of Muslim saints were originally Buddhist convents.While it is true that Buddhism influenced the early beliefs of the Turks in this region,"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE42it would nevertheless be mistaken to allege that the legends of the Muslim saintsderived exclusively from the Buddhists.

According to this source, there is no reference at all in theother biographical dictionaries to nefc Murammad Danishmend who was the firstkhalCfa. {lazcnc simply names nefc Murammad Danishmend. He does not say thatbiographical dictionaries do not mention him. If Köprülü meant to say that he couldfind no reference to nefc Murammad Danishmend in such sources available to him,he is closer to the truth. In fact, nefc Murammad Danishmend was the chief silsilalink, as Yasawc’s direct disciple, for the lineage that produces the earliest knownYasawc source, which was unknown to Köprülü; the work is the fourteenth-centuryTurkic work of Israq Khwaja b. Isma‘cl Ata, which survives in two redactions, oneentitled only RisAla, the other entitled LadCqat al-“ArifCn. This work reflects the Isma‘clAta tradition that seems to have been a rival of the Yasawc lineages traced throughlakcm Ata (hence the story from the LakCm Ata kitAbı, which Köprülü alludes to bysaying that the work shows nefc Murammad Danishmend as the “second khalifa,” butwhich actually makes lakcm Ata the “full” disciple and nefc Murammad Danishmenda “half ” disciple – a story also found in an earlier source, but with the two figuresreversed in status). nefc Murammad Danishmend also appears in some versions of theRashaRAt, whose presentation of Armad Yasawc’s four disciples is in fact more complexthan is often recognized and than Köprülü allowed. nefc Murammad Danishmendalso appears in the LamaRAt, but is simply called “nefc Danishmend.”} Only Shamsc, aYasawc dervish, reveals his presence in the tradition by mentioning his name in apoem that he wrote about Zangc Baba, Hak Mustafâ”nin peyrevî Sultân Hoc(a) AhmedYesevî/Sûfî Muhammed Mevlevî Yâ Zengî Bâbâ himmetî {the true follower of Mutuafa isSuluan Khwaja Armad Yasawc/nefc Murammad Mawlawc, or the spiritual ambitionof Zangc Baba}, DCwAn-i Likmat, p. 258. Furthermore, nefc Murammad Danishmendin the {anonymous} LakCm Ata kitAbı (Kazan, 1901) is shown as the second khalCfa afterlakcm Ata. For some reason, this person whose historical existence was probablygenuine did not become sufficiently renowned to enter the nefc biographical works.See Chapter 4, pp. 89–92 on Sulaiman lakcm Ata. We have no other historical orlegendary information on Shaikh ‘Uthman Maghribc {whose name recalls that of atenth-century nefc known already from Hujwcrc and later hagiographies, but remainsunidentified} or Imam Marghuqc {his nisba is problematical, as noted below in thenarrative, and the same figure (i.e. he plays the same role in the story below in thenarrative of the erasure of the scholar’s books and mind) is called “Imam Maraghc” inthe LamaRAt.

With the exception of this very valuable work {JawAhir}, whichwas based on Yasawc tradition, the khalCfas of Armad Yasawc are presented in adifferent manner in the other books on the legends of saints. See Chapter 4, pp. 89–94 for critical information on this matter. Suffice it to say here that Baba Machcn isnot mentioned in them {but he is found in Central Asian Yasawc sources unknown toKöprülü, especially the LamaRAt}. Nevertheless, the tradition is clear in this respect. Infact, Sulaiman Ata confirms this by saying Baba Maçîn ol Sultân / Mürîd boldi bî-gümân{Baba Machcn, that sultan / became his disciple without doubt}, DCwAn-i Likmat,p. 271. The 47th Rikmat in the 3rd Kazan edn of the DCwAn-i Likmat relates this legendin exactly the same way. After Baba Machcn died, he was buried in the town ofFarkat. During a battle with the unbelievers, his foot sank into a stone and left a printthat could be seen in the tenth/sixteenth century. Pilgrims visited it and made variousrequests that were granted, JawAhir, p. 77.19 {lazcnc,} JawAhir, pp. 78 – 81. Among them only the name and biography of Saifal-Dcn Bakharzc have been confirmed in the books of legends. This nefc, who wrotesome noteworthy Persian quatrains, was a khalCfa of the famous shaikh Najm al-DcnKubra. The shaikh, after himself extracting him from the khalwa during the secondforty {days}, sent him to Bukhara. Saif al-Dcn lived there a long time after theshaikh’s martyrdom and died in 659/1261. His tomb is in Bukhara ({Amcn} ArmadRazc, Haft iqlCm {Köprülü used the MS in the Hâlis Efendi Library in the SüleymaniyeLibrary in Istanbul; ed.

As for the others: Shaikh Sa‘d al-Dcn could beSa‘d al-Dcn lammeyc, one of the khalCfas of Najm al-Dcn Kubra; Shaikh KamalShaibanc could be the famous Kamal Khujandc {no, Kamal Khujandc was a fourteenth-century poet; Köprülü may mean Kamal Jandc, a disciple of Najm al-Dcn Kubra, butthe person in question was more likely Kamal al-Dcn lusain b. Muvaffar al-Shaibancal-Baladc, a disciple of Jandc; see DeWeese, “Baba Kamal Jandc and the KubravcTradition among the Turks of Central Asia,” Der Islam, 71 (1994), 58–94}; andShaikh Murammad Baghdadc could be Shaikh Majd al-Dcn Baghdadc, but theseidentifications are very unlikely. There is absolutely no record of any of these legendsin the biographical dictionaries, and also no account of Saif al-Dcn Bakharzc’srelationship with Armad Yasawc. In the NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., p. 173, it is onlymentioned that Shaikh ‘Alc Lala, a khalCfa of Najm al-Dcn Kubra, was attached toArmad Yasawc before joining him. See Chapter 3, p. 62 on this question. Some fiftyPersian quatrains of Shaikh Saif al-Dcn Bakharzc were published in {S. Khuda Bakhsh,“Saifuddcn Bakharzc,”} ZDMG, 59 (1905), 345 –54.

The poet Murammadnalir indicates in his ShaibAnCnAme that Yasc and Savran were two towns close to eachother. This conforms to the account in the legend given above (ShaibAnCnAme, {Germantrans. and} ed. Arminius Vambéry {as Die Sheïbaniade (Vienna, 1885)}, p. 444 {newed. E. Shadcev (Tashkent, 1989)}). Indeed, according to the information given byÉ. Reclus, Savan or Savran is a town west of Yasc, currently in a desolate and ruinedstate. Reclus writes that it possessed two graceful minarets, known to be ancientmonuments, and that one had collapsed and the other was on the verge of collapse(Reclus [ed.], Nouvelle géographie universelle {Paris, 1881–94}, vol. 6, p. 554). The Amer-ican traveler Schuyler, who visited these places during the Russian occupation, givesquite a lot of information on this town because he passed through it on the way toYasc. According to this account, the remains of rather large buildings and some ruinsof a fortress were found there. The local people had fled to the east in the years cor-responding to the Russian invasion. The same traveler writes that a very tall mosquebuilt of brick had previously been there, but it had collapsed and the two remainingminarets had been destroyed by the Russians, so he could see nothing but their bases(Schuyler, Turkistan, {Turkish} trans., p. 90). K. Ujfalvy, who also saw Savran, reportsthat this town had a fortress with thicker walls than had the other nearby townsand that a great many ancient monuments were excavated from there (Ujfalvy,Le Syr-Daria . . .{Paris, 1879}, p. 47).26 {lazcnc,} JawAhir, pp. 101–2.

As it happened, just at that time the wife of the farmer in whosehome he was staying as a guest was about to give birth. For this reason, the farmerasked Armad Yasawc to pray for her. The khwAja wrote a prayer and they attached itto the woman’s waist and there immediately occurred what he had wished. Thefarmer was very happy because his wife had given birth {without difficulty} and heprepared some tea. The khwAja perspired from drinking the very hot tea and it madehis fatigue disappear. He then prayed, saying “This had a healing quality. Have yourill ones drink this that they may be cured. May God make this available until the Dayof Judgment!” Then, according to tradition, tea has continued to be used amongthe Turks from that time and it has been a curative to everyone (‘Abd al-QayyemNatirc, FawAgih al-julasA” [Kazan, 1884], p. 658). After this, ‘Abd al-Qayyem Natircsays, “The village of Yasa is east of Kashghar; Khwaja Armad died in the year 369 ofthe Hijra.” He goes on to give other historical and geographical information – all ofwhich is, needless to say, totally without value. {The tea story appears in N.

The legends of Qayghusuz Suluan recount in detail how Qayghusuz,whom the Bektashcs considered one of their own, went to the dervish convent ofAbdal Mesa and, thanks to that, obtained guidance (ManAqib-i Qayghusuz AbdAl [SulUAn],MS copy in my private library).

When Mentesh {later} went from Kayseri to Sivas, he was martyred there.lajjc Bektash went from Kayseri to Kara-öyük where he married Khaten-ana and{later} died. This historian, who states rather clearly that he knew, in particular, theentire life of lajjc Bektash and his brother, says Kendi bir meczûb-ı budala azîzdi; Zeyhliktenve müridlikten fârigdi {he was a saint ecstatic with divine love and had no interest inbeing a shaikh or having disciples}. He rejects categorically the reports that hadno historical basis, such as the one that lajjc Bektash met Orhan and that he prayedfor the janissary corps. The numerous notes that ‘flc Bey added to this subject in hisannotations to ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade’s TawArCkh – for example, that lajjc Bektash wentto Rem in 680/1281–2, that he lived for ninety-two years, that he died in 738/1337–8, that Khaten-ana was engaged to Khwaja Idrcs who was a member of the “ulamA”,that during his life lajjc Bektash gave the position of shaikh in the convent built bySultan Orhan to the children of Khwaja Idrcs, that his father’s name was SayyidMurammad Ibrahcm-i Thanc and his mother’s name was Khatme Khaten, and thathe was born in Ncshaper in 646/1248–9 – are all based on Bektashc traditions.Unfortunately, they have no historical value. To compare legendary stories like these,drawn from the velAyetnAmes, with the clear and precise statements in ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade’s history (pp. 204 –6) can never be considered correct behavior for a historian."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"THE LEGENDARY LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh51Indeed, ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade’s remarks on lajjc Bektash can be easily corroboratedby other evidence.

Only the historian ‘flc presents some of the legends mentioned above asif they had taken place between lajjc Bektash and Luqman-i Paranda, but he givesno information about Luqman, Kunh al-akhbAr, vol. 5, p. 53. In like manner, Luqmanis shown as a murshid of lajjc Bektash in such books as {‘Abd al-Ghaffar b. lasanKirimc’s} “Umdat al-tawArCkh, which doubtless indicates that Kunh al-akhbAr was thesource of these works in this respect. ‘flc certainly took this story from Bektashctradition. We learn from {Mcrkhwand’s} RawQat al-TafA {ed. Riqa Qulc Khan (Tehran,1270 – 4/1853 – 6; new edn, Tehran, 1338 –9 sh./1960)} that Shaikh Luqman-i Parandawas not completely imaginary, like a number of other personalities in the VelAyetnAme,but actually existed. While mentioning him among the famous people from the reignof {the Tcmerid} Sultan lusain Baiqara {1469 –1506}, this work states that he had avery well known tekke and shrine {mezarlık} in Herat. The literary scholar MawlanaYesuf Badc‘c Andijanc (d. 898/1492–3), who wrote a treatise on the rules of themu“ammA {a genre of verse}, was buried in the cemetery of Luqman-i Paranda, RawQatal-TafA, vol. 7, p. 122; {Khwandamcr,} LabCb al-siyar {Bombay, 1273/1857}, vol. 3,p. 327. We also learn {from RawQat al-TafA} that the famous Sayyid Shams al-DcnMurammad Andijanc, a contemporary who had the byname Mcr-i Ser-Burehne {Bare-headed Amcr}, was placed in charge of this tomb and was appointed the shaikh, andthat every year this shrine received 150,000 kepeki dinars from waqfs {pious endow-ments} and votive offerings, RawQat al-TafA, vol. 7, p. 116. This brief report shows usthat Shaikh Luqman-i Paranda was a great and famous shaikh buried in Herat{Mcrkhwand does not clearly show this}, that his tekke and tomb were renownedamong the people in that region in the ninth/fifteenth century, and that it possessedrich waqfs. Most probably this shaikh was a member of Armad Yasawc’s UarCqa, butone could state with great likelihood that he, like a number of the other shaikhsmentioned in the VelAyetnAme, had absolutely no historical connection with lajjc Bektash.If more information were available on the life of this shaikh, it would probably shedlight on a number of points that have remained obscure up to now.

See Gölpınarlı (ed.), Vilâyet-Nâme, pp. 15 –16}at one side of the square at that place. Armad Yasawc said Kim bu darı çeçinin üstüneseccâdesini koyup namaz kılarsa, o emânetler gelip onun baZı ucuna dikilirler. Hem zâten nâfilezahmet çekmiyin, sâhibi nerede ise buraya gelir! {Whoever places his prayer rug over thisheap of millet and prays, those entrusted things will come and station themselves athis head. Anyway, don’t trouble yourselves in vain. Their owner will be here soon!}At that moment, lajjc Bektash appeared and greeted them. The khwAja and his murCdsrose to their feet. Shortly afterwards, Armad Yasawc shouted, “Yâ BektaZ!” {Oh,Bektash!}. On this signal, lajjc Bektash placed his prayer rug on the heap of milletand performed two prostrations. Not one grain of millet moved from its place. Thecrown in trust then immediately took flight and moved to Bektash’s head. The cloakrose in the air and settled on his back. The lamp rose from its place, lit up, and stoodbefore him. The Prophet’s standard rose from its place and stationed itself above hishead. The prayer-rug rose from its place and spread itself underneath him VelAyetnAme-i LAjjC Bektash Veli, pp. 24 –5. {Köprülü made a jumble of this passage.

Sarı Saltuk,i.e. the legend of Kaligra (Kalliakre) Suluan, is described at length in these pages.Evliya Chelebi not only says that Sarı Saltuk had a shrine in Babaeski (Book 3,fo. 170a), but he also states, while mentioning Babadaxı {in Dobruja} in the samevolume, that Sarı Saltuk had a maqAm {tomb} there; and he adds that Yazıcı-oxlu{Mehmet Chelebi, d. 1451} and the governor of Ochakov {Özi} Kenan Pasha{d. 1659} each wrote a work on his legends, Book 3, fo. 127b. Unfortunately, wehave no information about these two works. In any case, Sarı Saltuk was a very wellknown hero among the Western Turks. The poet Naw‘c-Zade ‘Aua’c {d. 1635}, theauthor of Khamsa, tells of one of his great miracles in his KitAb-i NafRat al-azhAr derjawAb-i maRzan al-asrAr (copy in my private library) and Kemal Pasha-Zade {d. 1534}speaks of his spiritual height in his MohaçnAme {book 10 of his Tarih-i Al-i osman, ed.and French trans.

There is infact a historical basis to this legend. In 662/1263 – 4 a number of Turks went toDobruja in the company of Sarı Saltuk and later, at the time of ‘hsa Bey, one ofthe Karası-oghulları at Balıkesir, they emigrated to the area of Karası.

Sanguinettias Voyages d’Ibn Batoutah} [ Paris, 1853 – 8], vol. 2, p. 416). While providing informationon Sarı Saltuk in the annotations to his translation of the MohaçnAme, Pavet de Courteillesays that his tomb was in Babadaxı, that it was widely venerated, and that it wasvisited by Sultan Süleyman in 945/1538, p. 177. In any case, these historical worksmention no connection whatsoever between Sarı Saltuk and lajjc Bektash. Neverthe-less, it is recorded in detail in Bektashc tradition, which is always completely contraryto the historical facts, that Sarı Saltuk was a shepherd, that on the order of lajjcBektash he took Ulu Abdal and Kichi Abdal with him and traveled from Sinop toGeorgia on a prayer rug, that he converted the Georgians to Islam, that he then wentto the fortress of Kaligra in Dobruja where he killed a dragon, that he then invited thepeople of the surrounding region to Islam, and that he established a tekke. Sarı Saltukreturned for a time after lajjc Bektash’s death, but he went back again to Dobrujaand died there. In accordance with his will, when he died seven coffins were laid out.His murCds and those who believed in him came from various cities and took one ofthem and looked in it. They saw Saltuk Baba in each one and thus they happily tookhim to their own cities where they buried him. According to Bektashc tradition, thiswas why he had a maqAm in seven places (VelAyetnAme-i LAjjC Bektash Veli, pp. 62–7).In the versified version of the VelAyetnAme, the legend is the same, lacking only the tripto Georgia and his return to the mother lodge. Naw‘c-Zade ‘Aua’c shows quite clearlyin his Khamsa that in the eleventh/seventeenth century the Bektashcs considered SarıSaltuk to be a great member of their order, just like Qızıl-Deli Suluan (MS in myprivate library).

Because his JawAhir does notinclude all sorts of legends from the Bektashc tradition, provides rather plausibleinformation on the family of Armad Yasawc, and incorporates much material on therules of the Yasawc UarCqa, we can regard this work as being uniquely important inpreserving the version of the legend of Armad Yasawc found in Turkistan {but Köprülüwas unaware of the substantial literary legacy produced by Yasawc tradition, orreflecting it, in Central Asia}. Speaking of Armad Yasawc in the versified version ofthe VelAyetnAme of lajjc Bektash, the verse Murâd îden menakıbında göre / Olan pervâne îrenZem“-i nûrâ {He who wishes may consult his ManAqib; it is the moth that attains thecandle of light} could be evidence, although not very definitive, that some kind oflegend about him had appeared in that region and that he was known there."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"THE LEGENDARY LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh5570 There is nothing on Armad Yasawc in any of the works of Babur Shah or Nawa’cor in {Mcrkhwand’s} RawQat al-TafA, or {Khwandamcr’s} LabCb al-siyar. Only {nafc’s}RashaRAt, which was written in the early years of the tenth/sixteenth century,contains a little information on him. Even Jamc’s NafaRAt has no reference to him.{Babur, indeed, does not mention Armad Yasawc; but Mcrkhwand does mention hisshrine, as does Khwandamcr. Nawa’c, of course, gives the extremely importantaccount of Armad Yasawc in his NasA”im al-maRabba, along with several other figureswho may be linked with the Yasawc tradition; the work was a Chaghatay translation,with expansion (especially a section on the Turkic shaikhs) of Jamc’s NafaRAt. Köprülü’sfailure to use it for Early Mystics was remedied in a later article, “Orta-Asya Türkdervizlixi hakkında bazı notlar,” TM, 14 (1964), 259 – 62, in which, however, hemerely paraphrased the work’s accounts without adding any analysis or comparison.On the earliest edition of the additions, see Carl Brockelmann, “Newa’is Biographientürkischer und zeitgenössischer Mystiker,” in Documenta Islamica Inedita (FestschriftR.

Eraslan does not mention Brockelmann’s work. As forthe RashaRAt, it is indeed an important source on Armad Yasawc and the Yasawctradition, but it garbles or over-systematizes the tradition’s silsila, among other things.Jamc’s NafaRAt does not accord a separate biographical entry to Armad Yasawc, butit does mention him in its account of the four successors of Yesuf Hamadanc. Seethe critical edition of NafaRAt al-uns by Marmed ‘fbidc (Tehran, 1370/1991), pp. 382,388, 438.}71 Setting aside the VelAyetnAme, we first encounter the tradition of lajjc Bektash inwritten form in {‘flc’s} Kunh al-akhbAr and Evliya Chelebi’s SeyARatnAme. It is quiteobvious that the tradition of lajjc Bektash was fixed and established, and the VelAyetnAmewas created, in the tenth/sixteenth century, which we consider to be the period inwhich the present-day Bektashiyya took form and developed, and that both ‘flc andEvliya Chelebi made use of it. ‘flc summarized the information on lajjc Bektash,apart from the section on Chcn Osman, from material wholly derived from theVelAyetnAme. The fact that the arrangement of the material in the VelAyetnAme is thesame as that in the Kunh al-akhbAr, and the fact that there is not even the slightestdifference between the legends, are sufficient proof of this. Furthermore, ‘flc statesthat he saw the {spiritual?} genealogy of lajjc Bektash (vol. 5, p. 53) and informs usthat he visited his convent in 1005/1596 –7 and met there with Iskender Chelebi, adescendant of Balım Suluan. All of this is sufficient evidence to confirm that theVelAyetnAme of lajjc Bektash existed at that time and was commonly known.72 The legend of Sarı Saltuk is evidence for this Bektashc practice. In addition, the factthat historical personalities like Yenus Emre, Sayyid Marmed lairanc, and MawlanaJalal al-Dcn Remc, whose legends were widespread among the people, were mixedwith the Bektashc legend in various ways is also evidence for this practice. If wepossessed Yazıcı-oxlu’s Sarı Saltuk menkabesi, which Evliya Chelebi says was extant, wewould surely learn the extent to which he was associated with Armad Yasawc.I wonder if this relationship, which is mentioned by Evliya Chelebi, had long existedas a legend among the people or if it was created later under the influence of theBektashc legend. For now no definite answer can be given to this question. The secondpossibility appears to be more likely, but because certain dervishes like Chcn Osman –and numerous Yasawc khalCfas mentioned by Evliya Chelebi – who are not included inthe Bektashc tradition are associated with Armad Yasawc in early legends among theWestern Turks, the first possibility cannot be completely rejected. {Köprülü, however,has no evidence of these legends’ early attestation.}"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE5673 Another possibility arises here. I wonder if the legend of Armad Yasawc spreadamong the Western Turks after the spread of the Naqshbandiyya. The spread of theNaqshbandiyya among the Western Turks took place in the second half of the ninth/fifteenth century after Shaikh Ilahi-i Simavc, or more correctly in the tenth/sixteenthcentury, {Tashköprü-Zade,} al-ShaqA”iq, {Turkish} trans., vol. 1, p. 262; {ysmâ‘îlBelig,} Güldeste-i riyâz-ı irfân, p. 144; {Laucfc,} Tadhkira, {ed. Ahmed Cevdet as Tadhkira-yi LaUCfC ( Istanbul, 1314/1896)}, p. 50. In any case, the present form of the legend oflajjc Bektash, ‘flc’s history, Evliya Chelebi’s SeyARatnAme, and even {lazcnc’s} JawAhirall came into being after the ninth/fifteenth century, in the tenth/sixteenth century,i.e. after the spread of the Naqshbandiyya. By dismissing all this evidence as coin-cidence, could it not be a mistake to assert that the legend of Armad Yasawc hadalready spread among the Western Turks before the formation of the Ottoman state?In my view, this possibility is not very strong. The aforesaid annotations can because to reject it and several other factors could be considered in this regard. Forexample, if ‘flc and Evliya Chelebi had taken the legend of Armad Yasawc from{lazcnc’s} JawAhir, then we could conclude that this legend had come to the WesternTurks as a result of the spread of the Naqshbandiyya, but the fact is that they bothtook this legend from the Bektashc tradition. Indeed, because it is not mentioned inKatib Chelebi’s Kashf al-VunEn, we could conclude that the JawAhir cannot have beenwell known at that time. Although it is true that the Bektashc tradition was fixed in thetenth/sixteenth century, this does not prove that the Yasawc legend had appeared atthat time. If it had, then one would have to believe that the legends of Yenus Emre,Sayyid Marmed lairanc and others had also come into existence in the tenth/sixteenth century. I have explained above, however, that Armad Yasawc legends areto be found in ‘flc and Evliya Chelebi, which differ from those derived from thevelAyetnAmes. As will be described in the second part of this book, there is a definiteresemblance between the work of Yenus Emre and his associates and the DCwAn-iLikmat, which further strengthens my aforesaid assertion. In any case, until newdocuments provide proof to the contrary, we can state categorically that the legend ofArmad Yasawc had already existed among the Western Turks before the formation ofthe Ottoman state. {Köprülü was on to something in suggesting that the Naqshbandcshad a role in spreading Armad Yasawc’s fame among the “Western Turks,” butthat role probably came later. His argument against his suggestion stresses the weakarguments and misses the main one, namely that the VelAyetname of lajjc Bektashwas undoubtedly compiled before the end of the fifteenth century (the notion thatEvliya Chelebi could have gotten his information on Armad Yasawc from lazcnc’swork makes no sense). Finally, he goes too far in claiming that the circulation oflegends about Armad Yasawc in Anatolia before the formation of the Ottoman stateis “categorically” affirmable without negative proof !}"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"THE HISTORICAL LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh573THE HISTORICAL LIFE OFAlMAD YASAWhLegends created by the popular imagination always contain an element of truth,i.e. they faithfully represent the form in which any personality or event is reflectedin the general consciousness. It is the duty of the historian first to describe thelegendary form of this personality or event and then to establish and animate itshistorical reality. If the first duty has been adequately done, it will greatly facilitatetranslating and reducing the myth to its true proportions.A His childhoodArmad Yasawc was born in the town of Sairam, which today is part of thedistrict of Aqsu in the region of Eastern Turkistan in China. It is located 176 kmnortheast of {the town of } Aqsu.1 Sairam is a small town on the stream calledthe Qara-su, which flows into the Shahyar River, a tributary of the TarimRiver.2 Although the date of Armad Yasawc’s birth is not known for certain, wecan estimate that it occurred around the middle of the fifth /eleventh century.3Armad’s father, Shaikh Ibrahcm, was one of the most famous shaikhs of Sairam.He married ‘f ’isha Khaten, the daughter of Mesa Shaikh, one of his khalCfas.From this union, a daughter, Gawhar-Shahnaz, and later a son, Armad, wereborn. Their mother predeceased their father, who died when Armad was sevenyears old.4 Thus we find him under the guardianship of his sister. According totradition, Shaikh Ibrahcm’s family was traced back to Imam Murammad Ibnal-lanafiyya b. ‘Alc al-Murtaqa in the following manner: Shaikh Ibrahcm b.Shaikh Ilyas b. Shaikh Marmed b. Shaikh Marmed (?!) b. Shaikh Murammadb. Shaikh Iftikhar b. Shaikh ‘Umar b. Shaikh ‘Uthman b. Shaikh lusain b.Shaikh lasan b. Shaikh Isma‘cl b. Shaikh Mesa b. Shaikh Mu’min b. ShaikhHaren b.

Imam b. al-lanafiyya b. ‘Alc al-Murtaqa.5It can be supposed that, for unknown reasons, Armad Yasawc went to Yascwhen he was still young and settled there. The traditions about how he took thebyname Yasawc and about how Arslan Baba met him in Yasc both support thisnotion. Because the city of Yasc – as it is called today {laqrat-i} Turkistan – was"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE58the center of government of Oghuz Khan, it was a famous place that hadalready passed into Turkish legend.6 And the fact that Khwaja Armad took thebyname Yasawc, based on residence in this city, further increased its historicalimportance in the Turkish world. In any case, Armad, who went to this city andsettled there with his sister, received there the favor, kindness, and blessing of thewell known Turkish shaikh Arslan Baba.7 Because the latter died while Armadwas quite young, the tradition that Arslan Baba had a strong influence on hispersonality cannot be regarded as historically correct. {In any case,} it is likelythat Armad did spend the first years of his education in Yasc, for we find him,while he was still a youth, going to Bukhara, which was a great Islamic center, inorder to complete his education.B Khw™ja Y§suf Hamad™n¢ in Bukh™r™In the sixth/twelfth century, Bukhara was under the political control of theQarakhanids. This city had lost the political significance that it had had in theSamanid period, but it maintained its fame as the most important center ofthe Islamic sciences in Transoxiana. Its madrasas were full of students comingfrom throughout the Muslim world, and especially Turkistan. The city was ruledby a very rich family of “ulamA” known as the fl-i Burhan. All the learnedmembers of this family, who were lanafcs, were given the byname nadr-i Jihan.The founder of the family was Burhan al-Milla wa ’l-Dcn ‘Abd al-‘Azcz b. ‘Umar,who was well known under the byname Nu‘man-i Thanc. He lived from aboutthe second half of the fifth/eleventh century to the early years of the sixth/twelfth century. Although subordinate to the Qarakhanids, this Tadr {paramountor foremost person} usually lived like an independent ruler. He was succeededby his son, lusam al-Dcn ‘Umar, who held the reins of power in Bukharauntil he was killed by the Qara Khiuay in 536/1143 – 4.8 In any case, it is rathereasy to guess what kinds of religious currents were prevalent in the madrasas ofBukhara during the rule of these Tadrs who were lanafc religious scholars andsupported 6000 faqChs { jurists}. It was at such a time and into such a milieu thatArmad Yasawc arrived. He attached himself to Shaikh Yesuf Hamadanc, one ofthe leading religious scholars and nefcs of the period, and his personality wasformed under his influence.9Abe Ya‘qeb Yesuf b. Ayyeb b. Yesuf b. al-lasan b. Wahara10 was born in440 or 441/1049 –50 in the town of Bezanjcrd in the region of Hamadan.11Sometime after 460/1067– 8, he went to Baghdad,12 where he attached himselfto Shaikh Abe Israq Shcrazc and in a short time surpassed his friends in {thestudy of } uTEl al-fiqh {the principles of jurisprudence} and khilAf {divergencesamong the legal schools} and won the respect of his master. According to theinformation given by al-Sam‘anc, who was in Yesuf Hamadanc’s tekke in Marwand who met there and later in Bukhara with lasan Andaqc, he had extensiveknowledge of fiqh and, above all, “ilm-i naVar. Later he studied LadCth with thegreat traditionists of the age in Baghdad, Isfahan, and Samarqand. Finally, after"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"THE HISTORICAL LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh59acquiring great knowledge and erudition in the religious sciences, he abandonedthem on the impulse of his mystical temperament and studied nefism directlyfrom the famous Shaikh Abe ‘Alc Farmadc. It is reported that he also conversedwith Shaikh ‘Abd Allah Juvainc and Shaikh lasan Simnanc.13After following the path of asceticism and struggle against his carnal self,Yesuf Hamadanc went to live in Marw. A short time later, he left for Herat. Hestayed there for a fairly long time, but when the people of Marw asked him toreturn to their city, he did so. {Nevertheless,} he left a second time for Herat. InRabc‘ I 535/October–November 1140, while on the way back to Marw fromHerat, he died in the town of Bamiycn.14 According to one report, Ibn al-Najjar,one of his disciples, later had his body taken to Marw, where his tomb now is.15Khwaja Yesuf Hamadanc was a very ardent follower of the “Greatest Imam”{Abe lancfa} and was a follower of his madhhab {the lanafc school of law}. Helived in different cities in Iraq, Khurasan, and Transoxiana where he was occu-pied with providing spiritual guidance to the people. He spent a rather long timein Bukhara and even lived for a while on Keh-i Zar {near Mt Damghan}.16 Itseems that Armad Yasawc joined Yesuf Hamadanc when he was in Bukhara –or, according to another tradition, when he was in Samarqand – and learnedfrom him the rules, as well as the sciences (both exoteric and esoteric), of themystical way. He may also have traveled about various countries with his shaikh.In any case, Yesuf Hamadanc spent most of his time in Marw al-Red. Abe’l-Sa‘d al-Sam‘anc says that he had a tekke in Marw,17 and other sources reportthat his tekke in that city was so famous and important at that time that it wasregarded as the Ka‘ba of Khurasan.18 Yesuf Hamadanc, who won widespreadfame in the Muslim world for his erudition and virtue and for the miracles thathe performed, went to Baghdad in 515/1121–2. In the famous NivamiyyaMadrasa founded by the Seljuk Vizier Nivam al-Mulk, he gave sermons andspiritual counsel to a select assembly who had hastened there from all directions.During one sermon, a famous faqCh named Ibn al-Saqqa’ stood up and asked thekhwAja a question. In reply he said, “Sit down! I detect the odor of unbelief inyour words. It is likely that your death will not be within the Muslim faith.” Thisin fact came to pass. Ibn al-Saqqa’ went to Constantinople with the Byzantineambassador who had come to Baghdad and he became a Christian.19 YesufHamadanc performed a great many similar miraculous and marvelous deeds.Khwaja ‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc, in his treatise MaqAmAt-i YEsuf HamadAnC,20provides considerable information that shows, in the most sincere manner, thelife and character of the shaikh. Thanks to this work, the figure of the learnednefc, which al-Sam‘anc, whom we can consider to be the earliest source on thissubject, and various other sources only vaguely bring to life, takes very clearand lively form. We learn not only of Yesuf Hamadanc’s physical appearance,character, and habits, but also the full essence and depth of his spirit.{According to the MaqAmAt,} Yesuf Hamadanc was a tall, thin man with pock-marks and a long, light-brown beard. He wore wool clothing that was alwayspatched. He gave no importance to worldly affairs and would not visit the homes"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE60of rulers or great men. Whatever he acquired, he gave to the needy. He wouldnot accept anything from anyone. He did not know Turkish. He was single forseventy-five years and then finally married. His wife died forty days before hedid. He was very kind to everyone. He was patient and tender-hearted andwould ask visitors about the dervishes in their provinces. As he silently performedthe dhikr, he would imprison his carnal self and therefore sweat profusely.21 Hewas always occupied with reading the Koran. From the place called Khosh-ded,which was within the Ghatfar quarters, to the mosque he would make a completerecitation of the Koran. From the door of the mosque until he arrived at thehome of Khwaja lasan Andaqc and Khwaja Armad Yasawc, he would reciteSErat al-Baqara. On the way back, he would complete SErat Fl “ImrAn. While goingfrom his mosque to the dervish cells, a distance of 700 feet, he would also recitepart of the Koran. In between, he would turn his face toward Hamadan andweep profusely. He possessed the staff and turban of Salman Farsc {a Persianbarber who was taken into Murammad’s household and became the model ofspiritual adoption}. At the beginning of every month, he would summon themullas of Samarqand and discuss the SharC“a with them. Khaqir was his constantcompanion. He would apply medications to pains and wounds, write nuskhas(amulets) for fevers, and try to alleviate everyone’s suffering. He was never loathto teach the obligations of the faith to all the villagers, Turk and Tajik alike. Hewas always preoccupied with teaching. He accepted all the basic dogmas ofIslam without esoteric interpretation. He lived in a continuous state of asceticismand spiritual struggle {against his carnal self }. He advised his disciples to followthe ways of the Prophet and his Companions. His heart was full of deep affectionfor all creatures. He would go to the homes of Christians and Zoroastrians andrecount to them the splendors of Islam. He was patient and forbearing witheverything. He showed respect and affection to everyone. A harsh word neverpassed his lips. He never called a Muslim an unbeliever. He was inclined topoverty and would not use anything made of gold or silver. He regarded thepoor more highly than the rich. In his room, there was a rush mat, a felt, a waterjug, two cushions, a saucepan and nothing else. He would always speak to hisdisciples of the legends and virtues of the ChahAr yAr {the first four caliphs} andadvise them to pray, fast, hold dhikrs, practice asceticism, and struggle againsttheir carnal desires.On Wednesday, 11 Ramaqan 504/March 25, 1110, Sultan Sanjar sent aletter to Qasim Jekc in Samarqand. In this letter, he made known his respect anddeference toward Shaikh Yesuf Hamadanc. He also sent 50,000 gold pieces tothe dervishes of his tekke and added that “they should inform him about the wayof life of this great shaikh, who did not deviate from the path of the Atrab-iKiram {Companions and disciples of the Prophet}, and should request for himself{the recitation of } the FAtiRa from the Shaikh.”22 Meanwhile, Shaikh Yesufhad gone to the cell of Khwaja ‘Abd Allah Baraqc in order to meet his disciples.Khwaja lasan Andaqc, Khwaja Armad Yasawc, Khwaja ‘Abd al-KhaliqGhujduwanc, and several others were all there. The disciples informed him of"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"THE HISTORICAL LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh61Sultan Sanjar’s offering, and Shaikh Yesuf recited a FAtiRa for his deed. He thensaid that he had no deeds that Sanjar should be informed of except for moralslips and errors. When his dervishes pressed him, he said, “Write down whateveryou see me do that is in conformity with the prophetic SharC“a!” Granted thispermission, the dervishes wrote his biography and sent it {to Sanjar}.Before he died, ‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc asked him about his khalCfas andreceived the following answer: “My khalCfas will be Khwaja ‘Abd Allah Baraqc,and after him Khwaja lasan Andaqc, and after him Armad Yasawc. When theturn of khalCfa has come to Armad Yasawc, he will travel to the province ofTurkistan and you will become the khalCfa.” This in fact came to pass. On theday of his death, he turned his back to the miRrAb {niche indicating the directionof Mecca} and ordered his companions to heat some water {to wash his corpse}.Then he turned his face to his four khalCfas and the others who were present andsaid, “I have left my place to ‘Abd Allah Baraqc. Follow him! Do not opposehim! State the rules of behavior that we wrote for Sultan Sanjar to our disciplesand companions!” Turning to Armad Yasawc, he asked him to read the SEratal-FAUir, SErat YAsCn, and SErat al-NAzi“At. When this was finished, a cry broke out.23When Yesuf Hamadanc, who had won great fame during his life for his strictobservance of the stipulations of the SharC“a and the sunna of the Prophet andfor his erudition in the religious sciences, closed his eyes, many of the attributesthat contributed to his fame passed to his khalCfas and within a short time theytoo won great renown.24 Yesuf Hamadanc was often cited in books on nefism.25These references as well as some legends confirm that he wrote several works,26but unfortunately none has come down to us.27Thus, Khwaja Armad regarded his spiritual guide and teacher Yesuf Hamadancas a model of knowledge and learning, excellence and virtue. In this period,which was dominated by Turkish rulers who closely adhered to the stipulationsof the SharC“a and were opposed to Mu‘tazilism {theological doctrine stressingrationality},28 he acquired, like his teacher, a great knowledge of the sciences ofthe SharC“a and became so renowned for his religious knowledge, asceticism, andpiety that, in his old age, Yesuf Hamadanc selected him to be a khalCfa togetherwith his other three murCds.29 For a while after the deaths of the first two khalCfas,Khwaja ‘Abd Allah Baraqc (d. 555/1160 –1) and Khwaja lasan Andaqc (466 –552/1073 –1157), he was the head of the tekke in Bukhara. However, after servingin this post for a time – how long we do not know, but it was probably not verylong – he left all his disciples to the fourth khalCfa Khwaja ‘Abd al-KhaliqGhujduwanc and went straight to Turkistan, to Yasc.30C His return to Yas¢After completing his training in the nefc path with the most famous shaikh of theage and acquiring the position of khalCfa, Armad Yasawc did not remain inBukhara, but returned to Yasc for unknown reasons. Although we do not knowexactly when he returned, it was probably after the death of the first khalCfa ‘Abd"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE62Allah Baraqc, i.e. after 555/1160 –1. If so, we must conclude that Armad did notreside very long in Yasc and that he died about ten years after his return, becauseall the different biographical dictionaries agree that his death occurred in 562/1166 –7 {the “first” khalCfa, Baraqc, died in 555, and the “second” khalCfa, Andaqc,died in 552. Köprülü has the latter in mind when he says “ten years”}.31 If wecompare the very few historical documents in our possession to the legendaryaccounts, we must conclude that either the tradition according to which KhwajaArmad lived 125 or more years, or else his historical death date, is mistaken. Ifthe tradition were accepted as correct, this would require advancing his deathdate into the early years of the seventh/thirteenth century, but this would obvi-ously be absurd.The report on Shaikh ‘Alc Lala in { Jamc’s} NafaRAt indicates that ArmadYasawc was a contemporary of the famous Najm al-Dcn Kubra.32 A point onwhich all the historians agree is that Najm al-Dcn Kubra was martyred in 617/1220 during the Mongol invasion.33 Even if this story of contemporaneity wereaccepted as correct, we would still not have to conclude that Armad Yasawc diedaround the end of the sixth/twelfth century or the beginning of the seventh/thirteenth century, because if we consider that Najm al-Dcn Kubra {b. 540/1145}was still young when he met Armad Yasawc, we can easily admit that KhwajaArmad could then have been nearing the end of his life. In this case, however,we would have to conclude that Shaikh ‘Alc Lala lived for almost a century (d. 3Rabc‘ I 642/August 9, 1244). Despite the long lives of most nefcs, when we takeinto account the birth date of Shaikh ‘Alc Lala this story is unacceptable.34 Whenwe consider the fact that, in {lazcnc’s} JawAhir, which has the best record of theYasawc tradition, Shaikh Saif al-Dcn Bakharzc, who was a khalCfa of Najm al-DcnKubra, is also mentioned as a khalCfa of Armad Yasawc, then it appears prob-able that there was some basis to this story in { Jamc’s} NafaRAt and that Shaikh‘Alc, for example, was in a Yasawc tekke – perhaps in Yasc – where the {living}memory of Armad Yasawc had not yet been forgotten. Thus, based on theseextrapolations, I see no reasonable justification for now to reject the report thatArmad Yasawc died in 562/1166 –7.35Yesuf Hamadanc’s learned khalCfa gathered around him thousands of disciplesfrom Turkistan during the years that he lived in Yasc. The general situation atthat time was very conducive to {the spread of } religious and nefc propaganda.Sultan Sanjar, who had united Transoxiana and Khurasan under the samepolitical rule after Malik-Shah, had died (552/1157) and the Khwarazm-Shahshad begun to show signs of creating a large Muslim state. At exactly the sametime, a powerful Islamic movement was developing around Yedi-Su {Semirechy}in the vicinity of Qelcha {Kulja} in Eastern Turkistan.36 During this period,when the shaikhs possessed enormous influence throughout Muslim Asia andtekkes were being built everywhere, Armad Yasawc won fame along the Syr Darya,around Tashkent, and even in the steppes to the north. He gathered around himnot the educated men who had a knowledge of Persian language and literatureand were familiar with Iranian customs, as was the case in Bukhara, Samarqand,"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"THE HISTORICAL LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh63or the cities of Khurasan, but the simple and naive Turks who were newly, butvery strongly, attached to Islam. Consequently, although he knew, of course, theArabic religious sciences and Persian literature quite well, he had to address hisdisciples in a language they could understand. Instead of writing in Persian, likeother nefcs who had lived within the Persian cultural milieu, he used Turkish;and in order to expound the rules of the nefc path to Turkish dervishes who didnot know Arabic and Persian, he wrote moralizing and mystical verses usingthe simple forms derived from Turkish popular literature {this is all speculationbased on no sources whatsoever}.According to tradition, after Armad Yasawc reached the age of sixty-three,he had a chilla-khAne that was three yards deep made to one side of his tekkeand withdrew to it. Unfortunately, we do not know when this took place. Usingmystical language, he recounts at length in many passages in the DCwAn-i Likmathow he withdrew to his chilla-khAne, and the reasons for his seclusion. His life inthis chilla-khAne was probably not as long as was reported, nor did he collectabout him 99,000 disciples as was claimed in the traditional stories. This greatage and large number are simply meant to indicate the wide fame that heenjoyed at that time. Until his death, Khwaja Armad continued to write nefcverses under the heading of Rikmat. In this fashion he expounded to his disciplesthe rules of nefc behavior and discipline, mystical truths, the need for the purifica-tion of the inner self and moral betterment, and religious traditions. He used hisRikmats to explain these things to those who could not read about the primaryreligious sciences in Arabic or Persian. Because Armad Yasawc was a lanafcfaqCh and a scholar of the SharC“a just like his teacher, he continuously welded theUarCqa with the SharC“a. He tried to propagate the idea that neglect of religiousobligations did not accord with the rules of behavior of the UarCqa.37After the sections that he abridges and cites from ‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc’sMaqAmAt, Armad b. Mawlana Jalal al-Dcn Kasanc {Makhdem-i A‘vam} givesthe following information on the khalCfas of Yesuf Hamadanc: “Oh holy ones{azizler}, you should know that his Excellency Khwaja Abe Yesuf38 Hamadanchad four khalCfas. The first was ‘Abd Allah Baraqc who was his immediate successor.His noble tomb is outside the gate of Gülabad {rather, Kalabadh} in Bukhara,on Sheristan hill and near the tomb of his Excellency Khwaja Israq-i Gülabadc.The second was Khwaja lasan Andaqc, who was immersed in the world of ecstaticcontemplation and beatitude. His tomb is also near that of Khwaja Israq. Andaqis a village six parasangs from Bukhara. The third was Khwaja Armad Yasawc.One of his miracles and wonders was that whoever, with sincere intention, hadthe honor of his company would become a saint. In fact, he used to say, ‘Yourintentions are your companions’ {Niyyâtın koldaZın}. He departed from this worldin 512/1118 –19. His blessed tomb is in Turkistan. His sublime dervish conventis enormously prosperous.” It is obvious that the date of 512 given here is acopyist’s error for 562/1166 –7.39As is clear from an examination of the DCwAn-i Likmat and the milieu in whichhis personality was formed, Khwaja Armad Yasawc was a serious, far-sighted,"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE64discerning Turkish nefc {this characterization is Köprülü’s own}. Junaid ofBaghdad said that nefism consisted of “the abandonment of pretensions and con-cealment of accomplishments” {terk-i deâvi ve kitmân-i meâni}. These words applyperfectly to Armad Yasawc. In his works, one finds no hints that might upsetcommon beliefs. The ideas and tendencies of many Iranian nefcs who behavedsomewhat carelessly with regard to the SharC“a are virtually absent from this greatTurkish shaikh. Khwaja Armad was so devoted to the stipulations of the SharC“athat he once exclaimed: “There is no difference between someone who neglectseven one of his prayers and a pig.” In every poem he mentions his sins and asksforgiveness, or he speaks of heaven and hell and nefc legends and concludes byhumbly asking God to forgive his sins. Even when he becomes most absorbedin the philosophy of the unity of God and speaks most often of the stage {maqAm}of {To me with God}, the palace {sarAy} of {death beforedying}, and the sea {deryA} of {obliteration of the self in God}, he doesnot forget the weapon of the SharC“a.40 His ability to attract so many disciples wasnot only due to the great care that he exercised with respect to the SharC“a andthe depth of his knowledge of the religious sciences; it was also aided very muchby his speaking to the people simply and categorically of the principles that hedefended, and addressing them in a language that they more or less understoodand in a form of verse to which they were accustomed. In short, Armad Yasawcprofoundly understood the needs of his milieu and tried to meet them. Thedense fog of legends that still envelops his historical personality is an indicationof the great sanctity in which he has been held in the popular imagination overmany centuries.D His children and grandchildrenBoth a present-day tradition in Yasc and a legend in {lazcnc’s} JawAhir agree thatArmad Yasawi’s son named Ibrahcm died during his father’s lifetime. Accordingto the tradition in Yasc, the khwAja also had a daughter named Gawhar Kheshnasor Gawhar Shahnaz. The lineage of a great many people who, over the centuries,considered themselves to be the descendants of Khwaja Armad Yasawc is tracedto this daughter.41 Even today, many people among both the Eastern and WesternTurks claim that they are descendants of Armad Yasawc.42 Khwaja lasan Naqcbal-Ashraf {Nitharc} of Bukhara says that Shaikh Zakariyya’, a tenth/sixteenth-century notable from Transoxiana who for a while was in the company of ‘AbdAllah Khan, recited poetry from time to time, and lived in Samarqand, was adescendant of Armad Yasawc.43 We find among the Western Turks as one of thedescendants of Armad Yasawc the poet Mevlidji Üsküplü ‘Aua, who wrote awork entitled TuRfat al-“ushshAq in the style of the TajnCsAt of Katibc.44 In addition,the famous eleventh/seventeenth-century Ottoman traveler Evliya Chelebi statesin several places in his book that he too was a descendant of Armad Yasawc.45We learn very clearly from {the Ottoman admiral} Sayyidc ‘Alc Ra’cs’ Mir”Atal-mamAlik that there were found across the great expanse of Asia in the tenth/"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"THE HISTORICAL LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh65sixteenth century a great many nefcs who claimed kinship with Khwaja ArmadYasawc.

Whilepassing through the regions of Sind, Punjab, Afghanistan, Transoxiana, Khurasan,Azerbaijan, and Iran during a long journey that he made in 961– 4/1553 –7, hecame across the following nefcs who claimed to be related to Armad Yasawc:the first was nadr-i ‘flam Shaikh. Baraq Khan, whom Sayyidc ‘Alc Ra’cs met inSamarqand, had this man accompany him as an envoy (Mir”At al-mamAlik{Istanbul,1313/1895– 6}, pp. 65, 72 {new Turkish edn, Mehmet Kiremit (ed.), Mir”âtül-memâlik (Ankara, 1999); English trans.

The second was Baba Shaikh, who was tobe killed by the Circassians while on the way to Astrakhan (ibid., p. 89). Thethird was Shaikh Murammad Dam-tcz b. Khwaja Armad Yasawc, whom hevisited in Gurgan, which he reached after passing through Abhar near Suluaniyyaon the Qazwcn–Baghdad road (ibid., p. 92) {actually the admiral mentions onlyhis grave}. These details indicate how extensively and vigorously Yasawism andYasawc influence had spread in Muslim Asia in the tenth/sixteenth century.After the eleventh/seventeenth century, we only encounter a nefc namedKhwaja lafiv Armad Yasawc Naqshbandc who claimed to be related to ArmadYasawc. According to a statement by the author {Lahawrc} of KhazCnat al-aTfiyA”,this dervish “was a performer of wonders and miracles and a source of illumina-tions and epiphanies.” Separated from his homeland by the hand of fate, hespent time in Arabia, Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, Damascus, Iraq, Anatolia,and Russia, and then went to India and Kashmir where he went into seclusion.He would not meet with anyone. Sometimes, however, he would go to thetekke of Shaikh fgah Mulla Shah. A few years later, Khwaja Nivam al-Dcnb. Mu‘cn al-Dcn recognized his spiritual superiority and entered his service. Withgreat difficulty he convinced him to come to the city with him. After the deathof Nivam al-Dcn, Khwaja Ner al-Dcn Murammad fftab entered his serviceand became his disciple. In this manner, he acquired great fame in the region.This Naqshbandc – or more correctly Yasawc – shaikh, who was a descendantof Armad Yasawc, died in 1114/1702–3 or 1116/1704 –5 and was buried inKashmir.46E His türbe and mosqueThe world conqueror Tcmer, who throughout his life followed an Islamist politicalpolicy aiming to take advantage of the spiritual influence that the khwAjas andshaikhs had over the people,47 who abolished the old yasa {“law,” tribal custom}of Chingiz Khan, and who established a new {religio-political} organizationinspired by Twelver Shc‘ism,48 built the Dilgusha Garden in 799/1396 –7 {inSamarqand} and then headed toward Tashkent.

According to theaccount of Sharaf al-Dcn ‘Al ı ̃ Yazdc, the author of the PafarnAme, he orderedthe construction of a lofty shrine over his grave “out of respect for this greatMuslim who was a descendant of Murammad Ibn al-lanafiyya” and issueda ferman {edict} to this effect.49 This project was placed under the control ofMawlana ‘Abd Allah nadr and it was begun under the architectural direction ofone Khwaja lusain Shcrazc.50 A magnificent building, including a large dome,two minarets, and innumerable anterooms, cells, and cupolas, was completedin two years.51 As required by Tcmer’s orders, the dome and walls of thebuilding were decorated with tiles and the tombstone of the khwAja was madeof marble and embellished with superb carving. Thus both the exterior andinterior of this building were created in a form that was virtually flawless.On each side of the miRrAb were enormous lamps, made in Tcmer’s name in899/1493 – 4 by an artisan from Isfahan.52 There was also inside the shrine53 ahuge cauldron inscribed with verses from the Koran, which apparently wasdonated as a waqf in 801/1398 –9.54 The carvings on the door were of exception-ally fine and elegant detail. After this great building was completed, Tcmerbestowed many gifts and gave many alms to the poor and needy in the city.When these ceremonies were finished, he returned to his army. Accordingto {Schuyler’s} report, this architectural monument was last repaired by ‘AbdAllah Khan.55According to Ujfalvy {Le Syr-Daria}, who made a scientific exploration of thatregion about a half century ago {c.1875}, this shrine was an architectural monu-ment in the full sense. Both Mir-Salikh-Bekchurin and Schuyler indicate that theshrine was not only the principal monument of the city of Turkistan but was alsoan artistic work that could perhaps take its place among the architecturalmasterpieces of the entire world. I feel compelled to cite briefly here the valuableinformation that Schuyler provides on this shrine.The mausoleum is an immense building, crowned by a huge dome, andhaving annexed to the rear another small mosque, with a melon-shapeddome. The front consists of an immense arched portal, at least a hundredfeet high, flanked by two round windowless towers with crenelatedtops . . .

One room answers for a mosque, where the Friday prayersalone are said, while under the small dome at the back of the buildingare the tombs of Ahmed Yasavi and his family;56 and opening out of along corridor full of tombs is a large room with a sacred well. Next tothe tomb of the saint the most interesting monuments are those erectedto a great-granddaughter of Timur, Rabiga-Sultan-Begim, daughter ofthe famous Ulugh-Bek. She was married to Abulkhair-Khan, and diedin 1485. One of her sons lies next to her.The walls of the first room are covered with numbers of inscriptions,chiefly short prayers or verses from the Koran, one of which is said tohave been written by Muhammed Ali Khan of Khokand, who waskilled by the Amir of Bukhara in 1842; and in the middle, standing ona pedestal, there is a large brass vessel like a kettle, which would containat least fifty gallons of water57...In the little enclosure in front of the portal are numerous tombsbearing inscriptions, and in a corner of the large court-yard is a smalland very elegant mosque, with a lemon-shaped cupola, covered withblue tiles. The local legend runs that this was the temporary resting-place of the body of Rabiga-Begim, whose early death caused Timursuch grief that he built the great mosque {shrine}. Unfortunately historyshows that she died some eighty years after him, and it is very doubtfulif he ever saw her.The termination of the great mosque {shrine} called Hazret wasalmost contemporaneous with Timur’s death. The word Hazret, an Arabicword, meaning literally “presence,” is used in the sense of “majesty” forrulers, and with the meaning “sanctity” is frequently applied to saints,especially to those most reverenced, and in this case the celebrity of thesaint has given a name to the town, which is often called “Hazreti-Turkestan,” or even simply “Hazret.”Besides the mosque {shrine} there is little in Turkestan to interestone.

It isthe capital of the district of Turkistan, which constitutes the sixth division of theprovince of the Syr Darya, which was divided into eight divisions in the Tsaristperiod. About a century ago {c.1820}, it had 965 houses and a population of5223 composed of Sarts {rather Uzbeks} and Qazaqs. The city’s ruined fortressand its only monument, the Jami‘-i laqrat, which is in the middle of the fortress,are visible. Ascending to a high point on this building, one is greeted by a verypicturesque landscape. First, the dilapidated Sart city spreads round about withits dirty tangled streets and gloomy houses. Among the confused mass of streetsand buildings, the ruins of the old palace of the Khan and the Russian churchstand out. Then, beyond the limits of the city and past the well tended arablefields lie the town of hqan and other Qazaq villages and in the distance the snow-capped peaks of the Karatau range. This part of Asia, in fact, is covered withruins. The fortresses that served to defend the fords of the Syr Darya have longbeen abandoned and mounds are scattered about the plain. South of Yasc areUtrar, where Tcmer died, and Savran {actually northwest of Yasc}, each ofwhich is nothing but a heap of ruins.59After belonging to various dynasties of Asia at different times, Yasc becamefor a while the capital of the Qazaqs60 and finally in 1864 it was taken by theRussians. The walls of Jami‘-i laqrat still bear marks of the terrible Russianartillery bombardment.61 Nevertheless, thanks to the mosque and to KhwajaArmad Yasawc who lies beneath its dome, this small city still retains its sacredcharacter among all the Eastern and Northern Turks. Over the centuries, notonly have a great many rulers visited it but poets have also never stoppedpraising its holiness.62 Even today, throngs of people come from various placesin Turkistan to visit {i.e. make a pilgrimage to} the tomb of the khwAja. Thistomb is visited continuously, but once a year on 10 Dhe ’l-lijja {‘hd al-aqha},the nefcs withdraw into seclusion with extraordinary ceremonies.63 Up to recentyears, 5000 – 6000 people used to gather there solely for this purpose.64 Visitingthe tomb of Armad Yasawc, whose legends and miracles are related in popularworks among the Northern Turks and throughout the steppes, and about whommany eulogies and hymns are sung,65 is considered in that region to be of greatermerit than making the pilgrimage to Mecca.The khwAja’s greatest influence is over the people of the steppe. Throughout thisarea, one finds numerous legends, as well as tombs of the khwAja’s disciples, whichtestify to this influence. For example, the name of the town of Awliya Ata, whichHoworth claims to be identical with the old city of oaraz, was taken from thebyname of a nefc named Qarakhan, who was a descendant of Armad Yasawc.Histürbe, which is a ruined building made simply of bricks, has given its name to theentire town. Also, according to a local tradition, the great türbe of Asa Bibi, a kins-woman of Qarakhan, is next to the road ten miles west of the town of AwliyaAta.66"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE70According to the report of a Russian traveler, if a rich Qirghiz or Qazaqbelonging to the Great or Middle horde dies in the winter, he is not immediatelyburied.

As soon as spring arrives, his corpse is taken to Yasc andburied near the tomb of Qara Armad – their name for Armad Yasawc.67Indeed,the rich, while still alive, buy a plot of land near the türbe and place feathers onit, and when they die they are buried there.68 Qazaqs who do not have childrengo to the shrine and sacrifice sheep to the spirit of the khwAja next to the greatcauldron.69 All of these reports show that this early influential leader of Turkishnefism in the Syr Darya region and throughout Central Asia has still maintainedover the centuries his legendary greatness in all its former glory.70NOTES1{lazcnc,} JawAhir, p. 49. This account is found only in this book. All other sourcesstate that the khwAja was born in Yasc. Nevertheless, it would not be wrong to preferthis work to the other sources, which all transmit the same material, because itcontains the most plausible accounts of the khwAja and was written by a Yasawcdervish who was most familiar with the Yasawc tradition. There are a number ofother historical reasons for preferring this narrative. According to tradition, Sairamhad long been an important Islamic center and its inhabitants were divided into threeclans (uruX), i.e. three divisions: the Shah clan, who traced their descent to the earlyTajik shahs; the Amcr clan, who traced their descent to the early amCrs and mCrzAs{princes}; and the Khwaja clan, who were the descendants of ‘Alc. Naturally, thisthird uruX, who were related to the family of the Prophet, were held in greater esteemthan the others. This tradition, which has been current among the people of Sairamup to recent times, considers all the khwAjas to be descendants of Imam MurammadIbn al-lanafiyya (Mulla Mesa b. Mulla ‘hsa Sairamc, Ta”rCkh-i amaniyya [Kazan, 1905],p. 286). {This is a rather garbled version of local Sairamc tradition.} Indeed, theauthor of this history traces his own genealogy from Kamal al-Dcn Bab Shaikh, whosedescent from the Prophet was confirmed in a yarlıX {edict} given by ‘Abd Allah Khanin 945/1538 –9 to Imam Murammad Ibn al-lanafiyya in the following manner:Kamal al-Dcn Bab, Sayyid Ibrahcm Bab, Sayyid ‘Abd al-Jabbar Bab, Sayyid ‘Abdal-Karcm Bab, ‘Abd al-Majcd Bab, ‘Abd al-Wuded Bab, ‘Abd al-‘Azcz Bab, Arslan Bab,Ilyas Bab, Marmed Bab, Iftikhar Bab, ‘Uthman Bab, ‘Umar Bab, Isma‘cl Bab, IsraqBab, ‘Abd al-Karcm Bab, ‘Abd al-Jalcl Bab, ‘Abd al-Rarcm Bab, ‘Abd al-RarmanBab, ‘Abd al-Jabbar Bab, ‘Abd al-Fattar Bab, Imam Murammad Ibn al-lanafiyya;ibid. If we compare this genealogy with that of Armad Yasawc mentioned above, wefind a very close similarity. Ilyas Bab was Armad Yasawc’s grandfather. Thus itappears that Arslan Bab Ibn Ilyas Bab, who was the grandfather of Kamal al-DcnBab, was the brother of Shaikh Ibrahcm, Armad Yasawc’s father. The fact that therewere others in Sairam who claimed that they were descendants of Murammad Ibnal-lanafiyya – or, rather, that there were enough of them to constitute a clan – fullycorroborates the birth of Armad Yasawc in Sairam.

In the note above,Köprülü states that “all other sources” affirm Armad Yasawc’s birth in Yasc. This isnot quite true. In so stating, Köprülü ignores the fact that the earliest sources (theRashaRAt and Nawa’c) say this, and he goes on to defend lazcnc’s account on the basisof a nineteenth-century source by a native of Sairam!

Also according totradition, Arslan Baba took upon himself his education in the fifth/eleventh century.{Köprülü never seriously grapples with the date of Armad Yasawc’s death. This issueis more complicated than he suggests. Indeed, there is little reason to give credenceto the notion that Armad Yasawc died in 562. The invocation here of “tradition” asa source for this death date or for his “training” by Arslan Baba makes no sense; thefirst comes from a specific source, while the second is based on a source that nevergives any kind of date.}4{lazcnc,} JawAhir, p. 66. When speaking of his father’s tomb, Armad Yasawc givesit the name Aq-türbet (DCwAn-i Likmat, p. 33). {Note: this same account ofArmad Yasawc’s family is presented in the previous chapter from the same sourceas “legendary.”}5Ibid., pp. 48 –9. I mentioned above that Bektashc tradition also presents Armad Yasawcas a descendant of Murammad Ibn al-lanafiyya. No such detailed genealogy isfound, however, in any other source. {Armad Yasawc’s descent from MurammadIbn al-lanafiyya is attested, for example, in Sharaf al-Dcn ‘Alc Yazdc’s work from theearly fifteenth century; and a full genealogy appears already in the Turkic work ofIsraq Khwaja b. Isma‘cl Ata from the fourteenth century.} Yet there are some thingsthat corroborate this in a number of verses in the published version of the DCwAn-iLikmat, which was written by Yasawc dervishes in different periods based on earlytradition, on his belonging to the lineage of laidar (DCwAn-i Likmat, p. 267), and onIsraq Baba and Shaikh Ibrahcm (ibid., p. 270). It is not particularly difficult to investigatethe origin of these legends. Even today there are several legends in Turkistan abouthow some of the descendants of ‘Alc, and especially those related to Ja‘far al-nadiqand Murammad Ibn al-lanafiyya, went as far as that region. Mulla Mesa of Sairamstates that Ja‘far al-nadiq had a place of pilgrimage in Khotan; that Imam ‘Abdal-Rarman ‘Alawc, who was renowned under the name Bauual Ghazc and was buriedin Aqsu, was the fourth grandson {removed} of Murammad Ibn al-lanafiyya;that the tomb of Alp-Ata the sixteenth grandson {removed} of Murammad Ibnal-lanafiyya was in Turfan; that the tomb of Baba Qanbar Walc, ‘Alc’s master of thehorse {mirahor}, was in Kecha; that those of a number of imAms were in Ush-Turfan;"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE72and even that there was a tradition in the latter place that ‘Alc had visited it ({MullaMesa,} Ta”rCkh-i amaniyya, pp. 316 –19, 358). There are a great many legends similarto these in other places in Turkistan. Needless to say, they have no historical value.{On the narrative of Islamization focused on Israq Bab, an ancestor of ArmadYasawc, see DeWeese, “Yasavian Legends on the Islamization of Turkistan,” in DenisSinor (ed.), Studies in Altaic Civilization III (Bloomington, IN, 1990), pp. 1–19, and Safïad-Din Orïn Qoylaqï, “Nasab-nama”, ed.

At a formertime it was the capital of the Özbek khanate. Khwaja Armad, who was a Naqshbandcshaikh, got his byname from this city} (published version {apparently Istanbul, 1145/1732}, p. 367). Armad Vefik Pasha, under the rubric “Turkistan” in his Lehce-i osmânî{2nd edn (Istanbul, 1306/1890)}, says Semerkand Zimâlinde sâbıkâ Kazaklar”ın Zehri, Nesâ”,Ahmed Nesâ”î makâmı, türbet-i hazret {formerly the city of the Qazaqs north of Samarqand,Nasa’, the tomb of Armad Nasa’c, the türbe of the exalted one}, thus confusing Nasa’with Yasc. Similarly, Yasc appears as Nasa’ in the published edition of {Mcrkhwand,}RawQat al-TafA (vol. 6, p. 126). The reason for this is that the authors, or those whocopied them, confused these two names. Katib Chelebi mentions two Nasa’s, anupper Nasa’ and a lower Nasa’, in Farghana, and another, a third, in Khurasan andsays that the last one was famous (JihAn-numA, p. 357). A great many “ulamA”, in fact,came from this Nasa’ in Khurasan. Yaqet mentions four more cities with this name(Mu“jam al-buldAn, Chapter 8, pp. 282–3); Barbier de Meynard, Dictionnaire géographique,p. 564). The French Orientalist Louis Dubeux, while discussing Yasc, reports that ithad previously been called oaraz (Tartarie {Béloutchistan, Boutan et Népal} [Paris, 1848],p. 113), which is totally mistaken, however. This old historic city {oaraz}, which wasvery well known to both Chinese travelers and historians and to the Arabs, indeed,even to the Byzantine ambassador Zemarchus, had long had great importance becauseit was at a pass at the junction of two major trade routes between Iran and Turan.The {sixth-century} Byzantine historian, Menander Protektor, who cited the embassyof Zemarchus, called this city “Talas.” The Chinese traveler Hsüan Tsang called it“Ta-lu-si” and some Chinese historians called it “Ta-la-za.” The Arabs called it“oaraz.” According to H. Howorth, it is none other than the present-day Awliya Ata(History of the Mongols [London, 1880 – 8], vol. 2, part 1, Chapter 4, n.1 {i.e. part 2,division 2, pp. 284 –7}. Virtually all the information on this city is collected here{Howorth}. Chavannes, Documents, p. 238). It is clear from all of this that oaraz,which had been known since the sixth century ce, is completely different from Yasc.Detailed information is given on these cities in Chapter 5, p. 154, n.28.7 See Chapter 4, p. 92 for information on the historical existence of Arslan Baba and onhis family.8 After Bukhara passed into the hands of the non-Muslim Qara Khiuay, the influence ofthese Tadrs continued, however, in a different form.

Calmard et al.).}9 An important treatise entitled MaqAmAt-i YEsuf HamadAnC, attributed to Khwaja ‘Abdal-Khaliq Ghujduwanc {appended to larcrc-Zade’s TibyAn-i wasA”il al-RaqA”iq, IbrahimAxa MS 432 in the Fatih Library in the Süleymaniye in Istanbul}, states clearly thateleven people – Ghujduwanc among them – went with Khwaja Yesuf from Hamadanto Samarqand; also that Yesuf Hamadanc went to Samarqand at the direction ofKhaqir; and that while he was residing at Maralla-i Khesh, Khwaja lasan Andaqcand Khwaja Armad Yasawc arrived and nine months later were joined by Khwaja‘Abd Allah Baraqc. But {Murammad Parsa’s} FaTl al-khiUAb, and also {nafc’s} RashaRAtand { Jamc’s} NafaRAt, which cite it, report that ‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc becamean adherent of Khwaja Yesuf in Bukhara – indeed, that Armad Yasawc also becamean adherent of him there (FaTl al-khiUAb, MS in the {Istanbul} University Library).Still, Imam {‘Abd Allah b. As‘ad} al-Yafi‘c’s history {Mir’At al-janAn wa ‘ibrat al-yaqzanfC ma“rifat RawAdith al-zamAn (Hyderabad, 1337–9/1918 –21, and Beirut, 1984)} andal-Sam‘anc’s al-AnsAb specify that Khwaja Yesuf had previously resided in Baghdad,Isfahan, Bukhara, and Samarqand for the purpose of learning LadCth, and if we takeinto consideration contemporary dervish life, the possibility that he could also havebeen in those places later cannot be completely ruled out. In any case, the story inthe MaqAmAt is not implausible enough to be rejected outright or be regarded as afabrication. {Wilfred Madelung, in his “Yesuf al-Hamadanc and the Naq⁄bandiyya,”Quaderni di Studi Arabi, 5 – 6 (1987–8), 499 –509, highlights the discrepancies betweenthe early and reliable biographical tradition about Hamadanc, on the one hand, andthe version of his biography incorporated into Naqshbandc tradition, on the other.Köprülü himself already noted the discrepancies, but he did not explore them indepth, and was unable to get out from under the assumption that Armad Yasawc wasa disciple of the historical Yesuf Hamadanc. In any case, Madelung’s study demolishesthe synthetic view of Hamadanc accepted in nearly all secondary literature, includingKöprülü.}10 {Yaqet,} Mu“jam al-buldAn, vol. 2, p. 302. This lineage was taken from there. IbnKhallikan says that he did not know the meaning of the name Wahara at the end ofthis genealogical chain {WafayAt, ‘Abbas edn, vol. 7, p. 80}.11 On Yesuf Hamadanc, Ibn Khallikan made use of al-Sam‘anc’s al-AnsAb and Ibnal-Najjar’s Ta“rCkh BaghdAd ({Wafayat,} vol. 2, pp. 464 –5 {‘Abbas edn, vol. 7, pp. 78 –81}). {See EI2, s.v. “Ibn al-Nadjdjar” (C.

KhwajaMurammad Parsa’s verbatim account of this matter is as follows:{Mawlana Sharaf al-Milla wa ‘l-Dcn al-‘Aqclc al-Antarc al-Bukharc, may God rest hissoul, one of the great “ulamA”, of the dynasty of the Khwajagan (Naqshbandiyya), has"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE74written in his own hand that Shaikh Yesuf Hamadanc, may God sanctify his soul, waseighteen years old when he went to Baghdad.

Nevertheless, Ibn Khallikan, whose information is credible given the sourceson which he relied, indicates that he went to Baghdad after 460/1067–8 {WafayAt,‘Abbas edn, vol. 7, p. 78}. Taking this into consideration, we would have to admitthat Yesuf Hamadanc probably went to Baghdad after age twenty. {Again, seeMadelung, “Yesuf al-Hamadanc.” On the Khwajagan, see EI2, Supplement, s.v.“Khwadjagan” (Th.

The same source also states that Baghsher was betweenHerat and Marw al-Red (see Mu“jam, vol. 2, and Barbier de Meynard, Dictionnairegéographique).15 {nafc,} RashaRAt, {Turkish} trans. p. 13. {The RashaRAt’s identification of Ibn al-Najjaras one of Yesuf Hamadanc’s disciples is an example of garbled transmission.

There are some treatisesbelonging to ‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc in the Esad Efendi Library {in theSüleymaniye in Istanbul}, MS 3702, but despite all my efforts it was not possible tosee them. Perhaps the original of the MaqAmAt-i YEsuf HamadAnC is there. I have carriedout considerable research to determine if this treatise is a complete fabrication or if itis really a work by ‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc and has some historical value. Thereare, in fact, clear contradictions between the information provided by this treatise andthe reports in al-Sam‘anc and other sources. For example, Khwaja Yesuf ’s lineage, ina wholly fictitious manner, is traced to Abe lancfa. Then, not only is his birth dateerroneous but we also find, for example, a report to the effect that he never cursedChingiz Khan, whereas Chingiz Khan appeared only after the death of the khwAja. Inaddition, there are a number of exaggerations, such as “that he made the pilgrimageto Mecca 32 times on foot, that he made 10,000 complete recitations of the Koran,that he memorized 700 books of fiqh, tafsCr {exegesis, especially Koranic} and kalAm{scholastic theology}, and that he converted 8000 idolaters to Islam.” For a murCd whobelieved in his shaikh, however, these exaggerations were of no consequence. A numberof things like this, which cast doubt on the {historical} reliability of the treatise,may have been introduced through the process of copying and recopying over thecenturies, or could have been added by a later copyist for various reasons. If we takeinto consideration how much the “dynasty” (sulAla) of the Khwajagan {Naqshbandiyya}was in demand and respected in Central Asia at the time of the rulers who weredescendants of Chingiz Khan, then we could readily grant that any dervish could addsuch things in order to curry favor with the ruler. Otherwise, the information that‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc gives in his own biography and the descriptions that hegives of the khalCfas of the khwAja, their actions and character, conform exactly to theother sources and complement them in an exceptional manner. If this treatise hadbeen completely fabricated, then its author would be someone so unfamiliar withchronology as to consider Chingiz Khan a contemporary or predecessor of KhwajaYesuf Hamadanc, and he would not have known that period of history and thekhwAja’s spiritual personage so completely and accurately, and so would have filled thistreatise with a bunch of wild legends. In light of all these observations, we canconclude that this treatise, which portrays Yesuf Hamadanc in such a manner, waswritten by ‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc, but that the version that has come down to uswas corrupted and altered as it was copied and recopied [on Ghujduwanc and theMaqAmAt-i YEsuf HamadAnC, see YA, s.v. “Gucduvânî” (Kasım Kufralı), {cf. EI2, s.v.“Ghudjduwanc” (S. Naficy)}].In the rich and truly valuable library of Baxdadlı Vehbî Efendi {in the SüleymaniyeLibrary in Istanbul}, there is a RisAla-i bAburiyya by Armad b. Jalal al-Dcn al-Kasanc{known as Makhdem-i A‘vam, d. 1542–3, see EIr, s.v. “Armad Kvajagc” ( J. Fletcher)}on nefc rules and another treatise on Yesuf Hamadanc. {These two works are boundtogether. The latter is ascribed to Makhdem-i A‘vam and stands as sixteenth-centuryevidence for the circulation of a work similar to the MaqAmAt of Hamadanc ascribed toGhujduwanc.} As the author clearly states, part of this treatise was abbreviated from‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc’s MaqAmAt-i YEsuf HamadAnC. At the end of it, there israther abundant information on the khalCfas of Yesuf Hamadanc and on the chains ofauthority of Baha’ al-Dcn Naqshband and Sa‘d al-Dcn al-Kashgharc. The first partof this treatise, equivalent to an abridged version of one section of the copy of theMaqAmAt that I have studied, indicates that this work was not fabricated, but that ithad been current among the Naqshbandc dervishes for centuries. There is nothing soincongruous here as the issue of Chingiz Khan as to undermine one’s confidence inthe text. Clearly, such details as this were added by various people as the treatise"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE76passed from hand to hand. It is stated in this work too, however, that Yesuf Hamadancdied in Samarqand in 505/1111–12. The year 505 could well be a mistake for 535/1140 –1. As for his death in Samarqand, this contradicts Ibn Khallikan. Nevertheless,these details show that the work attributed to ‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc cannot besimply rejected. The author {al-Kasanc} of the treatise says, “Although Khwaja {‘UbaidAllah} Arrar had a great many khalCfas, the last of whom was Armad b. Jalal al-Dcnal-Kasanc, the real khalCfa of khalCfas was his {the latter’s} own murshid MawlanaMurammad al-Qaqc and this man was buried at the feet of Khwaja Arrar.” Thistreatise, which was apparently copied in India in 1184/1770 –1, includes the followingbiographical note on the author: “The shaikh of shaikhs, his excellency Shaikh Burhanal-Dcn Qılıch was a companion of Shaikh Abe ’l-Qasim Gurganc and Khwaja YesufHamadanc. He died in 490 {1096 –7}. His excellency my father used to say ‘My sonhas become an adherent of his excellency Shaikh Burhan al-Dcn Qılıch and they willcall his son Qılıchlıx Ata.’ If this shaikh looked at a withered tree, it would turn green.If he saw someone deviating from the path of the SharC“a, one look from him wouldbehead him. He was very awe inspiring and quick tempered.” {This detail confirmsthe identity of the treatise that Köprülü saw with a treatise, ascribed to Makhdem-iA‘vam (who was a descendant of “Qılıch Ata”), found in some, but not all, collectionsof Makhdem-i A‘vam’s treatises. In some collections it is called the RisAla-i “ilmiyya.}{On the problems with the MaqAmAt, see Madelung, “Yesuf al-Hamadanc” andDeWeese’s forthcoming analysis. A version of this work was published by Sa‘cd Nafcscas “Risalah-i taribiyah,” Farhang-i HrAn-zamCn, 1/1 (1332/1953), 70 –101. This workcannot be by Ghujduwanc. It survives in fuller manuscript versions and is paralleledby another set of traditions about Ghujduwanc and Hamadanc that probably reflectcommunal splits in the early Khwajaganc tradition. It cannot be used at face value asa source on Hamadanc. The dates mentioned in the work (and the supposed letterfrom Sanjar mentioned below) are also completely unreliable. It is worthy of notethat the text credits Hamadanc with going on holy war and converting unbelieversto Islam. Depending on the version, they are identified as “Jete” or “Toqmaq,” whichare fourteenth and fifteenth-century terms for Mongol groups, or as Russians, whichis evidence of the late date of the text.}21 It is also mentioned in the MaqAmAt that Yesuf did not do the dhikr aloud and, indeed,that at that time there was no audible dhikr. Somewhat different information is givenon this, however, in the translation of {nafc’s} RashaRAt. See Chapter 4, p. 101.22 Malik Shah’s son Sultan Sanjar was appointed governor of Khurasan by Barkyareqwho had taken possession of the entire sultanate on the death of his brother Marmedin 487/1094 and then became involved in the fighting between him and their otherbrother Murammad. From the death of Barkyareq in 498/1105 to the death ofMurammad in 511/1118, he ruled Khurasan independently. According to the afore-said story, his sending a letter to Khwaja Yesuf Hamadanc thus occurred during thistime. From Sanjar’s attitude toward al-Ghazalc {see below, n.28}, we can supposethat he would certainly have had a great interest in legal and mystical questions andin particular that he would want to learn about the lifestyle of a shaikh famous for hisgreat devotion to the sunna of the Prophet. We learn from a very amusing and cleverepisode that Dawlat-Shah cites from Nuwar al-aqAlCm {not further identified} howcontemptuous Sanjar was of Shc‘c beliefs (Dawlat-Shah, Tadhkira, p. 66).23 {Ghujduwanc,} MaqAmAt-i YEsuf HamadAnC. According to this account, Khwaja Yesufmust have died in Samarqand. Other sources, however, are unanimous in giving amuch different report. To be sure, even in the MaqAmAt, it is not explicitly stated thathis death occurred in Samarqand; rather, this can only be inferred from the context.{More tellingly, the MaqAmAt insists he was buried in Samarqand, while YesufHamadanc’s shrine in Marw is well known.}"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE HISTORICAL LIFE OF AlMAD YASAWh7724 Among these khalCfas, Armad Yasawc and ‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc in particularwon great fame. The first two khalCfas did not become very famous.25 In his FaTl al-khiUAb, for example, Murammad Parsa cites him frequently and usesphrases that express deep respect for him. Al-Sam‘anc {al-AnsAb} also says that he wasa well known traditionist {muRaddith}.26 Shaikh Najcb al-Dcn Shcrazc states that he came across some of the khwAja’s works andthat the khwAja appeared in one of his dreams and told him that these works, the nameof the author of which was not clear, belonged to him ({ Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish}trans., p. 410). {The subject of the story mentioned here from Jamc’s NafaRAt actuallyrefers to himself (in the dream) as Abe Yesuf, not Yesuf Hamadanc.}27 An Arabic work by Yesuf Hamadanc under the title Nahj al-asrAr wa ma‘dan al-anwAr fCmanAqib li-sAdAt al-akhyAr min al-mashAyikh al-abrAr is mentioned with the number 4340 inthe catalogue of the Ayasofya Library, but this work is nothing but Ner al-Dcn ‘AlcIbn al-Jawzc’s KitAb-i Bahjat al-asrAr wa ma‘dan al-anwAr, which describes the legends of‘Abd al-Qadir Jclanc. {A nefc work entitled Kashf al-asrAr is ascribed to Yesuf Hamadanc,but apparently it has not survived.}28 Because both the Qarakhanids and Seljuks were simple Muslims, they showed greatrespect to the “ulamA” and nefcs. The members of these two dynasties were extremein their support of Sunnism – downright fanatic, in fact. Nevertheless, the Shc‘c move-ment, which had already appeared in Khurasan in the Samanid period, was secretlypresent in Transoxiana. The “ulamA” in Bukhara, which was the most important centerof Sunnism in Transoxiana, fought continuously against Shc‘ism. In 436/1044 –5, agreat Shc‘c movement broke out in Transoxiana. Bughra Khan crushed it by massacr-ing the Isma‘clcs (Ibn al-Athcr, {al-KAmil,} vol. 8, p. 180). In any case, according tothe information provided by Barthold, we can say that in the fifth/eleventh and sixth/twelfth centuries the rulers of Transoxiana and the Tadrs of Bukhara were ferventlanafcs. In this regard, see Chapter 1, p. 15, n.17 (Barthold, Turkestan). Nivamal-Mulk clearly shows what a fanatical Sunnc Alp Arslan was (SiyAsatnAme, sections 21and 42). We also know very well how Sultan Sanjar dealt with al-Ghazalc for a whileover an accusation of Mu‘tazilism ({Mehmed} [erefeddin {Yaltkaya}, “Sencerve Gazzâlî,” {Darülfünûn Ylâhiyat Fakültesi Mecmuası, 1 (1341/1925), 39 –57}). Recentresearch on the subject of the madhhabs in the Seljuk period has corroborated all this([erefeddin, “Selçukiler devrinde mezâhib,” {TM, 1 (1925), 101– 8}).29 {Ghujduwanc’s} MaqAmAt, {nafc’s} RashaRAt, { Jamc’s} NafaRAt, and all the otherbiographical dictionaries that rely on them are unanimous on this point.30 It is certain that Armad Yasawc became shaikh in Bukhara, probably after the deathof Yesuf ’s first khalCfa, i.e. after 555/1160 –1 (on the date of the death of ‘Abd AllahBaraqc, see {Lahawrc,} KhazCnat al-aTfiyA’, vol. 1, p. 531), because it is evident that boththe first and second khalCfas were in Bukhara and both were buried in Bukhara nearthe tomb of Shaikh Abe Israq Gülabadc ({nafc,} RashaRAt, {Turkish} trans., pp. 13 –14). {Köprülü is apparently not bothered by the fact that Lahawrc (whose dates aremostly worthless) has Baraqc, the first khalCfa, dying in 555, but Andaqc, the secondkhalCfa, dying in 552. The accounts of the succession to Hamadanc all affirm thatsuccession came upon the death of the prior successor (until Armad Yasawc broke thepractice). Hence the curious death dates of Baraqc and Andaqc. On Armad Yasawc’sabdication of leadership to Ghujduwanc, see DeWeese, “The MashA”ikh-i Turk and theKhojagAn: Rethinking the Links between the Yasavc and Naqshbandc Sufi Traditions,”Journal of Islamic Studies, 7 (1996), 180 –207. Here DeWeese shows that the depiction ofArmad Yasawc handing his disciples off to Ghujduwanc is clearly a story contrived tofavor the Khwajagan and Naqshbanidyya in competition with the Yasawiyya, etc.}31 Mawlana Ghulam Surer Lahawrc, a religious scholar from India {i.e. Lahore inmodern Pakistan}, describes the Naqshbandc silsila, cited from {nafc’s} RashaRAt, in his"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE78famous biographical dictionary of saints called KhazCnat al-aTfiyA”, and while doing soprovides information on Armad Yasawc. As an addendum, he mentions the followingchronogram of his death, which is equivalent to 562/1166–7 (KhazCnat, p. 532),{The Shaikh Armad, by divine grace, went to Paradise in the party of MurammadThe divine luminary became visible: the year that pious saint diedAnd Armad, revealer of Truth, add the numbers and say: “Armad saint ofParadise”(the letters in = 562).

First, absolutely no one can state his own death date inhis own dCwAn! Second, not only does the existing tradition indicate that ArmadYasawc probably lived more than sixty-three years, but his poetry proves it.It is obvious that Melioransky did not understand that “entering the earth” in the line“ol sebepden altmıZüçte kirdim yirge” {for that reason at age sixty-three I entered the earth}meant “withdrawing from the tumult of the world,” i.e. “entering the chilla-khAne,”and thus he interpreted it to mean death. {Köprülü actually pictures Armad Yasawc“entering the earth” at age sixty-three and continuing to write there. It did not occurto him that perhaps some later devotee of Armad Yasawc wrote the verse aboutentering the earth as a reflection of the traditions about him.}32NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., pp. 492– 4. Shaikh Raqc ’l-Dcn ‘Alc Lala was in ArmadYasawc’s tekke in Turkistan. One day a man came from Khwarazm. Shaikh Lala wasin a cell doing his religious retreat {khalwa}. Shaikh Armad asked the man “Is therea dervish occupied with guiding people on the mystical way in Khwarazm?” The mananswered, “A new young man has come. He is guiding people on the mystical wayand has attracted a great many murCds.” Armad Yasawc asked his name. The mansaid, “Najm al-Dcn Kubra.” Shaikh ‘Alc Lala had once seen Najm al-Dcn Kubra in adream and, interpreting this to mean that he {Najm al-Dcn} would guide him {‘AlcLala} on the mystical way, had searched for him for years. As soon as he heard hisname during his retreat, he leapt up and girt his loins for a journey. Because it waswinter, Khwaja Armad advised him to wait. But the exuberant dervish could not waitanother day. He immediately went to Khwarazm and joined the service of Najmal-Dcn (p. 493). {Köprülü did not know that Jamc took this story from a much earliersource, the Chihil majlis of Amcr Iqbal Scstanc, a collection of sayings he compiled fromhis master, ‘Ala’ al-Dawla Simnanc, and dates from c.1325.

Köprülü’s insistencethat he was a Yasawc underscores his confusion about (or blurring of ) the distinctionbetween silsila and natural descent. He does so because he adopted the version of theYasawc silsila preserved in the RashaRAt and thus repeated in general Naqshbandcworks, and by the time he wrote there was no Yasawiyya as such.}47 All the historians who have done research on Tcmer – including Léon Cahun,although we cannot consider him to be a true historian – agree on this (Léon Cahun,Introduction à l’histoire de l’Asie, les Turcs et les Mongoles, [Paris, 1896], p. 471). {Köprülü’sdescription of Tcmer’s “Islamist policy” and Shc‘c leanings was unfounded.

There are quite a few who believe that those who visit these two tombs willacquire more merit than that obtained from going on the pilgrimage to Mecca. Theymake visiting the khwAja’s tomb the top priority for those who visit such tombs.

The article from ShErA, signed by acertain “T,” recounts a visit to Armad Yasawc’s shrine in January 1914. The listing ofgraves comes as the caretaker – who belonged to the social/familial group known askhwAjas (who claimed descent from Yasawc’s daughter, see DeWeese, “The Politics ofSacred Lineages”), hence perhaps Köprülü’s confusion over who was encouraging thevisitation of these shrines – was identifying particular graves. The “Bu” in thesephrases simply means “this,” in the sense of “here lies.”}57 There was water in this vessel “for the the use of the persons who live in the mosque{i.e. shrine} and the pilgrims and students who come there.

Baipakov (ed)., GorodaTurkestana: Sbornik nauchnykh statei (Almaty, 1999), pp. 9 –29.} In the ZDMG, 51 (1897),Vambéry has an article on the legends of Tcmer ({“Eine legendäre Geschichte"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE84Timurs,”} pp. 215 –32) that includes the text and translation of a Persian historicaldocument entitled{Account of the campaign of His majesty the narib-qiran into the Qipchaq Steppeagainst Toqtamish Khan}. This document, which was apparently written in 1192/1788 at the time of Abe ’l-Ghazc Bahadur Khan, is of much more legendary thanhistorical value. {The text cited here from Vambéry’s article in ZDMG comes from awork known as the KunEz al-a“Vam, compiled by a certain ‘Abd al-Rarman Scrat in theearly eighteenth century.

Indeed, I have mentioned above, while describing the feelings of respect thatTcmer had for Armad Yasawc, certain legends and legendary works {of this kind}.We find one of these legends, which derived from the fact that Tcmer had a türbe builtfor Armad Yasawc, at the beginning of this document that Vambéry published.

According to Mir-Salikh-Bekchurin’saccount, the Shaikh al-Islam, who saw that the shrine was in ruins, ascended theminaret with great difficulty and waved the white flag to the Russians, and in this waythe most beautiful monument in the region of the Syr Darya was saved from completeruin (Ujfalvy, Le Syr-Daria, p. 18). The current state of the shrine, however, is one ofutter ruin. In recent times several attempts have been made to raise funds to repair it,but nothing has come of this ({“Khalwa” in} the journal ShErA, March 1914, p. 145).The Russian committee that has been preoccupied with research on Central and EastAsia sent N.

Beforethe city was conquered by the Russians, the Khan of Khokand used to send 500 goldcoins (tıla) every year to help to cover the expenses of the mosque. In addition, thosewho visited the mosque always gave some {monetary} assistance to its employees anddistributed the sacrificial animals that they slaughtered to the poor (Howorth, Historyof the Mongols, vol. 2, cited from Turkistan). Mir-Salikh-Bekchurin also says that thismosque was managed by waq fs.

Although most of them havebeen forgotten among the thousands of complex events in life, the memory ofsome of them who had strong personalities has survived until today and theYasawc silsila has continued with them. It would be useful, therefore, to reviewthe most famous of these first khalCfas and those with whom the Yasawc silsila wasmaintained until around the end of the tenth/sixteenth century.Khwaja Armad Yasawc’s first khalCfa, to whom an important and prominentplace was given in {Yasawc} tradition, was Manter Ata, the son of Arslan Baba.Manter Ata was succeeded by his son ‘Abd al-Malik Ata, who was replaced byhis son Taj-Khwaja, who in turn was the father of the famous Zangc Ata.1 Thesecond khalCfa, about whom we have little information, was Sa‘cd Ata ofKhwarazm, who died in 615/1218 –19.2 As for the third khalCfa, Sulaiman lakcmAta, not only do we know that he uttered “wisdom-filled and moral-pointinganecdotes about the conditions of the dervishes in the Turkish language” {derviZlerahvâlinden Türkî dilde kelimât-i hikmet-âmiz ve latâif-i ibret-engîzleri}, but we also possessdetailed information about his deeds and khalCfas. Based on this, we can showthat Sulaiman lakcm Ata was the most well known khalCfa of Armad Yasawcamong the Turks. lakcm Ata lived in Khwarazm providing spiritual guidance tothe people in that region. Although he died before the other khalCfas of ArmadYasawc, he remained a source of spiritual authority for a rather long timeand gathered about him most of the disciples who were attached to the UarCqa.According to tradition, his wife, ‘Anbar Ana, was the daughter of the rulerBughra Khan.3 According to another story, he died in 582/1186 –74 and wasburied in Aq Qerghan.5We know of the legend of lakcm Ata because it circulated among the NorthernTurks for centuries in a book of legends with the title LakCm Ata menkabesi{i.e. The legend of lakcm Ata}.6 lakcm Ata’s original name was Sulaiman.When he was a boy, he used to go to school holding the Koran in his hand outof respect and would not dangle it on his neck like the other boys. When he left"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE90school, he used to turn his face to the school and his back to his home. One day,while sitting at the threshold of his masjid {mosque}, Khwaja Armad Yasawcobserved this behavior and it pleased him. With the consent of the boy’s motherand his teacher, Armad Yasawc took him into his service and instructed him inthe Koran. After reaching age fifteen, Sulaiman became a disciple of the khwAja.One day Khaqir, peace be upon him, came to visit the khwAja who sent the boysout to fetch some firewood in order to cook dinner. While they were returningwith the firewood, a terrible rainstorm began and all the wood got wet. Only thewood that Sulaiman had brought was dry because he had taken off his clothesand used them to wrap it. Thanks to this, they were able to ignite the otherwood. Khaqir, peace be upon him, asked Sulaiman how he had kept his wooddry and Sulaiman told what he had done. Khaqir was very pleased with this andsaid to the boy, “Henceforth may your name be lakcm {wise}!” He then placedsome of his blessed saliva in Sulaiman’s mouth and the boy’s heart was filledwith light. Khaqir then said, “Come on! Don’t stop! Show your spiritual power!”At that moment, lakcm Ata began to recite some wisdom quatrains {Rikmats}and other verses {manVEmas}.7One day in the month of sacrifice {Dhe ‘l-lijja}, 99,000 shaikhs were presentin the tekke of Khwaja Armad Yasawc. The khwAja acted as the prayer leader{imAm} and they began to pray. At his right was lakcm Ata and at his left wasnefc Murammad Danishmend. During the prayer, a noise emerged from thekhwAja. The congregation said, “The imAm has broken wind” and abandoned theprayer because it was not ritually acceptable. The khwAja, however, paid noattention. He continued the prayer. Without hesitation, lakcm Ata followedsuit. nefc Murammad took his cue from lakcm Ata and also continued. Finally,after all greetings were finished {following the prayer}, the khwAja said, “I didthis on purpose to see what level you had reached in your religious training.That sound did not emerge from me. It came from a piece of wood that I hadinserted at my waist. It is apparent that I have one disciple who has reachedperfection and one who has come half way to perfection. The others are allignoramuses.” He then gave lakcm Ata an order saying, “Tomorrow just beforedawn a camel will come to you. Mount it and wherever it stops that will be theplace where you will dismount.”8The next morning just before dawn, lakcm Ata mounted the camel thatappeared and gave it free rein. The camel headed out of Turkistan {i.e. Yasc}toward the east. Just west of the city of Khurasan, it came to a place calledBc-nawa Arkası {Behind the Beggar} and stopped. They tried with all their might,but the camel would not budge. It only brayed. For this reason, they called thatplace Baqirghan {“It brayed”}.9 When the camel stopped, lakcm Ata dismounted.This was a place where Bughra Khan’s herd of horses grazed. The horse herderswanted to drive him away from there. “I am a dervish. I won’t go anywhere,” hesaid. They then attacked him with the sticks that they used to herd the horses.lakcm Ata gave an order to the trees that were there, saying, “Hold them!” Thetrees seized three of them tightly, while two others fled and reported to Bughra"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"THE KHALHFAS AND OARHQA91Khan what had happened. The Khan was very pleased with these events andsaid, “For three days I have been getting whiffs of the odor of erens. This meansthat an er {saint} has appeared in our country.” He sent someone named ‘AbdAllah nadr to ascertain the matter. ‘Abd Allah nadr asked the dervish who hewas and what he wanted, and learned that he was lakcm Sulaiman, a Yasawcdisciple. When he realized why the herdsmen were left in the trees, a voice camefrom the trees, saying, “This is what happens to those who act like this.” Con-vinced of the sublimity of this dervish, ‘Abd Allah then returned to inform theKhan.10 In order to conciliate the dervish, Bughra Khan gave him one of hisvery beautiful daughters named ‘Anbar and also sent him many camels, sheep,and horses. lakcm Ata accepted all of these things and made his residence at theplace called Baqirghan. Bughra Khan and all his viziers became his disciples andfollowers. lakcm Ata’s fame spread in all directions.lakcm Ata had three children by ‘Anbar: Murammad Khwaja, AtgharKhwaja, and lubbc Khwaja. When the first two had grown up, they were sentto Khwarazm to study with a very famous religious scholar {“Alim} named Jarullah‘Allama Shaikh. They performed many miracles there and attracted hundreds ofdisciples.11 As for the youngest, lubbc Khwaja, every day he would ride aboutthe mountains and plains on horseback hunting deer and would bring them tohis father. lakcm Ata had no idea what a high level of spirituality his youngestson had attained.One day, by a strange turn of events, he learned of this fact. lakcm Ata hada disciple named Shaikh Sa‘at from the town of oaradckan () {rather,oura, so far unidentified} in the province of Juneq {rather, Khcvaq or Khcva}.lakcm Ata summoned him and he immediately came running. A little laterhe also summoned lubbc Khwaja. He was a bit late and, as usual, brought hisfather a deer. The boy’s late arrival annoyed his father. Perceiving this, lubbcKhwaja explained the reason for his delay, saying “Two ships in the ocean weresinking and requested my help. I am late because I was busy with them.” Hisfather did not believe this. “If you don’t believe me,” his son continued, “inexactly five months they will bring 10,000 gold pieces here as a token of gratitude.Then you will see.” And truly it happened that way. All the men who broughtthe money became disciples of lubbc Khwaja. lakcm Ata now began to under-stand his son’s high degree {of spirituality}.Again, one day his son posed the following question: “I see that you alwaysperform here recommended acts {sunna} of the ritual prayer, but where do youperform its obligatory acts {farQ}?” In response to this question, his father saidthat he performed the obligatory part at the Ka‘ba. “Very well,” he said, “butit is a lot of trouble to go that far. Can’t you bring the Ka‘ba here?” lakcm Ataconfessed that he did not have that much power. The next day, however, he wassuddenly shocked to find that his son had brought the Ka‘ba to Baqirghan andhe became somewhat jealous. Now, two saints certainly cannot occupy the singleofficial position of the shaikh in a nefc order {post}. One day lakcm Ata assembledhis disciples. They sacrificed nine oxen12 and held dhikrs and samA“s {nefc séance"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE92with music}. Everyone was summoned except lubbc Khwaja. Meanwhile, hereturned from the hunt with the deer he had caught. When he saw that everyonehad been summoned but no word had been sent to him, he was upset and askedhis father the reason for this. By means of a miracle, he then brought back to lifethe oxen that had been slaughtered. All the people who witnessed this becamehis followers. Consequently, his father called him and said that the two of themcould not remain together in the same place.13 lubbc Khwaja understood themeaning of these words very well and said to his father, “You stay!” He went outand bade farewell to his mother. He put on his burial shroud and stood in themiddle of his cell. He told his mother not to weep for him but to try to please hisfather. He pulled in his head, and disappeared except for his shroud, whichremained in the cell. His father and mother wept profusely over this. lakcm Atarecited many Rikmats about his grief for his son.lakcm Ata’s behavior toward his son required divine punishment. It wasrevealed to him that if lubbc Khwaja had lived, sixty saints would haveappeared among his descendants. Because they were prevented from cominginto the world, as an atonement, water would flow over him for forty years, andonly in this way would he be cleansed of his sin. And in fact this is whathappened. After his death, the Amu Darya flooded the city of Baqirghan, andwater flowed for forty years over lakcm Ata’s türbe. Then the water receded, butno one knew what had become of his türbe. Finally, by the spiritual direction oflakcm Ata, someone named Khwaja Jalal al-Dcn found his grave and erected atall building over it. People flocked to visit it from all directions.14The best known of lakcm Ata’s many khalCfas was Zangc Ata. When he was inTashkent, he learned of his shaikh’s death and immediately went to Khwarazmto visit his tomb and offer his condolences to his family. Because he was adescendant of the Arab Arslan Baba, he was an ugly man with black skin {Arabcan mean “African,” “black”}. After the canonically prescribed waiting periodfor an engagement had ended {to see if she were pregnant}, he asked for thewidow ‘Anbar Ana as a result of the spiritual direction of her deceased husband.‘Anbar Ana was very loath to remarry, but finally, as a result of one of ZangcAta’s miracles, she was compelled to give her consent.15Zangc Ata was a thick-lipped negro {zanjC} cattle herder in the mountains ofTashkent. He used to support himself and his family with the meager wages hereceived from the people of Tashkent for herding their cows. Because he spenthis life in the countryside, he would do his prayers on the plains or in the valleys.Afterwards, he would begin a loud dhikr. According to tradition, whenever he didthis, all the cattle would stop grazing, form a circle around him, and listen. Oneday, Zangc Ata collected a huge pile of thorny brush from among the thicketsin the mountains and was tying it with a rope in order to take it home. At thatmoment, four young men appeared before him. They greeted him and heacknowledged their greeting and asked where they had come from and wherethey were going. {They replied that} while studying in a madrasa in Bukhara,they resolved to follow the path of God and were now searching for a shaikh"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE KHALHFAS AND OARHQA93who could give them guidance. “Wait a bit!” said Zangc Ata. “Let me sniff in thefour directions. Wherever I perceive the fragrance of the perfect guide, I willinform you.” The youths waited with pleasure. Zangc Ata turned his face to thefour directions and sniffed. At last he said, “No one but me is capable of makingyou reach perfection.”These four youths who had come from Bukhara in search of a shaikh wereUzun lasan Ata, Sayyid Ata, nadr Ata, and Badr Ata. They eventually becameZangc Ata’s four great khalCfas. Uzun lasan and nadr were the first of the four tobecome his followers based on his promise. For this reason, they were the first toreach the level of perfection. Sayyid Armad,16 because he had some educationand came from a respected family, found it rather strange that a black cowherdwould undertake to guide him. This conceit, however, only blocked his path,and his efforts proved fruitless. Finally, he implored ‘Anbar Ana to intervenewith Zangc Ata on his behalf in this matter. ‘Anbar Ana promised to help him,saying, “Tonight wrap yourself in a black felt and wait by Zangc Ata’s path. Justbefore dawn, when he goes out to relieve himself, he will see you in this con-dition and pity you!” Indeed, that night, this very kind-hearted woman asked herhusband why Sayyid Armad had not received his favor and said that he wasworthy of it. Zangc Ata smiled and explained that when Sayyid Armad first sawhim, it had awakened conceit in his heart. He added that, as a result of ‘AnbarAta’s intercession, he would forgive his original fault. The next morning justbefore dawn, when Zangc Ata went outside, he saw a black object lying in hispath. When he touched it with his foot in order to discover what it was, SayyidArmad prostrated himself at the shaikh’s foot and begged forgiveness. Inresponse to this, Zangc Ata treated Sayyid Armad with such favor that everythingthat he wished for was revealed to him at that moment.17As for nadr Ata and Badr Ata, who were the third and forth khalCfas of ZangcAta, their names were nadr al-Dcn Murammad and Badr al-Dcn Murammad.When they were in Bukhara, they lived in the same cell, studied the samelessons, and never left each other’s company. After becoming a disciple of ZangcAta, nadr al-Dcn’s level {of spirituality} rose. In contrast to this, that of Badral-Dcn continuously declined. Finally, grieved by this, Badr al-Dcn went to ‘AnbarAna weeping profusely and explained his dilemma. When her husband was in alight-hearted mood, she described Badr al-Dcn’s anxiety to him. Zangc Ata laughedand said, “When he first met me, Badr al-Dcn said to himself that this negro withcamel lips was claiming too much. That is the reason he has not yet been able toattain enlightenment. But since you have intervened, I have forgiven this fault ofhis.” Afterwards, in fact, there was no difference in the progress of the spiritualtraining of these two friends.18The tomb of this famous Turkish shaikh, whose memory was sung for centuriesby the nefc poets of Central Asia,19 is eight miles from Tashkent on the Samarqandroad.20 Khwaja ‘Ubaid Allah Arrar, the great and renowned nefc of CentralAsia, held Zangc Ata in very high regard and used to say that whenever hevisited his tomb he would hear the cry of “Allah Allah” from within.21"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE94The Yasawiyya spiritual chain traces back above all to the two disciples ofZangc Ata, Sayyid Ata and nadr Ata. After receiving his shaikh’s forgiveness,with the intervention of ‘Anbar Ana, Sayyid Ata made great spiritual progressand had many debates with his contemporary Khwaja ‘Azczan.22 The mostfamous khalCfa of Sayyid Ata, many of whose miracles are mentioned in thebooks of legends, was Isma‘cl Ata from leziyya.23 A pure Turk, Isma‘ cl Ata paidno attention to the attacks on him by the mullas and would not give up his dutyas a spiritual guide.24 One day, however, while passing in front of the tomb ofKhwaja Murammad al-Namc, the ancestor of Khwaja ‘Ubaid Allah ArrarTashkandc, he said, “Rotten straw is good for nothing,” alluding to the factthat Murammad al-Namc had died long ago and therefore could no longer haveany influence. Suddenly a piece of straw came through the air and struck himin the eye. As a result, he lost the eye.25 Nevertheless, Khwaja ‘Ubaid Allahalways spoke highly of him. As for Isma‘cl Ata’s son Israq Khwaja, he spent arather long time in Isfcjab26 providing the people with guidance. Some of theexploits of this shaikh, who gained fame among the Turks, were firmly provenand famous.27 Khwaja Baha’ al-Dcn Naqshband appeared shortly after him,but the Yasawc spiritual chain maintained its fame with the original khalCfas ofnadr Ata.Another khalCfa of nadr Ata was Ayman Baba, whose khalCfa was Shaikh ‘Alc,whose khalCfa was Mawded Shaikh. The latter’s two leading khalCfas were alsofamous: Kamal Shaikh and Khadim Shaikh. Kamal was a contemporary ofKhwaja ‘Ubaid Allah Arrar. Khadim already had many disciples in Tashkentand Transoxiana when the khwAja appeared on the scene and subsequently hadan audience with him. The author {nafc} of the RashaRAt reports a number ofsacred words of this shaikh cited from Khadim Shaikh’s khalCfa Jamal al-DcnBukharc.28 According to {larcrc-Zade’s} TibyAn-i wasA”il, the Yasawc chain ofauthorities that derived from Khadim Shaikh was as follows:29 Khadim Shaikh,Shaikh Jamal al-Dcn Bukharc, Shaikh Khudaidad ‘Azczagc, Mawlana Keh-iZarrc (Keh-i Zarc), Shaikh Garmcnc, Murammad Mu’min Samarqandc, Shaikhfkhend, and Mulla Khurd ‘Azczan. The same source records the chain ofauthorities from Kamal Shaikh as follows: Kamal Shaikh hqanc, Shaikh ‘Alcyabadc,Shaikh Shams Özkendc, Abdal Shaikh, Shaikh ‘Abd al-Wasi‘, and Shaikh ‘Abdal-Muhaimin who was alive in Tashkent in 974/1566 –7. lazcnc, however, givesa rather different chain than this from Zangc Ata.30B Yasaw¢ rules of behaviorLike all UarCqas, the Yasawiyya had a number of rules. The fundamental principlesof these rules did not differ from those of the other nefc paths, but they had theirown special features that are worthy of study. The basic number of rules thata disciple who entered the Yasawiyya UarCqa was required to observe can bereduced to ten {these ten are actually listed by lazcnc}. (1) He must not recognizeanyone as superior to his shaikh and must submit to him unconditionally. Spending"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"THE KHALHFAS AND OARHQA95the days eating all sorts of food and the nights sleeping in the presence of theGuide cannot close the doors to esoteric spiritual knowledge. But a dervish wholeft his shaikh, {even though he} fasted and stayed awake to his own satisfac-tion, and carried on naked and weeping, would have the door to progress closed.(2) The disciple should be intelligent and perceptive and be able to understandthe shaikh’s allusions {rumEz} and directions {ishArAt}. (3) He must submit to andobey all words and actions of the shaikh. (4) In all service to the shaikh, heshould not be lazy but be quick and nimble, so that he may obtain his approval,because the approval of the shaikh is tantamount to the approval of God.

(9) He should keep in mind all the shaikh’s sugges-tions, admonitions, and counsels and never neglect them or try to circumventthem.

If necessary, in order to meet the shaikh’s needs, he shouldbe willing to sell himself as a slave.31The principles of the fortified city {shahristAn} of the UarCqa are six: knowledgeof God, absolute generosity, true honesty, absorption in certainty, trust in Godpending bestowal of spiritual or material possessions, and critical meditation.The pillars of being a shaikh and role model are also six: knowledge of the truefaith, true manifest forbearance, praiseworthy patience, sublime contentment,Abrahamic sincerity, and bountiful nearness.32 The duties of the UarCqa are alsosix: seeking the Possessor of Perfection and approaching the Possessor of Glory,longing for union with the Everlasting, fearing the imperishable King day andnight, being hopefully expectant under all conditions, mentioning continually{God’s name}, and contemplating union with the transcendent everliving God.The customary practices of the UarCqa again are six: congregational prayer,staying awake until just before dawn {seherlerde uyanıklık}, maintaining a state ofspiritual purity, {seeking} the presence of God, invoking God, and obedience tothe righteous and to the guides.33 Laudable {but not required} actions are alsosix: to look after a guest cheerfully and with pleasure, to accept a guest just as heis, no matter how long a guest remains to regard this as a Godsend, to extendhospitality, to try to do whatever a guest wishes, and to pray for Armad Yasawcand the shaikh. The rules of the UarCqa are also six: to fall to one’s knees and sitin a humble, well behaved manner, to see oneself as inferior to all others, to seeeveryone else as superior to oneself, to know all the shaikhs and saints34 and toremain quiet in their presence, not to speak without permission in the sessionsof the shaikhs, and to keep in one’s memory the saintly {velAyet} secrets andmiraculous signs of one’s own shaikh and other shaikhs.35"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE96According to Khwaja Armad Yasawc, the passing {murEr} of the novices{s. mubtadi”}, the rise {TudEr} of those of middle range {s. mutawassiU}, and theappearance {VuhEr} of those who have reached the goal {s. muntahC} are dependentupon four conditions. The first is place. The second is time. The third is thebrethren {of the order}. And the fourth is attachment to the ruler.36 In order forthe devotees to be free from distraction and to be preoccupied with litanies{awrAd}, it is necessary first of all for the place to be flourishing. In order forthere to be no boredom37 among the {religious} students and ordinary people,which could result in idleness and neglect {of duties}, it is necessary to beprotected from the disturbances {s. “AriQa} of the time. In order for the requiredardent yearning to be present at all spiritual levels {maqAmAt}, in the khalwa{retirement for devotions}, and in the forty-day periods of penitence, one needstrue brethren who are seekers of poverty {faqr, i.e. the dervish life} and pass-ing away {fanA”, see glossary}.38 Finally, it is also necessary to be attached tothe ruler, for control by the ruling authorities assures the privileges of thosewho possess spiritual knowledge.39 According to the Yasawcs, the ultimate goal{muntahA} for devotees and the final stage of all strivers {s. mujAhid} is the road ofpoverty. lazcnc describes the hardships of this road in the following manner:Fakr yolunda lâ yu“ad velâ yuhsâ seferler olur.

These stages and levels of the wilderness of povertyand passing away, which is awful and wondrous, are impossible andinconceivable to traverse without a guide. If one does not traverse them,it is impossible to understand (true) poverty.}40According to Armad Yasawc, a true nefc must become accustomed to asceticismand striving {for union with God}. He must distance himself from the comfort ofeating and drinking, from khalwa,41 sexual desire, and carousing. Abandoning thepomp of this world, he should make it a practice to turn toward God and tomeditate, so he may become a genuine nefc. For this reason, three different{forms of } asceticism and striving are stipulated for the followers of the YasawcUarCqa. According to them, if voluntary fasting is done for three days, dust anddarkness will be lifted from the inner self; if done for five days, the divine secrets{mughayyabAt} of the jinns and the good spirits will be subdued {i.e. made obedient};if done for six days, the springs of the heart’s seas will open and begin to flow; ifdone for nine days, it results in the revealing of hearts {qulEb} and the uncover-ing of tombs {qubEr}. But all these ascetic practices and strivings must be donewith the permission and approval of the shaikh. If not, they are of no use.Indeed, they will cause harm.42In the JawAhir, there are more descriptions of the Yasawiyya that provide detailsabout its procedures and rules. These are very important in demonstrating thecharacteristics of the UarCqa. We can relate their general outline as follows. In theYasawc UarCqa, it is the custom, while offering greetings in every encounter, toplace the back of the left hand on the ground and to cup the right hand behindone’s back. The dervish places his left foot on the ground and, also placing theleft side of his face on the ground, extends his right foot, heel first, like a sheep tobe sacrificed. With humility and contrition, he describes his faults with a hundredgriefs in the presence of the nefc master {pCr}. Finally, the master says AllAhu akbarand thus makes his devotee, who has taken the form of a sacrificial sheep, reachthe state of “death before dying.” In like manner, according to the SharC“a, it isprophetic custom {sunna} for a superior to initiate the greeting to an inferior,and not vice versa. If his excellency the pCr does not state his faults, he increasesthe number of sacrificial {kurban} takbCrs {to say “God is most great”} as ananswer. The dervish, thanking the pCr for the favor of pronouncing the takbCr,must withdraw with his left hand and depart, while again asking forgiveness forhis faults. If there is something in his hand, he makes an entreaty and presents it.If nothing is present in his hand, it suffices to make an entreaty. In order to openthe way to esoteric knowledge, he must ask for forgiveness for his faults and inthis manner his entreaty before the guide results in nearness to God. The guide’sprayer in response to his entreaty is acceptable. As long as the nefc devotee doesnot dwell at the door of faults and entreaty and is not upright, the door ofacceptance and the gate of nearness to God are closed to him and his wish willnot be fulfilled. It is as Armad Yasawc said, “Prayer opens the way.”"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE98The dervish should spend the night in prayer by reading the short sEras {chap-ters of the Koran}, because not everyone is able to read the long sEras. Afterdoing night vigil prayers of sixteen rak“as {bending of the torso while uprightfollowed by two prostrations} with special rules, he should recite the tamjCd prayer{spelled out in the Okuyucu edn, fo. 126a, as } twiceand the fivefold prayer {} threetimes. After this, istighfAr AllAh {i.e. the prayer astaghfiru”llAh “I ask God’s forgive-ness”} is said 101 times in a sad voice and with humility and anguish, and {Sufficient for me is my glorious Lord; there isnothing in my heart but God} is recited five times, and the istighfAr is recited fivetimes, and the kalima-i istighfAr is recited three times, and the kalima-i JalAl isrecited 101 times in a loud strong voice. Then he is occupied with the dhikr-i arra{of the saw, see below}. This dhikr must also be performed forcefully and vigorouslyso that the dervish breaks into a sweat. As the nefcs have confirmed, only in thisway can the ritual impurity of the UarCqa be cleansed. Then, the length of thenight permitting, the sEras YAsCn, al-Muzzammil, SErat al-A“lA, alam nashraR {= SEratal-SharR}, innA anzalnA {= SErat al-Qadr}, and li ClAf Quraish {= SErat Quraish} arechanted. Just before dawn, a silent fervent prayer to God, done sorrowfully andwith weeping, is accepted by Him. After the dawn prayer, subRAn AllAh is repeatedtwenty-five times, al-Ramdu li”llAh is repeated twenty-five times, lA ilAha illA “llAhis repeated twenty-five times, and AllAhu akbar is repeated twenty-five times. Thegreat name of God {ism-i JalAl} is recalled 101 times and the dhikr-i arra iscontinued with love, passion, and enthusiasm, for the dhikr-i arra leads to theannihilation and passing away, and to poverty and eternal union with God{baqA”}. Then one reaches a state of pleasurable meditation and chants the YAsCn{sEra} with full reverence. Then one asks God’s forgiveness. The FAtiRa is recitedfor the spirits of the shaikhs and the ancestors. Then one shakes hands witheveryone in the gathering {majlis}.According to the interpretation of a noble tradition {LadCth-i sharCf} whichwas handed down from laqrat-i Anas {b. Malik}, “Whoever does the morningprayer with the congregation, then sits to perform the dhikr until sunrise, andthen does two rak“as, he receives a reward equal to that of a pilgrimage and a fullminor pilgrimage {to Mecca, “umra}.” For this reason, after the tasbCR {sayingsubRAn AllAh}, tahlCl {saying lA ilAha illA “llAh}, qirA”at {reading the Koran}, khatm{complete reading of the Koran}, prayer, and greeting each other, a two-rak“amorning {ishrAq} prayer is done with complete supplication and humility.

After reciting the prayers, istighfAr AllAh is said seventy-one times and thegreat name {of God} is said 101 times with modesty and humility and then onebegins the dhikr-i arra {on this, see section D below}. In the evening at nightfall,one prays and beseeches God while recalling the darkness and solitude of thegrave. After each of the five daily prayers, the five well known sEras that are theobligation of the superiors {waVCfa-i buzurgAn} must be chanted. If this is notfeasible, one FAtiRa, one Fyat al-kursC and three IkhlAT sEras must be recited. This isto receive God’s mercy and forgiveness for one’s sins. It is meritorious to fast onMondays that coincide with the birthday of the Prophet. It is also meritorious tofast on Thursdays, which is the day on which people’s deeds are presentedbefore God for judgement.43CKhalwa {retirement for religious devotions}Khalwa has a special significance in the Yasawiyya UarCqa and has its own specialrules. According to Khwaja Armad Yasawc, a number of subtle meanings arefound in the letters in the word khalwa: khA” derives from khAlC {empty, devoid ofeverything}, lAm from lail {night}, wAw from wuTla {union with God}, and tA”{i.e. hA” as tA” marbEUa} from hidAya {guidance}. {A similar, but not identical,explanation of the letters in this word is found in the LamaRAt.} During thekhalwa, pleasures pertaining to the senses and to satan are burnt away anddisappear. Fire and light appear from divine ecstacies. The gloom and otherafflictions of humanity are removed. The layers of the inner self are illuminatedand cleansed and many {other forms of } divine favor {faiQ} like this are acquired.There are two khalwas. One is the canonical {SharC“a} khalwa and the other isthe mystical {UarCqa} khalwa. Without the canonical khalwa, the mystical is imposs-ible. The canonical khalwa is based on complete repentance for all actions thatcan be considered shameful, all inauspicious words and all other faults and sins.If this is not done, the devotee of the UarCqa is not worthy of its khalwa. Furthermore,the fast must be done in a manner in which the limbs and sensory organs areguarded and preserved from the things that are canonically forbidden. The earlygreat nefcs had a number of views about the UarCqa khalwa {in the Okuyucu edn,p. 22, “about khalwa and arba“Cn”} and various principles and rules were establishedaccording to these views.44 Only the perfect spiritual guide can determine howthe devotee who will do the khalwa should behave during this period in accord-ance with the devotee’s nature. Otherwise, harm is bound to occur.lazcnc describes the traditional forms and ceremonies of the khalwa in theYasawc UarCqa in the following manner. One day beforehand, with the consent oftheir guide, the devotees must fast to purify themselves for the khalwa. After themorning prayer on the eve of the khalwa, they repeatedly say subRAn AllAh and lAilAha illA “llAh and recite the dhikr-i mulaqqin {in the Okuyucu edn, p. 33, “mulaqqan”}and wird-i murakhkhaT. After pronouncing the dhikr AllAh, they stand in line and, ina loud voice, say AllAhu akbar eight times in the direction of Mecca. The purposeof this is to ask for succor and victory from God at the beginning of the war to be"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE100waged against the army of carnal desires. After the afternoon prayer on the daybefore the khalwa, the holes, doors, and chimneys of the place of worship and thekhalwa cell are closed so that no wind or cold may spoil the training {sulEk, but inthe Okuyucu edn, p. 34, RarAra = heat, adding “and so that they may progress ontheir path} of the disciples who are going to begin the khalwa. Then, until thesun sets, while imploring God and shedding tears, the disciples devote themselvesto the awrAd {litanies}, istighfAr and dhikrs, which have been authorized andordered for this. After the evening {sunset} prayer, they wash hands {in prepara-tion} for a meal. Whoever is serving brings hot water in a jug for breaking thefast. The fast is broken with it and then no additional water is brought. Afterwards,khalwa soup is provided, made from black millet {kara darı} that sprouted thanksto the miracles of Armad Yasawc. If this cannot be found, red millet can be used.The soup is served to everyone individually. The purpose of this is to ensure thata situation does not arise in which someone does not participate and thus fails toattain divine favor. Then, in order to counteract the heat, a bit of watermelon orsome ayran {a cool drink made of yogurt and water} may be served. After eating,a sEra or a number of verses of the Koran are chanted. Standing in line, they saythree takbCrs in a loud voice. Then all are seated and occupied with invokingGod’s name {dhikr AllAh} with reverence and respect until midnight. During thistime, hymns of the Yasawc shaikhs, called Rikmat, are read solemnly and in aninspirational manner{telkînlerle} in order to encourage and excite the dervishes.45After this, they go to another place to have their heads shaved. When the razorand whetstone are ready, another three takbCrs are recited. After shaving, theyline up in the khalwa cell and give three takbCrs to the four directions, beginningwith the direction of Mecca. When this is finished, they form a circle and beginthe dhikr. This continues until the candles go out. When this occurs, several hoursare spent resting “in order to remove hardship and repel fatigue.” During thisperiod, many veils are lifted and divine lights are uncovered. With permission,the dervishes recount their dreams to the shaikh and solicit his interpretation. Ifthe dream is auspicious, they perform supplication; if inauspicious, they admitfault, and thus the dream is annulled and made auspicious, by the grace of God.If supplication and admission of fault are delayed or neglected, this is evidence ofa lack of progress and decline.In this manner, day and night, the khalwa and arba“Cn are completed. Withpermission, kitchen servants are the first to leave the khalwa cell and they slaughtersacrificial animals. It is the custom not to give the blood of these animals to dogs,but to bury it and preserve the bones.46 The esophagi of the slaughtered animalsare roasted and given to the participants in the khalwa along with cold water orayran. No one spends that night in the khalwa cell. The dervishes rest in thehouses of the other friends and nefcs. Then they gather for the morning prayerand chant religious formulas. They pray that their khalwa be acceptable {khairyAd misread for khair bAd in Okuyucu edn, p. 35} with three takbCrs and makesupplication. Then all disperse to their homes with tranquil hearts. This then isthe character and form of the khalwa that is very famous in the Yasawc UarCqa.47"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE KHALHFAS AND OARHQA101DDhikr-i arraOne of the features of the Yasawc UarCqa and of the Turkish nefcs whose religioustraining was traced to Khwaja Armad Yasawc is a dhikr known as dhikr-i arra {i.e.of the saw}. They gave it this name because the sound that emerges from thelarynx of one performing the dhikr resembles the sound of a bucksaw. One day,according to legend, Khaqir came to have a chat with Armad Yasawc. He hadalways found the khwAja to be cheerful and light hearted, but on that day he sawthat he was distressed and worried. With surprise and astonishment he askedthe reason for this, saying, “Having attained these lofty states and stages {ofspirituality}, what is the cause of your affliction?” Armad Yasawc gave this reply:“Sorrow has seized the hearts of the companions and dervishes. I am grievedand distressed because I see no way to remove it.” Khaqir then began to mentionthe name of God {dhikr AllAh} saying, “Ah, ah!” The anxiety disappeared andthis dhikr, by his command, became a litany {wird} throughout the silsila. This,therefore, according to legend, was the basis and nature of the dhikr-i arra in theYasawc UarCqa and how it entered the Yasawiyya.48 The Yasawc UarCqa is, in fact,from the Jahriyya {i.e. those who recite the dhikr aloud}.49There are a number of stories about the effect and spiritual power of thedhikr-i arra. {For example,} Shaikh Marmed Khalwatc Zawranc, a disciple ofthe Turkistanc Shaikh Mawded, was once near Khwaja ‘Ubaid Allah in one ofthe districts of Samarqand. Because the loudness of his public instruction and theclamor of his dhikr-i arra clashed with Khwaja {‘Ubaid Allah} Arrar’s meditationand silent dhikr, Arrar wrote a letter specifically asking him to abandon thispractice. As soon as Shaikh Marmed received this letter, he kissed it and placedit to his head. Heaving a heart-burning sigh, he began such a dhikr-i arra andloud public instruction that the man who had brought the letter and the otherpartisans of silence were overcome with dread and amazement. Khwaja Arrarwas offended by this and tried to change Marmed’s mind by spending the nightin prayer and seeking divine guidance in dreams. He was not, however, able toaccomplish anything. Finally, he revealed his greatness by admitting that Marmedwas not defeated but, rather, was victorious. They met and had a friendly dis-cussion and a strong friendship developed between them.50As described in detail in {nafc’s} RashaRAt, Kamal Shaikh, one of the leadingkhalCfas of Mawded Shaikh, used to live in the region of Shash {Tashkent}.Khwaja ‘Ubaid Allah Arrar, when he went to Tashkent from Khurasan,frequently met with him. One day in Tashkent, Kamal Shaikh visited Khwaja‘Ubaid Allah, who asked that he perform a dhikr-i arra for him. Kamal Shaikh, inagreement with his disciples, performed the dhikr forcefully seven or eight times.‘Ubaid Allah then said, “Enough! It has infected my heart with suffering.” Hethus acknowledged the powerful spiritual effect of this dhikr.51On this type of dhikr, which was also called dhikr-i minshArC {saw-like}, ShaikhMurammad Ghawth {Gwaliyarc, d. 1562} gives the following information. Forthe dhikr-i minshArC, one must put his two hands on his two thighs and exhale"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE102toward the navel saying “Ha!” Then, he prolongs this by causing the breath {tobe squeezed} from below the navel, and as his head, waist, and back comeparallel, he must say “Hay!” forcefully and then repeat all of this. Just as acarpenter makes a sound when he draws a bucksaw over wood, the personperforming the dhikr, in order to get his heart in the right condition and toattain ease, must draw the dhikr over the tablet of the heart {lawR-i qalb}. Someshaikhs perform the dhikr-i minshArC by saying “Hu! Hay!” Others perform it bysaying “Allah!” As is known to those who acquire it, the benefits of this dhikrare beyond calculation.52 The description that Shaikh Salim b. Armad ShaikhanBa-‘alawc-c laqramc gives of the performance of the dhikr-i minshArC is clearer andmore detailed:The dhikr-i minshArC is performed in five manners. In each one, theperson doing the dhikr presses a little on his belly and draws his breathupward from below his navel. Then, relaxing his belly a little, he extendshis breath toward his navel and exhales. This aspect {of the dhikr} isvery much like a carpenter sawing back and forth with a bucksaw on apiece of wood. In the first of the five manners, the person doing thedhikr sits on his knees, places his hands on his thighs, begins to draw hisbreath from his navel toward his palate, and says “Ha!” Then, extend-ing his breath toward his navel, he forcefully exhales downwards insuch a way that his head, waist, and back are parallel and says “Hay!”These cries actually resemble the sound that a carpenter makes whenhe pushes and pulls the bucksaw over a piece of wood. “Ha!” pointsto Fyat-i nafs and “Hay!” points to FyAt-i AfAk {allusion to Koran 41:53,i.e. one signals the signs of God within oneself, and the other the signsof God outside oneself “on the horizons”}, or the reverse. This aspectin the first is according to the victory of necessity over possibility or inthe second according to the victory of possibility over necessity. In thesecond manner, the person says “Hu!” while drawing his breath and“Hay!” while exhaling downward. Or, in both instances {in and out},he says “Allah!” In the third manner, he says “Allah!” while drawing hisbreath and “Hu!” while exhaling downward. In the fourth manner, hesays “Hay!” in both instances. In the fifth manner, he also says dA”im,qA”im, RAQir, nAVir, and shAhid in both cases. The benefits of this dhikr aremany. It was handed down from Zacharia, peace be upon him.53Eºar≠qas originating from A£mad Yasaw¢With respect to the pedigree of the religious order {sülûk silsilesi}, the mostimportant UarCqas connected with Armad Yasawc are two: the Naqshbandiyyaand the Bektashiyya. In addition, there are a few small branches that also origi-nated from Armad Yasawc, such as the hqaniyya, but they cannot be consideredas truly separate UarCqas. In each of the major UarCqas a number of minor branches"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE KHALHFAS AND OARHQA103also sprang up, but they did not depart from their basic features. Many suchbranches cannot yet even be properly identified.54The Naqshbandiyya is considered to be traced back to Armad Yasawcbecause the pCr of this UarCqa, Murammad b. Murammad al-Bukharc, known asKhwaja Baha’ al-Dcn Naqshband {d. 1389}, spent some time with QuthamShaikh and Khalcl Ata, both Yasawc shaikhs, and was enlightened by them. Inhis youth, Khwaja Baha’ al-Dcn was instructed by Amcr Sayyid Kalal to join thecompany of Qutham Shaikh and he spent more than two or three months withhim. Then Qutham Shaikh bestowed an honor on him, saying, “I have ninesons. You are the tenth and are preferred to all of them!” After this, whenQutham Shaikh went from Nakhshab to Bukhara, the khwAja paid him extra-ordinary respect.55Khwaja Baha’ al-Dcn has a second connection with the Yasawiyya because bewas also initiated into this order by the Yasawc shaikh Khalcl Ata. He personallydescribes his discussions with him in the following manner:In my youth, I had a dream in which lakcm Ata commended me to acertain dervish. I had a pious grandmother to whom I related mydream. She explained it {by saying} that I would be initiated into adervish order by a Turkish shaikh. One day in the Bukhara market, Iencountered the dervish whom I had seen in my dream, but I was notable to meet with him. That evening someone came to my house andhe told me that that dervish, whose name was Dervish Khalcl, wantedto see me. With supplication and eagerness, I immediately went to hismajlis. I started to tell him my old dream. He stated in Turkish that thishad, in fact, been known to him from the beginning. {Now,} chancemade that dervish the ruler of Transoxiana. He took the title SuluanKhalcl. He also met with me at that time and showed me great kindness.Sometimes gently, sometimes harshly, he taught me the rules of theUarCqa. I remained in his company in this manner for about six years.I made great progress in religious training and in acquiring spiritualpower. I used to be in his service among the people. When we werealone, I was his special confidant. Subsequently, the sultanate of SuluanKhalcl took a turn for the worst. In an instant, nothing remained of thatformer reign. When I saw this, my heart completely lost its enthusiasmfor the affairs of this world. I went to Bukhara and settled in one of theneighboring villages.56Khwaja Baha’ al-Dcn Naqshband, in fact, received his spiritual training fromKhwaja ‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc. For this reason, it is by no means a mistaketo regard the latter as part of the Khwajagan {i.e. Naqshbandiyya}. Thus, theNaqshbandiyya naturally resembles the Yasawiyya in many respects because itwas influenced by the Yasawiyya, on the one hand, via Qutham Shaikh andKhalcl Ata and, on the other, via Khwaja ‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc, who was"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE104the khalCfa of Yesuf Hamadanc, after Armad Yasawc. After Baha’ al-Dcn, theNaqshbandiyya spread widely among the Turks of Transoxiana and Khurasanand from one point of view restricted the area of influence of the Yasawiyya.With respect to the general features of the Naqshbandiyya, however, we mustadd that they differed little from those of the Yasawiyya57 and that it was indebtedto the Yasawiyya for laying the groundwork that allowed it to spread throughoutCentral Asia in a short time.58The second great UarCqa that originated from Armad Yasawc is the Bektashiyya.While discussing the legendary life of Armad Yasawc, I have described the placegiven to him in Bektashc tradition (Chapter 2, pp. 32–5). In some nefc genealogies,the silsila of the UarCqa of lajjc Bektash Veli is presented in a totally differentmanner, but none of these has any historical value.59 The reason is, as I explainedabove based on ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade, that lajjc Bektash Veli was a dervish obsessedwith divine love who went to Anatolia and settled there before the foundingof the Ottoman state and he did not by any means establish a UarCqa. Indeed, hispersonality militated against founding such a great order. Like many othermadhhabs and UarCqas of various types that were involved in the religious upheavalsthat began among the Turks in Anatolia in the seventh/thirteenth century andcontinued vigorously in the eighth/fourteenth, ninth/fifteenth, and even thetenth/sixteenth centuries, the Bektashc UarCqa proper most likely took shape in theearly years of the ninth/fifteenth century, if not earlier, and chose as its pCr lajjcBektash Veli, whose historical character had been forgotton and whose legendshad grown up among the people since the seventh/thirteenth century.60The tradition in those legends that lajjc Bektash Veli was a Yasawc disciplehas two possible explanations. One is that, because numerous Yasawc disciplesdid go to Anatolia before the founding of the Ottoman state, lajjc Bektash Veliwas considered to be one of them. The other is that lajjc Bektash Veli wasindeed a Yasawc disciple. Whichever of these is true, it would not indicate thatthe Bektashc UarCqa is related to the Yasawiyya, because this UarCqa is not some-thing that lajjc Bektash himself established. Despite some external similarities,such as the use of Turkish rather than Arabic and Persian in the religiousceremonies of the Bektashcs and the widespread use of hymns written in plainTurkish and in the popular meter and language, exactly as among the Yasawcs,there is no factual connection between the two orders. From the very firstappearance of the Bektashc UarCqa those who joined it were regarded as heretics{zindCqs} who considered everything that was religiously unlawful to be religiouslypermissible,61 or they were deemed part of the lurefc sect62 and thus outside theSharC“a. This state of affairs, which pertained from the very first appearanceof the UarCqa, strengthens the notion that the generally held opinion that theBektashiyya was originally a nefc maslak {path} within the scope of the SharC“alikeother UarCqas, but later was taken over by lurefcs, mulRids {heretics, unbelievers},and zindCqs and thus lost its original character, is historically mistaken.The author {larcrc-Zade} of TibyAn-i wasA”il indicates that, in additionto these two great UarCqas, there are two other UarCqas that are branches of the"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"THE KHALHFAS AND OARHQA105Yasawiyya, but, in fact, they are not individual UarCqas but subdivisions of thesame UarCqa. The first of these two subdivisions is the hqaniyya. It goes back toShaikh Kamal hqanc, a khalCfa of Mawded Ata.63 Khwaja ‘Ubaid Allah Arrarmet this shaikh, who lived in the region of Tashkent, when he went to that cityfrom Khurasan and showed him great respect and affection. Indeed, as a resultof their mutual affection, they were constantly engaged in discussions. Because Ihave described above the pedigree of the hqaniyya, which derived from KamalShaikh, there is no need to repeat it here (see section A, p. 94). As for the secondof these two subdivisions, larcrc-Zade, without ever mentioning it by name, iscontent with stating that it extended via a silsila, which I mentioned above, fromKhadim Shaikh to Shaikh fkhend Mulla Khurd ‘Azczan, who died in 975/1567and was a khalCfa of Shaikh Khwajagc-i Kasanc {Makhdem-i A‘vam}.F ConclusionIn light of the analytical details that have been given to this point about ArmadYasawc and the Yasawiyya, it is possible to present a synthetic view of the originand nature of Turkish nefism in Central Asia and its basic features and charac-teristics. The significance of Armad Yasawc in Turkish history does not derive,in fact, from his being an early poet who wrote only five or ten pieces or {even}a few volumes of nefc verse {manVEma}. Instead, it derives from his holding swayfor centuries over the {Turkish} spirit by creating for the first time among theTurks, in the centuries during which Islam was beginning to spread amongthem, a nefc maslak. It is not that prior to him no one among the Turks hadentered the nefc maslaks (Chapter 1, pp. 7– 8), but those who did had beenPersianized as a result of Iranian cultural influence in the great cities of Islam or,because of the general acceptance of the new religion, were forgotten after beingabsorbed among the great masses of the Turks. Not one of them left a lastinglegacy or succeeded in establishing anything of permanence, whereas ArmadYasawc, thanks to his powerful personality, founded a great UarCqa among theTurks that lasted for centuries. And this UarCqa was the first to be founded by aTurk among the Turks. Thus, by critically examining the Yasawiyya and ArmadYasawc, we can shed light on a number of the oldest and most original aspects ofTurkish nefism.The Yasawiyya, i.e. Turkish nefism, was born under the powerful influence ofa great Persian nefc in an area that was dominated by Persian culture. ShaikhYesuf Hamadanc, the scion of a Zoroastrian family from Hamadan that hadbeen Muslim for only three generations, was not, however, one of those broad-minded, free-thinking, Persian nefcs who tried to reconcile and interpret ancientIndian and Iranian beliefs on the basis of Islam. Instead, because he was a LadCthscholar, in the full sense of the term, who was deeply imbued with the sciences ofthe SharC“a, he held the Koran and sunna above everything and did not advanceinterpretations that would be unacceptable to the upholders of religious law.64 Itis here that one will find the basic principles that later dominated the Yasawiyya."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE106Armad Yasawc, who was completely imbued with the ideas of his shaikh andwho was fundamentally a great religious scholar, tried to propagate and instillhis shaikh’s ideas when he returned to Yasc and, within a short time, he hadgreat success. This success of a nefc maslak that instilled simple and plain religiousand ethical principles – or, more correctly, that made religious and ethical propa-ganda – in an equally simple and plain environment, which had recently enteredthe Islamic milieu and in which philosophical subtleties were not yet understood,is quite natural. Moreover, Armad Yasawc addressed the people in a languagethat they understood and in literary forms to which they were accustomed, andso his success was all the greater.65Just as the Yasawiyya never attempted to propagate or instill a subtle andprofound “pantheism,” so it never allowed certain {eclectic} ideas and viewsproduced by the coalescence of various beliefs and deriving from various sources.66The spiritual and intellectual history of the area in which it developed, not tomention the personality of its founder, was never conducive to such things.These things were possible, indeed natural, in milieus that, over the centuries,had become accustomed to an ancient religion and to a high philosophy towhich it gave rise, and that, long remaining under the ebb and flow of variouscivilizations, took a keen interest in their spiritual sediments. But they werealmost completely impossible for the Turkish milieu at the time that ArmadYasawc flourished.Up to that time, the Turks had been in contact with the ideas and beliefs ofIndia, China, Iran, and even, to some degree, Christianity, but they had neveradopted them as their own. They were content with the simple views of theancient primitive religion that was peculiar to them. For this reason, they felt noneed to go beyond the fundamental beliefs of Islam, with which they were justbecoming familiar, or to exceed that framework.67 The fact that a number ofBuddhist monasteries were located in the Syr Darya region where the spirituallyguiding voice of Armad Yasawc first resounded did not and could not lead toeven a slight Indian influence on the Yasawiyya.68 We do find, however, sometraces of the ancient primitive religion – not, to be sure, in the fundamentalYasawc teachings propagated by Armad Yasawc and his khalCfas, but in a numberof Yasawc legends that became current among the people. This is a naturalphenomenon that commonly occurs in the history of the religious developmentof mankind.69 We can also say that the Naqshbandiyya, which was founded andspread a rather long time after the Yasawiyya and had very close connections withit and similarities to it, possesses the same basic characteristics as the Yasawiyya.70The reference by Sayyidc ‘Alc Ra’cs shows that in the tenth/sixteenth centuryYasawc shaikhs {he actually says Yasawc descendants} were found in Khwarazm,Astrakhan, and Western Iran in addition to the places that I have mentioned.Furthermore, I can mention an Indian Yasawc dervish named al-Shaikhal-Sharcf Murammad al-Hindc who died in the fortress of Lippa in Temeshvar{in modern Romania}. According to ‘Aua’c, this shaikh, who was originally fromAgra, “was a pCr in the UarCqa of Armad Yasawc and a khalCfa of Shaikh Riqa, who"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"THE KHALHFAS AND OARHQA107recovered his health in the service of Shaikh lajjc Bektash.” He was a vizier ofShah Humayen {the Moghul emperor} and the two took refuge together atthe court of Shah Tahmasp in 960/1552–3, but when his Sunnism was detectedand he realized that his life was in danger, he fled to the Ottoman Empire. Afterliving for four years in Istanbul, where Sultan Süleyman granted him a dailyallowance of 120 akchas, he went to the fortress of Lippa in Temeshvar witha zeamet {land grant} of 20,000 akchas and died there in 974/1566 – 67 (thesupplement to {Tashköprü-Zade’s} al-ShaqA”iq {i.e. LadA”iq}, vol. 1, p. 191). Theinformation that Evliya Chelebi provided above on “the Yasawc dervishes inRem” can also show very well the areas to which this order spread.Historically, it is not possible to follow precisely the development and spreadof the Yasawiyya in Central Asia. Nevertheless, I can give some details aboutit that are probably fairly accurate.71 According to what can be gleaned fromexisting documents, this UarCqa first took hold in Tashkent and its environs in theSyr Darya region, and then spread to Khwarazm, while also beginning to growin strength in Transoxiana. I have also given some information above, deducedfrom surviving legends, on the historical development of this UarCqa, which spreadfrom the Syr Darya Valley and Khwarazm toward the northwest and the Qipchaqregions and, by means of various dervishes, went as far as Khurasan, Azerbaijan,and Anatolia (Chapter 2, pp. 36 –7). Let me add here that this UarCqa, which wecan regard as exclusively Turkish, generally held sway in the Turkish countriesuntil the appearance of the Naqshbandiyya.72 After the appearance of this neworder, it won a major place among the Turks of Transoxiana in particular andalso spread to all of Khurasan and Khwarazm. Because of the close relationshipbetween the Yasawiyya and Naqshbandiyya, this state of affairs naturally causedno injury to the fame of Khwaja Armad Yasawc and was no obstacle to thespread of Yasawc shaikhs throughout the Turkish world. In fact, in the tenth/sixteenth century, we not only find Yasawc khalCfas in Khurasan,73 but we also findYasawc shaikhs in various places in Central Asia and even in Kabul, Diyarbakir,the Hijaz, and Istanbul.74 Nevertheless, by that time, the Naqshbandiyya hadacquired much greater importance than the Yasawiyya.75 The overriding influenceand importance of Khwaja Armad Yasawc was only maintained in the Syr Daryaregion and in the Qazaq steppes, where it was never supplanted by anotherUarCqa. As I have explained above (Chapter 3, pp. 69 –70), the enormous respectand reverence for this great pCr that the Qazaqs have nourished for centuries is ofa different order and much stronger than the respect and reverence they havefelt for any other saint or spiritual guide. We can safely say that of all the variousUarCqas that have taken shape over the centuries, the one that is most character-istically Turkish is the Yasawiyya.76NOTES1{nafc,} RashaRAt, {Turkish} trans., p. 15.

It is apparent that thelegendary account that I recounted at great length in Chapter 2 (pp. 20 –1) was formedaround these details, because Arslan Baba was certainly a historical figure and fromthe black race. {Köprülü relied completely on the RashaRAt’s account of the successionto Armad Yasawc, which is completely contrived, in order to assign him four khalCfas(requiring the insertion of two ciphers, one of whom is never anything more than aname). It is odd that he did not trust lazcnc, whose work he emphasizes for so muchelse. As it stands, he failed to use fully lazcnc’s extensive information on the Yasawclineage leading to his own master, Sayyid Manter, and failed even to consider theother successors of Armad Yasawc, as named by lazcnc, whom he mentioned earlier.Also, even if we could accept Arslan Baba as historical (which is not clear), there is noevidence that he was “from the black race.” One of his descendants is called “ZangcAta,” but elsewhere Arslan Baba is called an Arab.}2 {The date given for Sa‘cd Ata is meaningless. It is found no earlier than thenineteenth-century KhazCnat al-aTfiyA”.}3 Although {nafc,} RashaRAt, {Turkish} trans., indicates that the wife of lakcm Ata, thefamous ‘Anbar Ana, was the daughter of Buraq Khan (p. 16), the author {NitharcBukharc} of Mudhakkir-i aRbAb especially makes the point of correcting this to thedaughter of Bughra Khan (p. 299).4 {The death date for lakcm Ata never appears in “a story.” It too appears no earlierthan the KhazCnat al-aTfiyA”. The date was probably chosen to yield a round twentyyears from the death date of Armad Yasawc.

Oneis a winter pasture {kıZlak} in the environs of the town of Shcr-abad near the present-day Bukhara and Afghan border. The French Traveler G. Capus gives considerableinformation about it (A travers le royaume de Tamerlan . . .[Paris, 1892], pp. 120, 140).The other one is a ruined site that the Qazaqs today call Aq Qerghan in the Tekeshvalley southeast of Qelcha (Kulja). It was a government center of the former MongolkhAns (Reclus, Nouvelle géogrqphie universelle, vol. on Russian Asia, p. 562). Because traditionputs lakcm Ata in the vicinity of Khwarazm, it is more likely that the Aq Qerghan inquestion was the town visited by Capus. Nevertheless, because the name Aq Qerghanwas a common designation that could be given to the türbe of any saint, just as the türbeof Armad Yasawc’s father Shaikh Ibrahcm was called Aq Türbet, it is also possiblethat lakcm Ata is buried in an Aq Qerghan that has nothing to do with these twotowns. {The problem here is that there are two apparently different stories about theburial place of lakcm Ata. The anomalous one is also the most influential, since it isfrom the ubiquitous RashaRAt: it calls his burial place Aq Qurghan, further explainingthis name in Persian as qal“ah-i safCd, leaving no doubt that the form “Aq Qurghan”was indeed intended, at least by the author of the RashaRAt. The author may, however,have had written material at hand in which his burial place was given as “Baq.rghan”or the like, and interpreted the initial bA as the Persian prefix, and the rest as a garbledAq-q.r.ghAn. In any case, the name “Baqırghan” (i.e. the form “Bagh.r.ghan”) is attestedas the burial place of lakcm Ata already in the early sixteenth century, i.e. not longafter the RashaRAt was compiled, and that name is widely associated with lakcm Ata.We have, of course, the other etymology of the place name, as the site where the saint’scamel bellowed. Köprülü could not have read Barthold’s brief article “K voprosu orodine Khakim-Ata,” Sochineniia, II/2, p. 361 (originally published in 1902), whosetitle was somewhat misleading since the legend of lakcm Ata says nothing of his“native land” (and in fact implies that he was in the same town as Armad Yasawcalready in his boyhood). Köprülü does point out the similarity in pronunciation below inn.9, but in any case his long discussions of two places called Aq Qurghan are in vain.}6 {The work to which Köprülü refers is actually known as LakCm Ata kitAbı (as he himselfacknowledges below in n.7 and elsewhere).}7 {Anonymous,} Lakîm Ata kitâbı (Kazan, 1901). {The best known published version ofthis work was one that Köprülü evidently knew but never obtained: K. G. Zaleman(ed. and Russian trans.), “Legenda pro Khakim-Ata,” Izvestiia Akademii nauk (SPb.),9/2 (1898), 105 –50. Zaleman’s version was based on the earliest known manuscriptand is much better than the 1901 printing. What Köprülü proceeds to give above inthe text is a much-paraphrased rendering of the eleven stories of this work. He leavesout a great deal and does not, or could not, compare the stories with other versions inindependent sources. Moreover, much of the work only makes sense with an under-standing of the hereditary nefc traditions linked to lakcm Ata, Sayyid Ata, andothers, in Khwarazm, but Köprülü could not have known of those.} In the mostimportant works like {nafc’s} RashaRAt, Sulaiman Ata and lakcm Ata are described astwo different people, but this is not correct. Not only does the Lakîm Ata kitâbı testifyto this, but even a book like {lazcnc’s} JawAhir, which is one of the most importantworks on this subject, describes Sulaiman lakcm Ata as a single person. For moredetailed information on the works of this important Yasawc khalCfa, see Chapter 6,pp. 175– 6 of this work. {Köprülü glosses over a very real problem: it is quite truethat many other sources affirm the status of nefc Murammad Danishmend as ArmadYasawc’s disciple, but the fact that early versions of the RashaRAt replace nefc Murammadamong Armad Yasawc’s four successors by splitting lakcm Ata into two people issignificant nonetheless.}"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE1108 {The term tekke is virtually never used in Central Asia, and in this particular instanceit is not mentioned in the text of LakCm Ata kitAbı. Its use has the effect of imposing aTurkish form (institutionally, even) on a Central Asian reality it does not fit. Köprülü’srendering of the story here, moreover, obscures the difference between what he istranslating and what he is explaining or interpreting, and is very unfortunate. Zaleman’stext makes it clear that what Armad Yasawc fastens at his waist is a sheep’s bladder,from which he both expels air audibly and pours water.}9 {Anonymous,} Lakîm Ata kitâbı. This was the reason the name Sulaiman Baqirghancwas given to lakcm Ata; but it is nevertheless apparent that this resulted from a folketymology rather than from a historical tradition. The similarity in pronunciationbetween Aq Qerghan and Baqirghan is evidence to support this.10 It should not be forgotten that the man whom Tcmer ordered to build the türbe ofKhwaja Armad Yasawc was also named ‘Abd Allah nadr. It seems very likely that the‘Abd Allah nadr in this legendary account represents an altered version of this historicalpersonality.11 {Here Köprülü leaves out major elements of two stories: the Jarullah with whom thetwo sons go to study in Khwarazm is the famous scholar al-Zamakhsharc (d. 538/1144); and the story recounts the profligacy of the two sons in the city, where theydrink wine and miraculously evade the punishment recommended by their father.}12 The sacrifice of these nine oxen was also a vestige of the pre-Islamic religious tradi-tions of the Turks. For considerably more information collected on the sanctity of thenumber nine among the Turks and Mongols, see my “Türk edebiyatı tarihine medhal”{never published, see his “Türk edebiyatının menze’i,”}, pp. 101–2. This sacrifice andinviting everyone to the feast are reminiscent, in fact, of the old Zölen (public feast);see ibid.13 {The point of the story is again obscured by Köprülü’s rendering: it shows theincreasing tension between father and son, which culminates in the son showing uphis father by reviving the slaughtered oxen. It is surprising that Köprülü omitted theproverb uttered by lakcm Ata to explain why his son had to get lost, namely that“two rams’ heads cannot be boiled in the same cauldron” (to which the son repliesthat even three will fit, if you just remove the horns!). This proverb is found already inal-Kashgharc, Dankoff and Kelly (trans.), Compendium, vol. 2, p. 345.}14 One night lakcm Ata appeared to Khwaja Jalal al-Dcn in a dream. He said, “Seekme out! Build a mausoleum over me!” Based on this spiritual guidance, Khwaja Jalalal-Dcn went to Turkistan with many goods and returned from there to Baqirghan.Just then, however, the weather suddenly turned very bad. The sky darkened and aterrible wind blew. When the weather cleared, the goods and animals of the mer-chants had all been swept away. Khwaja Jalal al-Dcn went up a hill and lookedaround. Opposite him, he saw a mountain and on top of it he saw a woman. He wentover and greeted her and asked the location of lakcm Ata’s türbe. The woman didn’tknow. She suggested that the khwAja go with her to her old mother and ask her. Theold woman told them that that area was under water and the türbe was lost, and shesaid, “Near the water is an ornamental tree {süs aXacı, i.e. not fruit bearing}. Everynight deer gather around it and remain there until dawn paying homage. Those whopass by hear the sound of a dhikr. Perhaps that is the place.” Khwaja Jalal al-Dcntraveled there that very night. He saw the deer, listened to the sounds of the dhikr, andfell asleep. lakcm Ata appeared to him again in a dream, saying “Go forward sevenpaces from the place where you lay down! Dig there! A reed mat will emerge and,under it, a bouquet of roses. That place is my türbe. Don’t worry about your lost goodsbecause all of it is in the caravanserai. Retrieve it and come! Build a mausoleum overme and take up permanent residence at my tomb!” When Khwaja Jalal al-Dcn awoke,he did as he was instructed, found the tomb and set up a marker. Then he departed"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"THE KHALHFAS AND OARHQA111and retrieved his goods. Later he had skilled craftsmen brought from Khwarazm and100,000 gold tenges were spent to build the mausoleum. He took the name Shaikh Jalalal-Dcn and lived on the site. Everyone in the region rushed to visit him (Lakîm Atakitâbı {a paraphrase of the original Chaghatay}). On the sanctity of trees among theTurks, see the Uygur menkabesi of Juvainc {probably a reference to J. Marquart,“—uwaini’s Bericht über die Bekehrung der Uiguren,” Sitzungsberichte der PreussischenAkademie der Wissenschaften, 1 (1912), 486 –502. Cf. Boyle’s translation of Juvainc, vol. 1,pp. 53 – 61}, Radloff ’s famous work on Shamanism {Das Schamanenthum und sein Kultus,eine Untersuchun (Leipzig, 1885)}, and Grenard {Le Turkestan}. Ancient deer legendsand popular folk tales clearly show the importance of deer in popular beliefs. {Köprülü’scontinuous search for “survivals” is noteworthy.}15 Because lakcm Ata was very dark skinned, ‘Anbar Ana one day somehow thought toherself, “I wish my husband were not so black.” lakcm Ata learned of this throughthe miraculous light of saintliness and prayed, saying, “May it happen soon that yoube the companion of one blacker than me.” And, indeed, a short time later lakcmAta died and Zangc Ata came and asked ‘Anbar Ana for her hand in marriage.‘Anbar Ana, turning away her face with rage, rejected this proposal, saying “I will notmarry anyone after lakcm Ata, least of all such a negro,” but her neck remained inthat position {i.e. twisted}. Zangc Ata then sent her a message reminding her of whathad previously passed between her and her deceased husband. When she learned thatthis proposal of marriage had simply resulted from a saintly miracle, she wept andhad to accept ({nafc,} RashaRAt, {Turkish} trans., pp. 16–17). The Lakîm Ata kitâbıpresents this legend in a different manner: lakcm Ata was black, while ‘Anbar Anawas white and beautiful. One day, while lakcm Ata was washing {himself }, ‘AnbarAna was in bed. She looked at him and wondered why she, the daughter of BughraKhan, had become the wife of {lit. fallen to} this black man. lakcm Ata knew whatshe was thinking and he said to her, “You do not like my looks. But after me you willbecome the wife of one so black that he has nothing white except his teeth!” ‘AnbarAna then regretted what she had thought and wept. But it was too late. When thetime approached for lakcm Ata to pass away, he sent for his sons from Khwarazmand said to them, “After my death, when you serve the funeral banquet on thefortieth day, forty abdAls from the people of the Ka‘ba will come from the East {sic}.Among them will be a black abdAl blind in one eye and lame in one leg. After therequired waiting period before remarrying has passed, marry your mother to him!”And indeed, forty days after lakcm Ata’s death, the abdAls arrived, but there was noblack abdAl among them. The sons asked about him. They learned that he hadremained behind and they sent for him. His name was Zangc {i.e. “Negro”}. Theymarried their mother to him according to their father’s will. At that time, no oneknew of the saintliness of this Zangc. Zangc Baba took his wife and departed for hisnative country. ‘Anbar Ana suffered great distress because of this Zangc as a result ofher former husband’s saintly miracle, but she put up with it and gave advice to otherwomen on this subject (Lakîm Ata kitâbı). {See EI2, s.v. “Zangc fta” (Th. Zarcone). Inthe narrative, Köprülü switches from LakCm Ata kitAbı to the RashaRAt’s account oflakcm Ata and Zangc Ata (who are not portrayed in the former work as ever meetingone another!), but mixes the two accounts together for a while. Zangc Ata is made adescendant of Arslan Baba in the RashaRAt and in Nitharc’s work, but the LakCm AtakitAbı says nothing of this. The idea that Zangc’s black skin (or ugliness!) was becausehe was a descendant of Arslan Baba (who does not appear to be identified as an Arabin any source) is Köprülü’s own invention.}16 {The saint Köprülü usually calls “Sayyid Armad,” using the RashaRAt, is more oftenknown as “Sayyid Ata,” who stands at the head of an enormously important nefcand familial tradition in Central Asia.

The Lakîm Ata kitâbı mentions certainlegends about Sayyid Ata that are not found in the RashaRAt and describes his relation-ship to lakcm Ata as follows. One day Lakîm Ata kitâbı was being read in Sayyid Ata’steaching circle and his legends and miracles were being discussed. Sayyid Ata asked ifany of the sayyids had taken up residence at his tomb. When he learned that none haddone so, he went to Baqirghan taking three people with him. Sayyid Ata asked ShaikhJalal, who was there, if he would cede the post of resident {mujAwir} to him. ShaikhJalal, who had been personally hurt by his coming, stated that he had come there onthe order of lakcm Ata. Sayyid Ata then made the following suggestion: “Tonight letthe two of us go and petition {lakcm Ata}, and whomever lakcm Ata wants willstay.” Shaikh Jalal agreed to this and that night they went. lakcm Ata said, “Oh, myson Shaikh Jalal, Sayyid Ata came here on the order of the Prophet. Cede the postof mujAwir to him. Near Khwarazm is a place called Aqtash. Go there and establish ahalting place {or caravansarai}. Let whoever comes to visit me, visit you first. I willnot accept those who have not gone to you first.” Shaikh Jalal happily ceded the postof mujAwir and went straight to Aqtash. Sayyid Ata spent a long time there as mujAwir.Finally, his time to pass away arrived. His murCds asked him, “Shall we take you to theKa‘ba or bury you here?” He answered, “Put my coffin on a large cart and depart{with it} from Baqirghan in the direction of the Ka‘ba. That night, however, firmlytie up your animals. Don’t make any noise. Stay in your homes. If you hear a sound,beware. Don’t go outside. When dawn breaks, look outside. Wherever the cart hasstopped, bury me on that spot.” All of this, in fact, happened. The next day they sawthat the cart had stopped next to the türbe of lakcm Ata.

Now thosewho come to Baqirghan first visit the tomb of lakcm Ata, then that of Sayyid Ata,and afterwards the other tombs (Lakîm Ata kitâbı). We find the death date {chronogram}of Sayyid Ata, who died in 702/1302–3, as follows in {Lahawrc’s} KhazCnat al-aTfiyA(vol. 1, p. 540) {again, a meaningless date}:Sayyidc ‘Alc Ra’cs says that he visited the tombs of lakcm Ata and Sayyid Ata whilegoing from Khcva to Khwarazm and that both were in the same place (Mir”Atal-mamAlik, p. 71).Riqa Qulc Khan gives the following information on lakcm Ata and his tomb inhis famous SafarnAme-yi KhwArazm {ed. and French trans. Ch. Schefer (Paris, 1879)}:“lakcm Ata is the name of a place on the bank of the Amu Darya. lakcm Ata, whois buried there, was a Turkish shaikh of the Naqshbandc silsila.

They live in this arid region between the Syr Darya and AmuDarya, which takes twenty days to cross” (Persian text, p. 101). Schefer, who made anannotated trans. of the SafarnAme, corrects and supplements this information, basedon {Lahawrc’s} KhazCnat al-aTfiyA, by stating “lakcm Ata was buried in Aq Qerghan.”He also says that there was an early copy of the story of lakcm Ata and that it waspublished in Kazan by I. Gottwald (Schefer trans., p. 101). Furthermore, Riqa QulcKhan mentions an Adun-Ata Fountain among the halting places of the Turkmenand states that this Adun-Ata was a murCd of Zangc Ata (Persian text, p. 41; Schefertrans., p. 65). This would again confirm that the influence of the Yasawc murCds hadexpanded widely in the the Turkmen region.18 {nafc,} RashaRAt, {Turkish} trans., pp. 20 –1.

It is published in Armad Yasawc’s DCwAn-iLikmat.

The story of the straw in Isma‘cl Ata’s eye, in the narrative below, involvesan ancestor of Khwaja ‘Ubaid Allah Arrar, who was indeed a Tashkandc. Isma‘clAta begins an important Yasawc nefc lineage, primarily hereditary, that was entirelyunknown to Köprülü.

In order: Khudaidad’s nisba was “Ghazcragc,”though “‘Azczagc” is easy to understand and shows up in manuscripts as well (Ghazcrahis/was a town near Samarqand). “Mawlana Walc Keh-i Zarc” is the best form of thenext person’s name. “Shaikh Garmcnc” clearly refers to the most important Yasawcshaikh of the second half of the sixteenth century, Qasim Shaikh Karmcnagc (Karmcnahis a famous town between Bukhara and Samarqand). Murammad Mu’min Samarqandcwas the father of ‘flim Shaikh, who wrote the LamaRAt; this was as close as Köprülügot to him. It is not clear whom Köprülü had in mind with “Shaikh fkhend, MullaKhurd ‘Azczan.” All this probably refers to one person, not two, namely MawlanaKherd ‘Azczan (a son and successor of the Naqshbandc Makhdem-i A‘vam), who diedin 977/1569 –70 in Balkh, and who is mentioned later by Köprülü in this chapter ofthe narrative. As for the lineage of Kamal Shaikh hqanc, the latter’s disciple is shownin better sources as “Shaikh Sayyid Armad,” and it is not clear why Köprülü (or theTibyAn) gives “Shaikh ‘Alcyabadc.” This Armad was one of the figures to whom A. K.Borovkov suggested ascribing some of the poems from the DCwAn-i Likmat (“Ocherkipo istorii uzbekskogo iazyka (opredelenie iazyka khikmatov Akhmada Iasevi),” Sovetskoevostokovedenie, 5 (1948), 229 –50). Shams Özkendi ( Uzgandc) is known most extensivelyfrom the LamaRAt. Köprülü took the three names following him from the late TibyAn,but that work’s source must have been, directly or indirectly, another work of lazcncthat was unknown to Köprülü, the JAmi“ al-murshidCn (preserved in a unique manu-script in Berlin). For the most extensive discussion of the post-fifteenth-century Yasawcsilsila lines to date, see DeWeese, “The Yasavc Order and Persian Hagiography inSeventeenth-Century Central Asia: ‘flim Shaykh of ‘Alcyabad and his LamaRAt minnafaRAt al-quds,” pp. 389 – 414.}30 The silsila given in {lazcnc’s} JawAhir is as follows: Zangc Ata, nadr Ata, Jamal Shashc(in Khwarazm), his son lasan Shaikh, ‘Alc Khwaja, Khwaja ‘Alc {sic}, who had twokhalCfas, Shaikh Pehlivan { just an epithet}, and Shaikh Mawded (the shaikh of SultanAbe Sa‘cd). Shaikh Mawded’s khalCfa Khadim Shaikh, Shaikh Jamal al-Dcn (in Bukhara,his tomb was in Herat), Shaikh Sulaiman Ghaznawc (he studied first from ‘UbaidAllah Arrar and then Jamal al-Dcn), Shaikh Khudaidad, Mulla Walc Keh-i Zarc(Keh-i Zarrc), Qasim {sic} Shaikh, and Shaikh Khudaidad’s other khalCfa Shaikh Matcn{an epithet}, from whom Shaikh Amcn {an epithet} received permission to initiateothers, and from whom in turn Sayyid Manter Ata received this permission, and fromwhom in turn lazcnc the author of this work received this permission (summary of therhymed Persian {nefc} genealogical tree {silsilanAme} at the end of JawAhir, pp. 232–43). The reason for these differences is obvious. A given shaikh had numerous khalCfas,only some of whom were recorded in the genealogical tree. Many were forgotten ortheir correct genealogical trees were later lost. The author {nafc} of RashaRAt, so itwould seem, took the Yasawc khalCfas who had won fame up to his time from Jamalal-Dcn Bukharc. As for lazcnc, he seems to have recorded the genealogical tree of hisshaikh Sayyid Manter. The author {larcrc-Zade} of TibyAn-i wasA”il also cites thegenealogical tree of some dervish or other that resembles this one. {Köprülü mis-understood lazcnc’s account of the Yasawc silsila in several respects. His silsila charthas often been repeated and cited in other works, but it is thoroughly misleading andincomplete and thus should no longer be used. The problems posed by lazcnc’saccount in the earliest stage of this silsila are indeed confusing, and cannot be sortedout on the basis of his accounts alone. Adding the data in the LamaRAt is essential.Köprülü is to be criticized primarily for implying that the presentation is straight-forward, not for misunderstanding a confusing account. The more important errorsbegin with Shaikh Sulaiman Ghaznawc and Khudaidad. Köprülü implies that thelatter was the disciple of the former – and there are, in fact, the sort of conflicting"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE116accounts that should tell us that two separate lineages claimed supremacy for theirown spiritual ancestor – but there is abundant evidence (some from lazcnc himself )that Khudaidad was a direct disciple of Jamal al-Dcn. Next, Mawlana Walc Keh-iZarc is indeed consistently shown as a disciple of Khudaidad and as a master of QasimShaikh; but lazcnc’s account then goes on to say that another of Khudaidad’s discipleswas Darwcsh Shaikh (to whom the epithet “Shaikh-i Matcn,” i.e. “the firm master,” isapplied), and that after Darwcsh Shaikh came “the powerful shaikh, Mulla Amcn,”from whom lazcnc himself obtained guidance, in addition to his relationship with hisprincipal master, Sayyid Manter (who was a disciple of Sulaiman Ghaznawc). TheMulla Amcn mentioned here may be another epithet referring to a known disciple ofKhudaidad who came to prominence after Darwcsh Shaikh. In any case, “DarwcshShaikh” was not recognized as a proper name, in effect, by Köprülü (or Okuyucu),primarily because they did not know the LamaRAt ( Darwcsh Shaikh was a grandfatherof that work’s author, ‘flim Shaikh). Finally, it is worthy of note that lazcnc’s masteris never called “Sayyid Manter Ata” (except by Köprülü).}31 {lazcnc,} JawAhir, p. 120. Here it suffices for us to cite briefly from lazcnc’s work therules (AdAb) of the Yasawc UarCqa. The details given on this subject in this work, whichwas written in the tenth/sixteenth century, are not found in other sources, so they arealso very valuable with respect to the general history of nefism. Comparing thesedetails with the rules and principles of other UarCqas, however, is a subject completelybeyond the scope of the present work. On the rules of the UarCqa, lazcnc cites a workcalled BustAn al-“ArifCn (JawAhir, p. 137), but I know of no work by Khwaja ArmadYasawc with this title. The work with this title that is renowned throughout theMuslim world is one on LadCth transmission, canonical rules and ethics by ImamAbe ‘l-Laith Natr b. Murammad Samarqandc lanafc who died in 375/985 – 6 {rather,between 373/983 and 393/1003}. There are many copies in our libraries. KatibChelebc adds that there were three versions of this work, large, medium, and small,and that the small one was the version commonly found throughout Rem and theArab countries (Kashf al-VunEn [Belaq, 1274/1857], vol. 1, p. 153). Katib Chelebi alsostates that Imam Muryc ‘l-Dcn Yarya b. Sharaf al-Dcn al-Nawawc al-Shafi‘c(d. 676/1277) had a work with this title. {It is not quite clear that lazcnc intended toascribe the BustAn al-“ArifCn to Armad Yasawc. He mentions it twice, once withoutascription, and once ascribed to the shaikh al-mashA”ikh, a phrase typically used to referto Yasawc, but nevertheless somewhat ambiguous.}32 According to Armad Yasawc’s declaration, one could not become a shaikh withoutstudying seventy sciences and passing through seventy stages {maqAms}. One gradu-ally attained these sciences through forty-four stages. One who set out to be a shaikhwithout studying them would be detested by the men of God {ahl AllAh; in theOkuyucu edn of lazcnc, p. 63, awliyA” AllAh, i.e. the saints}. The stages are as follows:sincere repentance, beneficial knowledge, lofty forbearance, perfect discernment,comprehensive knowledge, whole-hearted submission, humble dignity, complete con-tentment, being as truthful as Caliph Abe Bakr, being as certain of what is rightas Caliph ‘Umar, being as pious as Caliph ‘Uthman, praising God like Caliph ‘Alc,being as piously ascetic as lasan, being as obliterated {in God} as lusain, placingcomplete trust in God like Imam Murammad Ibn al-lanafiyya, perfect endurance{of this world}, giving thanks for divine benefaction, submission to one’s fate,fortitude in the face of tribulation, enjoyment of blessings, generosity from what onepossesses, sincerity towards people of distinction, praisworthy ethics, abstinence fromwhat is religiously forbidden and cleanliness and fasting, general humility, permanentfear {of God}, wishing for all contingencies and terrors, compassion and weeping,longing for and being perceptive to God, ecstasy of God, goodness and virtue,"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"THE KHALHFAS AND OARHQA117kindness and generosity, the guidance of God, being fearful {of God} in outwardreverence, being fearful {of God} in inward submission, devoutness in rejectingwhat is forbidden and resolution in conforming to what is commanded, wisdom andexperience in word and deed, being innocent of great sins, being innocent of minorsins, the illumination of separation {from God} and the ardor of yearning {for God},melancholia and madness {as a form of love}, love and affection {for God}, modestybefore God and men {in the Okuyucu edn followed by wa “l-dawabb, and animals},signs of union, and approaching and drawing near God. In the words of this shaikh,the following eight stages are the bases of these forty-four stages: (1) the stage of thepenitent ones – asceticism and striving {for God} – the master of the penitent ones isAdam; (2) the stage of the learned ones – humility and supplication and turningtoward God and seeking the five RaQaras {presences} – the master of the learned onesis Idrcs; (3) the stage of the ascetics – compassion and attention and love and affection– the master of the ascetics is Jesus; (4) the stage of the patient ones – forbearance andputting trust in God and reflection – the master of the patient ones is Job; (5) the stageof the contented ones – joyfulness and sociability and attachments – the master is notspecified; (6) the stage of the grateful ones – declaring the unity of God and chantingin praise of God and praising God – the commander is Noah; (7) the stage of thelovers – reciting and private worship and dhikrs and asking God’s pardon – the onewho asks the lovers to bear witness is Abraham; (8) the stage of those who know God– fasting, and praying and meditation – the supporter of those who know God is ourProphet and master {i.e. Murammad} ({lazcnc,} JawAhir, pp. 108 –14).33 {In the Okuyucu edn of lazcnc, p. 73, the last word is “urafA”, mystics.}34 {In the Okuyucu edn of lazcnc, p. 74, we find “to know that all the shaikhs and pCrsare holy and saintly” instead of “to know all the shaikhs and saints.”}35 {lazcnc,} JawAhir, pp. 129 –31.36 {A similar formula, with ikhwAn (brethren), makAn ( place), and zamAn (time) notedfirst and then ta“alluq be-pAdshAhAn (attachment to the ruler) added as the essentialingredient to ensure the first three, is articulated in a treatise of the NaqshbandcMakhdem-i A‘vam, entitled TanbCh al-salAUCn, written most likely around 1530, and histreatment has been discussed briefly in Baxtiyor M.

The words khalwa and “uzla have long been special nefc terms andare used synonymously. The object of khalwa is to withdraw from the world in arelatively deserted place. “Uzla is the attribute of one pure in heart; khalwa is the markof union with God. With regard to the murCd, he first has to withdraw {“uzla} from hisfellow men and finally he has to choose khalwa for uns-i Laqq {intimacy with God}.However, whoever chooses “uzla must believe that he has chosen this action inorder to protect the people from his own wickedness, not to be protected from thewickedness of the people, for the contrary would cause vanity and conceit. AbeBakr {Murammad b. ‘Umar} Warraq {al-Tirmidhc} said, “I found the goodnessof this world and the next in khalwa and scarcity {qilla} and I found wickednessand harm in this world and the next in mixing with people and in abundance”(al-Qushairc, al-RisAla, {Turkish} trans., pp. 82–5) {vol. 1, p. 273 in the Marmedet al. Cairo edn}. Shihab al-Dcn al-Suhrawardc, whose works on nufcsm were of greatvalue and importance, discusses khalwa at length in the chapter FutER al-arba“Cn inhis “AwArif al-ma“Arif and gives its rules and conditions. According to him, the objectof khalwa is not to witness a number of strange and wondrous events or make dis-coveries. Whoever prefers khalwa over mixing with people has to desist from alldhikrs except dhikr AllAh, from all desires except the desire for God, and from seekingall intermediate causes {kAffa-i asbAb; as opposed to God, the ultimate cause}. Other-wise khalwa would lead to dissention or disaster. On this matter al-Suhrawardc says,“Some people enter the khalwa without observing its conditions; they continuallyrecite one of the dhikrs, focus their spiritual faculties on one point and block theiroutward senses from external affairs. Monks, brahmans, and philosophers, in fact,do this. This state of affairs can certainly have an influence in bringing about innerpeace. But the khalwa that is done by following the stipulations of the SharC“a and sunnaresults in illumination of the heart, asceticism, a refined dhikr, and acting with sinceredevotion in prayer and chanting the Koran.

The custom of burying the blood of the sacrificial victimand preserving its bones is not Islamic. It would be more correct to look for theinfluence of the pre-Islamic religious traditions of the early Turks in this matter.Perhaps this was a vestige of early Buddhism.47Ibid., p. 56.48Ibid., pp. 72–3. The same legend is repeated in a Persian poem in this work, p. 229.{There are several other legends recorded about the origin of the dhikr-i arra.

Only ‘Abd al-Khaliq Ghujduwanc was charged with the dhikr-i khafiyya{private or quiet dhikrs} by Khaqir. Yesuf Hamadanc, who was his shaikh, did notchange this ({nafc,} RashaRAt, {Turkish} trans., p. 25). Shaikh Rukn al-Dcn ‘Ala’al-Dawla Simnanc asked the famous Khwaja ‘Azczan about the nature of the dhikr-ijahr. Answering him, he said, “I also heard you do the dhikr-i khafiyya. The purpose ofthe khafiyya, however, is that other people be unaware. Once people know about it,both are equal. Indeed, a reputation for khafiyya is tantamount to hypocrisy.” Accordingto the noble LadCth... it is lawful to do the dhikr at the last breath with ashout and teach it {telkîn etmek} to a novice. Every breath of the dervish is the equi-valent of the last breath. For this reason the dhikr-i jahr is regarded as inappropriatefor them. Khwaja Marmed Injcr Faghnawc also said that “the dhikr-i “alAniyya is forhim whose tongue is free of lies and gossip, whose throat is free of what is unlawfuland suspicious, and whose heart is free of hypocrisy and vanity, and whose head isfree from turning away from God to what is other than God.” {Köprülü presents herea few of the many claims and counterclaims about who did what kind of dkhir thatcan be found in the Khwajagan and Naqshbandc literature from the fourteenth to thesixteeth centuries as “evidence” that seems to favor a particular claim, when whatthey actually reflect is a long process of polemics.}50 {lazcnc,} JawAhir, pp. 157– 8.51RashaRAt, {Turkish} trans., p. 21. According to another story, Khwaja ‘Ubaid Allahsaid, “Enough! He has burned from Heaven to Earth,” and then “I thought ifan unbeliever asks what kind of dhikr this is, how should one answer him?” And herecited the couplet,{The birds of the field, every morning, Address you with technical terms (i.e. inlanguage that others do not understand).}52 The author {larcrc-Zade} of TibyAn-i wasA”il (vol. 3, p. 265) cites this passage from awork by Shaikh Murammad Ghawth entitled JawAhir-i khams {or al-JawAhir al-khamsain the original Arabic}.53Ibid., vol. 3, p. 266. This passage was also taken from Shaikh Salim’s work entitledal-Sifr al-manthEr li “l-dirAya wa “l-dhikr al-manshEr li “l-wilAya. It is evident that this authorsaw JawAhir-i khams and made use of it. At the end of the information that he provides,Shaikh Salim says, “according a well known tradition {qawl}, this dhikr goes back toSayyid Armad Badawc. The attribution is so well known that it has become knownas dhikr-i BadawC.” This is not correct. The author {larcrc-Zade} of TibyAn-i wasA”il,in fact, quite rightly criticizes and corrects this by saying, “Tracing this dhikr back toSayyid Armad Badawc is an error by either the copyist or author.

While thesection down to Armad Yasawc in this chain of transmission follows tradition, thesection after him {i.e. to ‘Alc} is completely unfounded. It has neither legendary norhistorical value. In another chain of transmission written by Selânikli Muhammedb. Osman Efendi in 1140/1727– 8, we have the following: Bektash Veli received theUarCqa {from} Nu‘man Sarcn (a corruption of Luqman-i Paranda), who received itfrom Sayyid Armad Badawc, who received it from Shaikh Quub al-Dcn Ejder (laidar),who received it from Khwaja ‘Abd al-Rabb, who received it from Khwaja YesufHamadanc (TibyAn-i wasA”il, same vol. and chapter). Although this chain concludeswith Yesuf Hamadanc, Armad Yasawc’s shaikh, it too certainly has no value. Indeed,the author Kamal al-Dcn {i.e. larcrc-Zade} says that the Bektashc way {UarCq} was nota branch of the Badawiyya – despite Bektash Veli’s meeting with Sayyid ArmadBadawc as cited from {Hüda‘c’s} WAqi“At-i UftAda – and that the link with the Badawiyyahere is different from, and contradicts, the well known link, i.e. the {traditional} chainof transmission. Adhering to the ideas and reflections of the majority, he considersthe Bektashiyya as a branch of the Yasawiyya (TibyAn-i wasA”il, vol. 3, chapter on theYasawiyya). {To declare that divergent versions of the Bektashc silsila have no valueignores the potential clues they provide to differing traditions, rivalries, and the like.}60 In his research on the Bektashiyya, Jacob writes that this UarCqa was founded by BalımSuluan who died in 922/1516 and that this UarCqa has definitely been in existence onlysince the beginning of the tenth/sixteenth century (Bektaschijje, p. 24, and EI1, s.v.“Bektash” [ R. Tschudi]). Shams al-Dcn Samc, while attributing historical value to thelegendary stories about lajjc Bektash, also confirms that the official religious cere-monies and rules of the Bektashc UarCqa were established by Balım Baba (QAmEs al-a“lAm,s.v. “Bektash Veli”). However, based on a number of new documents currently in ourpossession, which Jacob did not see, we must date the founding of the Bektashc UarCqato at least a half century or a century earlier. In fact, Khunkar lajjc Bektash Veli ismentioned in a poem {manVEma} entitled KhaQirnAme written by a Bektashc poet namedMuryc al-Dcn in 880/1475 – 6. And even famous personalities like Sarı Saltuk, YenusEmre, Armad Badawc, Mawlana {Remc}, Suluan Walad, Marmed lairanc, QarajaArmad and Fauima Bajc, who later appear in the VelAyetnAme-i LAjjC Bektash Veli or inthe chains of transmission, and a large number of Anatolian erens are presented asfollowers of Bektash Veli (unique MS in my private library). While discussing thesymbols (s. “alAma) on the headgear (tAj) of the shaikhs, Amcn al-Dcn Baba b. Da’edFaqch, in his RisAla-i Qudsiyya (from a unique MS belonging to Kilisli Rifat Bey)addressed to Sultan Bayezid II in 903/1497–8, also mentions the “alifC tAj” {tallheadgear}, which is famous in Bektashc tradition: Ve bir dahi meczûb-ı mutlak ve mahbûb-ı Hwond-kâr Hacı BektaZ Hazreti”dir kim ol dahî Zol makâma cezb olmuZtur kim aZk âlemidir veaZkın kisvelerinden bir kisve anın baZında elifî tacdır. {ol ma“nâya delâlet eder kim bu cümlemahlûkâtın îcâd olmasının aslı bir elifdendir ve elif hem cemî“ hurûfun aslıdır ve ben ol makâmavardım ve anın sırrına mahrem düZtüm.

He was attracted to that mystical stage, which is the world of love, andone of the garments of love is the alifC tAj on his head. The meaning of this is that theorigin of the creation of all creatures is from an alif {the first letter of the Arabicalphabet}. The alif is the origin of all letters and he reached that stage and becameprivy to its secret. For this reason, he put the symbol of it on his head}. These two"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"THE KHALHFAS AND OARHQA123documents thus demonstrate that not only the Bektashc legend but also the BektashcUarCqa with all its religious ceremonies and rules – even up to the shape and nature ofthe tAj – were established in the ninth/fifteenth century. The most accurate informationon lajjc Bektash and the historical nature of the alifC tAj is found in the reports of‘fshıq Pasha-Zade, one of the leading figures of the ninth/fifteenth century, whichshows that this UarCqa definitely was founded in that century (‘fshıq Pasha-Zade,TawArCkh-i Al-i “uthmAn, pp. 204 – 6). In light of these documents, therefore, the opinionembraced by Jacob that the Bektashc UarCqa has only been in existence since the tenth/sixteenth century (Bektaschijje, vol. 2, p. 20) collapses, and it is obvious that its originmust be pushed further back. [ For more extensive and bibliographic informationon the Bektashc UarCqa and the views and research on this matter, see, YA, s.v. “Bektaz”( F. Köprülü).] {Now see, for example, Suraiya Faroqhi, Der Bektaschi-Orden in Anatolien( Vienna, 1981); Irène Melikoff, Hadji Bektach un mythe et ses avatars ( Leiden, 1998); andEIr, s.v. “Bekta⁄” and “Bekta⁄cya” ( H.

The comment of the author {Tashköprü-Zade} of al-ShaqA”iq on the meaningof this belongs to a later period. Amasyalı Hüseyin Hüsâmeddin {Amasya tarihi( Istanbul, 1328/1910)} alleges, based on waqf documents, that lajjc Bektash Veli diedbefore 691/1292 (see Chapter 7, p. 228, n.30 of the present work). There are supple-mentary details on the Bektashiyya below in Chapter 10, pp. 366–7.62 During the ninth/fifteenth century, disciples of Faql Allah lurefc spread to Anatolia.We know that among them was the famous ‘Alc ‘l-A‘la who went to Anatolia wherehe established himself in a Bektashc tekke and then propagated lurefc beliefs in thename of the Bektashiyya. He died in 822/1419 (see yshak Efendi’s KâZifü”l-esrâr vedâfi“ü”l-eZrâr {Istanbul, 1290/1873 – 4}. Prof. Browne and Dr Jacob have also acceptedthis opinion about the lurefiyya’s penetration of the Bektashiyya). The author {larcrc-Zade} of TibyAn-i wasA”il also agrees with this, “lajjc Bektash named no one as hiskhalCfa while he was alive. Later, someone belonging to the lurefc sect named ‘Alc‘l-A‘la, known by the title ‘Ishıq,’ arrived and claimed to be lajjc Bektash Veli’skhalCfa.’ Many people adopted his UarCqa and thus went astray and led others astray.They were a troop of zindCqs who regarded as {religiously} permissable the renuncia-tion of prayer and {other} things that are forbidden” (vol. 1, art. “Bektâzîye”). I willdescribe in the second part of this book a number of men who had propagated beliefscontrary to the SharC“a under the name of nefism in Anatolia before the Ottomans.Furthermore, we know very well that a forceful political policy was pursued againstthe lurefcs with the encouragement of the “ulamA” in the ninth/fifteenth century({Tashköprü-Zade,} al-ShaqA”iq, {Turkish} trans., vol. 1, art. “Fakhr al-Dcn ‘Ajamc,”pp. 82–3), and we also encounter numerous similar actions in subsequent periods.There are also some important references in tenth/sixteenth-century documents tothe ıshıqs – i.e. lurefc dervishes – mentioned in the TibyAn-i wasA”il. Faqcrc, a poet ofthat century, describes them in his famous work, RisAla-i ta“rCfAt in the followingmanner, which can serve to indicate the general opinion about them:IZık oldur ki olamaz hep de hâricKamu lûtî ve bengî vü havârîc“Alî aZkında yanub Zöyle piZmiZCihânda onsekiz kez ton deXiZmiZYanında cür“adan yancıklarıdırSanasın Kerbelâ kancıklarıdır"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE124{IZıks are those who. . .

Absolutely no historical study has beendone to date on the spread of the lurefiyya in Anatolia. Rızâ Tevfik’s studies onthis subject and the information provided by Huart are not really critical historicalstudies (Textes Persans relatifs à la secte des Houroufis [ Leiden, 1909]). Details on thisword ıshıq, which had appeared by the eighth/fourteenth century, can be found inmy still unpublished work on the Bektashiyya. One can show that this word existedbefore the establishment of the lurefiyya and that it meant not only lurefc, butalso more generally bAUinC.

This byname hqanc has no relationship to the word CqAn, whose meaning– certain knowledge, knowing without doubt – is well known.64 See above (Chapter 3, pp. 58 – 61) for all the details corroborating this. Accordingto the information provided by legendary accounts and history books, which areunanimous in this respect {this is not the case}, Shaikh Yesuf Hamadanc was a murCdof Shaikh Abe ‘Alc Farmadc, so that he was an associate of the same shaikh as thefamous al-Ghazalc {d. 1111}, the author of IRyA” “ulEm al-dCn. Just as the nefism ofImam al-Ghazalc was based completely on the Koran and the sunna, the opinionsabout nefism of Yesuf Hamadanc, who was brought up under the instruction of thesame shaikh, are essentially no different. In order to see clearly and categorically thefundamental points of similarity between numerous ideas and teachings of ShaikhYesuf Hamadanc, who felt great reverence toward Abe lancfa, and the ideas ofArmad Yasawc, see Chapter 5 below.65 {Most of this is Köprülü’s invention.}66 “Of the two forms of nefism, the ‘Western=Arab’ and ‘Eastern=Irano-Indian,’ thelatter is more original. Central Asian nefism is connected to this second form ofnefism, the creation of which was owed to Arians or Indo-Iranians. Both forms ofnefism were propagated in the Middle Ages by profound and elegant philosopherslike Armad Yasawc (sixth/twelfth century) and Baha’ al-Dcn Naqshband (eighth/four-teenth century). The murCd was slowly made cognizant of absolute wisdom {Rikmat-imuUlaq} as he went from the SharC“a to the UarCqa, to spiritual knowledge {ma“rifa}, andfinally reached the spiritual vision of God {RaqCqa}” (Pierre Kouznietsov, La Lutte descivilizations et des langues dans l’Asie Centrale [ Paris, 1912], pp. 131–2).

Certain phenomena like this, which are immediately noticeable and worthyof attention, were alluded to in the second chapter of the present book. As studies onTurkish ethnography and history gradually increase, it will be possible to do seriousresearch on such phenomena.70 [ Köprülü stated for the first time in his Les Origines de l ’Empire Ottoman ( Paris, 1935),pp. 118 ff, Turkish trans., Osmanlı devleti”nin kuruluZu (Ankara, 1959), pp. 98 ff, 2nd edn(Ankara, 1972), based on his recent research, that it was necessary to change hisopinion according to which he had described the Naqshbandiyya and Yasawiyya ashaving the same basis {Köprülü mentions only the Qalandariyya, cf. the Englishtrans., pp. 104 –5}. Later, in his article “Ahmet Yesevî” in YA, he pointed out, basedespecially on the research he had done on the origins of the Bektashiyya and newdocuments that he had acquired, that the Baba’c, laidarc, and Bektashc traditionsand the stories about Armad Yasawc were much closer to historical reality than theway he had described both the nefc personality of Armad Yasawc and the characterof the Yasawc UarCqa in Early Mystics. For more extensive bibliographic information onArmad Yasawc than that found in Early Mystics, see the aforesaid article in YA.]{Köprülü’s newer views have been followed by Irène Mélikoff, Ahmet Yazar Ocak,and most other Turkish writers. See, for example, Ocak’s collected studies Türk sufîliXinebakıZlar ( Istanbul, 1996). Nevertheless, these views do not reflect Central Asian sources.}71 {Köprülü’s account of the spread of the Yasawcyya in Central Asia is pure fantasy.}72 {Köprülü does not prove any of this. He only insists on it. The historical Yasawc orderis found above all in the Persophone parts of Central Asia, and its literary legacy isalmost entirely in Persian.}73‘flc, Kunh al-akhbAr, rukn-i thAlith, juz”-i thAlith, p. 11.74 {lazcnc,} JawAhir, biography of Sayyid Manter.75 It suffices to take a quick glance at {nafc’s} RashaRAt in order to understand thisobvious fact. A long and separate study is required in order to explain the importanceof the Naqshbandiyya in Central Asia, especially in the ninth/fifteenth and tenth/sixteenth centuries. In order to give a general idea about this, let me simply say thatnot only did the Tcmerid family give great importance to the Naqshbandc shaikhs inthe ninth/fifteenth century (see { Jamc,} NafaRAt; RashaRAt, {Turkish} trans.; Jamc’sbiographical dictionary {sic, i.e. NafaRAt} and other works {such as TuRfat al-aRrAr}),but during the reign of the Shibanids in the tenth/sixteenth century – thanks tothe fact that all members of the ruling family were murCds of Naqshbandc shaikhs – theNaqshbandiyya also gained very great importance throughout Transoxiana (see thedescriptions given of the Shibanid rulers in {Nitharc Bukharc’s} Mudhakkir al-aRbAb).{See EI2, s.v. “Nasshband” (H. Algar) and “Nasshbanidyya” (H. Algar et al.}76 The dhikr-i arra, for example, constituted one of the chief characteristics of theYasawiyya. We can see clearly in this dhikr the vestiges of certain types of behaviorthat were peculiar to the Qazaq bakhshis {saint, sorcerer, popular poet}. {Köprülü iscertain that something in the “behavior” of Qazaq bakhshis shaped the Yasawc dhikr-i"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE126arra; even assuming that what he meant to say was that the Qazaq bakhshis continueda tradition that went back to earlier Turks whom Armad Yasawc wanted to reach byadjusting the dhikr to suit their tastes. Köprülü seems intent on seeing the bakhshisas more Turkic than Muslim, and never seems to have considered that perhaps thebakhshis’ chants resemble the dhikr because the Qazaqs adopted the latter.} The informa-tion given by the author of RisAla-i BAburiyya, one Armad b. Mawlana Jalal al-Dcnal-Kasanc, is very worthy of note in this regard: Sâdât-ı NakZbendîye zikr-i hafîyi ihtiyârbuyurmuZlardır; fakat bâzıları muktezâ-yı hâl olarak zikr-i cehrî de yaparlar.

In fact, on being authorized to depart forTurkistan, Khwaja Armad Yasawc saw that the people there did not think much ofthe dhikr-i khafC and he immediately took the way of the dhikr-i jahrC and from this thedhikr-i arra was created. Many people were honored by this good fortune} (from theunique MS in the Baxdadlı Vehbî Library {in the Süleymaniye in Istanbul}). Marmedal-Kashgharc states, in fact, that the shaikhs were in great demand among, and wereshown great respect by, the Turks in the fifth/eleventh century (DCwAn lughAt al-turk,vol. 1, p. 294). It would be quite natural that a UarCqa founded by a Turk amongthe Turks would acquire the imprint of the environment in which it developed. {Themanuscript of the RisAla-i BAburiyya is not unique, but it was no doubt the only copyknown to Köprülü. He was unfamiliar with the substantial body of hagiographicalliterature produced in Central Asia within nefc circles linked to the Naqshbandc,Yasawc, and Kubrawc traditions.

In fact, we can presume, with a high degree oflikelihood, that this title was given to it later. We know for certain that this typeof poetry was called Rikmat at least since the fourth/tenth century, given that wedo not have any clear documentation of the term before then.1The DCwAn-i Likmat has great importance among the literary works producedby the Turks in several respects. First, because Armad Yasawc died in the sixth/twelfth century, this work is the oldest example of Muslim Turkish literature {tocome down to us} after {Yesuf Khatt lajib’s} Kutadgu Bilig. Such a work,belonging to a period for which we have few linguistic and literary products,naturally has very great linguistic as well as literary historical value.2 Second,because the DCwAn-i Likmat was the first work to take many elements of the oldfolk literature and express the spirit of Islam through them, i.e. by means of theancient national forms and meters, we must consider it to be the oldest and mostimportant monument of Turkish nefc literature. It is for this reason that theDCwAn-i Likmat has long attracted the attention of Orientalists and, although theproper study of it could not be undertaken until now, some piecemeal researchhas been done on it and some sections have even been published and translatedinto Western languages.3Because the DCwAn-i Likmat circulated for centuries, especially among theEastern and Northern Turks – the Uzbeks, Qazaqs, and Volga Tatars – virtuallyas a sacred text, we can find innumerable manuscripts of it and, more recently,even some printed editions. Unfortunately, my analysis of many of the manuscriptshas not yielded any positive result with regard to linguistic and literary history,i.e. it has been impossible to find an early manuscript of this important work.4"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE128With respect to the printed editions, as far as I know, this work was publishedonce in Istanbul, four times in Kazan, and once in Tashkent in a lithographicedition.5 However, all these editions were based on recent manuscripts that areby no means trustworthy, so we currently possess no edition derived from anearly accurate manuscript on which reliable research can be done.6It is immediately obvious {for example} that the present Istanbul edition ofthe DCwAn-i Likmat, even when examined superficially, consists of a hodgepodgeof pieces written by very different authors at different times; for one thing, pennames of the poets suffice to show this. In the Istanbul edition, there are worksof different poets like Shams, Shah-Mashrab, and lakcm Sulaiman Ata, while inthe Kazan editions there are also two pieces by another poet with the pen nameQel Gharcb (Rikmats number 102 and 126 in the fourth Kazan edition). With theexception of these five or six pieces in the Istanbul edition and the others in theKazan editions, all the remaining sections belong to poets who used several veryclosely related pen names, like Qel Khwaja Armad, Khwaja Armad Yasawc,Yasawc, and Armad Miskcn; or, much more likely, to a single poet who used allthese closely related names. Indeed, according to the current general view, theperson who used all these pen names was Armad Yasawc and all of these poemswere very early products of sixth/twelfth-century Turkish. This view, which isnot based on definitive proof, has been so pervasive up to the present as to havebeen accepted as an absolute fact in both popular and scholarly circles.I do not hesitate, even if it at first seems strange, to assert my opposition to thisgeneral view. For one thing, we possess historical and literary evidence to showthat all the works written under the pen names mentioned above, i.e. Qel KhwajaArmad, Armad Miskcn, etc., cannot be attributed to Armad Yasawc. Unfortu-nately, in one of these many poems (Rikmat number 88 in the fourth edition), thefamous poet and nefc Nescmc is mentioned! A poet who died in 562/1166 –7would not, of course, be able to mention a nefc poet who appeared two centurieslater, even with his miraculous power!7 In two other poems in the DCwAn-i Likmatin our possession, two famous disciples of Armad Yasawc, Baba Machcn (Rikmatnumber 47 in the Kazan edition and number 131 in the Istanbul edition), andSulaiman lakcm Ata (Rikmat number 77), about both of whom we spoke at lengthabove, are mentioned, whereas the likelihood is so remote as to be virtuallyimpossible that Armad Yasawc himself would speak of his disciples. In additionto this varied historical evidence, which is categorical and incontrovertible, thereare also a number of linguistic and literary considerations that strongly supportmy previous assertion. Among the poems that constitute the DCwAn-i Likmat, thereare some very well composed {muntaVam} poems written in the various “arEQmeters, which, for those who have studied even a little the development of theliterary language, are impossible to accept as products of the sixth/twelfth century.8What can we deduce from all these considerations? Given the present extent ofour knowledge and the fact that we do not possess a manuscript of the DCwAn-iLikmat from the sixth/twelfth, seventh/thirteenth, or eighth/fourteenth centuries,it is not possible to reach a definite judgment in this matter. Did this dCwAn,"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh129which we today attribute to Armad Yasawc, actually belong to another poetnamed Armad who was a Yasawc dervish? Based on what we have said above,we would surely have to attribute an important part of the DCwAn-i Likmat,especially the poems written in the “arEQ meters to such a person. Because hementions Nescmc, this poet must not be from a time prior to the ninth/fifteenthcentury, but neither could he be much later. In order to be able later to attributethe Rikmats that he wrote to Armad Yasawc, this poet would surely have had tohave lived in the ninth/fifteenth century or early tenth/sixteenth century.Would it not be correct to attribute the entire DCwAn-i Likmat to a poet otherthan Armad Yasawc and, because of a similarity in name, to conclude that hewas later confused with Armad Yasawc? In my view, this possibility cannot bewholly rejected. We know for certain that Armad Yasawc wrote Rikmats in formstaken from popular literature9 and that subsequently the writing of poems inthis style actually became a tradition among the Yasawc dervishes. It is verylikely, however, that the Rikmats that Armad Yasawc wrote have been lost overthe centuries and that the works of a poet of the same name who appeared laterhave been attributed to him because of his fame and spiritual influence amongthe people. Indeed, in the manuscripts presently in our possession, it is statedin several places that this work is the Daftar-i thAnC {the Second Notebook}.10Perhaps the Yasawc poet who compiled this dCwAn considered the work of KhwajaArmad Yasawc to be the “first daftar,” and because his own work was composedof Rikmats in the same form and style and was given the same name, i.e.DCwAn-iLikmat, he regarded it as the “second daftar.” If the names of both dCwAns andboth authors were the same, and if there was a profound and genuine similarityin the poems of both poets with respect to form, style, and spirit, the work of themore recent poet could quite easily have been later attributed to the famousolder nefc.Still, we might conclude that even if the Rikmats presently in our possession donot belong to Armad Yasawc, they are completely indistinguishable in form andspirit from those that did belong to him, because, as will become quite apparentwhen we discuss the followers of Armad Yasawc, even centuries after him Rikmatsof the same kind were written in the same form, style, and spirit. Nevertheless,we should not think that this was something peculiar to Armad Yasawc and hisfollowers. This uniformity sometimes continued for centuries in the nefc literat-ure written in the popular meters and forms. The reason for this is not only thatthe products of popular literature continued for centuries to be indistinguishablefrom each other, but also that later writers tried to imitate their predecessors,and that the followers of the great pCrs ascribed a virtual sanctity to the forms thatthey had established. Nevertheless, despite all these considerations, there alsoexists the strong possibility that the text of the DCwAn-i Likmat in our possessionis a mixed product composed of works belonging to both Armad Yasawc andto a Yasawc dervish named Armad who lived in the ninth/fifteenth or tenth/sixteenth century. In any case, no matter which of the various possibilities thatwe have considered is preferred or accepted, the literary personality of Armad"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE130Yasawc and the early unknown stages of Turkish nefc literature can be illuminatedby studying the DCwAn-i Likmat in our possession.11B Linguistic characterI have briefly recounted above the very rapid spread, via Iran, of Islam toCentral Asia, to the Syr Darya region, and even to countries further east, such asKashghar and its environs. I also described how Transoxiana became completelyMuslim in the Samanid period and how the people of Isfcjab12 adopted Islamunder the very first Samanid ruler (Chapter 1, pp. 5– 6). Because we do notpossess an early reliable copy of the DCwAn-i Likmat, it is necessary to study inparticular some linguistic history and provide some brief information on thegeographic areas of the Turkish dialects in the fifth/eleventh and sixth/twelfthcenturies in order to place the DCwAn-i Likmat in its proper linguistic sphere. Inaddition, by clarifying the meaning of “Chaghatay” and “Uighur” {as adjectivesdescribing languages} – terms that have been used continuously up to the present– it will also be useful to show the extent to which the DCwAn-i Likmat justifies itsappraisal, with respect to its linguistic and literary features, as the earliest workof Chaghatay literature. Until now, Turkish linguistic history has been almostcompletely neglected in scholarly studies, and so there has been no serious researchon these questions to which one can refer. At the same time, because linguisticsis outside my area of expertise, I expect that the information that I will presenton this matter, and some of the ideas that I will advance, will {later} have to bere-examined and criticized by specialists in this field.Marmed al-Kashgharc provides information in his DCwAn lughAt al-turk, com-piled in the years during which the Kutadgu Bilig was being written in Kashghar,on the contemporary dialects and geographical locations of the various branchesof the Turks. According to him, the Turks were distributed from west to east inthe fifth/eleventh century in the following manner: first came the Pechenegs,who were closest to the Byzantine lands, and then the Qipchaqs, Oghuz, Yimak,Bashqird, Basmıl, Qay, Yabaqu, Tatars, and Qirghiz. From north to south, theywere distributed as follows: Chigil, Tokhsı, Yaghma, Ughraq, Charuq, Chomul,and Uighur. After all of these, {further east} came the Tangut, Khiuay, andMachin.13 According to al-Kashgharc, who knew all these branches and theirlanguages very well, the most eloquent form of Turkish was that used by thosewho knew only one language, who did not mix with the Persians, and who didnot settle in the cities, whereas the languages of those, like the Sughdaq, Ganjak,and Arghu, who knew a second language and lived with city people, becameenfeebled.14 According to al-Kashgharc, nomads like the Chomul, Qay, Yabaqu,Basmıl, and Tatars had separate languages, but they also knew Turkish well. AsI explain at length in the note below,15 I believe it is necessary to interpret andclarify this report to mean “they did not have separate languages but their owndistinct dialects that could be included within the general Turkish linguisticsphere and, in addition, they knew the common Eastern Turkish that was called"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh131Khaqaniyya Turkish.” As for the other branches of the Turks whom al-Kashgharcdiscusses, the Qirghiz, Qipchaqs, Oghuz, Tokhsı, Yaghma, Chigil, Ughraq, andCharuq had a common language that was pure Turkish;16 the language of theYimak and Bashqird/Bashghırd was also close to theirs; the language of theBulghars, Suwars, and Pechenegs, who extended toward the west, was uniformlyTurkish but had a slightly different pronunciation {takhfCf}.17 Among these variousdialects, that of the Oghuz was the most khafCf {lightest}; that of the Yaghma,Tokhsı, and those who lived along the banks of the Ila, Irtish, Yamar, and Volgarivers in the direction of Uighuristan was the most correct; and that of theMulek-i Khaqaniyya {Khaqanc kings} and those who lived with them was themost eloquent.18These brief characterizations by al-Kashgharc, as obscure as they are import-ant, {at least} give us a fairly clear and concise idea of the number of Turkishdialects in the fifth/eleventh century and their relationships and resemblances toeach other. It seems quite clear that Turkish was divided into two major linguisticgroups in that period, Eastern and Western. Eastern Turkish, which the authorcalls Khaqaniyya Turkish or Turkish in general, was the literary dialect that wasspoken in Kashghar in particular and was used throughout that region. It was veryclose to the Chigil, Yaghma, Arghu, Tokhsı, and Uighur dialects. As for WesternTurkish, which constituted the second major group, it was the dialect of theOghuz, which was extremely close to the dialects of the Qipchaqs and Yimak,and also close to those of the Pechenegs and Bulghars. It is quite clear from theDCwAn lughAt al-turk that by the fifth/eleventh century, there were a number ofspecific and significant differences between these two great groups, i.e. KhaqaniyyaTurkish and Oghuz Turkish, with regard to grammar and phonology.19Among these two dialects, the Eastern dialect, i.e. the language of Kashghar,had especially great importance in the fifth/eleventh century. The languages ofthe other Eastern Turks who lived further to the east and who had not enteredthe milieu of Islam were naturally also very close to the language of Kashgharwith respect to grammar and phonology. Al-Kashgharc mentions them underthe name “Uighur” and states clearly that their languages were pure Turkishand that they used the Uighur script. Only because they had not entered theMuslim milieu was there no discernible Arabic or Muslim Persian influenceamong them.20 Both the Oghuz and the Khaqaniyya Turks employed the Uighurscript; but because the level of civilization of the Oghuz at that time was lowerthan that of the Khaqaniyya Turks, the literary language in the Oghuz regionwas Khaqaniyya Turkish, i.e. the dialect spoken in Kashghar and its vicinity.While discussing the Uighur script, al-Kashgharc says, “All the Turkish countriesfrom Kashghar to Upper China have used this script, from the most ancienttimes up to today (i.e. around the end of the fifth/eleventh century), in thecorrespondence of their khAqAns and sultans and in their books.” This briefpassage shows that much was written in Khaqaniyya Turkish since rather earlytimes and that the Uighur script was used for it.21 Al-Kashgharc adds that thesame spelling system was used for all documents written in this script.22"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE132According to the Russian scholar V. Grigor’ev and the French OrientalistGrenard, who relied on him, the language of Kashghar, i.e. Khaqaniyya Turkish,was Qarluq Turkish,23 because the founders of the Kashghar Khaqanate,according to their research, were not Uighurs, i.e. Toquz Oghuz, but Qarluqs.These Qarluqs, who lived among the Göktürk tribes north of the T’ien-ShanRange, migrated to the west of Issik-Kul with some other Göktürk tribes whowould not accept Uighur rule after the collapse of the Göktürk state in thesecond/eighth century and occupied Tashkent and Farghana. The descendantsof their chiefs expanded {their authority} like the Göktürks as far as China, i.e.as far as the Wolf clan.24 Supplementing the information provided by al-Mas‘edc,but from another point of view, Istakhrc states unequivocally that these Qarluqs,who were referred to as Turks, had spread toward the east and that it took amonth’s journey, starting at Farghana and passing through the Qarluqs, to reachthe country of the Toquz Oghuz.25 This report, which shows that the KhaqaniyyaTurks in {al-Kashgarc’s} DCwAn lughAt al-turk were Qarluqs and that we mustconsider them to be a Turkish tribe separate from the Uighurs but related tothe old Göktürk social structure, also clearly indicates that the Kutadgu Bilig islinguistically related to the Orkhon Inscriptions, which belong to these sameGöktürks.26 This clear connection, which was first proposed by Thomsen andlater confirmed by Radloff, can also be considered as linguistic evidence tosupport the historical analysis that I have been giving here.27In the fifth/eleventh century, while Kashghar Turkish, i.e. Eastern Turkish,prevailed in the eastern areas where the Qarluqs lived – from Kashghar to theenvirons of Farghana, Tashkent, and Samarqand – Oghuz Turkish, i.e. WesternTurkish, which constituted the other great linguistic domain, had spread to awide area in the west, especially from the Syr Darya region south as far asKhurasan. According to al-Kashgharc, in the fifth/eleventh century the principalcities of the Oghuz were along the Syr Darya and the nomads among them alsolived on both banks of this river.28 According to the accounts of the other Arabhistorians and geographers, these Western Oghuz, who had separated from theEastern Toquz Oghuz, had spread to the Syr Darya region from Gurgan {sic} toFarab and Isfcjab. There were Khazar and Bulghar Turks to the west of them,Qarluqs to the east, and Kimeks to the north.29 Also, during this century, someof the Oghuz migrated to Mangıshlak and settled there.30 Some of these OghuzTurkmen who had already entered the Islamic realm in the fourth/tenth centuryalso descended upon the area around Bukhara toward the end of the fourth/tenth century. Among them appeared the Seljuk dynasty that founded a powerfulsultanate in Asia. During the period of their sultanate, Asia Minor and Azerbaijanwere strongly Turkified by this Oghuz migration. After this, no great movementof the Oghuz who remained in the East has been recorded. We only know thatin 548/1153 – 4, the Oghuz who lived around Balkh revolted against SultanSanjar and wreaked havoc on Khurasan and the surrounding area, but thiswas neither ethnographically nor linguistically significant. The places that wereabandoned by the Oghuz north of the Caspian and Aral seas in the Syr Darya"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh133area were filled by the Qipchaqs, who were a large branch of the Kimeks. By421/1030 –1, we find the Qipchaqs adjacent to Khwarazm.31This then was the linguistic situation in the Kashghar and Syr Darya areasof Central Asia in the fourth/tenth and fifth/eleventh centuries, i.e. before theMongol invasion. Given the paucity of contemporary historical and linguisticdocuments and the confusing and obscure references of the early historiansand geographers, this summary {of the available material} that I have presentedis certainly not very clear. Nevertheless, despite this vagueness, in light of theanalysis given above, I think the linguistic character that must be ascribed toArmad Yasawc’s DCwAn-i Likmat is fairly clear. Armad Yasawc was born in thecity of Sairam/Isfcjab in the vicinity of Isfcjab {sic}, which early on had adoptedIslam.32 If we consider that al-Kashgharc regarded the places that stretchedfrom Isfcjab to Balasaghen to be the Arghu region,33 then it would appear thatArmad Yasawc was also an Arghu Turk. The same writer adds that the peopleof Balasaghen, oaraz, and Madcnat al-Baiqa, i.e. Sairam, spoke both Soghdianand Turkish and hence – because of foreign influence – the language of theinhabitants of the Arghu region had to some degree lost its vigor.34 Becausethe Arghu dialect can be included in the same linguistic domain as that of theKhaqaniyya Turks, it is certain that Armad Yasawc’s mother tongue was notthe Oghuz dialect.35 To be sure, he might have encountered Oghuz in placeswhere he subsequently traveled, in Bukhara, for example. We do not know theextent to which the Oghuz, after they descended from the Syr Darya region,mingled with the local people in Central Asia and Khurasan and, at the sametime, with other branches of the Turks and whether they had any linguisticinfluences on each other.36 We can only say for certain that when Armad Yasawclater went to Yasc a significant number of Oghuz had already migrated fromthat region, and those who had remained had mixed with Qipchaqs who hadcome down from the north and with other Turks who had come from variousdirections. Therefore, even if there might have been some Oghuz influence onhis language, we cannot include it in the Oghuz linguistic sphere generally. Inother words, we must definitely accept his work as a product of Eastern Turkish.If we possessed an early and trustworthy copy of the DCwAn-i Likmat, it wouldsurely show a number of linguistic features very similar to those in {Yesuf Khattlajib’s} Kutadgu Bilig; although it was under much stronger Arab and Persianinfluence – and even perhaps a bit under the influence of the old Oghuz dialect– it would belong, broadly speaking, to the same language domain as the KutadguBilig. However, even if the copies that we currently possess contain some genuinepieces of Armad Yasawc’s work, they will have been corrupted as they passedthrough the hands of various copyists over the centuries and will have lost almostall their original character. Such pieces, if they exist, would thus have no seriousvalue for linguistic history.37Some researchers – including, first of all, Vambéry and then Thúry – jumpedto conclusions about the linguistic character of the DCwAn-i Likmat, although theydid not make a proper analysis of it and were ignorant of the historical personality"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE134of Armad Yasawc. They claimed that the language of the DCwAn-i Likmat was thedialect of the Khanate of Khokand.38 Later, certain other researchers – Thúryalso among them – considered it to be, along with Rabghezc’s QiTaT al-anbiyA”, oneof the early works in the Chaghatay dialect, and regarded it as an intermediatework between the Kutadgu Bilig and the language of Nawa’c.39 Prof. Hartmannalso considers the work of Armad Yasawc to be in Chaghatay, {defined as} theliterary language of the area extending from the Caspian Sea to Kansu, andstates that even later poets, like Chimyanlı Hüveyda, remained linguisticallyfaithful to it as much as possible.40 In light of the thorough description that Ihave given above of the copies of the DCwAn-i Likmat in our possession (sectionA of this chapter), however, I hope it is clear that in order to truly determinethe linguistic character of this important work, we must not study the printededitions or recent manuscripts, but must find a very early manuscript or, if this isnot possible, investigate the milieu in which Armad Yasawc lived and wrote hisRikmats and the linguistic area to which it belonged. I reported briefly in theprevious paragraph the results of my research in this respect and said that wemust consider the DCwAn-i Likmat as belonging to the same linguistic domainas the Kutadgu Bilig, i.e. to be a work in the Eastern dialect connected with theQarluqs. Until the appearance of an early and trustworthy copy of the DCwAn-iLikmat written before the Mongol invasion, the current state of our knowledgewill not allow us to state categorically the linguistic area to which it belonged.The fact that the recent unreliable copies currently in our possession belongcompletely to the dialect that we call Chaghatay means nothing. Nevertheless,despite the continuing lack of an early and accurate copy of the text and therather astounding primitive character of the current research on Turkish linguistichistory, I am of the opinion that the hypothesis that I have advanced on thisquestion is based on a rather strong foundation.41C Literary characterIn order to explain properly the literary nature of the collection of poetry thatwe possess today under the general title of DCwAn-i Likmat, we must subject it toa minute analysis with respect to both subject and form. The subject matter inthe DCwAn-i Likmat is very simple and limited: countless eulogies of the virtuesof dervishes and the dervish life; the most famous Muslim legends, from which,finally, ethical and religious morals are inevitably drawn; various pieces on thelife and miracles of the Prophet Murammad; anecdotes; complaints aboutthe state of the world and ascetic complaints written to remind {the reader} thatthe Day of Judgment is near; and finally simple and primitive, yet lively, accountstold with a simple-hearted appeal about conditions in heaven and hell, thedemons of hell, and the female and male denizens of paradise {s. RErC andghulAm}, and the gardens of paradise. At a time when Islam was just beginning tospread among the Turks, it was quite natural that works written by a nefc for amass of people with simple and primitive tastes – and who had not yet succeeded"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh135in completely escaping from the customs and beliefs of the ancient pagan period– would not go beyond these subjects.Armad Yasawc was by no means a stranger to the Islamic sciences andPersian literature. Much of his education and religious training took place inMuslim Persian intellectual centers, so he knew very well the mystical works ofthe great early Persian nefc poets. However, given the need to address the Turks,who had sincerely but still superficially adopted Islam, and who would not easilyabandon their national culture, it was necessary, willy-nilly, to conform to theirtastes and customs and to address them in a simple language whose meaningthey would understand and in a meter to whose music they were accustomed. Itwas simply under the influence of such powerful factors as these that ArmadYasawc adopted the national syllabic meter, which the people loved and thepopular poets had used for centuries, rather than the harmonious “arEQ meterscultivated by the Persians. He wrote all his Rikmats in this meter and in the oldnational forms that were also taken from popular literature. In this regard, it isnot pertinent to claim that the language had not been cultivated to an extentthat it was comfortable with the “arEQ meters, because the Kutadgu Bilig clearlydemonstrates that the “arEQ metrical system had been employed in Turkish liter-ature some sixty or seventy years earlier. The single reason for this phenomenonwas, as I stated above, the desire of the poet to address the mass of the peopledirectly.42 Nevertheless, if we had an early copy of the DCwAn-i Likmat, it is almostcertain that its language, despite the author’s desire to compose it in a very plainmanner so that it could be understood by the greatest possible number, wouldcontain a much greater mixture of Arabic and Persian words than the KutadguBilig, which was bound to the Persian meter.43Armad Yasawc wrote most of his Rikmats in the seven- or twelve-syllable meterslong used and much beloved among the people of Central Asia. These meters,which have a strange somewhat monotone harmony, and, at the same time, asomewhat primitive and crude but “original” flavor, do not reveal anythingextraordinary in his hands. Even in passages requiring the greatest display ofemotion, he is very cool and calm. The plodding nature of his admonitions, thesimple and monotonous expression of his narratives, and the calm and dignifiedmanner of his prayers almost never change. The staid and rigid personality ofthis Central Asian Turk, usually indifferent to the rapture and excitement of theinner life, but outwardly completely faithful to the fundamental principles of theSharC“a, is immediately apparent in the DCwAn-i Likmat. In order to provide somemovement and excitement in the heavy monotonous harmony of the seven- andtwelve-syllable meters, an artistic and emotional soul would have had to breathelife into it. In the meters that he selected, Armad Yasawc conformed to thecommon taste of the period and completely avoided any personal innovations.With regard to rhyme as well, he had no attachment to Arabic and Persianand remained completely faithful to the national literary tradition. Rather thanuse full rhymes, he followed popular literature and used half rhymes, usuallycomposing them from the inflections of the verbs, and for the most part stuck to"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE136the old radCf {repetition of the word at the end of each couplet} method.44 Hisinterest in respecting the early folk literary tradition fully reveals itself in his formof versification. Armad Yasawc, who saidÜçyüzaltmıZ hikmet aytıb dâstân aytıDâstân aytı bûstân içra oymak ucun{He uttered 360 Rikmats and dastAnsin order to penetrate (?) in the garden}arranged all of his Rikmats according to this ancient and thoroughly nationalform. In these dastAns, composed of four-verse stanzas or quatrains, the last verseof the first stanza is sometimes repeated in all the stanzas like a refrain. The firstthree verses of each stanza rhyme, while the last verse rhymes with the last versesof all the stanzas. Usually the first stanza differs from the others with the firstverse rhyming with the third and the second with the fourth {thus: abab cccbdddb etc.}. This form of versification, which is very limited and primitive, isapparently the native form and completely devoid of foreign influence. Therepetition at the end of each stanza, either of an entire verse or of a rhyme,shows that it was written not for the purpose of being read privately like worksbelonging to later periods of development, but in order to be recited publicly inreligious gatherings. In other words, Armad Yasawc’s work was in this respect nodifferent from the products of the early folk literature.45D Yasaw¢, ∞§f¢In the chapters above, I have discussed the time when Khwaja Armad Yasawclived, his milieu, the various influences under which he developed, and the basiccharacteristics of the UarCqa that he established. If readers will recall these descrip-tions, they will easily grasp the extent to which Armad Yasawc can be called a“nefc poet” and the degree to which this title, when applied to him, is compre-hensive and all encompassing. This great Turkish shaikh, who, from childhooduntil his last years, lived a vigorous and sincere nefc life, wrote poetry for theenlightenment of the Turks who could not understand the nefc works in Arabicand Persian and for the purpose of confirming the mystical truths and instillingthem in his disciples. It was therefore quite natural that the mystical characterof his poetry should come to the fore. As I explained above (section A of thischapter), even a superficial analysis of the DCwAn-i Likmat – which, even if it doesnot belong to Armad Yasawc, we naturally concluded that in form and spiritit would be identical with those works that did belong to him – proves thispoint sufficiently. This nefc, who had a very simple imagination and was almostcompletely unfamiliar with literary art, was, like all other nefcs, indifferent tothe external world and its manifestations. Engrossed as he was in the world ofmonism, he could, in the end, liken this world and the next world “to two poppy"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh137seeds.”46 The only thing that preoccupied him was the thought of guiding thepeople and encouraging them along the right path. The religious legends that herecounted, the prayers, pleas for God’s help, and requests for God’s forgiveness,were all written with this noble thought in mind. In the various poems that hewrote about the Prophet and in the Rikmats that deal with eschatological subjects,he called upon everyone to follow the right path and begged God’s forgivenessfor his own shortcomings and sins. His most common recommendations wereto listen to the words of the saints, to conform to the stipulations of the Koran andLadCth, to combine SharC”a with UarCqa, to abandon this world of vanity, and toturn to the path of asceticism and religious striving {mujAhada}. Like all the nefcs,he complained of the condition of this world. With a very sincere and consumingpassion he bemoaned the fact that no one heeded the words of the true saintsand that everyone was a captive of his own base desire {nafs-i ammAra}.Because he was of the lanafc madhhab, he always venerated and praised the“Imam A‘vam” {the most magnificent imAm, i.e. Abe lancfa} and the foundersof the other Sunnc madhhabs. Indeed, there is a long and noteworthy legend inthe DCwAn about how Abe lancfa had miraculously solved a number of com-plicated problems of Islamic law at the age of six and how he received his title.On the other hand, there is absolutely nothing in the DCwAn-i Likmat to suggestShc‘ism or any form of Mu‘tazilism, even to the extent found, for example, inFarcd al-Dcn ‘Auuar.47 Indeed, as I have also explained above, this {i.e. strictSunnism} was one of his governing ideas. Even when he discoursed on thepassion of Manter al-lallaj and the mystery of anA “l-Raqq {al-lallaj’s utterance,“I am the Divine Truth”} and when he said that the mullas did not understandthe mysteries of the UarCqa {i.e. of mysticism}, he would never go beyond acertain point. He strongly promoted renunciation and ascetical exercises as stepson the nefc path. Asceticism, piety, mortification of the flesh, and spiritual strivingwere all most necessary in order to reach the level of truth. It was not easy tofollow the path to Divine Truth {Laqq}. The path of {ecstatic or spiritual} loveof God was very blessed, but it was full of endless difficulties. “The {psychologicaland physical} state of one who enters these tortuous paths is desperate. Many alover has become dust on these paths . . .”48 “In order to become a devotee, onemust enter the garden of love. For its sake, however, one must first kill the self.One must endure many long torments and great tribulations in order that thisbe possible. He who wants to find the pearl of love should be content with onedrop. The true lover who burns with the fire of love loses his own color. His soulis bewildered, his heart is desolate and his eyes are flooded with tears. As theProphet said, {The world is carrion and those who hankerafter it are dogs}. The true lovers are those who give up their own souls and seekthe beloved, union with God. Oh, Khwaja Armad, always think of God andweep. Pray morning and night and keep the fast, so that you may reach yourgoal.” Asceticism and spiritual striving, which occur in this sense in most ofthe Rikmats, indicate the need to withdraw from all worldly matters. For the nefc,in fact, this is the meaning of the Koranic verse (2:278)"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE138{Oh you who believe, fear God!}. If not, one’s heart cannot become “the placeof divine manifestation” {naVar-gAh-i ilAhC}.49 And although Armad Yasawc tellsus that after all these hardships “he drank the wine of union, received preced-ence {sabq} from God, and was aware of the mystery of anA “l-Raqq,” he still didnot reveal the mystery.50In addition to many poems on such themes in the DCwAn-i Likmat, there are anumber of Rikmats on the life of Khwaja Armad Yasawc. This Turkish shaikhrecounted the important events of his life in simple and artless language: how hehad become a friend of Khaqir, in what manner he received blessings fromArslan Baba, and how he had been seized by the love of God since childhood.Stating that he wandered about as an exile in Khurasan, Iraq, and Syria for along time, and then, missing Arslan Baba, that he returned to his own city ofTurkistan {Yasc} and wanted to die there, he mentions his birthplace with greatardor: “Fastening a stone to my heart, I left that blessed Turkistan where I wasborn.” Just as his shaikh, Khwaja Yesuf Hamadanc, became homesick wheneverhe thought of Hamadan, so too did Armad Yasawc harbor a great affection forhis hometown. The DCwAn-i Likmat also clearly relates that, after passing throughvarious cycles {dawra, of religious learning} up to age sixty-three and reachingvarious spiritual stages {maqAm} in the mystic path, he realized that he hadbecome a great “sultan” in the eyes of his disciples and, attributing this to thedictates of the carnal soul {nafs-i ammAra}, he went underground – i.e. enteredthe chilla-khAne – and wrote his Rikmats in isolation from the people.51Now that we have analyzed the contents of the poems in the DCwAn-i Likmat,we can broach the topic of the extent to which it would be suitable to callArmad Yasawc a nefc poet. He cannot be regarded as one of the “Ashıq nefcs whotried to record the candid outcries that burst from their souls and did not pauseto consider whether these outbursts were reconcilable with the external ordinancesof Islamic law. To the contrary, he always took into consideration the mentalityand spiritual state of the community he was addressing. He communicated tothem not the subtleties of nefc philosophy, which they could not understand,but rather a number of legal and ethical principles in a hortatory manner, urgingthem to follow these principles faithfully in order to achieve happiness in thenext world. His lengthy eulogies of the first four caliphs, his ascetic exhortationsto the dervishes to follow the UarCqa, and his bemoaning the evils at the end oftime do not reveal Armad Yasawc to us as a true nefc poet. Yenus Emre said,“He who does not regard the seventy-two sects with the same eye {i.e. as indis-tinguishable} rebels against truth even if he is a madrasa instructor.” One canfind nothing at all in the DCwAn-i Likmat that recalls this broadmindedness andnothing of the pantheist philosophy of Jalal al-Dcn Remc.52 In this respect, ratherthan being a profound poetical nefc work, the DCwAn-i Likmat can be bettercharacterized as a simple work composed of religious and ethical sermons andnarratives as well as didactic poems concerning the principles of the UarCqa andthe rules of the mystical discipline. Armad Yasawc had many nefc ideas, butdespite this he was a dry moralist who lacked true poetic ability or lyrical gift."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh139We can get a clearer idea about this if we compare Armad Yasawc to themoralist nefc poets of Iran who had diverse abilities and talents. In the sixth/twelfth century, when the DCwAn-i Likmat was written, the magnificent nefc liter-ature of Iran was still in the process of formation. After epic literature, epitomizedby Firdawsc, it was the turn of moralistic nefc literature to develop and becomerefined. Among the nefcs who had thrived up to that time, there were somewho wrote a few quatrains or ghazals from time to time. The famous nefc ShaikhAbe Sa‘cd b. Abc ‘l-Khair, who died after the age of eighty in 440/1049 – theadmiration that he and Ibn Scna expressed for each other from the moment oftheir first meeting is well known – recited beautiful quatrains with a lofty andsincere nefc feeling. In the poetry of this great nefc, who says in a famousquatrain{Since I beheld you, my candle of oaraz,I have ceased all work, keep not the fast, nor pray.With you my figurative speech becomes prayer.Apart from you my prayer becomes a mere figure,}53there is a vague pantheistic streak and a free and candid expression of mysticallove, in short, a divine breath.54 Although subsequent nefcs wrote innumerablecommentaries on some of his quatrains,55 Shaikh Abe Sa‘cd was generally knownmuch more as a nefc than as a poet. Thus, we can say that great poets who weredirectly inspired by nefism had not yet appeared.lakcm Sana’c and Farcd al-Dcn ‘Auuar opened the period of great nefcsin Persian literature in the sixth/twelfth century. Following them, Sa‘dc, Jalalal-Dcn Remc, Jamc, and numerous other such poets extended this period. I haveexamined the moralistic nefc works of lakcm Sana’c (d. 545/1150 –1 {probablyd. 525/1131} and Farcd al-Dcn ‘Auuar, who are virtual contemporaries of ArmadYasawc, and I do not believe they had any influence on him.56 Apart from suchcommon elements as encouraging people to join the UarCqa or abandoning {theaffairs of } this world, there is no connection whatsoever in form or style betweenhis Rikmats and the nefc works of these great Persian poets. lakcm Sana’c and‘Auuar were not merely nefcs. They were at the same time great poets, possessingrefined language and a rich imagination. Armad Yasawc, on the other hand,was not a great poet, only a nefc. Unlike the Persian poets who were his contem-poraries, he addressed not an audience that was prepared to understand all thesubtleties of nefism, but rather an audience of simple and primitive folk. Yetneither lakcm Sana’c nor Farcd al-Dcn ‘Auuar, despite all their artistic power, canbe regarded as consummate nefc poets. It is not possible to deny the value oftheir works and the importance they have had among the nefcs, but we must"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE140admit, nevertheless, that they were not able to reach the sublime level of pantheistphilosophy found in the work of Jalal al-Dcn Remc.57 Farcd al-Dcn ‘Auuar, whoin his PandnAme was a moralist – exactly like Sa‘dc – can also be regarded as amoralist poet in his famous ManUiq al-Uair, because this work is, above all, acollection of nefc ethics. The same is true for ‘Auuar’s other works as well as thoseof Sana’c. Even as moralists, however, they were superior to Armad Yasawcand taught a much more systematic system of nefc ethics. But the unsystematiccharacter of the nefc ethics taught by Armad Yasawc is not due to the weaknessof his doctrines. If we take into consideration not only his lack of artistry but alsothe simplicity and primitiveness of the community that he was addressing, thenhis excuse in this respect is obvious. Otherwise, Armad Yasawc was an importantfigure who fully grasped the entire mystical world-view of his age. Because hefully believed in the need to reveal nefc realities, but tailored to the ability andcomprehension of his audience, he avoided pantheistic teachings, even to theextent found in the ManUiq al-Uair.58If we compare the DCwAn-i Likmat to other famous Turkish works of a didacticnature that were written before or a short time after it – for example, to theKutadgu Bilig – we find a significant difference with respect to their ethical views.The Kutadgu Bilig resembles the Persian mirrors-for-princes in giving attentionmainly to social ethics, while the DCwAn-i Likmat is a nefc digest of personalethics. As for {Armad b. Marmed’s} “Atabat al-RaqA”iq, which is reminiscentabove all of ‘Auuar’s PandnAme, it does not have even as much nefc character asthe PandnAme. In very dry language, it expounds on the merits of patience andcontentment; teaches that this world has no value other than as a place to sowand reap for the next world; enumerates the terrible consequences of miserliness,talkativeness, joking, keeping bad company, covetousness, and greed; and statesthat the world is full of evil men and evil deeds. The poet, who was alwaysbound to the text of the Koran and LadCth, saw no need to give an allegoricalsense to the “taverns,”59 for which all the nefcs felt the most sincere and ardentreverence, and related with profound chagrin that while the mosques were emptythe taverns were full. The only point that reveals a slight nefc influence inall these moralistic views is his insistence on not hankering after the transitoryworld but, instead, being resigned to fate – obviously such teachings could onlyderive from a mystical system.60 It is clear, therefore, that there is no connectionor similarity between the nefc ethics propounded in the DCwAn-i Likmat andeither the Kutadgu Bilig or the “Atabat al-RaqA”iq. Armad Yasawc was by no meansinfluenced by the Kutadgu Bilig, which was written earlier; by the same token,he did not influence the poet of the “Atabat al-RaqA”iq.NOTES1{lazcnc,} JawAhir, p. 53. {The fact that Köprülü assumes that Armad Yasawc’sauthorship of the DCwan-i Likmat is a given colors the rest of his discussion.

In the nextparagraph in the narrative, Köprülü goes on to use Armad Yasawc’s death date,which he never seriously examined, as the basis for declaring the DCwAn-i Likmat to bethe oldest example of Muslim Turkic literature after the Kutadgu Bilig!}2 The problem of the date of the DCwAn-i Likmat and the personality of Armad Yasawchave long been the cause of many protracted disputes among Orientalists. WhenVambéry published certain selections from this work for the first time in |agataischeSprachstudien {Leipzig, 1867}, he provided no information on its date or the personalityof Khwaja Armad Yasawc. Russian Orientalists, including Melioransky, have carriedout some more or less critical studies on the Khwaja based on the editions of theDCwAn-i Likmat printed in Russia. They know that he died in 562/1166–7 and thusrealize the early date of this work with respect to the history of the Turkish language.Prof. Brockelmann, in an important study entitled Ali’s Qissai Jusuf, der älteste Vorläuferder osmanischen Litteratur, recently published in the journal of the Prussian Academy{Abhandlungen der Königlichen Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, no. 5} (Berlin, 1917),states, based on Melioransky, that the DCwAn-i Likmat is a sixth/twelfth-century Turkishwork. In his critique of Brockelmann, Túrán, 2 (1918), 111–18, J. Németh, professorof Turkish linguistics at the University of Budapest, discusses the late HungarianOrientalist Jozef Thúry’s great knowledge of the literature of the Eastern Turksand, based on this, strongly criticizes Melioransky and Brockelmann’s opinion thatArmad Yasawc belonged to the sixth/twelfth century. Because Thúry’s article, whichincludes his observations on Armad Yasawc, has been translated into Turkish, as“Ondördüncü ‘asır sonlarına kadar Türk dili yâdıgârları,” {trans. from the Hungarianby Râgıp Hulûsî,} MTM, 2 {1331/1913}, pp. 81–133, we are able to refute theideas advanced by Prof. Németh that are based on it. According to Thúry, “ArmadYasawc was a shaikh of the Naqshbandc UarCqa. We do not know when he died, butit is well known that the founder of the Naqshbandiyya, Pcr Murammad {betterknown as Baha’ al-Dcn} Naqshband, died in 719/1319 and that Tcmer had a mag-nificent building erected over the tomb of Armad Yasawc in 799/1397. Therefore,Armad Yasawc must have died between 719/1319 and 799/1397 and consequentlythe DCwAn-i Likmat is a work of the eighth/fourteenth century” (MTM, pp. 97– 8).Thúry cites {nafc’s} RashaRAt, {Turkish} trans., as a source on this subject. If hehad properly studied the information about Armad Yasawc given by nafc, however,he would have realized that Khwaja Yesuf Hamadanc’s third murCd could not havebelonged to the eighth/fourteenth century. It is evident that, just as he made apoor analysis of the RashaRAt, academician Thúry also completely ignored all thesources on Armad Yasawc. Indeed, the most curious thing is that he was not evenaware that this work had been printed in several editions. Vambéry too claims that itwas unpublished except for 310 lines of verse found in Shaikh Süleyman’s Chaghataylexicon {Lughat-i Chaghatay ve TürkC-yC “OsmAnC (Istanbul, 1298/1882)} and also in FrenchOrientalist Abel Pavet de Courteille’s dictionary {Dictionnaire turc-oriental (Paris, 1870)}.In light of these remarks, Prof. Németh should understand how ignorant the lateHungarian Orientalist {i.e. Thúry} was of the sources on this subject. {Köprülü’scritique of Németh’s and Thúry’s ideas about the dates of Armad Yasawc was in somerespects correct. The fullest discussion of the issues here, and of Thúry’s error-filledarguments, came in a series of brief notes published in Der Islam: Franz Babinger,“Zur Frügeschichte des Naqschbendi-Ordens,” 13 (1923), 105–7; Brockelmann’snote in the same volume, 282–3; and the notes of Barthold and Babinger, 14 (1925),112–14.}3 The first Orientalist to mention the existence of the DCwAn-i Likmat and, in fact,to publish and translate selections from it was Vambéry (|agataische Sprachstudien,pp. 115 –23).

One ofthe two manuscripts that I personally was able to study in Istanbul is today foundamong the books acquired from N. Katanov. This copy, which was made in 1290/1873 – 4, is composed of 331 pages. Each page has an average of eleven lines andthere are ninety-nine Rikmats altogether. This copy, which is full of mistakes and iscorrupt in every sense, cannot be used as the basis of scholarly study – even less sothan the printed texts. The other copy, which is among the books acquired by theMinistry of Education from Hâlis Efendi, was made in 1260/1844 –5. It containsmuch poetry that does not belong to Armad Yasawc, even Nawa’c’s famous TarjC“-ibend, which was included in the KharAbAt {or Harâbât, i.e. a famous anthology pub-lished by Ziyâ Pasha (Istanbul, 1291–2/1874)}. Melioransky writes that there are fourdifferent manuscripts, all with number 239, in the Asia Museum in Saint Petersburg,but that they are all recent and that no trustworthy early copy of this work can befound. I was not able to find copies of it among the Turkish works in the Berlin,Vienna, or Gotha libraries or in the British Museum. (I have depended on the {manu-script} catalogues of G. Flügel, W. Pertsch, and Ch. Rieu. It is possible that theDCwAn-i Likmat might be found among the recent acquisitions of these libraries, i.e.since those catalogues were published.) A manuscript of the DCwAn-i Likmat is knownto be in the Library of the Hungarian Academy, but we do not possess sufficientinformation about it. Because the DCwAn-i Likmat was very famous in Central Asia andamong the Northern Turks, it is certain that other copies will be found in otherlibraries or in private hands. Nevertheless, most will undoubtedly belong to recenttimes. Strong evidence for this opinion is that the Russian Orientalists, who have thebest chance of finding an early copy of the DCwAn-i Likmat, have so far had no success.As far as I know, the oldest copy was formerly in the Vefik Pasha Library {not furtheridentified}. According to the catalogue, it (number 1039) is composed of 148 folios, isfour inches thick, is written in a plain but beautiful hand, has headings in red, and wasmade in 1105/1693 – 4. Unfortunately, I was not able to find it. Pavet de Courteillesays that there is a manuscript of the DCwAn-i Likmat in his private library, but he givesno information on whether it is old or new (Mirâdj-Nâme: Récit de l’ascension de Mahometau ciel {Paris, 1882; reprinted Amsterdam, 1975}, in the course of the notes, p. 33).It is obvious, therefore, that there are no happy results to be reported from thislong recital. {For comprehensive information on manuscripts of the DCwAn-i Likmat,see H.

Bosworth); EI2, s.v. “Sayram” (P. B. Golden).}13DCwAn lughAt al-turk, vol. 1, pp. 27– 8. Abe Dulaf, who made a long journey fromBukhara to China during the time of the Samanid ruler Natr II b. Armad {301–31/914 – 43} presents the Turkish tribes along the routes that he took as follows: “Firstthe (Charuq: ), a month later the (Tatars?), twenty days later the (?), then the Pechenegs, after traveling twelve days among them the Chigil,after traveling forty days the Bughraj (Ughraq?), a month later the Tübet (), fortydays later the Kimek/Mimak, after traveling a month among them the Ghuz/Oghuz,after traveling a month among them the Toghuz-ghuz/Toquz Oghuz, after travelingtwenty days among them the Qirghiz, after traveling a month among them theKharlukh/Qarluq, after traveling twenty-five days among them the (Halaj), andthen the (Khiuay?).” Abe Dulaf mentions that among these tribes the Kimek andQirghiz had their own special writings {yazılar}, indeed, that the Qirghiz had versecompositions to be recited at prayer times. (This traveler’s account, the Arabic textof which was published with a Latin translation in Berlin in 1845, is found in full in{Yaqet’s} Mu“jam al-buldAn under “al-ncn”; the Turkish trans. is in [erefeddin, “EskiTürk memleketlerinde,” YM, no. 59, {29 August, 1918, pp. 134 –6}). In any case, theinformation given by these sources urgently needs to be critically analyzed andexpanded upon. {Köprülü’s notes on Abe Dulaf no longer have any scholarly value.The basic edition is V. Minorsky, AbE Dulaf Mis“ar ibn Muhalhil’s Travels in Iran (circaAD 950): Arabic Text with an English Translation and Commentary (Cairo, 1955). Cf. PeterGolden, An Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples, pp. 194 –211.} Géza Kuun,while translating {into Hungarian} the information that Gardczc gives {in Persian} onthe Turks in the Hungarian Journal of Oriental Studies {Keleti Szemle}, also collects with it,in the form of additional notes to the text, the information that the Arab geographersgive on them and thus, by compiling all this information, makes a simple attemptto describe this subject ({“Gurdbzc a törökökröl,”} Keleti Szemle, 2 (1901), 1–5; 3(1902), 32– 44, 81–94, 253 – 61; 4 (1903), 17– 40, 129 –41, 257– 83; 5 (1904), 130 –52).However, because it was not possible to compile properly the information given by allthe Muslim and Chinese historians on this subject, this attempt comes across asrudimentary. This being said, these articles were not written, in fact, with this purposein mind. Because it would take us very far from our subject and, indeed, require aseparate study, I cannot give here a detailed description of the relationship of thesedifferent tribes to each other and their geographical areas. In any case, it should notbe forgotten that in subsequent periods they moved to other locations.14 Soghdia, which already constituted an Iranian satrapy between the Amu Daryaand Syr Darya at the time of the Achaemenids, had its capital at Samarqand. TheArab geographers placed this region, which they named Sughd, between Bukharaand Samarqand and included Samarqand within it. Indeed, Abe ‘Abd Allahal-Muqaddasc states that it had twelve cities, six in the north and six in the south({Yaqet,} Mu“jam al-buldAn, vol. 5, p. 86). The Turks began to play an important rolein this area around the middle of the sixth century ce. At that time or a little later,expanding their empire toward the west, they conquered the Hepthalites and thentook control of Soghdia. This brought them into close contact with Iranian peoplesand civilization (V. Thomsen, “Inscriptions de l’Orkhon {déchiffrées},” {Mémoires de"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE146la Société Finno-ougrienne,} Helsinki, 5 [1896], p. 54). Campaigns against the Sughdaqsaround the Iron Gate are mentioned in the Orkhon Inscriptions. In connection withthis, Prof. Thomsen says, citing {the sixth-century Byzantine historian} MenanderProtektor and J. De Guignes {Histoire général des huns, des turcs, des mongols et des autrestartares occidentaux (Paris, 1756 – 8)}, that this country had been subject to the Turkssince the time of Meqan Khan (ibid., p. 154, no. 38). As a result of recent researchon the Soghdian language, we have learned that it was a dialect of old Persian.Al-Kashgharc, however, not only indicates that the Sughdaqs, i.e. the Soghdians,knew both Turkish and Soghdian, but adds that the people of Balasaghen, oaraz, andSairam also spoke both languages (on Persian words found in Turkish, see n.20below). The explanation that the same writer gives of the word Sughdaq clarifies thispoint somewhat. According to him, the Sughdaqs who had come to Balasaghen had,in fact, come from Soghdia – the area between Bukhara and Samarqand; they dressedlike the Turks and adopted their habits ({DCwAn lughAt al-turk,} vol. 1, p. 391).Evidently a group of Soghdians migrated from Soghdia to the northeast, the region ofoaraz, Balasaghen, and Sairam, where, although mixing with the Turks and becom-ing Turkified, they were able to preserve their old language to some degree. It is likelythat this partial migration occurred around the time that the armies of Islam arrivedin Transoxiana – because the Tukiyu Turks, having previously passed through the IronGate to Soghdia and reaching as far as the Indus, had had close relations with theSoghdians for a long time {“Tukiyu” in Western books usually appears as T’u-chüeh,the Chinese designation for the Turk steppe empire of the sixth to eighth centuries.This is probably a transcription of Türk, though some think it stands for Türküt. Belowin n.15, for example, Köprülü calls them the Göktürk, which is the usual designationfor this empire in Turkey} – but for now we can say nothing definite about this. Asfor the Ganjaks, who are also described as knowing Turkish and Soghdian, thereis not much information on them in the DCwAn lughAt al-turk. We only learn that theGanjak dialect was predominant in the area around Kashghar, but in the city itselfKhaqaniyya Turkish was spoken (vol. 1, p. 31); and that the letter hA” (), which didnot exist in Turkish, was found among the Ganjaks in some words that were not ofTurkish origin (vol. 3, p. 85). On the Arghu, see the details given below.15 It is not possible to give here detailed information from Chinese and Arab sources onthese different branches of the Turks. Let me just briefly present the information thatal-Kashgharc gives on them and their languages and compare it with that in variousChinese and Arabic sources.The branches given by al-Kashgharc that were named the Chomul, Qay, Yabaqu,Basmıl, and Tatar nomads and were situated on the eastern march of the Turkisharea – namely, the Chomul between the Charuq and the Uighurs, and the other fourtribes among the Yimak, Bashqird, and Qirghiz – were tribes, some of which wereevidently not Turks but had become Turkish speaking as a result of mixing with theTurks, while others, who were Turks, had acquired a very peculiar dialect and hadnot completely lost it.Yaqet, citing al-Bcrenc {d. c.442/1050}, indicates that the area of the Qay andQun was to the east of the Qirghiz, Kimek, and Toquz Oghuz, thus approachingal-Kashgharc’s report (vol. 1, p. 31). Because nomadic tribes like these easily changedtheir location in those centuries, al-Kashgharc’s placement of the Qirghiz in a regionto the east of them should be seen as natural. On the other hand, because there is nomention in his DCwAn lughAt al-turk of the type of Turkish that they spoke, they appar-ently were not as important as the other branches of the Turks. Based on Murammad‘Awfc’s JAmi“ al-RikAyAt, Prof. Marquart has asserted the likelihood that the Qayı werein fact Mongols who were later Turkified, but he also adds that Rashcd al-Dcn reportsthat the Qayı were at the head of the Oghuz tribes (the bibliographical article written"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh147by Dr F. Giese entitled “Kumanların kavmiyetine dâir” {this is part 2 of Giese’sreview article “Türk elsine ve tarihine dâir bazı yeni alman nezriyatı” in DarülfünûnEdebiyat Fakültesi Mecmuası, 1 [1332– 4], pp. 290 –3}). However, the Qayı whom Rashcdal-Dcn considers to be among the Oghuz clans, i.e. the clan whom al-Kashgharc callsthe Qayıx, and these Qay are completely separate from each other. The DCwAn lughAtal-turk clearly shows this, but, on the other hand, it also confirms ‘Awfc with respect tothe suggestion that the Qay were in fact not Turks but had later been Turkified.{Köprülü later did additional work on the Qay, see his “Osmanlı ymparatorluxununetnik menzei mes’eleleri,” Belleten, 7 (1943), 219 –313, and “Kay kabilesi hakkında yeninotlar,” Belleten, 8 (1944), 421–52.}The Turkified people whom al-Kashgharc calls the Tatars are those whom theChinese had called Tatars since the third/ninth century, so they are indeed Mongols(Thomsen citing Klaproth {Asia polyglotta (Paris, 1831)} and W. Schott {“ÄltesteNachrichten von Mongolen un Tataren,” Philologische und historische Abhandlungen derKönig. Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, 1845, pp. 445–74}, Inscriptions de l’Orkhondéchiffrées, p. 140). Al-Kashgarc’s statement in DCwAn lughAt al-turk about their havingseparate languages implies, however, that the Yabaqu, Chomul, and Basmıl were alsonot originally Turks but were later Turkified like the Tatars and Qay, whom westrongly believe were of Mongol origin. The historical information that we have onthese peoples does not, however, support this.I believe that the Yabaqu in the DCwAn lughAt al-turk were an Uighur tribe subjectto the Göktürks and were the nomadic Turkish tribe mentioned by the Chinese asPa-ye-ku and in the Kültigin inscriptions as the Yırbaycrqu (Thomsen, Inscriptions,p. 109). If this is correct, we find them in the first half of the seventh century ce in theYu-Tu-Kiyun {= Ötüken} mountains with the other Uighurs and as subjects of Hsien-pi Kaghan. In 716 ce, the Göktürk ruler Mo-ch’o carried out a punitive operationagainst them and defeated them near the Tula river. On his return, however, anumber of Pa-ye-ku took advantage of his carelessness while passing through a forest,captured and beheaded him. In short, all information obtained from Chinese sourcesindicates they were related to the Uighurs and lived in the same areas as the Uighurs(Thomsen, ibid., p. 72; Chavannes, Documents, pp. 88, 89, 91, 95). {Al-Kashgarc’s}DCwAn lughAt al-turk also states that they were with the Uighurs who had not yetadopted Islam and, indeed, that in the fifth/eleventh century a force composed of40,000 Muslim Basmıl Turks under the command of Ghazc Arslan Tigin, and withthe help of the Prophet, defeated a force of 700,000 Yabaqu under the commandof Büke (DCwAn, vol. 3, p. 173). There is a long poem in the DCwAn lughAt al-turk aboutthis event {see Dankoff, “Three Turkic Verse Cycles Relating to Inner Asian Warfare,”Harvard Ukranian Studies, 3 – 4 (1979 – 80), part 1, pp. 151– 65}. Although the non-Muslim nomadic Yabaqu were actually a Turkish tribe ethnically related to the Uighurs,it is clear that they spoke a dialect that was quite different from the Turkish ofKashghar because their population was undoubtedly significant – even if we considerthe size of the army that they fielded to be an exaggeration. Al-Kashgharc also statesthat the famous Yamar river was a great river in the area of the Yabaqu (DCwAn,vol. 3, p. 21), that the Yabaqu river rose in the Kashghar mountains and flowedthrough Farghana to Özjand (ibid., vol. 3, p. 27), and that there was a Turkish tribecalled the Edhgish in Özjand (ibid., vol. 1, p. 89).As for the Chomul, about whom al-Kashgharc gives absolutely no information, theymust be the tribe called Cho-mi/Tch’ou-mi in Chinese sources. During the time ofthe T’ang, this tribe lived on the banks of the Manas river west of Urumchi (Chavannes,Documents, p. 31).The Basmıl were the Turkish tribe whom the Chinese called the Pa-si-mi, asThomsen originally proposed. According to Chinese sources, they had ethnic ties to"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE148the Turks and their chiefs were related to the A-shih-na family, as was the casewith the Göktürks. They originally lived along the Hopog river in Tabargatay eastof Choghujhaq (Tchougutchuk). In the second/eighth century, they migrated andoccupied Beshbalıg. During this century, the Basmıl sometimes acted in unison withthe Western Göktürks and Uighurs. Other times, they suffered from their attacks, orthey united with the Toquz Uighurs and Qarluqs and became involved in politicalactivities by creating a confederation of eleven tribes (Thomsen, Inscriptions, pp. 76,178; Chavannes, Documents, pp. 29, 86, 94). This information, which very clearlyshows the ethnic relationship of the Basmıl with the Qarluqs and T’u-chüeh, describesat the same time their political relations with the Uighurs. Al-Kashgharc’s accountstates that they were Muslims in the fifth/eleventh century, that they lived a nomadiclife in a region near the non-Muslim Uighurs, Yabaqu, and Chomul, and that theyfought with the Yabaqu. As for the question of their having a separate language likethe others, we could attribute this to the nomadic Basmıl having a dialect that wasdifferent from Kashghar Turkish.It appears, then, that the Qay and Tatars, who were originally Mongols and laterwere Turkified, as well as the Chomul, Yabaqu, and Basmıl, who were true Turks, allspoke separate dialects in addition to Kashghar Turkish, which had a firm hold onall the Eastern Turks in the fifth/eleventh century, and these dialects were ratherdifferent from it. It is not possible to interpret al-Kashgharc’s strange statement in anyother way according to the form and degree of our current knowledge.16 From this group, I see no need to go into great detail here on the Qirghiz, Qipchaqs,and Oghuz. Historical and linguistic information on the Qipchaqs and Oghuz will begiven below to the extent that it concerns our subject. As for the Qirghiz, sufficientinformation can be found on them in almost all the Arab geographers and a summaryof the information given by Chinese sources – based on the studies of such scholars asC. Visdelou {Bibliothèque orientale. . . (Maastricht, 1780)}, Schott, Radloff, and Klaproth– is found in Thomsen’s work (Inscriptions, p. 140). This people, who extended acrossan area stretching from the banks of the upper Yenisey south to the Tang-numountains, lived separately and independently of the Göktürks. Although they weredefeated by the Uighurs shortly after the first half of the eighth century ce, theylater became powerful and in 840 overthrew the Uighur Empire (ibid.). According toIstakhrc, the Qirghiz were surrounded by the Toquz Oghuz, Kimek, the “sea,” Qarluqs,and the lands of the Oghuz. According to Gardczc, the Toquz Oghuz were to thesouth of them and the Kimek were to the west of them. Yaqet, however, shows themto the east of the Kimek and the Toquz Oghuz. (See {Yaqet,} Mu“jam al-buldAn and{M. J. de Goeje (ed.),} Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum {Leiden, 1870–94}). {Thismaterial has been collected by Ramazan [ezen, Yslâm coXrafyacılarına göre Türkler ve Türkülkeleri (Ankara, 1985).} Murammad ‘Awfc states that the Kimek were north of theQirghiz (northwest) and the Yaghma and Qarluqs were to their west (Marquart,“Über das Volkstum der Komanan,” {i.e. Chapter 2 of Osttürkische Dialekstudien,}p. 39, text).Al-Kashgharc gives no information on the Ughraq, but they were probably thesame as the Arghu just as the Soghdians were called Sughdaqs (for more informationon the Arghu, see below n.33). Among the various Turkish tribes mentioned in aSyriac text written in 569 ce are the Bulghars, Suwars, Avars, and Ughars (Chavannes,Documents, p. 250). I believe that the latter were the Ughraqs. Based on his name,the famous Saif al-Dcn jghraq, whom we see {in Juvainc} as one of the greatestcommanders of Jalal al-Dcn the Khwarazm-Shah and the chief of the Khalaj andTurkmen, must have belonged to this tribe ( Juvainc, JahAn-GushA, vol. 2, p. 308).As for the Charuq, they lived in the city of Barjeq where, according to legend,Afrasiyab imprisoned Bczhan ({al-Kashgarc,} DCwAn lughAt al-turk, vol. 1, p. 318)."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh149It appears that these branches, about whose dialects virtually no details are foundin al-Kashgharc’s book, did not have great importance in the Turkish world, but theyare clearly listed among the Eastern Turks, namely the Qarluqs, Chigil, Tokhsı, andYaghma. Information on the Chigil, Tokhsı, and Yaghma Turks will be given belowwhile discussing the Qarluqs.17 Information on the Yimak is given below. Because al-Kashgharc gives no moreinformation on the Bashqirds, Bulghars, Suwars, and Pechenegs than that known todate by the scholarly world, I will not go into further detail on them. In his DCwAnlughAt al-turk, he only mentions, in addition to these Pechenegs who resided near Rem{Anatolia}, another group, the Bejaneks, who were an Oghuz tribe (vol. 1, p. 404).For the dialect of the original Pechenegs, see below.18DCwAn lughAt al-turk, vol. 1, pp. 29–31.19 The details scattered throughout the DCwAn lughAt al-turk allow one to form a judgmenton this matter. For example, while describing dialectical differences, the author saysthat words beginning with yA” () among the Eastern Turks are changed to alif () orjCm () by the Oghuz and Qipchaqs; words beginning with mCm () among the EasternTurks change to bA” () among the Oghuz, Qipchaqs, and Suwars; words beginningwith dAl () change to tA” (); and the three-dot fA” (), which is called the fA-i türkCyeamong the Eastern Turks and is pronounced between a fA” and a bA”, is replacedby wAw () among the Oghuz Turkmen (vol. 1, pp. 31–3, vol. 2, pp. 154, 253). Thedialectal split is invariable in nouns of time and place and in verbal nouns. Forinstance, while the Khaqaniyya Turks, the Chigil, Yaghma, Tokhsı, Arghu, and Uighurssay Bargu yir (the place to go), the Oghuz, Qipchaqs, Pechenegs, and Bulghars saybarası yir. In like manner, while these eastern branches say bu turgu yir irmas (thisis not the place to stop), the western branches say bu turasi yir tigil (vol. 1, pp. 34–5;vol. 2, pp. 56 – 8). The same difference occurs in the names of instruments. Whereasthe Khaqaniyya Turks say yıgaç biçgu nang (something to cut wood), the Oghuz sayyıgaç bicasi nang (vol. 2, p. 58). In addition, we know that the Oghuz and Qipchaqsdeleted the ghain () from the middle of words – for example, while the other Turkssay tamgak (palate), they use tamak, and in like manner they say baran instead of bargan(the one who goes) (vol. 1, p. 35). When al-Kashgharc mentions various Turkishdialects, he not only describes their phonological characteristics, but sometimes alsorecords certain lexical items that were of local significance; for instance, he reportsthat some words belonged only to the Chigil, or Arghu, or Qipchaqs. It is obvious,however, when his book is analyzed from beginning to end, that the primary subjectsare Khaqaniyya Turkish and Oghuz, i.e. Eastern Turkish and Western Turkish.Among the terms given, there are many that were particular to the Oghuz or thatwere unknown to them and used by other Turks. Furthermore, al-Kashgharc reportsthat because the Oghuz had mingled a lot with the Persians, they had forgotten manyof their own words and had replaced them with Persian words (vol. 1, p. 73). Aproverb from that period demonstrates, as much as any other historical document,that the Turks were then living cheek by jowl with the Persians: Tatsız Türk bolmas /baZsız börk bolmas {No Turk without a Tat / no hat without a head}. Here the Persiansare meant by Tat. Nevertheless, al-Kashgharc says that the Yaghma and Tokhsı Turksalso called the unbelieving Uighurs Tat because they considered them to be foreigners(vol. 2, p. 225). Börk was the famous red conical hat {külâh} that we also find amongthe Anatolian Turks up to the tenth/sixteenth century. We also learn from the samesource that the Oghuz used the word Sukak to allude to the Persians (vol. 2, p. 229).20 Persian words were also found in the Turkish language before the coming of Islam.Not only does one encounter New Persian terms like dost and dushmAn in the copy ofthe Oghuz legend {but this is now believed to belong to the Mongol period!} writtenin the Uighur alphabet (Radloff, Das Kudatku-Bilik), but one also finds words deriving"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE150from the Iranian Soghdian dialect in the Old Turkish works that have recently appearedin Eastern Turkistan (Thomsen, “Ein Blatt in türkischer ‘Runen’ Schrift aus Turfan,”Sitzungsberichte der (Berliner, d.h.) Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1910, {pp. 296 –306}). On this subject, see the studies by F. C. Andreas {The Book of Mainyo-i-khard. . . (Kiel, 1882)}. According to al-Kashgharc, the people of Balasaghen, oaraz, andSairam spoke both Soghdian and Turkish (DCwAn, vol. 1, p. 31). In any case, thereason for the appearance of Persian words in these Old Turkish works is eitherbecause this group of people were Turkified Soghdians or – much less likely – theywere Turks who had been under Soghdian influence (see n.14 of this chapter). Thereis no need to describe here the strong influence that Islam later had on the Turkishlanguage. Al-Kashgharc, in fact, by clearly specifying in his introduction to his DCwAnthat he recorded only pure Turkish words, acknowledges the adulteration of con-temporary Turkish. One can also clearly deduce from al-Kashgharc’s work that thedialects of the Khaqaniyya Turks and of the still non-Muslim Uighurs were verysimilar. Barthold quite rightly attributes this influence {i.e. the influence of the Uighurson the Khaqaniyya Turks} to the fact that the Turco-Muslim rulers who reigned inKashghar were more learned and civilized than the early Seljuk chiefs (Barthold,Turkestan, {English trans., p. 311}).21DCwAn lughAt al-turk, vol. 1, p. 10. While discussing the Uighurs, al-Kashgharc says, abit obscurely: “Not only is their language pure Turkish, but they also have a separatelanguage in which they converse among themselves and, as I explained at the beginningof the book, they have a script composed of twenty-four letters with which corres-pondence is written. In addition, the Uighurs and Chinese have another differentwriting system with which they write holy books and registers {dawAwCn}, and only theinfidels can read them” (vol. 1, p. 30 {English trans. Dankoff and James Kelly, vol. 1,p. 83}). What could be the separate language that these Uighurs, whose language waspure Turkish, spoke among themselves? Even if we consider the script that the Uighursshared with the Chinese, in addition to their own, to be the Buddhist {Chinese?}, theproblem of this “separate language” still needs to be resolved. In certain respects, wefind very clear Islamic influence in this Eastern Turkish of the fifth/eleventh century.For example, while the word yalavac at first corresponded to {the Arabic term} rasEl inthe meaning of both “prophet” and “envoy,” we know that under the influence ofIslam, rasEl was appropriated exclusively as the equivalent of “prophet,” and yalavarappeared as the equivalent of “envoy” (vol. 2, p. 231). We also know that at that timethe secretaries who wrote the Turkish correspondence of the sultans – this must be theSeljuk Sultans – with the Turkish {i.e. Uighur} script were called alımga (vol. 1,p. 127) and that the pens used to write in the Turkish script were made from the uctree (vol. 1, p. 38). These alımgas of the Oghuz were none other than the bakhshis ofthe Uighurs. (For general information on the writing system of the Uighurs and tolearn the major sources on this subject, see my Türk edebiyatı tarihi {reprinted 1981,pp. 27–31}).22DCwAn lughAt al-turk, vol. 1, pp. 7–9.23 Al-Kashgharc dubs Qarluqs “Turkmen” (ibid., vol. 1, p. 139; vol. 3, p. 259). We knowvery well, however, that the Turkmen were Oghuz (ibid., vol. 3, p. 304; {Yaqet,}Mu“jam al-buldAn, vol. 1, p. 41; an abundance of sources are unanimous on this point).Now, all the Arab geographers agree that the Qarluqs were distinct from the Oghuz;so how should one interpret al-Kashgharc’s statement? In my view, the reason for thisdiscrepancy is very clear: the word “Turkmen” was a title – the etymology of whichhas not yet been determined for certain – that was given to the Oghuz, in particularafter Islam. It is very likely that because al-Kashgharc used this vague expression tomean Muslim Turk, he also applied it to the Qarluqs who, along with the Oghuz, hadadopted Islam. In fact, the information given in his work on the Qarluqs and their"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh151language clearly shows that they could not be considered Oghuz, i.e. Western Turks.Other sources corroborate this. There is one aspect of this matter that is especiallynoteworthy. While speaking at the beginning of his work about the regions to whichthe Turks spread and their dialects, al-Kashgharc never mentions the name Qarluq;and in the area to which the other Arab geographers assign them, he indicates {only}the Chigil, Yaghma, and Tokhsı and especially that the Chigil were the most import-ant among them. We learn from al-Kashgharc’s clear and explicit statement where theChigil were found in the fifth/eleventh century. (1) The nomadic Chigil lived beyondBarsghan in Qayas – al-Kashgharc gives three towns with that name, all of thembelonging to the Tokhsı and Chigil (DCwAn lughAt al-turk, vol. 3, p. 129). (2) There wasa Chigil fortress near oaraz, which was in the country of the Arghu. The Chigil werefound there. Indeed, all the Arab geographers mention this city. (3) There was also aplace with this name around Kashghar. Because the country of the Oghuz adjoinedthat of the Chigil, they were always at war. Traces of this old hostility were foundeven as late as the fifth/eleventh century. The Oghuz gave this title to all the Turkswho dressed like the Chigil – because they had a distinctive dress – and so theyconsidered, erroneously of course, all the Turkish territories stretching from theAmu Darya to upper China to be Chigil (ibid., vol. 1, pp. 329–30). We gather thatthe Chigil had their own particular dress – even their tall felt caps {börk}, i.e. theirconical hats {külâh}, were different from those of the other Turks (ibid., vol. 3, p. 132).We also gather from a number of al-Kashgharc’s important descriptions of the Chigildialect that it was Eastern Turkish – very close to the language of the OrkhonInscriptions – and that it was extremely close to the Yaghma, Tokhsı, Arghu, andUighur dialects. Thus, what al-Kashgharc calls Khaqaniyya Turkish was the form ofthis dialect spoken in Kashghar. In the Orkhon Inscriptions, there is the term yzgil.Thomsen considered this to be the name of an unknown people and quite rightlyconnected it to the term yçgil-yçgül, which Rashcd al-Dcn mentions as one of the tenrivers in the country of the Uighurs. yzgil is probably nothing but Chigil (Inscriptionsde l’Orkhon, p. 160, no. 52). All of this linguistic and geographical evidence suggeststhat the Chigil were the largest and most important branch of the Qarluqs. It willbe demonstrated below that Kashghar Turkish was Qarluq Turkish, that the Qarluqswere ethnically related to the Göktürks, and that later, by seizing their summerpastures around the Chu and Talas rivers, they forced the Oghuz to withdraw to thenorthwest. When all of this is compared with the information that I have given aboutthe Chigil, it seems indisputable that the Chigil were one of the most importantbranches of the Qarluqs. Nevertheless, in order to prove this decisively – and also theidea, weakly advanced below by Grenard and Grigor’ev, that it was the Qarluqs whoestablished the Khanate of Kashghar and that Kashghar Turkish was Qarluq Turkish– let me cite the clear account of ‘Awfc and Gardczc (from Marquart’s work, {“Überdas Volkstum der Komanen,”} p. 39):{Another branch of the Turks are the Kharlukh (Qarluq). Their homeland was Jonah’smountain, which was Golden Mountain (Altun Tagh). They were slaves of the"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE152Toghuzghuz (Uighurs), against whom they rebelled. They emerged in the territory ofTurkestan and the lands of Islam. They are nine groups: three Chigil, three Hsk(?),one Nda(?), one Kwalcn(?), one Tukhscn.} This account, which shows that the Chigilconstituted an important branch of the Qarluqs and that the Tokhsı were also fromthe Qarluqs, definitely corroborates my assertion above and confirms the informationthat I will give below on the Qarluqs, which is cited from Thomsen and the studiesof Chavannes and Visdelou. Gardczc also says that all the Chigil were found on theroad from Tumket (?) to Kümberket, that the area around Issik-Kul, whichal-Kashgharc also mentions under the name Lake Barsghan (DCwAn lughAt al-turk,vol. 3, p. 99), was completely inhabited by the Chigil, that it was five parasangsfrom Issik-Kul to Tangkut and from there a three-day trip to Barsghan, and thatalong the way there were nothing but the tents of the Chigil (Kuun, {“Gurdbzc,”}sixth article {sic}, Keleti Szemle, no. 4, 1902 {part 6 is in 4 (1903)}). These reports, whichcompletely confirm the information given by al-Kashgharc and the other Muslimgeographers, tend to support and clarify my assertion.24 Grenard, Turkestan, p. 48. It is readily apparent from the reports of Chinese historiansthat the Qarluqs, whom the Chinese called Ko-lo-lu, were in fact ethnically related tothe Göktürks. They lived northwest of Pei-t’ing, i.e. Beshbalıg, and west of the Altunmountains. They were divided into three groups or clans. In 650 ce or a little later,they acquired authority over a province of China and their chiefs – according toChinese accounts – took the name Tu-tu, i.e. Tudun. The Qarluqs, who weresurrounded by the Göktürks on the east and west, would tailor their movementsaccording to the strength or weakness of the Göktürks. They slowly advanced towardthe south and their chiefs took the name Shih-hu. The Qarluqs were brave andwarlike. After 742 ce they became subject to the Uighurs and migrated to the Ötükenmountains (Thomsen, who cites Visdelou, Inscriptions de l’Orkhon, p. 71, n.3. For moreinformation, see Chavannes, Documents, pp. 85 – 6). The title se-kin that one comesacross in Chinese sources is nothing but a form of the term sagun, which al-Kashgharcsays was given to high-ranking men of the Qarluqs ({DCwAn lughAt al-turk,} vol. 1,p. 337). In his article on the famous city of Balasaghen, Barthold states that this worddid not exist in the Turkish dialects (EI1, s.v. “Balasaghen,” {cf. EIr, s.v. “Balasagen”(C. E. Bosworth)}), but he is mistaken. Moreover, al-Kashgharc records the termAtAsAghEn, meaning “physician.”25 Grenard, Turkestan, p. 94. Barthold also gives the same information based on Ibnlawqal (EI1, s.v. “Ghuzz”). In his article “Über das Volkstum der Komanen,” Marquartwrites that after the collapse of the state of the Western Turks, the summer pasturesaround the Chu and Talas rivers were seized by the Qarluqs; and the Western Turks,i.e. the Oghuz, being forced to withdraw toward the northwest, subsequently defeatedthe Pechenegs who lived at that time around the Aral Sea and in the valley of theSyr Darya (see Giese’s bibliographical article “Kumanların kavmiyetine dâir” {i.e. his“Türk elsine ve tarihine dâir bazı yeni alman nezriyatı”}, p. 291).26 Chavannes, in his valuable work on the Western Turks {Documents}, basically acceptsthis idea, which was proposed by Grenard in his article “La légende de Satok BoghraKhân et l’histoire.” According to Chavannes, it is very likely that those who succeededthe Western Turks and constituted the lineage of the Bughra Khans in Balasaghenwere Qarluqs. But he adds, “Even if it is not correct to consider the Bughra Khans tohave originated from the Uighurs, it should not be forgotten that the Qarluqs werevery frequently included in the Uighur confederation. This confederation, which tookthe name ‘the Eleven Tribes,’ was composed of the Toquz Oghuz, Basmıl, and alsothe Qarluqs. For this reason, one should not be surprised that the Kutadgu Bilig waswritten in Uighur. Because even if the Qarluqs were racially related to the Göktürks,they were politically bound to the Uighurs” (p. 86). It must be admitted that neither"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh153Grenard’s assertion about the linguistic character of the Kutadgu Bilig nor Chavannes’sobjection to it is based on scientific evidence. However, the information that I havebeen setting forth here on the distribution of the various Turkish dialects in CentralAsia during the fifth/eleventh and sixth/twelfth centuries and their closeness to eachother supports only Grenard’s assertion. The work of a Turk born in the city ofBalasaghen, which was inhabited by the Qarluqs or the Arghu who were one of theirbranches, and written in Kashghar, which was also inhabited by the Qarluqs, couldcertainly not have had any other linguistic character. It can be seen from the mostsuperficial analysis of al-Kashgharc’s DCwAn lughAt al-turk that Kashghar Turkish, whichthe author calls Khaqaniyya Turkish, is the same as the language of the Kutadgu Bilig.Some information is given below concerning the relationship of this Qarluq Turkishto the language of the Orkhon Inscriptions. At the same time, it should not beforgotten that this Khaqaniyya Turkish was close to Uighur Turkish and that both fallwithin the sphere of Eastern Turkish.27 In an important article entitled “Sur le système des consonnes dans la langue ouïgoure,”{Keleti Szemle, 2 (1901), 241–59} Thomsen, while giving a very important criticism ofthe way in which Radloff read the Kutadgu Bilig, carefully noted that the language ofthe Orkhon Inscriptions was extremely close to that of the Kutadgu Bilig and, as a resultof this study, categorically established that the vocalic {rather, consonantal} systemin the Kutadgu Bilig and in the Orkhon Inscriptions were, with almost no exceptions,identical (“Sur le système,” pp. 244 –7). Radloff also accepted this close relationshipbetween the old Göktürk inscriptions and the Kutadgu Bilig.Additionally, there is a point of morphology that is common to the language of theseinscriptions, the Kutadgu Bilig, the old Kuman dialect, and the old Seljuk-Ottoman(i.e. Oghuz) dialect, which, although it has attracted great attention from Europeanscholars who have specialized in Turkish linguistics and has been studied andexplained quite well, also needs to be supplemented with the information providedby {al-Kashgharc’s} DCwAn lughAt al-turk. Focusing his attention on words in the OrkhonInscriptions that end in -daci/-deci, e.g. boldacı, Thomsen asserted, in opposition toRadloff, that this form is found in the poem of Yesuf and Zulaikha published byHoutsma ({“Ein alttürkisches Gedicht: (eine vorislamische Bearbeitung des biblischenRomans von Joseph und Zulaika; aus der Dresdner Handschrift herausgegeben undüberstetzt),”} ZDMG, 43 [1889], p. 74), in a glossary published in 1894 in Leidenby the same author (Ein türkisch-arabisches Glossar, p. 42) and in the Codex Cumanicus(ed. Kuun {Budapest, 1880; reprinted Budapest, 1981} p. 104) and that, as far as thetense usage was concerned, it expressed the future (Inscriptions de l’Orkhon, pp. 162–3).However, words in this form also exist in the Kutadgu Bilig, as Thúry (“Ondördüncü‘asır sonlarına kadar Türk dili yâdıgârları,” p. 94) and then Brockelmann (“Ali’s Qissa”iJusuf, no. 51, p. 33) have previously reported. According to al-Kashgharc, among theEastern Turks, i.e. apart from the Oghuz and Qipchaqs, active participles are in theform közetküci/“one who watches, guard,” bititküci/“one who writes, scribe,” sufgurguci/“one who waters,” yükünküci/“one who prostrates.” Among the Oghuz and Qipchaqs,i.e. the Western Turks, the corresponding words are: gözetici from the assimilation ofközettaci, bititdaci, sufgurdaci, yükündaci ({DCwAn lughAt al-turk,} vol. 2, pp. 131, 203, 239,256; vol. 3, p. 232). We also clearly understand that this form, which, according toal-Kashgharc, was unique to the Western Turks, expressed the future, as Houtsmaand Thomsen have asserted. For example, öldaci sicgan meant “the mouse that is goingto die” (ibid., vol. 1, p. 366). Based on its frequent appearance in eighth/fourteenth-century Ottoman texts, this form clearly belongs to the Oghuz, i.e. the WesternTurks, as al-Kashgharc reported; thus it is worthy of study with respect to linguistichistory, given its presence in the Orhon Inscriptions, and then in the Kutadgu Bilig,in the Kuman language, and in the “Atabat al-RaqA”iq, which I very strongly suspect"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE154exhibits linguistic characteristics dating before the Mongol invasion (Necib Âsım(ed.), part 1, 1334, p. 103 {the reference is to Adcb Armad b. Marmed Yüknekc,Hibetül”-haSâyıS (Istanbul, 1334/1918); this edition was superceded by R. R. Arat (ed.),Atebetü”l-hakayık (Istanbul, 1951)}). I know of no examples of this form in laterworks from Central Asia, i.e. works created after the linguistic changes that occurredsubsequent to the Mongol invasion. It is quite surprising that despite the very clearstatement of al-Kashgharc, who was well aware of the characteristics of the Turkishdialects, this form occurs in works in early Eastern Turkish. For its existence inQipchaq Turkish as well, see Abe layyan {al-Gharnauc’s} KitAb al-idrAk {li-lisAnal-atrAk (Istanbul, 1309/1893)}, pp. 135– 6, 188 {new ed. A. Melek Özyetgin as EbûLayyân, Kitâbu”l-Ydrâk li Lisâni”-Etrâk (Ankara, 2001)}.28 In various places in his work, al-Kashgharc clearly indicates the locations and citiesof the Oghuz in the fifth/eleventh century. While discussing the word öküz {i.e. ögüz},for example, he states that this word, which generally means “river,” among theOghuz specifically referred to the Syr Darya, which was also given the name Banakat;and that the cities of the Oghuz were along this river, and the Oghuz nomads livedalong its banks as well ({DCwAn lughAt al-turk,} vol. 1, p. 58). Ibn lawqal also indicatesthat the Oghuz centers were primarily along the lower course of the Syr Darya({al-MasAlik wa ”l-mamAlik, ed. de Goeje (Leiden, 1873),} p. 393 {superseded byJ. H. Kramer’s edn (Leiden, 1938 –9)}). According to Ibn al-Athcr, these Oghuz hadseparated from the Tokuz-guz, i.e. the Uighurs, during the caliphate of al-Mahdc(158 – 69/774 – 85) (al-KAmil, vol. 2, p. 117). The DCwAn lughAt al-turk also informs us ofthe primary Oghuz cities. (1) Sabran. The author writes that this was the originalname of this city, which was usually called nabran, because there was no inTurkish (vol. 1, p. 364). This city, which Yaqet in his entry on Isfcjab places in thevicinity of oaraz, Sanckath, and Farab (Yangckend), and which he also describes in theentry on nabran as being the Oghuz capital on the Syr Darya and having a fortress(Mu“jam al-buldAn, vol. 1, p. 230, vol. 5, p. 336), was the city of Savran near Yasc,which I discussed above (Chapter 2, p. 27). (2) Sütkent (vol. 1, p. 369). It wouldbe natural for this city to be in the same region, although this is not specified.(3) Sughnaq (vol. 1, p. 392). This city was Sıxnak, which later became the capital of theWhite Horde (for more details, see Howorth, History of the Mongols) {EI2, s.v. “Sıghnas”(C. E. Bosworth)}. (4) Qarnaq (vol. 1, p. 393). There is no information on it apartfrom being an Oghuz city. (5) Qarajuq. Al-Kashgharc gives the following descriptionof it {it is the name of al-Farab, which is the name ofthe country of the Oghuz} (vol. 1, p. 304). We have seen above in one of the legendsabout Armad Yasawc how he made Qaraj(ch)uq Mountain disappear miraculously(Chapter 2, pp. 21–2). We find Qarajuk Mountain, which was in the vicinity of thisOghuz city, whose name also appears frequently in the Dede Korkut, within the Oghuzregion in the map in the DCwAn lughAt al-turk. There is much information on Farab(Otrar), which was far from Tashkent and close to Balasaghen, in Mu“jam al-buldAn(vol. 6, p. 322) and Barthold (see EI1, s.v. “Farab” {cf. EI2, s.v. “Farab” (Barthold-[B. Spuler]}). As for the famous city called Talas or oaraz, al-Kashgharc records twooaraz in his book, one jlegh-Talas and the other Kiji-Talas {Kümi-Talas in the firstedn of Early Mystics, which is correct} on the Islamic frontier ({DCwAn lughAt al-turk,}vol. 1, p. 306), but he does not specify whether it is an Oghuz city. However, whendefining the lands of the Arghu Turks, he says that they extended “from oaraz toBalasaghen,” so it appears that oaraz was not an Oghuz city (ibid., vol. 1, p. 114). Wealso learn from the same work the names of a few other towns near oaraz. One wasa fortress named Qarghalıgh (ibid., vol. 1, p. 433), another was the town of Yaghma,which belonged to the Qara-Yagma Turks (ibid., vol. 3, p. 26), a third was GencakSingir on the Qipchaq border (ibid., vol. 1, p. 399), and a fourth was the town of Atluq"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh155(ibid., vol. 1, p. 90). I have given sufficient information on oaraz above (Chapter 3,p. 72, n.6). For more information on old oaraz and Awliya Ata, which Howorthclaims occupies its site, see Reclus, Nouvelle géographie universelle, vol. on Russian Asia,pp. 557– 8. Although Barthold, like Howorth, asserts that old oaraz is present-dayAwliya Ata (EI1, s.v. “Balasaghen”), Chavannes categorically rejects this and says thatit must be five parasangs to the south of Awliya Ata (Documents, p. 304). {See EI2, s.v.“Awliya Ata (Barthold-[B. Spuler]), and “oaraz” (C. E. Bosworth).}29 Al-Kashgharc says the Kimek/Yimak were Qıfchaqs, but the Qıfchaqs distinguishedthemselves from the Yimak by this name. His account conforms to those of the Arabgeographers Ibn lawqal ({al-MasAlik,} p. 11) and Ituakhrc ({MasAlik al-mamAlik, ed. deGoeje (Leiden, 1870; reprinted Leiden, 1927),} p. 222) in making the Qıfchaqs abranch of the Yimak, for it explains how these two branches were related to eachother (DCwAn lughAt al-turk, vol. 3, p. 22). Furthermore, Ituakhrc says that the uppercourse of the Volga formed a natural border between the Oghuz and Yimak (MasAlik).At the same time, al-Muqaddasc, while providing details on the seven fortresses ofSavran (Sabran), which I indicated in n.28 above based on DCwAn lughAt al-turk was anOghuz city, and on its other features, also says that this formed a border betweenthe Oghuz and the Kimek ({ARsan al-taqAsCm fC ma“rifat al-aqAlCm, ed. de Goeje, 2nd edn(Leiden, 1906),} p. 274 {English trans. Basil Anthony Collins as The Best Divisions forKnowledge of the Regions (Reading, UK, 2001), p. 226}). In addition, the author {Ibnal-Faqch al-Hamadanc} of KitAb al-buldAn {ed. de Goeje (Leiden, 1885)}, while enumerat-ing the branches of the Turks in the entry on Shash (Tashkent) {p. 329}, lists the mostimportant branches as the Qarluqs, Tokuz-guz, Türgish, Kimek, and Oghuz ({DCwAnlughAt al-turk,} vol. 2, p. 394). The Qipchaq dialect, which al-Kashgharc consideredto be closely related to the Oghuz dialect, was the same as the Kimek dialect. Indeed,we can consider these two names to be virtually synonymous despite any apparentdifference between them.30 According to the Arab geographers, this peninsula had not been previously inhabited.The Oghuz who were separated from their comrades went there and settled (Ituakhrc,{MasAlik,} p. 219). Al-Kashgharc in fact records that Mangıshlak was “a place namein the Oghuz country” ({DCwAn lughAt al-turk,} vol. 1, p. 387, vol. 3, p. 118). {See EI2,s.v. “Mangıshlak” (Yu. Bregel).}31 See the details given by Barthold in EI1, s.v. “Ghuzz.”32 Isfcjab is a very old Turkish city. During his journey, Hieuen-Thsang stopped inthis city, “which was 200 li” southwest of Talas (oaraz) and which the Chinese calledPe-choei and the Turks called Aksu. Although its exact location is not given, itappears that it was a bit southeast of Chimkent. In 642 ce Tele Khaqan took refugein this city, where he was attacked by the Nu-shih-pi. According to Chavannes, thiswas the place the Arabs called Ispcjab {sic, rather Isbcjab} (Documents, p. 195). Accord-ing to the Arab geographers and {al-Kashgharc’s} DCwAn lughAt al-turk, Ispcjab {sic}and Madcnat al-Baiqa’, i.e. Sairam, are the same city, but Chavannes claims thatpresent-day Sairam is the city the Chinese called Kiu-p’i-lo (Documents, p. 8). Never-theless, I believe, based on the Arab geographers, that this is a mistaken opinion. Thisregion, which originally belonged to the T’u-chüeh Turks, was seized by the Qarluqsafter their collapse, as I explained above, and very quickly entered the realm of Islam.33DCwAn lughAt al-turk, vol. 1, p. 31. Nevertheless, the same author also shows the landsbetween oaraz and Balasaghen as the country of the Arghu (vol. 1, p. 114). In hisDCwAn lughAt al-turk, a city of Qabus (vol. 1, p. 308) and a city of Belu (vol. 3, p. 176),the locations of which are not specified, are shown as Arghu locations. This secondcity appears in the works of the Arab geographers as Balu/Bahlu and is described asa city that was a distance of a half parasang from the town of Chigil and was largerthan the town of Barsgan to the left of it (Kuun, “Gurdbzc,” citing al-Muqaddasc)."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE156These descriptions show that the Arghu area began at oaraz. Considering that oaraz/Talas was not an Oghuz city, and that it shared a border with the Chigil on oneside and the Arghu on the other, it is clear that the Arghu must be considered, likethe Chigil, to be among the Eastern Turks. While enumerating the primary Turkishtribes at the beginning of his work, al-Kashgharc does not mention the Arghu,but later he provides considerable information on their geographical area and thecharacteristics of their dialect. In the same passage, al-Kashgharc does not mention,for example, the Qarluqs, who were a great and very well known Turkish people,under this general name, but he lists the Chigil and Tokhsı, who were Qarluq tribes.Perhaps the Arghu were the same as the Ughraq {see above, n.16}; or else Ughraqmay be the general name for the Charuq and the Chomul. Whichever of thesetwo hypotheses may be correct, we must still inquire whether the Arghu includedthe Qarluqs, or were they a separate Turkish tribe? The geographical area thatal-Kashgharc indicates as belonging to the Arghu matches that assigned to theUghraq. Although the information at hand is still not sufficient to allow us to sayanything definite on this matter, we consider the Arghu, like the Chigil, Yaghma,and Tokhsı, among the Qarluqs. The information that I will give below on the Arghudialect will suffice to prove that it was an Eastern dialect, probably very close to thelanguage of the Khaqaniyya Turks.34DCwAn lughAt al-turk, vol. 1, p. 31. On this question, see n.14 of this chapter. Balasaghen,which al-Kashgharc mentions as Qoz {i.e. Quz}-ülüz (vol. 1, p. 60), or as the Mongolscalled it Gubalıg, i.e. “beautiful city” ({Khwandamcr,} LabCb al-siyar, see the sectionon the Qara Khiuay), was like other cities in that region destroyed in the innumerablestruggles for power in the eighth/fourteenth century. Consequently, nothing is heardof it during the events of the reign of Tcmer (see Barthold, EI1, s.v. “Balasaghen”).[Zeki Velidi Togan also confirms that this city had lost its importance before Tcmer,YA, s.v. “Balasagun.”] Barthold indicates its location as that of present-day AwliyaAta, i.e. northeast of old oaraz. A Persian couplet also corroborates this (HabîbEfendi, Düstûr-i Suhan {Istanbul, 1309/1891–2}, p. 126):{Bravo! For the skill of that fortunate-footed donkey of yours, which in a single nightcan go from Balasagen to oaraz.} The German Orientalist Marquart claims thatGubalıg was Guzbalıg, which meant “Oghuz city,” but this should probably beaccepted with caution. Even if the Oghuz had previously been in that region, andtherefore in Balasaghen, it is {still} true that the Arghu, whom we consider a branchof the Qarluqs, occupied their territory in the fifth/eleventh century. Nivam al-Mulkstates that he {i.e. the Samanid ruler Natr II b. Armad (301–31/914 – 43)} wasconsidering war against the non-Muslim Turks who had captured Balasaghen around330 –1/941–2, which tells us that this city was regarded as being within the sphereof Islamic influence at that time (SiyAsatnAme, Schefer edn, p. 189 and Barthold whocites it {see Darke trans., p. 215; Barthold, Turkestan, p. 243}). However, a little laterthese Turks became firmly converted to Islam, and the Ilek-Khans {Qarakhanids}who appeared from among them subsequently invaded and conquered Transoxiana.The first Muslim ruler from this family was ‘Abd al-Karcm Sateq Bughra Khan(d. 334/945 – 6), whose legends are still famous in Central Asia. The Turks whomIbn al-Athcr reported during the events of 349/960–1 as being a people of 200,000tents who had adopted Islam ({al-KAmil,} vol. 8, p. 176) were, according to the mostlikely probability, these Qarluq Turks (see above pp. 132ff. {of narrative}). Further-more, Ibn al-Athcr writes that a Turkish tribe that had accepted Islam in nafar 435/"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh157September–October 1043 had its summer pastures around the city of Balasaghen,and the Bulghar Turks had their winter pastures in that area (ibid., vol. 9, p. 179);it is probable that that tribe was also a branch of the Qarluqs, namely the Arghuor Basmıl. In 524 –5/1130, i.e. in the first quarter of the sixth/twelfth century, whenBalasaghen passed into the hands of the pagan Qara Khiuay, we again find theQarluqs and Qanglı in that region ( Juvainc, JahAn-GushA, vol. 2, p. 87).35 Because the Oghuz had a common border with the Arghu, they adopted quite a fewwords from them. For example, taking dag-ol from the Arghu, they transformed it intotekil/degül, “not” ({al-Kashgharc, DCwAn lughAt al-turk,} vol. 1, p. 329, vol. 3, p. 114),and in like manner adopted other words from them (vol. 1, p. 316). It appears fromal-Kashgharc’s account that the Arghu themselves made some linguistic borrowingsfrom the Persians (vol. 1, p. 360). In addition, the Arghu had numerous words incommon with the Yaghma and Qarluqs and at the same time with the populace ofthe city of Uch and the Bulghar Turks. The descriptions of the Arghu dialect given invarious places in the DCwAn lughAt al-turk definitely indicate that it was an Easterndialect that was very close to that of the Qarluqs, i.e. to Khaqaniyya Turkish.36 {See Peter Golden, “The Migrations of the Oxuz,” Archivum Ottomanicum, 4 (1972),45 – 84.}37 {It is noteworthy that Köprülü can disallow the DCwAn-i Likmat as a work with anyvalue for linguistic history because of the long history of copying and recopying thathe assumes to have occurred, yet he cannot imagine that this same long history couldhave rendered this work anything less than a key source on Armad Yasawc’s literarypersonality, nefc thought, etc.}38 Vambéry, flagataische Sprachstudien {there is no such statement in this work as citedbelow in this note; cf. his article “Muhammadanism (in Central Asia),” in Encyclopaediaof Religion and Ethics (New York, 1908 –26), vol. 8, p. 887}; Thúry, “Ondördüncü ‘asırsonlarına kadar Türk dili yâdıgârları.” Vambéry says that this work, which had greatinfluence among the nomads, was widely read and was in the Khokand dialect eventhough it was poorly understood because it incorporated foreign – i.e. Arabic andPersian – words and phrases. Thúry also concludes that “According to the sectionsthat have been published, one could definitely assert that the language of this work isin the dialect spoken in the Khanate of Khokand,” {p. 98}.39 Thúry, ibid.; Togan, Türk-Tatar tarihi. The scholarly meanings of the terms “Uighur”and “Chaghatay” {as designations for languages} are not crystal clear even today.Their sense is vague. Because research on Turkish linguistic and literary history is stillat a very preliminary stage, it is easy for anyone to use these terms at random and –taking advantage of their vagueness – give them whatever meaning he likes.Books that have been written up to now in the Uighur alphabet, like {Yesuf Khattlajib’s} Kutadgu Bilig, {the anonymous} Mi“rAjnAme, {the translation of ‘Auuar’s} Tadhkiratal-awliyA”, and the translation of {Nivamc Ganjawc’s} Makhzan al-asrAr, were con-sidered to be “Uighur” simply because the Uighur alphabet was used. The RussianOrientalist I. Berezin, for instance, in a short treatise that he published seventy yearsago on the classification of the various Turkish dialects, puts forth this observationon Uighur: “This dialect no longer exists. We know it thanks to manuscripts like thoseof {the anonymous} BakhtiyArnAme, Mi“rAjnAme, and Tadhkirat al-awliyA” – the texts ofthese works in the old Uighur alphabet, the forms in which they were copied and theirEnglish translations are found in Arthur Lumley Davids’s A Grammar of the TurkishLanguage (London, 1832) – the Kutadgu Bilig (published by the Orientalist {Amédée}Jaubert {rather, he was the first to bring it to the attention of the scholarly world andto translate a section of it in his ‘Notice d’un manuscrit turc, en charactères ouigours,envoyé par M. de Hammer à M. Abel-Rémusat,’ JA, 6 (1825), 39 –52, 78 –95; see YA,s.v. ‘Kutadgu Bilig’ (R.

Not only are the basic writingsystems of both dialects similar, but they also both contain certain forms that are notfound in others” (Berezin, Recherches sur les dialectes musulmans [Kazan, 1848]). Thismistaken and simplistic view is naturally also found in Davids’s Grammar (French trans.Sarah Davids, Grammaire turke [London, 1836]). Léon Cahun, even though he cameon the scene a half century after these researchers, still followed this old erroneousview and believed that works like the BakhtiyArnAme, Mi“rAjnAme, and Tadhkirat al-awliyA”were written in the Uighur dialect (E. Lavisse and A. Rambaud, {Histoire général duIVe siècle à nos jours (Paris, 1893 –1901),} vol. 3 {Formation des grands états, 1270 –1491,}p. 967 – Introduction à l’histoire de l’Asie, p. 508). Because these various works, whichwere copied in the tenth/sixteenth century, are also found in manuscripts written inArabic script, I see no need to expound on the superficial error of this approach.Scholars who have done somewhat more research on the Turkish language under-stand this error and realize the necessity of turning to history and linguistic historyfor information on this subject. Vambéry and Radloff, on the basis of such observa-tions, thus consider the Kutadgu Bilig to be an Uighur work – because it was writtenin Eastern Turkistan, which was inhabited by Uighurs, and because it has certainlinguistic characteristics different from later Central Asian works (see the introductionto Radloff ’s edition of the Kutadgu Bilig). Agreeing with them, Thúry and many othershave also applied the name Uighur to the linguistic products from the area of EasternTurkistan. The information that I have given above, however, on the number ofTurkish dialects in the fifth/eleventh and sixth/twelfth centuries and their relationshipto each other and their geographical areas, shows clearly that those who lived inthe city of Balasaghen, where the author {Yesuf Khatt lajib} of the Kutadgu Biligwas born, and Kashghar were not Uighurs but Qarluqs, whom al-Kashgharc callsKhaqaniyya Turks. Indeed, the author of the Kutadgu Bilig specifically states thathis work was not in Uighur but in Turkish. That Turkish was the Eastern dialect,which al-Kashgharc calls “Turkish,” without qualification, or “Khaqaniyya Turkish.”With respect to its general linguistic features, the DCwAn-i Likmat was also written inthis dialect.As for “Chaghatay,” the banner term for the literary language of Central Asia, itderives from the name of Chingiz Khan’s son Chaghatay, who ruled that region atone time, and was applied to the Turkish language of Central Asia. Thus, Central Asianand to some degree Qipchaq works, which have been written under the influence ofIslamic civilization since the eighth/fourteenth century, can be subsumed under thisname. Describing both the ethnographic and linguistic consequences of the Mongolinvasion on the entire Turkish world is a separate and important subject requiringmore lengthy research than can be presented here in even a brief outline (for details,see my article “Çagatay edebiyatı”). The simplest and most accurate definition of thisChaghatay – which includes the works of all Central Asian poets and writers, begin-ning with the QiTaT al-anbiyA” of Rabghezc (which includes a number of linguisticfeatures reminiscent of the language of the Kutadgu Bilig that are not found in Chaghatayworks from subsequent periods) and even comprising the followers of Nawa’c – isas follows: “It is the Eastern Turkish literary dialect that was established under theinfluence of Islamic civilization after the Mongol invasion.” The linguistic and historicalanalyses given above suffice to prove that the DCwAn-i Likmat – not the current copybut the original version that would have displayed the linguistic characteristics of thetime and milieu in which it was written – could by no means be included in this linguisticdomain. {In this note Köprülü claims to know the DCwAn-i Likmat’s general linguisticfeatures without having access to early manuscripts and with the acknowledgment"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh159that existing manuscripts are just in Chaghatay. The note culminates with his “proof ”that the phantom DCwAn-i Likmat should not be considered a Chaghatay work.}40 {“Der 0aghataische Diwan Huwedas herausgegeben und übersetzt von M. Hartmann,”in} Berlin Universität, Seminar für Orientalische Sprachen, Mitteilungen, {Westasiatische Studien},5 (1902), p. 133. The author {Kouznietsov} of the Russian work entitled La Lutte descivilizations et des langues dans l’asie centrale is also among those who consider ArmadYasawc to be a Chaghatay poet (p. 76).41 {Here Köprülü’s analysis becomes extremely convoluted, highlighting the untested(and untestable) assumptions that shaped his discussion of the DCwAn-i Likmat. First hecriticizes those, quite rightly, who declared the language of this work to be Chaghatay,and especially those who found its language to be quite similar to the version ofChaghatay known from ninetenth-century Qoqand. Then he insists that, failing theappearance of an old copy of the DCwAn-i Likmat, the way to study its language is tostudy the literary and lingustic milieu in which (he is sure, but without any realjustification) Armad Yasawc lived and wrote. Finally, he admits that all known copiesof the DCwAn-i Likmat do reflect Chaghatay, but that this means nothing. In otherwords, the imaginary early copies of a work, and the linguistic features of other workswritten in the time and place we imagine the work’s author to have lived, are bettersources on the work’s inguistic features (but not on its literary or intellectual features)than existing copies of the work!}42 I believe that even before the Kutadgu Bilig an attempt was made to adapt the “arEQsystem to Turkish and that some works were produced in this meter, and that,especially after the Kutadgu Bilig, many Turkish works were written in those regions inimitation of the Persians. {Armad b. Marmed’s} “Atabat al-RaqA”iq provides some ideaon this matter. However, while these works, which used the “arEQ meter in imitation ofPersian works, were dedicated to various rulers – i.e. were written in a court milieu,naturally subject to strong Muslim Iranian influence – the fact that works that directlyaddressed the great mass of the people, such as the DCwAn-i Likmat, were faithful topopular taste and understanding should not be regarded as a coincidence. We canonly explain this important phenomenon in the history of our literature by the influ-ence of this milieu. It was possible to exhibit great skill and excellence in the Turkishpalaces, which were full of men of state and scholars who knew Persian literature verywell and had received a classical {Islamic} education, by writing in Persian, or at leastby writing things that were comparable to what the Persians wrote. Whether or notthe people understood such things, whether or not they considered them suitable totheir own taste, was of absolutely no importance to the poet who only expected to beappreciated and rewarded by the ruler and palace officials. In contrast, the highlyspiritual, idealistic nefcs, such as Armad Yasawc, who labored for the satisfaction ofGod and did not expect any reward from rulers and men of state, and who weretrying to convey religious and mystical truths to the people, considered it their primaryduty to conform to popular taste and sensibility. We can clearly and definitely see thisstate of affairs in virtually every period of Turkish literature. The nefcs sang not forthe purpose of displaying their art to prominent figures and earning material rewards,but in a state of ecstasy and animated by the ideal of inspiring others with the sacredfeelings overflowing from their souls and quenching {other} thirsty souls from thesublime springs of divinity. We should not forget how important this factor was inmaking them – the nefcs – a much better representative of the national taste than anyother group.43 Although no research has yet been done on the history of the development of theTurkish language, I can try to explain the reasons for this in general outline. First,because he took his subjects wholly from the realms of religion and mysticism, ArmadYasawc had to use their specific and established terminology. In general, the Turks"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE160were only able to extract the new concepts pertaining to sacred law and mysticismof a religion they had newly adopted from the language of the Koran {i.e. Arabic}and also from the works of Persian scholars, who had appropriated those conceptsvia Arabic. Second, loanwords from Arabic and Persian had gradually increasedamong the Turks after they entered the milieu of Islam and the people had becomesomewhat accustomed to them. Thus, even Armad Yasawc, taking this into con-sideration, was not reluctant to use words from foreign languages while addressingthe mass of the people. I have shown above – based on {al-Kashgharc’s} DCwAn lughAtal-turk – that even in the fifth/eleventh century a number of Arabic and Persian wordshad entered the language of both the Eastern and Western Turks, i.e. of both theQarluqs and Oghuz.44 The most commonly used meters in the DCwAn-i Likmat are seven-syllable and twelve-syllable. The oldest examples of Turkish folk literature that have come down to uswere also, for the most part, written in these meters. Indeed, in these early works, thecaesuras of the twelves are usually in the form 4 + 4 + 4. In this respect too thepassages in twelves in the DCwAn-i Likmat conform to the folk literary tradition. Asfor rhyme, the views that I have advanced in another work concerning rhyme in theoldest examples of our folk literature can be applied to the DCwAn-i Likmat: “The rulesof rhyme that our earliest poetry followed were, naturally, of a simple and primitivecharacter. Instead of ‘rhyme’ in the modern sense, it would be more accurate to callthem half rhyme (assonance), because rhyme in our early poetry does not consist ofthe syllables at the end of the verses having the identical sound. This poetry is far frombeing constricted by such a narrow rule. For the existence of rhyme there suffices tobe a minimal similarity in sound among the final syllables. Rhymes can be formed bya partial resemblance in sound, such as deZildi/koZuldu, kuZlatmak/diZletmek/taZlatmak.Sometimes radCf is found along with rhyme, i.e. the last element is fixed and the rhymepertains to the elements preceding it. Sometimes – to be sure as a random effect – onealso comes across passages that rhyme according to the modern view. In any case, wefind this old view of rhyme flourishing in some of the folk poetry that we can considerto be a continuation of our ancient pre-Islamic folk literature. The poets of this earlyperiod usually achieved half rhymes very easily from inflections of the verb” (Türkedebiyatı tarihi, Chapter 4, “ylk ziirler ve ilk zâirler”). In some of the quatrains in theDCwAn-i Likmat, the fourth verse sometimes falls one syllable short. We also find thisfeature in our earliest popular poetry.45 The following information, which I have given in another work on the forms ofversification used in our earliest folk poetry, fully applies to Khwaja Armad Yasawc’sRikmats: “The sagus, or elegies, composed about great heroes, consist of four-versestanzas or quatrains, each verse of which has seven or eight syllables. Sometimes thefour verses of the first quatrain all rhyme together, sometimes all but the third verserhyme. The first three verses of the subsequent quatrains rhyme among themselves,with a different rhyme from the other quatrains. But all of the quatrains are linkedtogether because they have the same rhyme in the fourth verse. These sagus, whichundoubtedly represented a rich and most valuable form of our early Turkish folkpoetry, were generally long. In the early forms of Turkish poetry, two major pointsare worthy of note. First, the forms are few in number and well defined. This isbecause it was not possible for the literary personalities to develop freely in these earlyperiods, and every poet had to respect the existing forms as virtually sacred. Second,in the quatrains constituting elegies, the fourth verse always rhymes. This indicatesthat the elegies were written in order to be sung and that the fourth lines naturallyalways preserved the same rhymes because they constituted a virtual folk-songrefrain’ ” Türk edebiyatı tarihi, Chapter 4, “ylk ziirler ve ilk zâirler”). This type of verse,which evolved from the koZma and dastAn of popular literature to our classical literature"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh161in the murabba“ and Zarkı forms under Arab–Persian influence, is wholly national. Inthis form, which was a vestige of the early periods when there was no separationbetween literature and music, i.e. between words and melody, the first three verseswere to be recited by the poet-composer alone, while the refrain, which was the fourthverse, was to be sung chorus-like by the entire community. The author {lazcnc} ofthe JawAhir states that the Rikmats of Armad Yasawc were recited with special melodiesin the tenth/sixteenth century {he does not, in fact say this}; and we know very wellthat today there are special melodies for the DCwAn-i Likmat among both the Qazaqsin Turkistan and the Turks along the Volga. In exactly the same fashion, as we willsee in detail in the second part of this book, the ilâhîs {hymns} of Ottoman literature,and also a number of popular works, which acquired a religious value among thepeople and were much read, had specific melodies attached to them. {Note: section Cin the narrative is all Köprülü offers as a “minute analysis” of the DCwAn-i Likmat,giving only one example of a poem he believes can be traced to Armad Yasawc,whose work he characterizes broadly as primitive.}46 One can come across this simile (tashbCh) or other such unusual similies in almost allthe nefcs. We find the following lines from Mawlana Jalal al-Dcn Remc, for example:{Before my eye the two worlds are like a seed before a rooster.Thus is the pure vision of one who has seen divine majesty....Consider the business of this world as the weight of two poppy-seeds.}47 There are no traces of Shc‘ism in any form in the early famous works of Farcd al-Dcn‘Auuar, such as the PandnAme. Around the end of his life, however, he praised ‘Alc andthe Twelve Imams with great enthusiasm in the poem MaVhar al-“ajA”ib {again, thispoem is no longer considered to be an authentic work of ‘Auuar}, which he wrote anddedicated to ‘Alc, and declared that he believed in the occultation {gaybet, in 1st ednof Early Mystics; aleyhdarlık, opposition, in 3rd edn} of the mahdC. I mentioned abovethat as a result of this he was banished from Samarqand as a rAfiQC (Chapter 2, p. 43,n.28). Later, Farcd al-Dcn ‘Auuar related this incident in his poem LisAn al-ghaib, whichhe wrote in Mecca, and then could not resist writing these lines:{‘Auuar is a pure Shc‘c, O my son. Embrace this kind of Shc‘ism wholeheartedly.We have rooted out any refuge in Fareq (i.e. ‘Umar). We have stoppedfollowing your “Two Lights” (i.e. ‘Uthman).And you: give up Abe lancfa, and follow after Karrar (i.e. ‘Alc).}"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE162(from the detailed introduction that Mcrza Murammad b. ‘Abd al-Wahhab Qazwcncwrote to the Tadhkirat al-awliyA” published by Nicholson). Although some respect isgiven to Shah lusain and Shahr Bane {the mother of the fourth Shc‘c imAm ‘Alc Zainal-‘fbidcn} in the Istanbul edition of the DCwAn-i Likmat, (p. 205), this is by no meanssomething that could be interpreted as Shc‘ism, for it is common among all Muslims.Furthermore, it is highly likely that this short passage does not belong to ArmadYasawc but was written later. Moreover, it should not be forgotten that even ArmadYasawc, according to tradition, was descended from ‘Alc. Because Hartmann did notknow how the Bektashc UarCqa was connected with Armad Yasawc, he thought that the“Armad Yasawc b. Murammad al-lanafc” in the Bektashc tradition was a completelydifferent person (“Der 0aghataische Diwan Huwedas,” p. 133). The accounts givenabove demonstrate that this is completely erroneous and that even in the CentralAsian version of the legend of Armad Yasawc, which was the basis of the version thatspread in Anatolia, he was considered to be a descendant of ‘Alc.48DCwAn-i Likmat. The meaning of love {“ishq} here is, of course, not “metaphorical”{i.e. earthly} love, but “true” love, i.e. the love of God. Only through love is itpossible to be saved from non-existence and to exalt the human soul and return it tothe original place of its descent. The sole reason why a number of nefcs had a stronginterest in “the beauties of earthly form” {maRAsin-i suwariyya} was because it was onlypossible to attain “true” love via “metaphorical” love, according to the saying {metaphor is the bridge to truth}. However, the long, hair-finebridge leading from human love to divine love is very dangerous. Many on this pathfall into the whirlpool of human passions and are drowned. But once this bridge iscrossed, non-existence is itself obliterated. The lover sees divine beauty in everything.This is what our popular nefcs call “becoming God with God” {Hak ile Hak olmak}.The endless laments of true lovers result from their desperate longing for divinity,which is the soul’s original source. The moving laments that fill the DCwAn-i kabCr ofMawlana, the poet of the famous couplet{The bird of my heart fluttered and had no restIt saw its place of origin and found rest there}and many latitudinarian views, which were considered impossible to adapt to theexternal meaning of the SharC“a, were all a product of such a mad, infinite, divine love.In Armad Yasawc, however, such laments are very feeble – indeed, they hardly exist.49 Mawlana describes this mystical reality in the following manner:{Is that (pure heart) the heart that is enamoured of riches and power, or issubmissive to this black earth and water (the body),Or to vain fancies which it worships in the darkness for the sake of fame,The heart is naught but the Sea of Light: is the heart the place for vision ofGod – and then blind?

Qaqc Yenus ‘Abdal-Malikc says on this matter, “When hearing such expressions as or or {respectively, “Glory be to me,” “I am the Divine Truth,” and “I am He”;see Carl W. Ernst, Words of Ecstasy in Sufism (Albany, NY, 1985)} from a saint, do notimagine this to be a form of self-expression, because the reference in such cases is notto one’s self; instead, the ‘I’ that he announces is the ‘I’ of God.

In fact, Junaid had previously warned him that he had strayed to thewrong path and, according to tradition, when they wanted him to sign the fatwA forhis execution, he only signed it in the madrasa in the attire of the “ulamA” ({‘Auuar,}Tadhkirat al-awliyA”, Nicholson edn, vol. 2, pp. 12, 137).

In like manner, there isa noteworthy legend in {Murammad Parsa’s} FaTl al-khiUAb on why al-lallaj sufferedthis sentence. The legends about this great nefc, whose biography is also found inIbn Khallikan ({WafayAt,} vol. 1, p. 183), are well known in the Muslim world and,because they spread among the people, works were written about him, includingthe LallAjnAme by the early Ottoman poet Mürcdc.

It is worth noting that the DCwAn-i Likmat never mentions Yesuf Hamadanc.}52 For the differences between the great popular nefc of the Western Turks, YenusEmre, and Armad Yasawc, see the second part of this work. In Jalal al-Dcn Remc,there is a strong tendency toward pantheism under the influence of Neoplatonicmysticism. The DCwAn-i Shams al-RaqA”iq of this nefc poet, who expressed ecstatic andpassionate outbursts with a sublime and ardent love, is the finest indication of whatsublime and divine poetry this form of inspiration could produce; indeed, people oftaste and critical sensitivity are unanimous in regarding it as one of the major summitsof nefc literature. For example, referring to Bazm-i alast {the primordial covenantbetween man and God}, which formed a perpetual subject for Ottoman poets, thefollowing lines of Mawlana are very suggestive and poetic:{Before vineyard and vine and grapes were created, our soul was drunk on thewine of everlastingness.In the Baghdad of eternity, we uttered “I am Divine Truth” before Manter’sutterance and arrest and hanging.Before this heart was moulded of water and clay, our life thrived in the tavernof Reality.}Mawlana, who openly confessed “I am Divine Truth” {anA al-Raqq} like Manter{al-lallaj} in the Baghdad of eternity, does not refrain from declaring and revealingthe mystical truths with a most candid ecstasy and exuberance in his DCwAn-i kabCr{i.e. DCwAn-i Shams al-RaqA”iq}.

Our goal is majesty supreme.How different a source have the world of dust and the pure substance!Tho’ we came down, let us haste back – what place is this!(Nicholson, trans., p. 33.)} As for the MathnawC, this is a work of a much morepedagogic nature (see the second part of this book for more on Jalal al-Dcn Remc).53 {See John O’Kane’s trans. of Murammad b. al-Munawwar’s AsrAr al-tawRCd as TheSecrets of God’s Mystical Oneness or The Spiritual Stations of Shaikh Abu Sa”id (Costa Mesa,CA, 1992), p. 514.}54 J. Darmesteter, in Les Origines de la poésie persane (Paris, 1887), advanced the followingview, which is worthy of note, on this matter: “The orthodoxy of Baghdad could notlong satisfy Iran’s mythological and philosophical instincts. Among the people, Islamwas quickly transformed by receiving to its bosom all the old popular mythology thatwas galvanized around the heroic figure of ‘Alc. The new religion that arose from it,Shc‘ism, which combined in itself the inferior elements of these two parent religions,the mythological excess of ancient Iran and the dogmatic intolerance of Islam, andwhich became such a factor in the moral decline of Iran, was fine for the populaceand most of their priests. But it was insufficient for the souls of the elite. Some of themleft Islam more or less openly through science and lack of faith. Others left by meansof mysticism. At the time of Firdawsc, two poets represented these two oppositecurrents. One was the physician Avicenna (Ibn Scna) and the other was the dervishAbe Sa‘cd” (pp. 59 – 60). {Darmesteter goes on to say} “Abe Sa‘cd’s pantheism wasnot as definite and clear as in subsequent poets and it was because of this that he wassuch a great poet. Knowledge (i.e. “ilm), as one calls the nefc intuition, was not for him,as it would be for his successors, a frozen and unchanging belief, a tradition they hadacquired from their masters, a matter to be put in verse. This knowledge – he createdit, nourished it with his blood and tears, with the pain, doubt and contradictions inhis heart” (pp. 81–2). Although not clearly stated in Darmesteter’s book, we find thisidea at least a quarter century earlier in J. A. Gobineau (Les Religions et les philosophiesdans l’asie centrale [Paris, 1866 {reissued, Paris, 1953}], p. 79).

We have followed in the traces ofSana’c and ‘Auuar,} and Dawlat-Shah described the works of this great poet as follows:{The dCwAn of lakcm Sana’c, consisting of over 30,000 couplets, is a gathering ofRaqA”iq and ma“Arif, urging renunciation of the world and reproaching this dust-heapof desires} (Dawlat-Shah, Tadhkira, pp. 95 –9). As for Farcd al-Dcn ‘Auuar, who gainedeven greater fame than Sana’ c, the historical sources differ considerably on the date ofhis death, but Murammad b. ‘Abd al-Wahhab Qazwcnc rightly claims that he musthave lived until the year 617/1220 ({‘Auuar,} Tadhkira, introduction. {His death datemoves back and forth. Cf. EI2, s.v. “‘Auuar” (H. Ritter).} We possess considerableinformation on the mystical life of this great poet. Dawlat-Shah, who regarded himvery highly, states ({Tadhkira,} p. 188):{In the extreme of perfection he was a swelling sea. His ambition was directed to thebanishing of self-will. He withdrew into a corner and shut the door to others. Thousandsof virgin mysteries were revealed to him in seculsion, and in his bed-chamber thebrides of spiritual realities lifted their veils.} In any case, if we take into considerationthe time in which they lived, we can definitely assert that Armad Yasawc was notinfluenced by either lakcm Sana’c or, in particular, Farcd al-Dcn ‘Auuar, even thoughhe may have been familiar with the poetry of earlier nefcs, such as Abe Sa‘cd."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE168Based on Dawlat-Shah, the death date of lakcm Sana’c is given as 576/1180 –1,but this is not correct. Hüseyin Dâniz says in Ser-Âmedân-ı Suhan {Istanbul, 1327/1909}, p. 219, that Sana’c was a disciple of Yesuf Hamadanc and that according toone tradition he died in 576 and according to another in 690/1291, but this is alsomistaken. I have stated above that this nefc poet was for a while in the dervish conventof Yesuf Hamadanc. Based on H. Ethé’s catalogue {Catalogue of Persian, Turkish, Hindustaniand Pushtu Manuscripts [in the Bodleian] (Oxford, 1889)}, the work of G. Ouseley{Biographical Notices of Persian Poets (London, 1846)}, and { Jamc’s} NafaRAt, Prof. Nicholsonhas lowered his death date to 545/1150–1 (Selected Poems from the DCvAni Shamsi TabrCz,p. 259). There are many details on this in the entry on Sana’c in the EncyclopaediaBritannica. {His death date is given as probably 525/1131 in YA, s.v. “Senâ’î” (AhmedAtez) and EI2, s.v. “Sana’c” ( J. T. P. de Bruijn).}57 The works of both lakcm Sana’c and Farcd al-Dcn ‘Auuar were of a pedagogic nature,written to teach ethics and nefc rules of conduct to the people. In the famous poemManUiq al-Uair, which is the most renowned work of ‘Auuar, expounding as it does thetenets of nefism in an allegorical form, and which was translated and extensivelycommented upon by Garcin de Tassy, who considered it to be one of the mostimportant monuments of nefc doctrine (La Poésie philosophique et religieuse chez les persians{d’après le Mantic uttair. . .} [Paris, 1860], p. 6), there are a few rare points that couldbe interpreted according to only the strictist pantheistic beliefs, but they are notsufficient for us to regard him as a “pantheistic nefc poet” (Chapter 10 of Carra deVaux’s Gazali, in which he discusses the Persian nefc poets, p. 289). ‘Auuar, certainlyone of the most prolific of the early Persian poets, did compose much mystical verse,such as{He came to the market place with his face covered; the people were seized by thistalisman. He sent out one ray and the world became a torch; he sowed one seed andthe universe produced all these fruits,} but it is impossible to find in it the divineecstasy and exuberance of Mawlana and his intense pantheism. Sayyid ‘Izz al-Dcnfmilc wrote numerous commentaries on these mystical odes (Dawlat-Shah, {Tadhkira,}p. 190). Nevertheless, it would be more correct to regard the poet of the PandnAme andManUiq al-Uair as a moralist just like Sa‘dc. Carra de Vaux states that one must considerboth of these poets as moralists and even that the ManUiq al-Uair is a didactic workexpounding the fundamental tenets of nefism (Gazali, pp. 281, 283). This is com-pletely in accord with my view. On the subject of Sa‘dc, everyone agrees that hewas not a nefc poet but a great moralist (Carra de Vaux, ibid.). Barbier de Meynard,who translated the BEstAn into French, says that Sa‘dc had little inclination towardnefism, but that he had to give a slight nefc color to his work because of the generaltendency of his time; that he was never a nefc poet comparable to Mawlana or evenlafiv Shcrazc; and that one must view Sa‘dc as one of the most charming and humanemoralists to appear in the Muslim East. This view is quite correct (introduction tohis trans. of BEstAn {as Le Boustan, or Verger; poem persan de Saadi; traduit pour la premièr foisen français. . . (Paris, 1880)}, p. 26; Yran”da Ziir {Poetry in Iran, not further indentified},p. 47).58 The one poem in the DCwAn-i Likmat that reveals a relatively broad-minded andunconstrained nefc doctrine is not in the published editions currently in our possession.It is found in {lazcnc’s} JawAhir, and so we must recognize it as the oldest piece of"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF AlMAD YASAWh169poetry attributed to Armad Yasawc.

It also appears inthe recent Bice edn, pp. 82–3. The text does not, in fact, explicitly state that the poembelongs to Armad Yasawc, but that seems to be the implication. Köprülü’s claim thatthe text has been corrupted by copyists is interesting. The manuscript in which it ispreserved in this form was copied in the same year the work was composed (1002/1593), and there is every reason to suppose that it reflects lazcnc’s intention. PerhapsKöprülü means that lazcnc took it from a written version that had already beencorrupted in transmission. But if so, what is remarkable is that he never draws atten-tion to the most glaring “adjustment” in the text, namely the prevalence of “Oghuz”forms, orthographically and sometimes grammatically, over the Central Asian formswe might expect to find in an “original” DCwAn-i Likmat.

J. W. Gibb, who has beautifully summarized their nefc beliefs in his magnum opus,says “The early nefc poets had taken the current phraseology of the contemporarysingers of love and wine, and by imparting a mystic signification to the terms thusadopted, they had constructed a species of symbolic language in which, for example,‘wine’ represents the mystic love, ‘the vintner’ the teacher thereof, ‘the tavern’ {i.e.the kharAbAt} the place where it is taught, just as the ‘Beloved’ stands for God, and the‘lover’ for man” (A History of Ottoman Poetry {London, 1900 –9}, vol. 1, p. 23 {Köprülüused a Turkish trans. by Fuad Raif of five folios of the first volume as EZ“âr-i osmânîyetarihi}). The poet {Marmed Shabistarc} of Gulshan-i rAz explains the “tavern” of thenefcs in the following couplets:{To be a haunter of taverns is to be freed from self,Self-regard is paganism, even if it be in righteousness.The tavern is of the world that has no similtude,It is the place of lovers that reck not.The tavern is the nest of the bird of the soul,The tavern is the sanctuary that has no place.(Whinfield trans., p. 81.)}This then is the kharAbAt that Mawlana meant in the couplet:{Be of like color with the congregation, so that you may see the soul’spleasure.Come to the alley of the tavern, so that you may see those who swallowdregs,}and that lafiv meant in the couplet:{Do not set foot in the tavern except by the rule of good manners.For those who dwell at its gate are the confidants of the king.}One should not confuse the kharAbAt of the nefcs with the usual kharAbAt of the poets(for details, see my article “Harâbât,” YM, {1 (1917), 186 –8}).60 Many European researchers attribute the fatalism in the Muslim countries to the lackof the notion of free will in Islam, which is completely mistaken. On this subject, seeGobineau’s famous work Les religions, p. 72."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh’S LITERARY INFLUENCE1716AlMAD YASAWh’SLITERARY INFLUENCEA The influence of A£mad Yasaw¢The work of Armad Yasawc, who had no interest whatsoever in artistic expressionand who viewed poetry as simply a means of religio-nefc propaganda, was, asdescribed above, an ordinary product greatly lacking in intrinsic aesthetic value.If we leave aside its historical features and examine the DCwAn-i Likmat merelywith respect to its aesthetic significance, we cannot accord it any great valueaccording to the literary taste of today, indeed, even according to the literarytaste of the past. However, when we study it from a historical point of view, i.e.with respect to its extrinsic value and influence, we must acknowledge the great-ness and power of this work, which has endured for centuries. A literary workwhich, for almost eight {now nine – if not actually four or five} centuries, hasweathered all kinds of {social} transformations and changes in taste, which hasbeen the primary model to be imitated by a great many poets over these centuries,1and which has served the purpose of providing verse to the taste of the popularmasses for centuries, is unquestionably worthy of special attention with regard toliterary history.2 Let me try to shed light on the reasons for this very importantphenomenon so that the fact that the DCwAn-i Likmat has had such a greatextrinsic influence despite its fundamental lack of any significant aesthetic valuewill not remain a mystery.As was previously explained, two fundamental elements in the work of ArmadYasawc are immediately apparent: the Islamic, i.e. the religio-nefc element, andthe national, i.e. the element taken from folk literature. The Islamic element isespecially strong in the subject matter, i.e. in the substance of the work, while thenational element, in contrast to this, is noticeable above all in its form and meter.The Turks, who had recently entered the realm of Islam and who exhibited agreat desire to understand the bases of this new religion, naturally appreciatedthis work, which, with regard to form, seemed to them not at all unfamiliar. Andbecause, with regard to subject matter, the DCwAn-i Likmat aroused their verygreat and sincere interest, it immediately acquired a sacred character amongthe mass of the people.3 Furthermore, the fact that Armad Yasawc was also thefounder of a UarCqa, and its pCr, and that his UarCqa spread to many different and"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE172extensive regions, was perhaps the most important factor in this process. Forthose who joined his UarCqa, reading and memorizing the DCwAn-i Likmat and, forthose who were able, writing the same kind of poetry, i.e. Rikmats, were virtuallyconsidered to be requirements {of membership}. The Rikmats that were recitedduring the dhikrs could not, of course, simply be regarded as the work of anordinary folk poet. They were endued with a sacred aura that overshadowed theiraesthetic quality. The ability of the DCwAn-i Likmat to remain popular over thecenturies, despite all changes in taste, derived from its indisputable sacred valueamong the dervishes. Otherwise, if this feeling of reverence for his verses had nothad the character of an indisputable principle – even an article of faith – thiswork would have long been forgotten. In other words, the major factor thatcaused the DCwAn-i Likmat to endure for centuries and caused numerous writersto adopt it as a model was the religio-nefc spiritual influence of Armad Yasawc,which was described at length above, rather than the aesthetic value of the work.A second factor in addition to this fundamental one was the fact that theregions in which the DCwAn-i Likmat endured have remained under the sameruling principles {hâkim esaslar} for the past eight centuries and have not under-gone an intellectual awakening. The religio-nefc objectives that Armad Yasawcspread and instilled have not changed among the people since that time, but, tothe contrary, have become more widespread and more deeply rooted. The Turkishand Persian poets, the nefcs, the religious scholars and philosophers, and thejurists who appeared since the sixth/twelfth century were not able to createanything great or original but, instead, preoccupied themselves with a multitudeof insignificant details embroidering ancient established principles. Rather thanextend the intellectual horizon, they narrowed it. Indeed, they limited andrestricted it. The Mongol invasion brought, for a while, some new elements fromthe Far East to Central Asian Muslim civilization, but this had hardly any effecton religious and mystical ideas. After experiencing its most brilliant culturalflowering during the time of Tcmer and his descendants, Central Asia was finallysubjected to a state of continuous decline from the fall of the Shibanid dynasty{1500 –99} to the Russian invasion and even up to recent years.Moreover, despite the efflorescence during the Tcmerid period in architecture,fine arts, music, secular literature, in short, all such manifestations of aestheticlife, in the final analysis it was still a time of the triumph of scholasticism andnefism.4 In fact, the ninth/fifteenth century witnessed the flourishing of a numberof great poets and nefcs like Jamc and ‘Ubaid Allah Arrar. Jamc, in turn, exerciseda tremendous mystical influence on ‘Alc Shcr Nawa’c, his contemporaries andfollowers. As pahcr al-Dcn Babur Shah, the conqueror of India, perceived veryclearly with his customary insight, the nefism of the men who gathered around‘Alc Shcr Nawa’c at the court of Sultan lusain Baiqara in Herat was mainlyphilosophical and literary in character and was naturally very unconstrainedand dissolute {rindAne}.5 A bit later, however, at the time of the Shibanid dynasty,and in subsequent centuries, this powerful nefc current swept through all ofCentral Asia and, as was explained above, assumed a religious form that was"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh’S LITERARY INFLUENCE173very ascetic and that rigorously conformed to fundamental Islamic dogmas underthe name of Naqshbandism, which we can consider as a branch of Yasawism.6In other words, the social milieu gradually developed to the point at which itcould accept the work of Armad Yasawc with even greater enthusiasm.Just as the first of the two elements that shaped the work of Armad Yasawc,i.e. the religio-nefc element, thus remained unchanging in the social milieu forcenturies and conformed each day a bit more to the common {religious} inclina-tion, so the national element, which is so striking in the meter derived from folkliterature, also remained fixed in the social milieu. In other words, it did notdeviate from the {literary} inclination of the age. Because the folk literaturehas remained virtually constant from the sixth/twelfth century to the present,the DCwAn-i Likmat never went out of fashion with respect to popular taste. Itendured with the same power – even with a quasi-sanctity – over the people ofthe steppes, the Qazaqs and Qipchaqs, who were completely unfamiliar with theclassical Persian literature. Given these factors, it is no longer a mystery that theDCwAn-i Likmat, which essentially possesses no great aesthetic value, has enduredso vigorously over such a wide area for eight centuries.After Armad Yasawc, it became de rigeur for the dervishes who belonged tothe Yasawc UarCqa to write the same type of works that he did.7 For the Yasawcdervishes who had a modicum of poetic skill, following the road opened bythe pCr of the UarCqa acquired the character of a sacred duty. Thus, beginningwith Sulaiman Baqirghanc, i.e. the famous lakcm Ata, numerous Yasawc andNaqshbandc shaikhs and dervishes wrote the same kinds of Rikmats. These Rikmatswere virtually indistinguishable from each other with regard to subject, form,and style because the pattern established by the great pCr had acquired a virtualsanctity and it was felt that one should not deviate from it in any way. Only aftermany centuries had passed and the “arEQ metrics had become thoroughly incor-porated in literature did some nefc poets, no longer objecting to the use of a nowfamiliar metrical system, begin to use it to write mystical poetry, prayers {munAjAt},and narratives. Still, the old type of Rikmat continued to have a much strongerappeal than these other efforts and never conceded its place to the “arEQ system.Although we do not have much definite information, we can deduce that thenefcs, i.e. the poets in the tekkes, finally began to write works in “arEQ and thatthese types of works began to increase in the tenth/sixteenth century. In myview, “arEQ could not have entered the tekkes and khAnqAhs until after ‘Alc ShcrNawa’c. There had already been some occasional efforts in this direction beforeNawa’c, but it was not until the tenth/sixteenth century that they were able togo beyond random individual efforts and take the form of a vigorous generalmovement, and that the “arEQ system assumed a more or less popular character.Still, these nefc poets, who saw nothing wrong with using “arEQ, at the same timewere always eager to write Rikmats in the syllabic meters. Among the early productsof our literature, the influence of Armad Yasawc can also be clearly seen in thewell known poem of YEsuf u ZulaikhA written by a poet named ‘Alc in Central Asiain 630/1232–3.8"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE174Thus, on the one hand, the followers of Armad Yasawc, remaining faithful tohis literary traditions, produced simple nefc works for the people. On the otherhand, meanwhile, Persian influence gradually increased, and in the palaces ofthe Turkish rulers a number of Turkish works were composed in “arEQ in imita-tion of the Persians. This trend, which had begun with {Yesuf Khatt lajib’s}Kutadgu Bilig and {Armad b. Marmed’s} “Atabat al-LaqA”iq, continued in theSeljuk period, and maintained its importance during the Mongol period. Later,in the Tcmerid period, it began to develop with renewed vigor and, after producingpoets like Amcr Saif al-Dcn, Mcr laidar, Luufc, and Sakkakc, reached its highestpoint with Nawa’c.9 These poets, who thought of nothing but skillfully imitatingthe perfect examples of the great Persian poets, and so gave no value to thepopular language and taste and to the national meter and forms derived fromfolk literature, tried to display their talent in the courts by approaching thosePersian models as closely as possible. It was quite natural, therefore, that ArmadYasawc would have absolutely no influence on them. The influence of ‘Alc ShcrNawa’c was paramount throughout Central Asia until the collapse of the Shibaniddynasty. Only then did there begin to flourish, among groups of local poets whoappeared in various regions of Central Asia, popular nefc poets who took ArmadYasawc as a model alongside the classicizing court poets who imitated Nawa’c. Inthis way, the influence of Armad Yasawc, who had almost been forgotten in theliterary world for about two or two and a half centuries, reasserted itself with astrength that was no doubt greater than it had been in the past. This importantphenomenon can also explain, as I stated above, the rapidity and vigor withwhich the social milieu once again hankered after an ascetic nefism.Thus, among the imitators of Armad Yasawc, in addition to the popular nefcpoets, i.e. the tekke poets, there also appeared a group of folk poets who cannotbe regarded as nefcs in the full sense, although they took their basic literarynotions mainly from the tekkes. These were the “Ashıqs or minstrels who, with sazin hand, wandered from tekke to tekke, coffee house to coffee house, and city tocity. These minstrel poets, who replaced the old Turkish ozans or bakhshis {bAqshCs,bakhshCs, bakshıs, and other forms},10 for the most part had no madrasa education,but acquired whatever learning they had on their own. Therefore they werebetter acquainted with the popular taste and spirit and they made use of folkliterature in great measure. This being the case, and because virtually all of themwere connected with either the Yasawc or Naqshbandc UarCqa, they learned by eara great deal about the principles of nefism and the rules of the order, and theynaturally made abundant use of words and expressions related to such thingsin their works.11 The works of these “Ashıqs – who took their inspiration fromIslamic tradition, the legends of famous saints, the old Iranian epics, or else fromnational subjects or contemporary events – were naturally more varied thanthose of the nefcs and generally were of a semi-religious or non-religious nature.Thus, they were more satisfying to the national taste. These works were far,however, from the sanctity that was accorded to the Rikmats of the nefcs. Justas the “Ashıqs among the Western Turks had begun to use “arEQ after Nescmc"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh’S LITERARY INFLUENCE175{d. 820/1417–18} and especially after Fuqelc {d. 963/1556}, those among theEastern Turks did so after Nawa’c {d. 506/1501}. Nevertheless, while they didmake some use of “arEQ – like the poets who appeared after Nawa’c – they stillgave much more importance to the syllabic meter. This is the reason why Vambérysays that, in the books of minstrel poetry that he collected under the title Bakhshikitâbı, he came across numerous works by various poets written in both “arEQ andthe syllabic meters.12 In any case, it is quite clear that Armad Yasawc exerted avery powerful influence on these popular “Ashıqs as well as on all the poets of thenefc tekkes in Central Asia.Among the nefc poets who imitated Armad Yasawc and flourished in CentralAsia – Qel Shams al-Dcn, Khudaidad, hqanc, Qel ‘Ubaidc, Faqcrc, Armad Yasawc{sic}, Baiqa, Bihbedc, Shuhedc, Qel Sharafc, Geda, Ghazzalc, oufailc, Qasim,Mashrab, Hüveydâ, etc. – there were many who differed not only in time butalso in quality and fame. It would be outside the scope of this work to providehere even a very brief general account of all of them.13 These poets, some ofwhom have dCwAns ( published and unpublished) and some of whom have only afew scattered compositions, wrote some poems in “arEQ as well as Rikmats in thestyle of Armad Yasawc. A poet of this type from Khokand wrote, under the penname Güldeste, an important dCwAn modeled after the DCwAn-i Likmat.14 In short,Armad Yasawc was a very important poet who, with his powerful personality,influenced the Turkish literature of Central Asia for centuries and created hisown unique type of poetry.B Sulaim™n B™qirgh™n¢ {¡ak¢m Ata}In the field of literature, the first and most famous follower of Armad Yasawcwas his third khalCfa lakcm Sulaiman Ata {Baqirghanc}. We know from {nafc’s}RashaRAt that this nefc, whose life and legends I discussed at length above (Chap-ter 4, pp. 89–94), produced a number of Turkish works15 and that they werevery famous in Turkistan.16 Indeed, legend states that from his early childhoodhe began to recite versified Rikmats thanks to the spiritual power of Khaqir. Thus,the first Rikmat on the first page of the famous book of lakcm Ata begins with theline Hızır-Ylyas atam bar {I have a father Khaqir-ylyas}. In any case, both historyand dervish tradition show that lakcm Sulaiman Ata was also a nefc poet likeArmad Yasawc.The major works that have been attributed to lakcm Sulaiman Ata, such asBâqirghân kitâbı, Âkhir zamân kitâbı, and {LaQrat-i} Maryam kitâbı, are popular worksthat are still read with great rapture and excitement in Central Asia, especially inthe region of the Volga. If we leave aside Maryam kitâbı and also Âkhir zamân kitâbı– which is a rather long but simple dastAn put in the tongue of an ascetic aboutthe portents of the end of time, Gog and Magog, the messiah {mahdC}, the dAbbatal-arQ (an animal that will appear with the mahdC on the Day of Judgment), andthe events of the Day of Judgment – Sulaiman Ata’s major work is a famouscollection of poetry called Bâqirghân kitâbı. Glancing over this collection, which"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE176has been published in several editions, it becomes quite clear that it compriseshymns and nefc poems belonging to various poets of different times – exactly likethe DCwAn-i Likmat – and that it definitely cannot be attributed to a single person.Not only the style and contents of the poems but even the pen names {of thevarious authors} suffice to show this.17Much of the folk poetry in the syllabic meter written by Khwaja SulaimanBaqirghanc under different pen names, such as Qel Sulaiman, lakcm Sulaiman,lakcm Khwaja Sulaiman, and lakcm Ata, resembles the work of Armad Yasawcin every respect: dastAns about the Ascension and death of the Prophet; dialogueof heaven and hell; the very famous legend about how only those who repentwould be able to drink from the four rivers that flow through heaven while thosewho do not repent would be given instead the poison from the tree that grows inhell {zakkum}; events on the Day of Judgment; fear of God; Moses being adisciple of Khaqir; the story of Ishmael and Abraham; some nefc thoughts on thevirtues of dervishes and being a dervish and on the transitory nature of thisworld; eulogies about Armad Yasawc; and so forth.The basic spirit pervading all these things is exactly that of the DCwAn-i Likmat.The space devoted to mystical love in Sulaiman Ata, as in the work of ArmadYasawc, is very little, and suitable for the religious training not of true lovers{“Ashıqs} but rather of ascetics. “If the shadow of love touches someone, heshould become a lover. For the lover, the nurse of love is pain and torment. Thepath of love is long and its night is terrifying. One should forfeit his soul and diveinto the unfathomable sea of love.” The love of this ascetic, who speaks of thesweetness of mentioning {dhikr} God just before dawn together with the birds, isevidently no different than that of his shaikh Armad Yasawc. We see this identitynot only in subject matter but also in form and style. For example, the metersand forms used in the DCwAn-i Likmat, and their major characteristics, are foundin exactly the same manner in the works of lakcm Sulaiman Ata. Therefore, wecan definitely say that Sulaiman Ata tried to conform completely to the personalityof his shaikh rather than to exhibit an individual personality of his own, bothartistically and doctrinally. He took great pains to imitate him fully in literatureas well as in the rules of the order and mystical doctrines, for, as explainedabove, writing nefc Rikmats like those of Armad Yasawc was not an aesthetic orpersonal matter but was simply one of the protocols of Yasawism. BecauseSulaiman Ata was the one who first established this tradition, he deserves to holdthe most important place among the followers of Armad Yasawc. It is preciselyfor this reason that his work, together with that of his shaikh, has vigorouslyendured among the people for eight centuries.18C ConclusionWe have seen above what a powerful moral influence Armad Yasawc has longexerted on the entire Turkish world. Therefore, after describing his influenceon the corpus known collectively as Chaghatay literature and in Central Asia"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh’S LITERARY INFLUENCE177generally, we should also show the scope and power of his influence in the othervast regions of the Turkish world. We may thus attain a clear and definite ideaas to the extent of the DCwAn-i Likmat’s penetration and dissemination. In orderto do this, we have to search for the influence of Armad Yasawc in four mainregions: the area of the Qipchaqs, i.e. the present-day Northern Turks; the areaof the Turkmen; the area of the Azercs; and the area of the Western Turks, i.e.Anatolia and Rumelia.The literature of the earliest periods of the first of these different linguisticareas, i.e. the northern area, is almost entirely unknown. While a few texts of alinguistic character survive, there are hardly any of a literary character. Only afew rare and valuable works, like the MaRabbatnAme,19 reveal that a number ofliterary works imitating classical Persian literature appeared during the eighth/fourteenth century under the patronage of the Turkish rulers and princes withinthe realm of the Golden Horde. Consequently, these were written not in thelocal dialect but in the literary dialect that we call Chaghatay. Still, one wonderswhat kind of popular literary works were created in that region at that time.How much were the Rikmats of Armad Yasawc and Sulaiman Baqirghanc readamong the people and how much influence did they have? Given our currentpaucity of information, it is hardly possible to give precise answers to thesedifficult questions. All we know is that there endured among the people, inaddition to literature like the MaRabbatnAme that imitated Persian works, a num-ber of works whose subjects were taken from early popular mythology, such aslusam Katib’s famous story of Kesikbash entitled Jumjuma sulUAn,20 and someother early stories and verse compositions of this sort.21 It is highly likely that theRikmats of Armad Yasawc and especially Sulaiman Baqirghanc were among them,because we know that collective works like the DCwAn-i Likmat, Bâqirghân kitâbı,and Âkhir zamân kitâbı, which included the poetry of Yasawc dervishes, were verywidespread and famous among the Northern Turks from an early period.22 Inrecent years, i.e. during the early years of the twentieth century, a new literaturebegan to take shape among the Northern Turks under the influence of Europeancivilization. Yet it suffices to study the earlier literature only superficially in orderto detect the clear and unquestionable influence of Armad Yasawc and hisfollowers and imitators.23We can also see the influence of Armad Yasawc on the Turkmen tribes, mostof whom were nomads living in a vast area extending from Balkh and Herat toAstarabad between the Amu Darya and the Caspian Sea. These Turkmen,whose literature, given their social level, could be no more sophisticated thanfolk literature and whose primitive aesthetic needs were met by various kinds offolk poetry that was composed and sung by bakhshis, or minstrels {saz poets},were long familiar with the nefc Rikmats of Armad Yasawc and his followers, aswell as with the Dede Korkut stories. In the work of the folk poet Makhdem Qulc{1733?– 82?}, which they regard as quasi-sacred, the influence of Armad Yasawcis readily apparent – as Vambéry has quite rightly pointed out. This Naqshbandcdervish, who lived about a century and a half ago and wandered about"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE178Transoxiana and northern Iran with saz in hand, is considered even today to bethe greatest nefc poet of the Turkmen. Like the “Ashıqs of Azerbaijan and Anatolia,he composed poems of a very local character inspired from daily life. Thesedescribed folk heroes and accounts of alaman, i.e. tribal warfare. In his nefcethical poems, this poet shows exactly the same spirit and style as Armad Yasawc.He says that the world is transitory, that believers should strive basically for thehereafter, that his heart pounds with the love of God, and that he wants toaccompany true dervishes who sing for God’s sake. He tries to instill the need toworship God, to be pious, to avoid evil deeds, to acquire good habits, and otherethical principles – exactly the same things that are stressed in the DCwAn-iLikmat. It is quite evident, therefore, that Armad Yasawc also exerted a stronginfluence on the folk poets of the Turkmen.24Perhaps the least known linguistic and literary region of Turkish up to thepresent is that lying between Central Asia, where the great literary dialect thatwe call Chaghatay prevailed, and Asia Minor, where Seljuk Turkish was thedominant language. This middle region, which includes the area around Baghdad,Mosul, Diyarbakir, eastern Anatolia, and Caucasian and Iranian Azerbaijan, iswhere Azerc was used. This language very closely resembles the Anatolian, i.e.the Seljuk-Ottoman dialect. I believe that this later dialect came about as a resultof the migrations caused by the Mongol invasion and the appearance of newethnic groupings. We know that the earliest product of this dialect was themystical poetry of the nefc lasan-oxlu, who wrote before 700/1300 and wongreat fame not only in his own territory but also in Anatolia because of thedialectical similarity.25 Unfortunately, almost nothing of his poetry has survived.One can surmise, however, that this Turkish poet, who was well known forwriting Persian nefc poetry, must have been preoccupied with the subject ofnefism and, given his wide fame, must have written many hymns in the Yasawcmanner and in the syllabic meter. We can definitely conclude that the türküs ofthe famous lasan-oxlu – if they in fact belong to him (we have no conclusiveevidence if they can be attributed to him or not) – which the Ottoman biographers{tezkireciler} of the tenth/sixteenth century spoke of rather disparagingly, nodoubt because they were written in the syllabic meter in imitation of folk poetry,reveal the contemporary influence of Armad Yasawc.26 This hypothesis gainseven more credence if we take into account that the vestiges of folk literatureand mythology maintained their vigor in this middle Azerc area from a veryearly period.27I have expounded in detail above {Chapter 2, pp. 31–5} how and when thelegends of Armad Yasawc spread to Anatolia and how Yasawc dervishes wentthere without interruption. The second half of my book is devoted to analyzingthe rise and development of popular nefc literature among the Turks of Anatolia.A comprehensive account of Armad Yasawc’s literary influence on the WesternTurks is to be found there. Thus, there is no need to say anything about thissubject here. When the history of the nefc movement among the Turks, i.e. thehistory of the UarCqas, is more carefully studied, when many aspects of Turkish folk"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh’S LITERARY INFLUENCE179literature and Turkish ethnography that today are unknown become clarifiedthrough serious and detailed research, and when the history of Turkish liter-ature, which even today is regarded as a virtual enigma by the scholarly world,is scientifically established and explained, then the widespread and long-lastinginfluence of this early Turkish nefc on the entire Turkish world will be muchbetter understood.NOTES1 {It did not occur to Köprülü, or others, that the “imitations” were, in fact, the model,or even the stuff out of which the DCwAn-i Likmat was created.}2 Prof. Hartmann, while speaking of the Chaghatay poet Chimyanlı Hüveydâ, says thatArmad Yasawc provided all of Turkistan with spiritual fulfillment through the dCwAnthat he created, and he states: “If one considers that the death of the author of theDCwAn-i Likmat occurred only a century after the composition of the Kutadgu Bilig, theimportance of this book, which lives even today among his countrymen – almost 760years after the death of the poet – is patently obvious” ({“Der 0aghataische DiwanHuwedas,”} p. 133). In fact, all European scholars who have done research on Turkishhistory have more or less understood the importance of Armad Yasawc. According toCahun’s famous history, for example, “In the time of Tcmer, Turkish gained theupper hand over Persian. The men of Transoxiana awakened and no longer wrote inPersian but in Chaghatay. Before them, Khwaja Armad Yasawc of Turkistan wrote inthe popular language, but as can be seen from the historical works written by Juvainc,Rashcd al-Dcn, and Vattaf on the order of Mongol princes, the language of the courtand of science was Persian. However, after Khwaja Armad Yasawc in particular,Turkish gained such importance that books of religious propaganda and edificationlike Mi“rAjnAme, ‘Book of the Ascension’ (1442), BakhtiyArnAme, ‘Book of Fortune’ (1432),and Tadhkirat al-awliyA”, ‘Attestation of the Saints’ were written in the Uighur dialectand alphabet” ({Introduction à l’histoire de l’asie,} pp. 507– 8). In like manner, Rambaudin the section that he wrote on the empire of Tcmer for Histoire général {prepared withLavisse} adds to this description the following view of Armad Yasawc, “KhwajaArmad Yasawc, who was the first and in my opinion the greatest of the Central AsianTurkish poets” (vol. 3, p. 967). For some reason, however, Cahun did not record thisview in the history that he later published. Nevertheless, it will be well understood byreaders of this book the extent to which, and the points on which, the information hegives is deserving of criticism. Kouznietsov tries to describe the status of ArmadYasawc, citing Cahun and Vambéry, in the following manner: “After the conquest ofCentral Asia, Turkish civilization began to develop in confrontation with the Iraniansand reached its zenith during the reign of Tcmer. This development, by first assertingthe idea of Turkish nationality, goaded the country’s intellectual life onto this path. Inthis respect, the Uighurs were also of assistance in that their influence in Central Asiahad already begun at the time of Chingiz Khan. Alphabets derived from Christiansources were also used in the empire of Tcmer and it was only in the middle of thefifteenth century ad that the Arabic-Persian script was able to hold its own. Accordingto what Vambéry states in his History of Bokhara {2nd edn (London, 1873; reprintedNew York, 1973)} (Chapter 11), in the second half of the fourteenth century ad, theTurkish national feeling revealed itself especially when the national language calledChaghatay was used in place of Persian as the official language. Translations andimitations of Arabic and, especially Persian, works appeared and became widespread.Chaghatay writers appeared along with the Uighur author {Yesuf Khatt lajib} ofthe Kutadgu Bilig. The most famous of them were Khwaja Armad Yasawc, the pCr of"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE180the city of Turkistan, Tcmer himself, Murammad nalir, ‘Alc Shcr Nawa’c, the founderof classic Chaghatay, Babur, and Abe ’l-Ghazc the Khan of Khiva” (La Lutte desCivilizations, pp. 75 – 6). It is quite natural that such general observations based on verysuperficial and rudimentary analyses would be for the most part erroneous. In fact,although the studies done on Armad Yasawc in Europe have been so superficialand, in a great many respects, erroneous, the Orientalists still succeeded in vaguelyperceiving this subject, even if they did not definitely and clearly grasp the extent ofthe importance of Armad Yasawc, which neither our older nor younger historiansand researchers have been able to understand. Barthold states that in addition to thestudies and translations that have been done in Europe on Armad Yasawc, a Russianresearcher named N. Lykoshin has translated {into Russian}, with annotations, someof his Rikmats {in “Premudrost’ Khazrat-Sultana Arifin-Khodzh-Akhmada Iassavi(mogila ego v mecheti g. Turkestana),” Sbornik materialov dlia statistiki Syr-Dar”inskoioblasti, 9 (1901), otd. II, in 76–105} ({mentioned in Barthold’s} “Russische Arbeitenüber Westasien: Jahresbericht für 1901,” Berlin Universität, Seminar für Orientalische Sprachen,Mitteilungen, Westasiatische Studien, 5 {1902}, p. 44).3 There is an important point to be considered here. It is very likely that the Rikmats ofArmad Yasawc were collected not by him himself but by his dervishes somewhatlater. Because he recited his Rikmats not to exhibit skill and artistic talent but to instructand guide, it is hardly possible that he attempted to collect them in the form of adCwAn. Most probably, because of the sacred character attributed to these works {i.e.the Rikmats}, individual Rikmats were later collected and then arranged and compiledinto a dCwAn, and it is for this reason that we cannot find an old copy of the DCwAn-iLikmat. We shall see in the second part of this book that Yenus Emre’s dCwAn was alsocreated in this manner.4 Cahun’s view of this subject is worthy of note. According to him, “After cutting theirties with Chinese traditions . . . and firmly adopting the orthodox Transoxianan church,the Central Asian Turks began a new life. After about a century, they became soimbued with Islamic philosophy, literature, and art that they became strangers totheir native soil, unable to communicate with other Turks (who had not entered theIslamic millieu).. . . In accepting Islam as the religion of state, the Turks of Turkistan,Transoxiana, and Khwarazm adopted it as a whole, without reflection, withoutdiscussion, militarily like a command.. . . Thus, the renaissance in Central Asia wasnothing more than the beginning again of the Middle Ages. While Europeans, underthe lash of Hellenism and bedazzled by the rediscovery of Antiquity, set off boldlytoward the unknown, to independent research and to revolution, the Asians (i.e.Turks), who up to the fifteenth century had been their equals, let themselves beled docilely to school, such as it was conceived by the doctors and scholars of theorthodox caliphate. They discovered, as something of a novelty, Aristotelian philo-sophy, which the Arabs had distorted (as if they had found something unknown).They came back to the Almagest and immersed themselves in the ideas of Ibn Scna,their countryman, and they began to relive in Turkish the Samanid period andmarched in place. They spent their intellectual activities, which were by no meansinferior to those of others, on scholasticism, jurisprudence, and rhetoric. With greateffort, they revived Euclid, Ptolemy, Galen, and Hippocrates, only barely daringto touch on Plato. Going any further would have meant getting lost. Little by little,with the help of the monks (i.e. mystics), they came to think of nothing more thantheir salvation and contented themselves with the Koran and the compendia thatit inspired.. . . The Turk had abdicated spiritually to his pir and temporally to hissultan” ({Introduction à l’histoire de l’asie,} pp. 502–3). If we leave aside the numeroushistorical errors in these details, and the hasty generalizations, there is in fact a greatamount of truth in what Cahun says. After the time of Tcmer and his sons, the"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh’S LITERARY INFLUENCE181Central Asian Turks went continuously backward in a regressive movement. Thisdecline is obvious in all aspects of their lives (for more information on this subject, seemy article “Çagatay edebiyatı,” YA).5BAburnAme, among the events of 911/1505 – 6 {see the Thackston trans., pp. 205 –28}.Noteworthy information is found on this matter in my article “Çagatay edebiyatı,” YA.{See also Jo-Ann Gross and Asom Urunbaev, Letters of KhwAjah “Ubayd AllAh ARrAr andHis Associates (Leiden, 2002).}6 {Such a statement betrays Köprülü’s ignorance of nefc history in Central Asia afterthe fifteenth century.}7 {Köprülü provides no evidence of this.}8 This important Turkish work, which was studied and published by Houtsma in 1889based on the manuscripts in the Dresden and Berlin libraries {“Ein alttürkischesGedicht”} and which was later published in a new edition prepared by Prof.Brockelmann, who made a thorough examination of it {“Ali’s Qissa”i Jusuf}, was writtenin a twelve-syllable meter with caesuras of 4 + 4 + 4, just like the Rikmats of ArmadYasawc, and dastAn, i.e. quatrain, form just like his dastAns {See EI2, s.v. “Yesuf andZulaykha,” part 2, Turkish Literature (Barbara Flemming)}. In this Islamic story,which was written to be recited among the people, it is quite natural that this import-ant nefc poet remained faithful to the literary traditions that were so well suited to thepopular taste. The syllabic meters, which were used by folk poets and nefcs until “arEQand works in imitation of Persian poetry became common in the Turkish palaces –and even after they had become common – were not employed by the poets of theupper class who composed artful poetry addressed to their peers. Among the Chaghataypoets of the ninth/fifteeth and tenth/sixteenth centuries, including ‘Alc Shcr Nawa’c,who demonstrated in his MuRAkamat al-lughatain that he was a genuine nationalist, wefind none who gave any value to the national meter, although the period can beconsidered one of national revival for the Eastern Turks. Only in the DCwAn of pahcral-Dcn Babur {MS in Köprülü’s private library and partly published by him in“Zahiruddin Muhammad Bâbur [ah’ın ’Risâle-i vâlidiyye,” MTM, 1 (1331/1915),113 –24, 235–56, 464 – 80, and 2 (1331/1915), 308 –26; ed. Bilâl Yüce as Babür Dîvânı(Ankara, 1995)}, do we find one qiU“a {piece, composition} and also one ghazal, with asyllabic stroph of 7 + 7 = 14 – thus, in the national meter. As I stated in another work,with the exception of the tekke poets and the folk poets, i.e. the bakhshis (“Ashıqs),who wrote Rikmats and hymns, the national meter and national forms had long beenabandoned among the Eastern and Western Turks alike and were always met bythe scorn and ridicule of the classical poets. It is not possible to explain even brieflyhere the reasons for this and how long this view persisted (“Türk edebiyatında âzıktarzının menze’ ve tekâmülü,” p. 26). {Köprülü knows of the use of the “arEQ system bythe Chaghatay poets of Central Asia in the fifteenth century, before Nawa’c, but hewants to evict it from the tekkes and khAnqAhs until Nawa’c somehow installs it there.Thus, he has to declare the Chaghatay poets to be slavish imitators of Persian. Thenhe can explain (implicitly: he doesn’t call attention to the fact) why Armad Yasawc isnever mentioned as a poet, nor is verse by him cited, by these Chaghatay poets. Aneasier way to explain why those writers never mention verse by Armad Yasawc, or hisstatus as a poet, is to assume that neither verse nor that status were yet known.Perhaps more remarkable than Köprülü’s views on literary history is his apparentassumption that Persian and Turkic poets lived and wrote in utter isolation from oneanother. Why was it normal for popular nefc poets in Persian to know and use the“arEQ system, but not for popular nefc poets in Turkic? As for the poem written by acertain ‘Alc, Armad Yasawc’s influence is “clearly seen” only through a supposedlyshared meter and Armad Yasawc’s presumed death prior to ‘Alc’s work.}9 For further information, see my article “Çagatay edebiyatı,” YA."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE18210 For clear and detailed information on the bakhshi-ozans and their various functions inpre-Islamic Turkish life, see my “Türk edebiyatı’nın menze’i,” pp. 1–80. [See nowKöprülü’s “Bahzı,” YA, in which he corrects some of the conclusions he reached inthis earlier article.] {Actually, here in the narrative, Köprülü is projecting Anatoliancircumstances onto Central Asia.}11 This phenomenon is encountered in almost the same fashion in the histories of allliteratures. In Europe, for example, the priest-poets of the pagan period maintainedtheir religious aura with the establishment of Christianity. Whatever stage of Europeanhistory is studied, one sees that the poets called ménestrels were regarded by the peopleas having a sacred nature, and even their clothing preserved the fashion of a religiousdress. Virtually all the most famous troubadours, equivalent to the “Ashıqs, of thoseperiods spent their lives in monasteries (Herbert Spencer, The Principles of Sociology,{3rd rev. edn (New York, 1890)}, vol. 5, Chapter 4, pp. 48 – 68, which discussesprofessional institutions). While discussing the bakhshi-ozans in the work mentionedabove, I demonstrated that the same phenomenon is also encountered in our liter-ature. For more information on this, see my XVI. asır sonuna kadar Türk sazZAirleri(Istanbul, 1930), and Türk sazZâirleri (Ankara, 1962), vol. 1.12 This collection of the works of saz poets, which was called Bakhshi kitâbı {the bakhshibook}, is very rich and varied: in addition to a number of popular pieces, which weremainly current among the Turkmen and Özbeks, it also includes several piecesselected from the poetry of secondary poets, and even a large section drawn fromthe ghazals of Nawa’c, which were very poorly known and appreciated despite theirsimplicity ( Vambéry, flagataische Sprachstudien, pp. 33 – 4.) {This contains a small sectionfrom the Bakhshi kitâbı, pp. 132– 43, and three of Nawa’c’s ghazals, pp. 177– 80.} Suchcollections, which also included a great many pieces from Azerc poets like Fuqelcand Nescmc, were indeed highly varied and were arranged according to the taste ofthe compiler. Because the literary relations between the Central Asian Turks andAzerc Turks had long been very strong and close, it is quite natural that these twogreat Azerc poets were so well known that they were regarded as native poets inCentral Asia as well as in Anatolia. Considering that there were intellectual andliterary relations of long standing among the different regions of the Turkish world –for example, the ties between Herat and Istanbul during the reign of Mehmet II andamong the courts of Khurasan, Iran, India, and Istanbul during the reign of Süleymanthe Magnificent – it is quite evident that the history of Turkish literature can only bestudied as a whole.13 The research that has been done to date on these poets is, of course, very little anddeficient. Hartmann’s studies on Chimyanlı Huvaida {“Der 0aghataische DiwanHuwedas”} and {Baba Rarcm} Mashrab {this is a reference to Hartmann’s article“Me⁄reb der weise Narr und fromme Ketzer: Ein zentralasiatisches Volksbuch,” Derislamische Orient, vol. 5 (Berlin, 1902); Mashrab d. 1711}, for instance, are naturallyvery deficient, because some of their biographies have meanwhile unfortunately beencompletely forgotten. The studies on them done by certain Russian scholars, andespecially the important research published by Prof. A. N. Samoilovich as “Materialypo sredneaziatsko-Turetskoi literature,” {ZVO, 19 (1909), 1–30; 22 (1913 –14), 127–53; ZKV, 2 (1927), 257–74} are inaccessible to me. It is therefore apparent that, giventhe scanty material that we currently possess, it is impossible to make critical analysesof the Central Asian poets in the post-Nawa’c period. In order to do a proper study ofthese Central Asian Turkish poets who flourished after the Shibanids, it would benecessary to do research in Turkistan and to make use of Russian sources on thissubject. The most extensive and reliable information on this subject was first collectedin my article “Çagatay edebiyatı,” YA, {now see H. F. Hofman, Turkish Literature, aBio-bibliographical Survey. For discussion of some of the names to which poems found in"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh’S LITERARY INFLUENCE183versions of the DCwAn-i Likmat are ascribed, see A.

Unfortunately,we know nothing apart from this about this poet and his work.15 {The RashaRAt actually says he left “sayings,” not works.}16 The RashaRAt gives the following details on this matter: DerviZler ahvâlinden Türkî dildekelimât-ı Rikmet-âmiz ve latâif-i ibret-engîzleri Türkistan vilâytinde ma“rûf ve meZhûrdur ve ânlarınfevâid-i enfâs-i kudsiyyelerindendir.

He uttered this pithy saying with respect tohonoring the people highly and always regarding them as a Godsend: “Know thateveryone you meet is Khaqir, and every night is the Night of Power.” And this pithysaying, which concerns mortification of the flesh, is also attributed to him: “All isgood, we are bad / all is wheat, we are straw” (RashaRAt, {Turkish} trans., pp. 15 –16).17 The work that has long been known among the Northern Turks under the titleBâqirghân kitâbı was first published by the Kazan Academy in 1857. {Now editedby Ibrahim Häqqul and Säyfiddin Räf’iddin (Tashkent, 1991).} It is composed ofeighty-six pages, each of which has a double column of text. On each page are anaverage of fifty lines of verse. As for the text that was published by the same press in1301/1883 – 4, it is composed of 144 pages, each with an average of twenty-six lines ofverse. There are also other editions of this work. At the end of the first edition, thereare two rather long narratives written in the form of a mathnawC and in “arEQ. Theauthor of one is ‘Ubaid Allah and the other has the pen name Khaua’c. In thiscollection, there are countless nefc poems in both the “arEQ and syllabic meters belong-ing to a great many people. Those belonging to Sulaiman Baqirghanc constitute thesmallest portion. The others belong to various poets such as Rajc, Mashrab, KhwajaArmad, Shams-i Özkendc, Qel Sharcf, Khudaidad, hqanc, ‘Ubaidc, Faqcrc, Baiqa,Bihbedc, Shuhedc, Qel Sharafc, Geda, Qel Nascmc, oufailc, and Qasim. The worksof Shams-i Özkendc are perhaps the most numerous. It is thus quite obvious that theBâqirghân kitâbı, like the DCwAn-i Likmat, is not the work of a single poet and is not anaccurate and trustworthy text. The poems of Sulaiman Ata, like those of his shaikh,survived for a long time scattered in the anthologies of dervishes or in the popularmemory, then were mixed with the works of a number of other popular nefcs, andfinally this very confused material was attributed to lakcm Sulaiman Ata and printedunder the title of Bâqirghân kitâbı. It would have taken very little effort when the workwas printed to distinguish and group together the works of the poets having variouspen names. Just as the anthologies of “Ashıqs, called bakhshi kitâbı, are a hodge-podge,so this book too mixes the works of several discrete nefc poets. {See EI2, s.v. “lakcmAta” (Günay Alpay). As mentioned earlier, the inescapable conclusion is that lakcmAta is ascribed poetry much earlier, and much more consistently, than is ArmadYasawc. And we find verse attested to lakcm Ata quite early on that is subsequentlyascribed to Armad Yasawc.}18 Cemalü’d-Dîn Velidî Efendi, in his short treatise Tatar edebiyatı”nın barıZı, briefly men-tions Bâqirghân kitâbı as the oldest Tatar work, but the views that he advances are"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE184completely subjective and the information that he gives is also very deficient anderroneous. For example, he is wholly ignorant of the information provided on lakcmSulaiman Ata in the famous {anonymous} Lakîm Ata kitâbı and also {nafc’s} RashaRAt,and he hardly even considers the fact that the works in Bâqirghân kitâbı were written bymen with different pen names. Considering that the author lacks the most elementarynotion of criticism, one cannot ascribe any scientific value to this simplistic book,which contains almost nothing of historical value ( [Orenburg, 1912], pp. 87–9).19 This work {MSS in the Ali Emiri Efendi Library, which is in the Fatih Millet Libraryin Istanbul, and in the British Museum}, and which was written in 754/1353 – 4 by aTurkish poet named Khwarazmc, in imitation of the Epistles {nAmes} in mathnawC stylecomposed by poets like lakcm Sana’c and ‘Auuar, is linguistically Chaghatay. It wasdedicated to a certain Murammad Khwaja Big, who had an important position in theretinue of the famous Janc Big, the ruler of the Golden Horde, and who was from theQunxrat tribe. Rieu states in his catalogue {of Turkish MSS in the British Museum}that this person was the ruler of Andkhed, Shcbirghan, and Balkh and that he wasthe Amcr Murammad Khwaja Apardc who was killed while fighting Malik Mu‘izzal-Dcn lusain Kart in 759/1357–8 ({Khwandamcr,} LabCb al-siyar, vol. 3, p. 75), butI cannot accept this opinion. In my view, if one considers his youth, his connectionwith Janc Big and that he was from the Qunxrat tribe, it is certain that this person wasKhanizade Murammad Khwaja Big (Mehmed Remzc, TalfCq al-akhbAr. . . {Orenburg,1325/1907}, vol. 1, pp. 555 – 6), who fled during the sultanate of Janc Big’s son BirdcBig Khan (758 – 62/1356 – 61), went to the court of Ivan the Terrible in Moscow andpresented himself as though he had come on a special mission from the Khan (formore information on this matter, see my article “Osmanlı edebiyatının bazlangıcı,”YM, 3 [1918], 85 – 8). The MaRabbatnAme, which was written in a period when onefinds numerous Turkish works throughout the Turkish world, is of special importancebecause it shows that in the eighth/fourteenth century such works were created underthe patronage of the Turkish khAns and princes in the realm of the Golden Horde, andthat they were written in the Chaghatay dialect, which was accepted as a commonliterary language in the Turkish courts of Transoxiana, Khurasan, ‘Iraq al-‘Ajam,Fars – in short, throughout Asia. The creation of a common literary language and itsrapid development in the other areas of the Turkish world – except for Anatolia andAzerbaijan – already by the mid eighth/fourteenth century, is not such a mysteriousevent. While it is impossible to give even a brief explanation of this event here, we canconsider it to be one of the many consequences of the Mongol invasion, which gaverise to massive migrations in Asia, unified the Turks in different regions under thesame political rule, and established permanent bonds among them. One must alsoremember, however, that this literature appeared as a court literature in regionswhere the people had no connection with Turkishness and in a realm where only therulers and military commanders were of Turkish origin. In a letter that he wrote tome shortly before the First World War, Togan informed me that Prof. Samoilovichhad found and prepared for publication the poem Khusraw-u ShCrCn, written in “Uighur”by a poet with the pen name Quub in Egypt in the eighth/fourteenth century. Whatis meant here by “Uighur,” since this work is a product of the eighth/fourteenthcentury, must be Chaghatay, which was the common literary language of that period.It is also possible that this Chaghatay work was written in the Uighur alphabet. Whenwe take into consideration the fact that the rulers of Egypt had permanent ties andrelations with the Golden Horde, this would not be surprising. In addition to thiswork, a great many others were also written in Egypt in the Anatolian dialect.

In myview, what is meant here by “the Moghul language” must be the Chaghatay or theQipchaq dialect because our Ottoman authors of the ninth/fifteenth and tenth/sixteenth centuries readily called Chaghatay by various names: “the language of Nawa’c,the Tatar language, Türkc language, and Moghul language” (see “{Türk edebiyatında}âzık tarzının menze’ ve tekâmülü,” MT, p. 7, n.1). We understand from a short poemabout ‘Alc-Shcr Nawa’c by the famous nadiqc Kitabdar, author of the Tadhkira {no.168 in Pertsch’s catalogue of Turkish MSS}, that the Azercs also called Chaghatay“Moghul.” There is a possibility that the work of lusam Katib, or, to use the oldexpression, lusam Bakhshi, was a popular work written in the Qipchaq dialectbecause of its vulgar nature, but it is much more likely that this is a poem in Chaghatay,perhaps written in the Uighur alphabet. {Now see Fevziye Abdullah Tansel, “CümcümeSultan: Ottoman Translations of the Fourteenth Century Qipchaq Turkic Story,”Archivum Ottomanicum, 2 (1970), 252– 69; Ia.

Just as the ozans of the Oghuz sang, accompaniedby the kopuz, of the legends of the OghuznAme among the people, the bakhshis of theQipchaqs also sang, with kopuz in hand, of the legends found in their own collectionsof traditions (Damad Ibrahim Pasha Library {in the Süleymaniye Library in Istanbul},MS 913). {See U. Haarmann, “Turkish Legends in the Popular Historiography ofMedieval Egypt,” in Proceedings of the VI Congress of Arabic and Islamic Studies . . . 1972(Uppsala, 1975), 97–107.} The traveler Ibn Bauueua, who visited the country of theGolden Horde at the beginning of the eighth/fourteenth century, says that, aftereating, verses from the Koran were read and there was singing in Arabic, then singingin Persian and Turkish was promptly begun and these were called mulamma“{“macaronics,” half in one language and half in another} (Ibn Bauueua, {Turkishtrans.,} vol. 1, p. 365 {Gibb trans., vol. 2, p. 477}), but as will be easily understoodfrom this word, these mulamma’s were not, of course, popular works. It is also possible,however, that what Ibn Bauueua says were sung during the sultan’s {i.e. MurammadÖzbeg Khan of the Golden Horde} holiday celebrations were popular Mongol works(ibid., {Turkish trans.,} p. 382 {Gibb trans., vol. 2, p. 496}).22 Cemâlü’d-Dîn Velidî Efendi, Tatar edebiyatının barıZı, p. 87. Because the history of theliterature of the Northern Turks, and this area in general, is unknown, it is notpossible to determine when this began.23 Cemâlü’d-Dîn Velidî Efendi’s aforesaid work, despite its non-scholarly nature,adequately conveys this conviction. Closer study of the literature of the NorthernTurks only corroborates it.24 Vambéry first mentioned the Turkmen poet Makhdem Qulc in his famous travelbook (Voyages d’un faux derviche dans l’Asie centrale de Téhéran à Khiva, Bokhara et Samarkand,"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"AlMAD YASAWh AND HIS INFLUENCE186French trans., 2nd edn [Paris, 1873], p. 283 {English trans. as Travels in Central Asia(London, 1864; reprinted New York, 1970)}).

Among Russian scholars,Ostroumov published some of his poetry and Samoilovich prepared an index {fihrist}of it. Togan informed me before the First World War that Samoilovich had prepareda complete edition of his dCwAn.

The evidence that Köprülü gives for “influ-ence” is so general as to ensure that Armad Yasawc influenced anyone we wish.}25 This Turkish poet named lasan-oxlu is the famous nefc Shaikh ‘Izz al-Dcn Per-ilasan Isfara’inc. A brief extract from one of his ghazals is included in Dawlat-Shah’sTadhkira{Because God likes beautiful faces in both the worlds / No one likes me Per-i lasan.What can I do?} This poet from Isfara’in was one of the leading disciples of ShaikhJamal al-Dcn Armad Dhakir {Gerpanc}, who was a khalCfa of Raqc ’l-Dcn ‘Alc Lala.He wrote poetry in Turkish under the pen name lasan-oxlu and in Persian under thepen name Per-i lasan and, according to Dawlat-Shah’s account, won very greatfame in Azerbaijan and Anatolia (Dawlat-Shah, Tadhkira, p. 221). I provided someinformation above on the great nefc Shaikh Raqc ’l-Dcn ‘Alc Lala and stated that hedied in 642/1244–5 (Chapter 3, p. 62). In light of this explanation, it would not bewrong to conclude that the poet lasan-oxlu, who was a disciple of this shaikh, wonfame during the end of the seventh/thirteenth century or the beginning of the eighth/fourteenth century. For some reason, this very early Azerc poet has not yet attractedanyone’s attention. {See Hermann Landolt (ed.), Nûruddîn Abdurrahmân-i Isfarâyinî,Le Révélateur des mystères (Kâshif al-Asrâr) (Paris, 1986), pp. 19 –21 (text), 147–9 (trans.);and one of his Turkic ghazals has been published by A.

In the second part of this book, I will provide a comprehensivediscussion of the Oghuz migrations to the West and the time, strength, and intensityof these migrations. Consequently, there is no need to go into further details here.Even before the appearance of the Seljuks, a number of Oghuz tribes migrated tothose regions and some of the Oghuz whom Sultan Marmed Ghaznawc sent fromTransoxiana to Khurasan later went there and joined them.

When we recall that after the Mongol invasion, duringthe time of the Il-Khanids, still more Oghuz tribes migrated there and commingled,then we can begin to get an idea of the ethnographic nature of this Azerc region.Almost all the Turks who went to this area were from the Oghuz, i.e. of the Turkmentype. The fact that the locus of events in the Book of Dede Korkut (in the text currentlyin our possession) is Eastern Anatolia and Azerbaijan confirms the views assertedabove. Moreover, a slight acquaintance with the folk literature of that area wouldalso confirm this point. Indeed, in every respect, the folk literature of that region ismuch richer and more genuine than that of Western Anatolia and Rumelia.

Coming out of the East like aninexhaustible human flood, the Turks, who thoroughly Turkified Anatolia withina few centuries under the resolute government of the Seljuk rulers, were composedentirely of Oghuz. Consequently, before we describe in broad outline the Seljukpolitical structure and civilization that were established in Anatolia, it is necessaryto give a bit more historical background on the Oghuz.By the time of the reign of the ‘Abbasid Caliph al-Mahdc (158 – 69/775 – 85),the Oghuz Turks had separated from the Toquz Oghuz in Eastern Turkistan,and by the fourth/tenth century they were living in the Syr Darya region andhad begun to convert to Islam.1Around the end of that century, as the Oghuzbegan to migrate into Muslim territory, they first settled near Bukhara. It wasamong the Oghuz that the Seljuk dynasty appeared and quickly extended itsinfluence into the vast areas ruled by the Ghaznavid state and various minorpowers. Eventually, a huge and powerful Seljuk state arose that controlled thearea stretching from Chinese Turkistan to Egypt and Byzantium. This greatsultanate enjoyed its most brilliant period between the reigns of Toghrıl Bey(d. 455/1063) and Malik-Shah (d. 485/1092). Subsequently, it dissolved into anumber of independent states in Khurasan, ‘Iraq al-‘Ajam, Kirman, Aleppo andDamascus, and Anatolia. During the reign of Sultan Sanjar (d. 552/1157), someof the brilliance reminiscent of the earlier period returned, but it lasted only ashort time. The branch of the dynasty that survived the longest was that of theSeljuks of Anatolia, because it was based on the true power of the state, the localpeople, while the other branches relied exclusively on the ruling family, the tribalchiefs, and the army. It is not that there were no Oghuz Turks in Khurasan,‘Iraq al-‘Ajam or Aleppo, but in Khurasan and ‘Iraq al-‘Ajam in particular theywere fated to assimilate gradually with the local people, or, at the very least, toassume their culture. Anatolia and Azerbaijan, on the other hand, became Turkishcountries as a result of large and continuous migrations of the Oghuz tribes and"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE192Map 2Anatolia in the late thirteenth century (modern Turkish place names)."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE193thus, despite all the political turmoil that took place, these regions became a newcenter of civilization for the Turks, and the Oghuz settled there permanently.2Even before the appearance of the Seljuks, i.e. in the early years of the fifth/eleventh century, some Oghuz tribes from Transoxiana had moved to Azerbaijanand the southern Caucasus and settled as a rather powerful presence on thefrontier of the Byzantine Empire. Reinforced by some of the Oghuz whomMarmed of Ghazna had transferred from Transoxiana to Khurasan, thisquarrelsome mass of Turkmen did not hesitate to attack Byzantium on occa-sion. Finally, just when the Seljuk state was establishing itself in Iran, ToghrılBey received a request from these Turkmen for assistance and so sent Qutalmısh,one of his kinsmen, with an army against the Byzantines. Later, in order to ridhimself of some Oghuz tribes who had come to Khurasan, Toghrıl Bey also sentthem, under the leadership of his brother ynal, toward the interior of Anatolia toconfront the Byzantine Empire.During the sultanate of Alp Arslan (455 – 65/1063 –73), the Seljuks took moreeffective action in Anatolia. By capturing the fortresses of Ani and Kars andseizing an important part of Georgia, this ruler put an end to Byzantine rule inArmenia and Georgia. He then decisively defeated the Byzantine EmperorRomanus Diogenes at the Battle of Malazgird {1071} and took him prisoner,thus firmly establishing Turkish sovereignty in Anatolia. Afterward, he granted, astamlCks {state-owned land as freehold property} and iqUA “s {estates, land grants},all the lands of eastern Anatolia as far as the Kızıl Irmak to the leaders of theTurkmen tribes that had long been guarding the Byzantine borders. In this way,the first Turkish states were established in Anatolia, those of the Saltuqids,Mengüchekids, and Danishmendids. They were followed by those of the Seljuksof Anatolia during the reign of Malik-Shah, and of the Akhlau-Shahs during thereign of Berk-Yaruq. The most powerful and enduring of all these Turkish stateswas that of the Seljuks of Anatolia, which played the greatest role in theTurkification of Anatolia.3The independent state of the Seljuks of Anatolia, which arose in Asia Minorduring the dissolution of the Great Seljuk Empire after the death of Malik-Shah,was based on a fairly sound foundation. While migrating westward in a continuoushuman flood from their homeland, the Oghuz Turks had come into close contactwith Persian and Arab civilization, and then, mainly after the Battle of Malazgird,settled down in Anatolia. Spreading their language, their religion, in a wordtheir culture, they posed a constant threat to the Armenian and Byzantine rulers.Despite the attacks of the Crusaders and endless harrassments by the Greeks andArmenians, Anatolia continued to be Turkified. Thanks to a powerful army, thestate of the Seljuks of Anatolia, which drew its strength mainly from the Oghuzclans, caused its neighboring Muslim and Christian states to live in a constantstate of fear. Around the end of the sixth/twelfth century, however, Qılıj Arslan IIdivided his kingdom among all of his sons according to the old Seljuk custom.This division of a great power into eleven petty and mutually hostile principalitiesprecipitated a civil war. Eventually, Sultan Rukn al-Dcn Qahir {i.e. Sulaiman II"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE194(592– 600/1196 –1204)} succeeded in re-establishing political unity after devotinghis life and all his resources to this endeavor. Still, the constraints of the politicalsystem and the vagueness of the law of succession were permanent obstacles tothe attainment of long-lasting prosperity and well-being for the Turks of Anatolia.The endless struggles for succession and the rumbles of independence providedopportunities for the Greeks and Armenians to rebel. They would drive out theTurks from a neighboring region, but shortly thereafter, confronting a Seljuksultan who had established his authority over that region, they would be utterlydefeated and make peace under harsh terms. In short, despite all these internaldisorders, Turkish sovereignty in Anatolia proved enduring.4During the reign of ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Kai-Qubad I (616 –34/1220 –37), which wecan consider to be the high point, in every respect, of the era of the Seljuks ofAnatolia, all of the minor principalities that were {theoretically} subject to theSeljuks were forced into obedience and submission. Nevertheless, this wise rulerrealized that he could not resist the power of the Mongols, who just at that timewere coming from the east like a terrible whirlwind. He formally recognized theauthority of the Great Il-Khan and then made a great effort to suppress internaltroubles and repel several attacks by Jalal al-Dcn the Khwarazm-Shah. Duringthe reign of this prudent ruler, who brought all of Anatolia under his wellordered government, repulsed attacks from abroad, and also took political meas-ures against the danger of the Mongol invasion, the Turks of Anatolia enjoyedgreat prosperity. Strong walls were erected around the great cultural centers ofKonya, Sivas, and Erzincan. Mosques, türbes, madrasas, khAns, and caravansarieswere built throughout Anatolia. Thanks to the correct and far-sighted policy of‘Ala’ al-Dcn, the people, who, up to that time, had not been able to escape fromdomestic turmoil and whose lives and property were continuously threatened byaggressive armies, finally enjoyed security and prosperity. As a result, life in thegreat cities became refined. Aesthetic sensibility and the fine arts, which are itsnatural product, developed. Not content with creating a just, strong, and wellordered political structure, ‘Ala’ al-Dcn also gathered around him scholars andmen of letters. Altogether, he was an intelligent, prudent, and skillful ruler andpatron of the arts.5‘Ala’ al-Dcn was killed by his son Ghiyath al-Dcn Kai-Khusraw {634 – 44/1237– 46} when the latter realized that the sultanate of Anatolia was going tobe given to his younger brother. Upon his ascent to the throne, the previousprosperity and well-being in Anatolia abruptly disappeared. The Great Il-Khandid not approve of the murder of ‘Ala’ al-Dcn and dispatched Bayju Noyon, witha powerful army, ostensibly in order to administer the provinces of Anatolia.Domestic affairs were again thrown into confusion. As if the struggle for succes-sion, the uprising of Baba Israq, the disgraceful actions of a majordomo namedSa‘d al-Dcn Köpek, the intrigues of the rulers of Egypt, and the provocations ofthe Byzantines and Armenians were not enough, the Mongol invaders capturedErzurum, Tokat, and Kayseri, and repeatedly defeated the armies of Ghiyathal-Dcn. These continuous military operations violently disrupted the peace and"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE195tranquility of the people, and oppression and poverty prevailed in place ofprosperity and well-being. After Ghiyath al-Dcn, life in Anatolia became almostunbearable for the people. His three sons sometimes ruled individually, or some-times two or three ruled together. Amidst domestic troubles and Mongol andByzantine incursions, the country soon fell into confusion and ruin. The peoplegroaned under the hands of oppressive and tyrannical officials. The need toobtain the taxes that had to be given to the Great Il-Khan seemed to licenseevery abuse. There appeared to be almost nothing left of the central govern-ment. Finally, after the execution of ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Kai-Qubad III on the order ofGhazan Khan, the political unity of Anatolia was completely destroyed. Uponthe collapse of the Seljuk state, which had lasted from 470/1077 to 707/1307,ten small principalities arose in its place and anarchy prevailed. Not until one ofthese principalities, that of the Ottomans, united the Western Turks around a{new} political center did a new era of peace and prosperity return to Anatolia.6B Seljuk civilization{As they emigrated to the west,} the Oghuz Turks who settled in Anatoliacame into contact with Arab and Muslim Persian civilization and then, inthe new region to which they had come, encountered remnants of ancient andnon-Muslim civilizations. In the large and old cities of Anatolia, which weregradually Turkified, the Turks not only encountered earlier Byzantine andArmenian works of art and architecture, but also, as a result of living side by sidewith Christians, naturally participated in a cultural exchange with them. Thenomadic Turks {i.e. Turkmen}, who maintained a tribal existence and clung tothe way of life they had led for centuries, remained impervious to all suchinfluences. Those who settled in the large cities, however, unavoidably fell underthese alien influences.At the same time, among the city people, those whose lives and livelihoodswere refined and elevated usually had extensive madrasa educations and harboreda profound and genuine infatuation with Arab and Persian learning and literature.Thus, they cultivated a somewhat contemptuous indifference to this Christiancivilization, which they regarded as materially and morally inferior to Islamiccivilization. As a result, the influence of this non-Muslim civilization on theTurks was chiefly visible, and then only partially, in those arts, such as architecture,in which the external and material elements are more obvious. The main resultof this influence was that life in general assumed a more worldly quality.If we wish to sketch, in broad outline, the civilization created by the Seljuks ofAnatolia, we must recognize that the local, i.e. non-Muslim, element was fairlyinsignificant compared to the Turkish and Arab-Persian elements, and that thePersian element was paramount.7The Seljuk rulers, to be sure, who were incontact with not only Muslim Persian civilization, but also with the Arab civiliza-tions in al-Jazcra and Syria – indeed, with all Muslim peoples as far as India –also had connections with {various} Byzantine courts. Some of these rulers, like"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE196the great ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Kai-Qubad I himself, who married Byzantine princessesand thus strengthened relations with their neighbors to the west, lived for manyyears in Byzantium and became very familiar with the customs and ceremonialat the Byzantine court. Still, this close contact with the ancient Greco-Romanand Christian traditions only resulted in their adoption of a policy of tolerancetoward art, aesthetic life, painting, music, independent thought – in short, towardthose things that were frowned upon by the narrow and piously ascetic views {oftheir subjects}. The contact of the common people with the Greeks and Armenianshad basically the same result.8{Before coming to Anatolia,} the Turks had been in contact with many nationsand had long shown their ability to synthesize the artistic elements that they hadadopted from these nations. When they settled in Anatolia, they encounteredpeoples with whom they had not yet been in contact and immediately establishedrelations with them as well. ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Kai-Qubad I established ties with theGenoese and, especially, the Venetians at the ports of Sinop and Antalya, whichbelonged to him, and granted them commercial and legal concessions.9 Mean-while, the Mongol invasion, which caused a great number of scholars and artisansto flee from Turkistan, Iran, and Khwarazm and settle within the Empire of theSeljuks of Anatolia, resulted in a reinforcing of Persian influence on the AnatolianTurks.10 Indeed, despite all claims to the contrary, there is no question thatPersian influence was paramount among the Seljuks of Anatolia. This is clearlyrevealed by the fact that the sultans who ascended the throne after Ghiyathal-Dcn Kai-Khusraw I assumed titles taken from ancient Persian mythology, likeKai-Khusraw, Kai-Ka’es, and Kai-Qubad; and that ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Kai-Qubad Ihad some passages from the ShAhnAme inscribed on the walls of Konya and Sivas.When we take into consideration domestic life in the Konya courts and thesincerity of the favor and attachment of the rulers to Persian poets and Persianliterature, then this fact {i.e. the importance of Persian influence} is undeniable.11With regard to the private lives of the rulers, their amusements, and palaceceremonial, the most definite influence was also that of Iran, mixed with theearly Turkish traditions, and not that of Byzantium.12The cultural production that most clearly and forcefully represents Seljukcivilization for us even today is architecture. In the sixth/twelfth and, especially,the seventh/thirteenth centuries, Seljuk art was the sole art prevailing in AsiaMinor. Various ideas have been advanced about the sources and characteristicsof this important art that embellished the cities of Anatolia with madrasas, mosques,türbes, and palaces, and its highways with caravansaries. We do not possesssufficiently strong evidence to show that Seljuk art, which synthesized elementsof Arab, Persian, Syrian, Armenian, Byzantine, and early Turkish art and unifiedthem with a skill reflecting the Turkish genius, was an original art. While someolder investigators, like Gustave Mendel, called into question the originality ofthis art,13 more recent investigators, like Heinrich Glück, are of the opinion thatSeljuk art, while composed of various elements, is a high art that does reveal theTurkish spirit.14"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE197C The ∞§f¢ movementSteadily increasing in strength and spreading in all directions, the nefc move-ment preoccupied and engulfed all the countries in the Muslim world. In thesixth/twelfth and seventh/thirteenth centuries, this movement, which, afteral-Ghazalc {d. 505/1111}, was well harmonized with Sunnc beliefs, led to thecreation of numerous tekkes in Iran, Central Asia, Syria, Egypt, and Anatolia, inshort, in all Muslim lands.15 Although the actual personalities of the nefcs wholived in these tekkes are obscured by dense clouds of legend, we can still glimpsequite a few figures behind the clouds, including important poets, profound andindependent-minded thinkers, and men obsessed with divine love. We frequentlyencounter, especially after Muryc ’l-Dcn Ibn al-‘Arabc (560 – 638/1165 –1240),nefcs who embraced the concept of waRda {unity (of being)} in the broadestsense.16 As the moral and material influence of the ‘Abbasid caliphs in Baghdadwaned and sovereignty in various regions passed into the hands of local amCrs,the caliphs, for certain material reasons, began to favor and patronize tekkes andnefcs.17 Meanwhile, the absence of a single center of political power, and anarchyin the realm, i.e. the breakdown of the basis of the social system, also created aneed for mysticism in spiritual life. Later, in the places that were exposed tomomentous events like the Crusades and the Mongol invasion, the influence ofthe tekkes and their shaikhs naturally became stronger, because they promised –and indeed provided – anxious people with what they needed most: spiritual andmoral tranquility.The spread of nefism in all directions as a result of many material and,especially, spiritual factors, the quasi-official recognition granted by {the Muslim}states to the tekkes and UarCqas, and the fact that many statesmen and notables,even sultans, became disciples of the great shaikhs all gave enormous spiritualinfluence to the nefc shaikhs. The nefcs had such moral authority over thecorporeal dominions of the rulers that they sometimes even intimidated powerfulstates and forced them to adopt certain important measures. During the periodof the Seljuks and Khwarazm-Shahs, the nefc movement became firmly establishedthroughout virtually all the Muslim-Turkish countries and, especially, in thelarge cultured cities where Muslim-Persian influence was paramount. At thattime, when the Islamic world was shaken by continuous and large-scale disordersand anarchy, the great shaikhs, who had thousands of disciples who obeyedthem blindly, were able to play important political roles. Consequently, therulers found it necessary either to use force and threats against them or to treatthem with kindness according to circumstances. The legend of Khwaja ‘Azczan,18for example, and then the fact that the Khwarazm-Shah was compelled to askhis shaikh Najm al-Dcn Kubra for forgiveness for doing away with the famousMajd al-Dcn Baghdadc19 are certainly significant points in this respect.After the death of Armad Yasawc, the resurgence of political confusionover all of Asia on the one hand and, on the other, the establishment of nefismas a philosophical system by mystics like Ibn al-‘Arabc, who held broad and"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE198independent views that considered “the essence of God” to be “absolute being,”gradually caused the number of nefcs to multiply. Moreover, under the rubric ofnefism, all sorts of people assembled. Even in the time of al-Ghazalc, there werethose who spread and popularized bAUinC beliefs under the screen of nefism,20 butas time went on their number increased.This then was the character of the nefc movement in the Muslim world whenthe Oghuz Turks settled in Anatolia. As the Seljuk state in Anatolia becamestrong and several Muslim-Turkish cities were established, tekkes also appeared inthose places, in conformity with the usual pattern in Islamic countries. Thedervishes and shaikhs who came to Anatolia from other countries or who grewup there succeeded in awakening a powerful nefc movement within the Anatolianmilieu. Among them were a number of nefcs who came from Iran, Egypt, Iraq,and Syria. There were also a large number of dervishes who had flourishedamong the Turks of Khurasan and Transoxiana. There were even some whowere members of the UarCqa of Armad Yasawc. Particularly after the Mongolinvasion, as many nefcs and scholars in Turkistan, Iran, and Khwarazm fledbefore this great pagan influx to Muslim countries in the West, quite a few wentto Anatolia and settled there.21 The Seljuk rulers, like all Muslim rulers, had longshown great respect and favor to nefcs and scholars22 and so naturally greetedthe newcomers in the same cordial fashion. Anatolia, especially in the first half ofthe seventh/thirteenth century, had become a place of settlement for a numberof famous nefcs, the most illustrious of whom was Mawlana Jalal al-Dcn Remc.Among the nefcs who endeavored to propagate UarCqas in Anatolia in theseventh/thirteenth century, we can mention such well known personalities asAwrad al-Dcn Kirmanc in Konya;23 Fakhr al-Dcn ‘Iraqc,24 the author of Lama“At,in Tokat, for whom his disciple and follower Mu‘cn al-Dcn Parwana built atekke;25 Shaikh Najm al-Dcn Daya, the author of MirTAd al-“ibAd, in Kayseri andSivas;26 Ibn al-‘Arabc, also in Konya, and nadr al-Dcn Murammad b. Israqal-Qenawc, who, by writing many commentaries on Ibn al-‘Arabc’s works, spreadhis philosophy of the unity of being {waRdat al-wujEd} throughout that region;27and also Mu’ayyad al-Dcn al-Jandc, one of his disciples who also wrote com-mentaries on some of the works of Ibn al-‘Arabc,28 and Sa‘d al-Dcn Farghanc,who wrote a commentary on the QaTCda al-tA”iyya {Ode on the letter T} of Ibnal-Fariq.29 We can also include lajjc Bektash Veli among the nefcs who flourishedin Anatolia in the seventh/thirteenth century. He was not able to win as muchfame and influence as these others during his lifetime, but later, as a cycle oflegends took shape around his name, he was regarded by the people as thefounder of a UarCqa.30Among the UarCqas that spread in Anatolia between the end of the seventh/thirteenth century and the early years of the eighth/fourteenth century, we findthe Rifa‘iyya, to which Ibn Bauueua also gives the name Armadiyya. This writercame across Rifa‘c tekkes and members of the Rifa‘c UarCqa in Izmir and Bergama,in Sonisa {Senusa} near Amasya, and even as far afield as Majar in the territoryof the Golden Horde. Ibn Bauueua says that the UarCqa of the famous Shaikh Abe"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE199’l-‘Abbas Armad al-Rifa‘c, whose tomb he visited in the village of Umm ‘Ubaida,a day’s journey from Wasiu, had spread throughout Iraq and to some degree inthe cities of Anatolia, which had very close political and commercial relationswith Iraq. Indeed, he adds that at that time a descendant of Armad al-Rifa‘c wasthe head of the religious order in Sonisa, which belonged to the ruler of Iraq.They sometimes went to visit the grave of the pCr, taking with them hundreds ofdervishes. Ibn Bauueua encountered such a group and wrote that they would entera blazing fire while dancing, eat fire, and exhibit other very strange behavior.31In that period, the conditions of life in Anatolia ensured the propagation andgeneral acceptance of the nefc movement at all levels of society. As I relatedabove while discussing political life in Anatolia at that time, central governmenthad completely collapsed after ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Kai-Qubad I. Domestic strugglesover the succession, the Mongol invasion, and wars with the Byzantines andArmenians had destroyed the prosperity and security of the country. Observingan absence of social order and reeling from these continuous troubles, the peoplehad no other recourse than the tekkes and the shaikhs in order at least to ensurefor themselves in the next world the happiness that eluded them in the present.Conforming to this general tendency of the people, the beys {tribal chiefs, lords},who were trying to establish temporary local authority, built tekkes and zAwiyaseverywhere and set aside rich endowments for them in order to take advantageof the material and moral influence of the shaikhs. Under such social conditions,one can easily understand how Anatolia became such fertile ground for produc-ing shaikhs and bAbAs. Indeed, a number of works written about the legendsof the saints who lived during that period, as well as other historical sources,corroborate this point.32In the first half of this book, I dwelt on the fact that there were many membersof the Yasawc UarCqa among the dervishes who migrated to Anatolia from Turkistan,Khwarazm, Khurasan, Syria, and Iraq. For various reasons, however, theseascetics who were sincerely attached to Sunnc beliefs were not able to achievespiritual authority in the intellectual and religious environment of Anatolia. Inthe first place, this environment, which included remnants of the old Greco-Roman and Christian intellectual traditions, was capable of accepting, as Imentioned above, broad-minded philosophical views in addition to those thatwere narrowly ascetic. Second, under the influence of Ibn al-‘Arabc, who livedfor a rather long time in Konya, and the many important disciples who followedhim, the unconstrained intellectual atmosphere of Anatolia became permeatedwith the philosophy of the unity of being. It was inevitable, therefore, that theascetic and pious views of the Yasawc dervishes who had come there fromTurkistan and Khwarazm would assume a more unconstrained and philosophicalcharacter.33 Third, bAUinC beliefs had taken deep root at that time throughoutthe Muslim world and especially in Syria, which had very close material andspiritual ties with Anatolia.34 The matter did not, therefore, end here. Under thescreen of nefism, and taking advantage of favorable times, all kinds of gameswere played."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE200In the history of Anatolia, the earliest and most important of these hereticaland schismatic movements, which were generally accompanied by politicalobjectives and ambitions, was the famous Baba’c incident. In the reign ofSultan Ghiyath al-Dcn Kai-Khusraw II, Baba Israq, a disciple of Baba Ilyas ofKhurasan, collected numerous supporters in the region of Amasya, Tokat, andSivas, outwardly in the name of his shaikh – but in reality much more for his ownsake – and rebelled against the Seljuk state. Benefiting from the current weaknessof the Seljuks, he gained considerable power. Indeed, faced with these Baba’cs,Ghiyath al-Dcn was forced to abandon Konya and retire to the fortress ofQubadiyya with his family and treasure. Baba Israq, while propagating whatwas virtually a new religion, was able to attract true believers who were readyto sacrifice themselves for his sake, thus causing great turmoil in the Seljuk stateand straining its resources. Finally, Mubariz al-Dcn Armaghan Shah took himprisoner, after laying siege to Amasya, and executed him (638/1240).35Despite the important place of the Baba’c uprising in the intellectual history ofAnatolia, we do not have much clear information about it, so we can only gaugeit rather vaguely. Neverthless, I believe it would not be a mistake to regard theBaba’c incident as an important precursor of the heretical and schismatic move-ments that challenged Sunncsm in Anatolia, and subsequently of the formationof groups like the Qızılbash and Bektashcs that appeared as a result of variousevents beginning with the incident of Badr al-Dcn Samawnawc and continuingup to recent times.36 In analyzing similar later phenomena, one would naturallyregard the seeds of heresy and schism surviving from this period to have sproutedunder the influence of new factors, even novel ideas coming from abroad; still,the significance of this initial incident can by no means be denied. Indeed,it should not be forgotten that during the seventh/thirteenth century a numberof well known Turkish nefcs like Baraq Baba37 and Sulaiman Turkmanc38 alsospread many wild ideas and beliefs under the screen of nefism.Furthermore, based on both historical sources and the reports of the travelerIbn Bauueua, we know that in the same century in Anatolia, as in some of theother Turkish countries, there was an important and widespread corporation ofunmarried nefc craftsmen known as the akhCs and that they played a significantrole in the early history of the Ottomans.39 These akhCs followed the way of thefutuwwa, traced their roots back to the Prophet Murammad via ‘Alc, and worethe trousers {shalwAr} of the futuwwa, which distinguished them from the othernefcs, who wore patched woolen jackets {khirqa}. The akhC organization, whichalso included many qAQCs and madrasa instructors, was not simply a professionalgrouping or guild. Instead, it should be considered a UarCqa that relied on, andspread its beliefs through, this guild structure.40Ibn Bauueua says that a significant number of the akhCs were members of theknife-maker guild and that they carried knives on their persons in a very visiblemanner, but he also says that they included more than knife makers. Indeed,there were artisans of all types among them. According to Tashköprü-Zade, thetanners’ guild considered Akhc Evren to be the pCr of their UarCqa, and there are"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE201details about this in the manAqibnAmes concerning him.41 By the early Ottomanperiod, one encounters quite a few other dervishes with the title akhC and, ofcourse, they too were members of the same organization.42Apparently these akhCs were organized in a hierarchy, like those of the present-day Freemasons, and truths were disclosed to the adepts according to their rank.From this point of view, the akhCs can definitely be considered to have originatedfrom bauinism.43 In fact, the great Turkish poet Gülshehrc, who flourished inthe first half of the eighth/fourteenth century – almost a quarter century beforeIbn Bauueua – describes the akhCs saying that they were generally ignorant andheedless of the rules of the futuwwa, and thus he implies that contemporary Sunncscholars and nefcs took a dim view of them and more or less regarded akhism astainted with bauinism.44 After 762/1361, the year in which Ankara was taken bythe Ottomans, the term akhC rarely appears in the sources. But this should not beinterpreted to mean that the political importance of the akhCs had disappeared.After the Ottoman Empire established a strong political base in Anatolia, theakhCs could not maintain any political significance. Subsequently, the establish-ment of UarCqas like the Bektashiyya left akhism in the form of an ordinary guildorganization, and its bAUinC character, which was concealed in its foundation, alsopassed to UarCqas like the Bektashiyya.45It is quite natural that a century that produced Mawlana Jalal al-Dcn Remcand Suluan Walad would also produce a great nefc poet like Yenus Emre. Somebrief information will be provided below on the personality and work of Jalal al-Dcn Remc, who, beginning with Yenus during that century, and long afterwards,had an enormous influence on Turkish nefc life and Turkish literature in general– just as he did on the entire Muslim world and especially on Persian literature.Following this, an outline, in the most general fashion, of the Turkish languageand literature of that period will be given. Yenus Emre’s spiritual personalitywill thereby reveal itself, because every personality – even a genius like YenusEmre who endowed a raw and uncultivated language with a divine quality thatcould profoundly bring to life the emotional subtleties of the human spirit – isunquestionably a product of his social environment. After all these analyses, thedistinctions between Armad Yasawc and Yenus Emre or, more correctly, betweenCentral Asian Turkish nefism and the nefism that developed in Anatolia, andthe various factors that gave rise to those distinctions, will become clear.D Jal™l al-D¢n R§m¢Mawlana Jalal al-Dcn Remc, whom we can consider as perhaps the greatest andmost influential representative of pantheism in Persian nefc literature, was bornin Balkh in 604/1207. His father, Murammad Baha’ al-Dcn Walad b. lusainal-Bakrc, who was dubbed Suluan al-‘Ulama’, was one of the most famous nefcscholars of Khwarazm. He devoted himself to preaching and teaching; andall the leading personalities and notables of the time, sometimes even the rulerhimself, attended his majlis. Forced to leave Balkh – according to one story on"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE202the instigation of Fakhr al-Dcn al-Razc because of rivalry and jealousy betweenthem, and according to another because Murammad Quub al-Dcn the Khwarazm-Shah feared his spiritual influence – he took his family and fled to Ncshaper.Shaikh Farcd al-Dcn ‘Auuar, who was still alive at that time, gave his blessing tothe young Jalal al-Dcn and gave him a copy of his AsrArnAme as a gift. FromNcshaper, Baha’ al-Dcn went on to Baghdad, Mecca, Damascus, Malatya,Erzincan, and then to Akzehir where he remained for a while in a tekke built bythe wife of Malik Fakhr al-Dcn. Later, he went to Laranda, where he stayed forseven years. While in Laranda, Jalal al-Dcn married Jawhar, the daughter ofLala Sharaf al-Dcn Samarqandc (622/1225 – 6). Finally, as a result of repeatedand very warm invitations from ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Kai-Qubad, they all settled inKonya (626/1228). Suluan al-‘Ulama’, to whom the ruler showed great favor,devoted himself to learning and teaching until his final days. He died in 628/1231. According to Aflakc, Mawlana took his father’s post.46One of the important and fundamental factors in shaping Mawlana’s nefc andpoetic personality after his father’s death was the period of about nine years thathe spent with the Sayyid Burhan al-Dcn Tirmidhc. Acquiring fame under thetitle Muraqqiq {“the Verifier”}, the Sayyid Burhan al-Dcn was one of the leadingkhalCfas of Suluan al-‘Ulama’. After his shaikh’s death, he went to Konya and tookupon himself the spiritual education of the young Jalal al-Dcn, who, by thattime, had mastered the exoteric sciences, i.e. the canonical {shar“C} and literarysciences. The Sayyid Burhan al-Dcn, who had met with Shaikh Shihab al-Dcnal-Suhrawardc and won his respect, later retired to Kayseri where he died.47From both his father and the Sayyid Burhan al-Dcn, Jalal al-Dcn had acquiredstrictly ascetic and pious views. Thus, he occupied himself, on the one hand,with teaching and, on the other, with the principles of nefism that al-Ghazalchad reconciled with the provisions of the SharC“a. During this time, however,a dervish named Shams {al-Dcn Murammad} Tabrczc arrived in Konya. Hismeeting with Mawlana (according to Aflakc and Jamc on 26 Jumada II 642/November 29, 1244) had a profound and transformative influence on the latter’sspiritual outlook.48 According to one account, Shams was the son of a venerablefamily that belonged to the Isma‘clc madhhab.49 He had wandered from countryto country and had been in the service of various nefcs.50 It is reported that hewas a disciple of Baba Kamal Jandc and that he even met in his tekke with Fakhral-Dcn ‘Iraqc.51 In any case, no matter who the shaikh or shaikhs of this greatnefc might have been, it is certain that he was a man with the character of a rindor kalandar {both are terms for unconventional dervishes} who could experiencevery intense mystical ecstacy, and that he was a very forceful personality whoentertained the most broad-minded mystical notions because of the genuineneeds of his spirit.52There are a variety of reports in different sources about the nature and closenessof the relationship between Shams (who according to one story died in 645/1247, but according to other, more reliable, reports left Konya in that year) andMawlana.53 With respect to the extent and significance of his influence on"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE203Mawlana, the material in Sipahsalar is especially worthy of note. Even if weleave aside those aspects of this material that are of a purely legendary nature,those that remain appear to be very significant. These two nefcs first had friendlydiscussions for six months in the cell of Shaikh nalar al-Dcn Zarkeb and thendeparted. Following the path of his father and of the Sayyid Burhan al-Dcn,Mawlana initially had no liking at all for samA“, but because Shams made himlike it he could no longer live without it.54 Shams realized, however, that those inMawlana’s circle had become hostile to him and so, without notice, he departedfor Damascus. Overwhelmed with grief, Mawlana stopped writing poetry andconducting samA“. When a letter arrived one day from Shams informing him thathe was in Damascus, Mawlana was so happy that he recited a number of ghazalsand began a samA“. He also sent his oldest son Suluan Walad with some of hiscompanions to Damascus specifically to invite Shams back.55When he returned, Mawlana was overjoyed. Shortly thereafter, in fact, atShams’s request, Mawlana married him to a young girl named Kcmya who hadbeen raised in the women’s section of his apartment. Because it was winter, theyset aside a small place for the new husband and wife in the anteroom of thekitchen. Shams spent the winter there, but during that time a mutual aversiondeveloped between him and Mawlana’s middle son Chelebi ‘Ala’ al-Dcn. At thelatter’s instigation, Shams’s former enemies and their allies again began to plotagainst him. Shams said nothing to Mawlana of what was going on, but he didexpress his resentment to Suluan Walad and added that this time he woulddisappear without a trace. And so it happened. One morning when Mawlanawent to his madrasa, Shams was nowhere to be seen. Mawlana, who recited manyghazals expressing the pain of this separation, eventually went to Damascus tosearch for him again. When no trace of Shams could be found, however, he wasobliged to return to Konya.56Mawlana wrote poems with an exuberant passion and sublime inspiration. Hededicated them to the spiritual ideals of Shams Tabrczc, and they were laterknown collectively as the DCwAn-i Shams al-RaqA”iq.57 His ability to reach perhapsthe highest degree of pantheism {in this poetry} and his profound attraction tosamA“, dance, and music can be attributed above all to the teachings of Shams.With respect to language and versification, these lyrics can be considered quitefaulty. With regard to capturing and demonstrating the most profound andexuberant moments of a mystical soul, however, each poem is a living documentof the most immediate kind for properly understanding Mawlana’s emotionallife. For Mawlana, who mixed the basic ideas of the ancient Alexandrian school{i.e. Neoplatonism} with certain Indian, Persian, and Arab concepts, nefism wasnot an inert collection of rules and beliefs but something to be felt and lived.Thus, it could be apprehended not by mental and sensory discernment but byintuitive discovery, i.e. by inspiration and love.58 The divine lyricism in thesepoems reveals Mawlana’s spirit in all its immediacy, profundity, and nakednessand is sufficient to suggest that he is Persia’s greatest mystical poet. It would bea mistake, however, not to recognize Shams Tabrczc as the largest single factor in"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE204the origin and development of this lyricism. We have no clear and certaininformation about the life and personality of Shams, but it is certainly possible tograsp his mystical ideas and views from the DCwAn-i Shams al-RaqA”iq. This workwould prove even more useful than the MathnawC in shedding light on Mawlana’smystical path, because it displays points that are clearly reminiscent of hisNeoplatonist beliefs. In order to remain within the bounds of my subject, however,it is not possible to go into further details on this matter.59After Shams’s disappearance, Jalal al-Dcn adopted as his companion one ofhis former disciples, nalar al-Dcn Farcden of Konya, who was known under thebyname Zarkeb (goldsmith).60 Long known for his asceticism and piety, thisperson had been one of the leading disciples of Burhan al-Dcn Muraqqiq. Earlyon, he had taken up the profession of goldsmith in Konya and later attachedhimself to Shams. Adopting such a man, who had virtually no understandingof the religious and literary sciences, as a companion aroused the enmity of anumber of other disciples. They spoke out about his lack of knowledge, butMawlana, paying no attention to this gossip, increased his favors to, and respectfor, this man. Indeed, in order to strengthen his esoteric attachment with anexoteric bond, he married Suluan Walad to nalar al-Dcn’s daughter. In thismanner, a sincere attachment lasted for ten years until nalar al-Dcn became illand died. In despair and full of grief, Jalal al-Dcn composed a number of ghazals.61To be sure, nalar al-Dcn had had no influence over Mawlana, as Dawlat-Shahsupposed; on the contrary, he was very much under Mawlana’s influence.62 Thefact that Mawlana mentions him with respect and affection in a number ofpoems in the DCwAn does not constitute a reason to claim otherwise.Subsequently, Chelebi lusam al-Dcn became Mawlana’s khalCfa and com-panion. According to Mawlawc tradition, Chelebi lusam al-Dcn lasanb. Murammad b. lasan b. Akhc Turk was one of the children of Shaikh Abe’l-Wafa’ of Baghdad.63 He was bound and devoted to his shaikh through greatrespect and affection and, in turn, received the same kind treatment fromMawlana. Chelebi lusam al-Dcn played a significant role in Mawlana’s com-position of the MathnawC. Realizing that didactic works of the type of {‘Auuar’s}IlAhCnAme, ManUiq al-Uair, and MuTCbatnAme were well liked and widely circulatedamong the dervishes, Chelebi asked his shaikh to create a mathnawC that couldteach the dervishes the rules of the order and the mystical truths. Also, becauseMawlana had already written a rather large number of ghazals, Chelebi hopedthat he would now take up writing mathnawC. Then, taking out a piece of paperon which were written eighteen couplets from the introduction to the MathnawC,Mawlana said that he too had thought of doing this. At that point, the com-position of the MathnawC began. Mawlana spoke and Chelebi lusam al-Dcnrecorded his shaikh’s inspired recitations. After the first volume was finished,there was about a two-year delay in this project because of the death of Chelebi’swife. Subsequently, however, Chelebi implored his shaikh to continue his com-positon and convinced him to do so. Therefore, over a period of at least seven oreight years, this monumental work of six volumes came into being.64"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE205An enormous work of more than 26,000 couplets, the MathnawC is the mostfamous product not only of Mawlana, but perhaps also of all nefc literature.65 Itsinfluence, which has been very great throughout the Islamic world, especially inIndia and Iran, was exceptionally powerful on the Anatolian Turks from thetime it was written.66 Nevertheless, one cannot find in the MathnawC dazzlingflashes of brilliance and clear and profound reflections that sweep aside all obstaclesand boundaries like those in the DCwAn-i Shams al-haqA”iq. This is a didactic workof nefc ethics written strictly to provide guidance to those on the mystical path.It was written, quite naturally, with mid-level adepts in mind. With respect tolanguage and meter, this work is again quite faulty. Its structure can also be veryeasily criticized. Adhering to the format of earlier nefc poets, Mawlana expoundsevery idea, every bit of advice, and every theory with an appropriate story.When he wants to explain, for example, that trusting in providence can be bothpositive and negative, he begins with a few verses of admonition and then addsa story. Usually, however, before finishing one story, he interrupts it and insertsa second story, and may even insert a third into the second; and after they arecompleted, the first story is resumed.The lack of importance given to both the structure and the correctness oflanguage and meter are evidence that Mawlana was by no means a formalist.In the DCwAn-i Shams al-RaqA”iq, Mawlana had used poetry as a means of com-municating the most profound needs of his spirit, and in the MathnawC used it asan instrument to guide adepts on the mystical path and to expound the principlesof the UarCqa that he had founded. He never regarded himself as a poet or anartist.67 Yet, despite his reluctance to speak with absolute clarity and precisionabout the realities of the unity of being in the MathnawC, he was obliged in manypassages to make unintended revelations. Because he himself was aware of this,he also says in the MathnawC, “If you look at only the form of the expressions, thiswork seems to lead astray, whereas in reality it guides the right way,” and inorder to confirm this he relates the following couplet {vol. 6, 656}:{In the revelation God says that this Koran / Guides some and leads othersastray (cf. Koran 2:26).}Strongly influenced by Farcd al-Dcn ‘Auuar and Sana’c,68 as he frequently statedand acknowledged, Mawlana not only quotes from KalCla wa Dimna {on thisIndian mirror for princes, see EI2, s.v. “Kalcla wa-Dimna” (C. Brockelmann)},the legends of Jura {on this personage of the popular imagination, see EI2, s.v.“Djura” {Ch.

Pellat et al.)}, and from the qiTaTal-anbiyA” {stories of the prophets} and manAqib al-awliyA” {legends of the saints,in the generic sense}, but he also portrays, in various passages of his work, life inthe palace, or scenes of public life, such as the ceremonial mourning of the Shc‘cs"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE206of Aleppo at the Antakya Gate. Indeed, Mawlana is perhaps too realistic indescribing some obscene aspects of life, but this is no reason to criticize himwhen we take into consideration his personality and the purpose for which hewrote the MathnawC. In any case, the influence of the MathnawC is overwhelminglyobvious in the earliest Turkish works written in Anatolia.During his last months, Jalal al-Dcn wrote a number of moving ghazalsindicatingthat the time had come for him to leave this world. In fact, shortly after composingthem he became ill. Two well known physicians named Mawlana Akmal al-Dcnand Mawlana Ghaqanfarc attended him, but his illness could not be diagnosed.At sunset on Monday 6 Jumada II 672/December 18, 1273, Mawlana died. Thenext day, after the necessary arrangements, which had been made in advance,for washing and shrouding the corpse were completed, virtually the entire popu-lation of Konya participated in the funeral prayer, while Qaqc Siraj al-Dcn actedas imAm. Mawlana was then buried in the tomb where he now rests. With theexpress wish and approval of his oldest son Suluan Walad, his khalCfa Chelebilusam al-Dcn succeeded him.69Mawlana, whose important followers include such Persian poets as Qiwamal-Dcn Sanjanc, Ni‘mat Allah Kehistanc {i.e. Sayyid Ni‘mat Allah Veli}, and theSayyid Qasim al-Anwar,70 and who influenced many other poets of the samecaliber, and who was long very highly respected and honored by historians,biographers, and nefcs,71 wrote an important prose treatise entitled FChi mA fCh,72which he dedicated to Mu‘cn al-Dcn Parwana, and has quite a few other sayingsand utterances, but we cannot discuss them here. It is also beyond our subject todiscuss Mawlana as a Persian poet or his influence on Persian literature. Sufficeit to say that Mawlana flourished in an environment that was conducive to uncon-strained thought and that appreciated music, art, and literature. With his poetryand mystical ideas, he easily won over the Anatolian cultural scene, pervaded asit was with the philosophy of the unity of being that had been propagated by Ibnal-‘Arabc. If the cultural milieu had not been prepared, Jalal al-Dcn would nothave won such great fame while he was still alive and the UarCqa that he establishedwould not have spread and developed so readily. But as I made abundantly clearabove, the ground had been fully prepared for such a movement. Consequently,Mawlana’s UarCqa, as well as legends about him, began to take shape while he wasstill alive. Below, we will see how Mawlana’s influence was felt on the earliestTurkish works created in Anatolia. While discussing the works and nefc ideas ofYenus Emre, and drawing many comparisons, we will see how this influencespread in a very short time and what important traces it left even on popularnefc literature. One fact is incontrovertible: that without a thorough knowledgeof Mawlana, one cannot understand the earliest Turkish works in Anatolia.E The national {mill≠} language and literatureThe language of the Turks who settled in Anatolia, as adumbrated above, wasWestern Turkish, which we call the Oghuz or Turkmen dialect. This dialect had"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE207become the local language of the regions invaded by the Oghuz tribes, especiallyAnatolia. The Oghuz literary language, which had taken form and developedeven before the Oghuz settled in Anatolia, i.e. while they were still living in theSyr Darya area, retained its basic features, although it quite naturally underwentsome minor changes in Anatolia. Thus, Western or Southern Turkish, which isknown as Seljuk Turkish until the founding of the Ottoman state and OttomanTurkish thereafter, is simply a developed form of the old Oghuz dialect.73After the establishment of the Seljuk state in Anatolia, Turkish became awritten language, but we cannot determine exactly when. Oghuz Turkish hadbeen used for written correspondence even before the Seljuks settled in Anatolia.Like Eastern Turkish, this dialect too had ceased being simply a spoken language.It is quite natural, therefore, that Turkish works began to be written down fromthe earliest period of the Seljuks, but it is also true that they were very few innumber and quite elementary in scope. These works include simple religioustracts meant to expound the principles of Islam, as well as a number of Islamicpopular stories like the legends of Bauual Ghazc that could satisfy the warlikeleanings of the people of Anatolia, which was then an actual field for jihAd{strugglefor the faith}.74 For various historical reasons, virtually nothing has come downto us from the literary creations of this period, but thanks to works that werewritten later on these subjects, and parts of which have survived, we can get afairly clear idea about them, because most of these later works are merely updated,embellished, and expanded versions of the earlier ones. The lack of early textshas caused a major gap in linguistic history, but with respect to literary history itis not of such great importance. Such texts, which could not have had muchliterary value in themselves, could at least have served as a means to help us tounderstand the intellectual and emotional life of that period as well as its tastesand biases. Although we no longer possess these texts, it is possible to make suchan analysis through various other means. {Köprülü’s hypothesizing about non-existent Turkish literature is problematic. On the history of Turkish literature,see, for example, Alessio Bombaci, Storia della letteratura turca (Milan, 1956).}If we take into consideration the general features of the civilization createdby the Seljuks of Anatolia, and the intellectual and emotional life of that period,we will immediately understand the extent to which the national language wasneglected. The madrasas and tekkes that were built with great elan in almost everycorner of Anatolia after the establishment of the Seljuk state were so manyhearths that radiated Arabic religious science and, above all, Persian literature.While the nomadic Turkmen satisfied their aesthetic needs with their own folkliterature and with remnants of the old Oghuz Destanı, Persian literature prevailedin the cities that welcomed scholars, jurists, and vagabond dervishes who arrivedfrom throughout the Muslim world. At the courts of the learned and artisticrulers who were attracted to the venerable Persian traditions, this foreign languagebecame so influential that it supplanted the national language.Furthermore, the inclination on the part of the educated class, beginning withthe rulers, to pride itself on being distinguished from the common people and"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE208everything related to them, also kept Turkish far from the courts, belittled workswritten in Turkish and caused them to be viewed with contempt75 – insteadcreating in Anatolia the most brilliant works of Persian nefc literature of thisperiod, such as the MathnawC {of Remc} and Lama“At {of ‘Iraqc}. Because theonly institutions for training the intellectuals who were going to enter governmentservice were the madrasas, the officials who received their training there under theinfluence of Persian culture also used Persian in state affairs. This overwhelmingdomination of Persian as the official language lasted until the ruler of Qaraman,Murammad Bey, captured Konya.76 If the Seljuks had given value and import-ance to Turkish and tried to develop it, there might have been a rich literature inthat language in Anatolia long before the formation of the Ottoman state.Nevertheless, despite all this neglect and indifference, a Turkish literature– aside from popular religious and heroic works – did develop in Anatolia in theseventh/thirteenth century, partly under the influence of Persian nefc literatureand partly under the influence of early Turkish popular nefc works, such as thoseof Armad Yasawc and his followers. In addition to an early work entitled theStory of Shaikh San“An, whose author and date are unknown,77 we also have thenefcpoetry of Shayyad lamza and Suluan Walad, written quite a bit earlier thanthat of Yenus Emre. As for Gülshehrc’s {Turkish} translation of ManUiq al-Uair,the poetry of ‘fshıq Pasha and various compositions of oersen Faqch, Naqcb-Oghlu, Mu‘arrif Laziqc, and Ma‘adh-Oghlu lasan of Baypazar, they werecontemporary with, or slightly later than, the works of Yenus Emre.Among the Turkish poets who preceded Yenus Emre – leaving asideMawlana,78 whose Turkish work consists of about eight or ten lines of poetry,and Shayyad lamza,79 whose nefc poems and fame were quickly forgotten – theearliest to produce a noteworthy amount of work was Suluan Walad. This greatnefc was born in 623/1226 and died in 712/1312 at the age of almost ninety.In Konya and Damascus, he studied the religious sciences with various scholars,especially his father, and also received lessons in spirituality from leadingpersonalities like the Sayyid Burhan Tirmidhc, Shams Tabrczc, nalar al-DcnZarkeb, Chelebi lusam al-Dcn, and Shaikh Karcm al-Dcn. Suluan Walad,who, according to sources like {Ibn Qutlebugha’s} TAj al-tarAjim and {‘Abdal-Qadir b. Murammad’s} al-Durra al-muQC ”a {i.e. al-JawAhir al-muQC ”a}, was, likehis father, a great lanafc faqCh, was also a fairly noteworthy nefc poet in Persian.He has left us three mathnawC works, IbtidA”nAme, IntihA”nAme, and RabAbnAme, alarge anthology of poetry {DCwAn}, and a prose work called Ma“Arif.In the IbtidA”nAme and RabAbnAme, and in the DCwAn, there are Turkish poems ofa quantity and quality to allow us to consider Suluan Walad as an early Turkishpoet.80 I will not go into a lengthy description here of these poems, which werewritten in a very crude and primitive language and with a very defective andrudimentary versification replete with ziRAf {pronouncing a long vowel short}and imAla {pronouncing a short vowel long}. This work, which has still notreceived the study it deserves, although it has attracted the attention of Europeanscholars for some time,81 requires a separate, detailed, linguistic and literary"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE209analysis. Here I will only make a few brief and general comments about SuluanWalad and his Turkish poetry in order to indicate his actual place in the generaldevelopment of Turkish literature in Anatolia.Suluan Walad, who desired nothing more than to propagate the nefcprinciplesthat his father had put forward, and whose personality therefore never emergesas distinct from that of his father, tried to compose in Turkish according to theexamples of Persian nefc literature. Mawlana’s influence on Turkish literaturethus begins with him. Suluan Walad’s motivation in writing Turkish poetry,just as it was in composing and reciting Persian poetry, was to raise the religiousconsciousness of the people of Anatolia, to guide them, and instill in them asense of the greatness of Mawlana. The fact that he wrote most of his worksin Persian is a consequence of the literary traditions of the period. The fact thathe occasionally resorted to Turkish derives from his fear that a large majority,who did not understand Persian, would be deprived of these teachings.82 If weset aside the understandably primitive stage of the language and versification, wecan say that there is no difference in form, meter, and style between the Turkishpoetry of Suluan Walad and the Persian poetry of Mawlana. Although there wasno widespread use of Turkish as a written language at that time, it is almostcertain that nefc poems in “arEQ, as well as legends and stories, had been writtenin Turkish in Anatolia even before Suluan Walad.83 But Suluan Walad, thanks tohis influence as a great nefc and spiritual teacher, succeeded in establishing “arEQmeters and mathnawC form as the absolute rule for nefc-moralistic didactic works.At the same time, however, despite the influence of Suluan Walad and theimportance of the Persian “arEQ system, nefc poetry written in the syllabic meter,which began with Armad Yasawc and continued with popular nefcs like Shayyadlamza, continued to flourish and finally found its greatest representative inYenus Emre.Suluan Walad’s first imitator, and a contemporary of Yenus Emre, wasShaikh Gülshehrc, who expanded upon ‘Auuar’s ManUiq al-Uair with stories takenfrom various sources, especially the MathnawC, and with quite a few discussionsand complaints relating to his own time. In this great work, to which he gave asomewhat personal touch, he proved a fine versifier and a very talented artist.84The fame of this poet, who considered himself the direct successor of such greatPersian poets as Sana’c, ‘Auuar, Nivamc, Sa‘dc, Mawlana, and Suluan Walad,lasted until the tenth/sixteenth century, after which time he was virtually forgotten,so he was not included in later biographical dictionaries. Nevertheless, manypassages from his work are of such excellent literary quality that they can be readwith pleasure even today. The work of this poet, who, for his time, had a superbcommand of the language and a rich imagination – in short, a great artisticsensibility – not only surpasses the MathnawC, for example, in its composition, butalso stands out among contemporary works with regard to its internal aestheticquality.85After Gülshehrc, the most significant work to appear under the influence ofPersian nefc literature and of Mawlana and Suluan Walad was the GharCbnAme of"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE210‘Ashıq Pasha, whose shorter poems, written under the influence of Yenus Emre,I will discuss briefly below.86 Summing up, in Anatolia before Yenus Emre, thepervasive influence of Persian culture was present in language and literature asit was in all other aspects of civilization. Indeed, this influence was strong anddeep not only with respect to ideas, but also regarding language, form, style, andversification.F Folk literatureWhile the elite who received a madrasa education in the great civilized centers ofAnatolia cultivated a taste for the refined products of Persian literature and triedto write works of the same kind, the great mass of the people remained almosttotal strangers to it. Not only the nomadic Turkmen tribes and the march tribeswho guarded the frontiers with Byzantium, Armenia, and Georgia, but also alarge part of the urban population could take no pleasure in the literature of alanguage that they did not understand. Consequently, a number of simple andrudimentary Turkish works of a religious or heroic nature, as well as heroic poems,were written for them. The wandering ozans {minstrels},87 who for centurieshad, with kopuz88 in hand, satisfied the aesthetic needs of the people, kept the oldTurkish traditions alive throughout Anatolia in a vigorous and devoted manner.Beneath a veneer apparently borrowed from Arabic and Persian culture,Turkish life in Anatolia in the Seljuk period was perhaps a bit primitive, but itwas completely national, genuine, and widespread. After leaving the banks of theSyr Darya and experiencing a long career of migration filled with adventuresand crowned with continuous victories and booty, the Turkmen, who, fightingfor their national-religious ideals, settled in Anatolia, saw this as a period of alps{heroes}, i.e. as a heroic era. The old national and warlike traditions, whicheven exerted an influence on the official ceremonies and institutions of the {Seljuk}state, developed further among the Anatolian Turks as a natural consequenceof unremitting conflict with the Byzantines, Armenians, Georgians, and otherChristian peoples. The march tribes in particular, who lived along the frontiers,maintained their customs and pastoral existence and, in their traditions, theharsh and heroic spirit of the early migratory Turkish hordes.The basic organization of the Seljuk state also had a military cast. Landedestates were parcelled out to the sipAhCs. Officials who possessed large and richtimars were legally bound to raise up a specific number of soldiers. It was a kindof dynastic rule that the rank of sipAhC pass from father to son. In order for anyson to take his father’s place, however, he had to prove that he had the qualifica-tions and warlike attributes to be a sipAhC. Gold-embroiderd kutases {ornamentsof yak or horsehair} were placed on the necks of the horses of the alps whohad exhibited great self-sacrifice; tiger tails were attached to the wrists of those whoshot a tiger while hunting with a bow and arrow; those who killed a bird with asingle shot were allowed to wear its plume.89 Alp was a title of very high honor.‘fshıq Pasha {1272–1333}, who knew the period of the alps very well, describes"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE211at length in plain and charming language what was required for one to becomean alp.90 In this period, Anatolia was so permeated with an atmosphere of heroismthat even the Seljuk rulers who were under the demoralizing influence of Persianculture could not give up their attachment to Oghuz customary law {töre}91 andthe old warlike traditions in their own palaces. The sultans’ practices of goingout to hunt, playing polo with the Oghuz beys, and providing training in hand-to-hand combat and archery were all required by Oghuz “custom.”92The primary native singers of the era of heroes were the ozans. These minstrels,who, from time immemorial, had played the kopuz and sung the old Oghuzlegends, i.e. the national epics of the Oghuz Turks, were found without fail inthe armies, in the large nomadic tents, in short, wherever there was a gathering.There was never a Seljuk army that was without its minstrels and kopuz players.In the joyful evenings following military victories, kopuz in hand, they wouldrecite heroic poems that would bring to life that day’s gestes.93 It is a pity thatalmost nothing from these epics has come down to us. The products of thiswonderful era of alps, which certainly included a valuable epic literature, dis-appeared during subsequent centuries, perhaps because they remained in oralform. Fortunately, we can get an idea of the basic and genuine features of thisperiod, even the completely heroic views of love and women, so different fromthose of later periods, from the KitAb-ı Dede Korkut {Book of Dede Korkut}.94In addition to the ethno-religious didactic works and narratives that werewritten to expound the principles of Islam, and all of these epic works, theAnatolian Turks also possessed a large body of love poems and folk songs {s.türkü} of a purely lyrical nature. These short poems, which merely expressedindividual needs rather than collective feelings and social ideals, were usuallycouched in the national meters and the traditional forms that had survived fromthe early ethnic/folk {kavmi} literary period. They had names like türkü,95 türkmAnC,96and varsaXı,97 which reveal their ethnic origin, or koZma,98 deyiZ,99 or kayabaZı,100which convey their rustic nature or the requirement of musical accompaniment.Unfortunately, nothing has come down to us of these poems. Moreover, becauseof the lack of historical documents from this period, the disparagement of, andindifference to, this kind of literary work by the early tezkirecis,101 we do not evenknow the name of a single writer of such poems. Nevertheless, this gap inknowledge is, as I stated above, by no means an obstacle to gaining a clear anddefinitive idea of the basic features of our literature at that time.GOghuzn–meLike many other peoples in history, the Oghuz Turks had their national epic, theorigin of which is lost in time. This epic, which had existed not only as an oraltradition but had also been established in written form, very likely even beforethe appearance of Islam,102 was subsequently called the OghuznAme because itconcerned the Oghuz. Seeing that the early history of every people takes theform of myths and legends, Rashcd al-Dcn {d. 718/1318} used this written epic"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE212for details on the origins of the Oghuz in his famous universal history.103 Thus,positive history and myths were mixed together. We also know that this error,which was inescapable for that time, has been continued by our most recentresearchers and historians, who still believe that there existed a work describingthe early history of the Oghuz under the vague title of OghuznAme and evensearch for it.104 Although the existence of the OghuznAme is shown quite clearlyand unequivocally in certain historical documents from the ninth/fifteenth andtenth/sixteenth centuries,105 and passages from it are even cited in works like theJAm-i jam AyCn and SaljEqnAme,106 this evidence is not sufficient to reject the ideathat the OghuznAme was a collective work constituting a national epic that alsocomprised certain legends relating to the individual Oghuz lineages, and thuswas not an early history as has been believed or conjectured. The very clear anddetailed discussion of this subject by, above all, Abe Bakr Ibn ‘Abd Allahb. Aybak al-Dawadarc (himself a scion of the Seljuk dynasty {d. 713/1313}), whosaw an old copy of the OghuznAme, shows quite definitely that it was not a historyas has been believed.107 The famous work that we possess today entitled KitAb-ıDede Korkut, if not the complete original OghuznAme, is, without any doubt, animportant and fundamental portion of it.108We cannot give here even a brief account of the Oghuz epic and KitAb-ı DedeKorkut, both of which need a thorough analysis. Let me simply state, in order topresent, as far as possible, a full and accurate picture of life in Anatolia beforeYenus Emre, that the Dede Korkut legends were very widespread among thepeople at that time and that the Oghuz minstrels recited them with kopuz inhand.109 These shared legends of the early heroic periods of the Turks naturallyhad a special appeal to the unsophisticated and marvel-loving people of thosetimes, when the alp spirit prevailed in Anatolia. The old themes, which hadlasted for centuries, did not change, but certain unavoidable novelties appearedin the legends regarding time and place, which aroused even more interest, andhad an even more positive influence, on the common people, who had alreadybeen enjoying them for a very long time. Compared with heroic legends likethose of Bauual Ghazc and stories like those of the KitAb-ı Dede Korkut, all thepopular works, i.e. ethico-religious exhortations and stories, of that time werevery dull and ineffective. If we were to summarize this in one sentence, we couldsay that one can see in this work, in a most striking fashion, all the aesthetic andethical features of the alp period of Anatolia. Some of the stories that were toldunder the title of OghuznAme, such as the famous legend of Tepegöz, which hasattracted the most attention – and which has been seen by various Europeanscholars as having a strong connection with the cyclops in the Greek myths – stillsurvive in some Anatolian villages.H ConclusionHaving provided this long summary showing the general but distinct featuresof the spiritual and literary life in Anatolia before Yenus Emre in order to"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE213characterize the milieu in which he flourished, I can now lay out the issue to myreaders in a briefer and more synthetic manner. It is obvious from the abovesketch that the primary sentiments that animated the Turks of Anatolia werethose of religion and heroism. The religious feelings, which were chiefly manifestin mystical form, were not of the type that would paralyze the social structureby confining the Turks of Anatolia to tekkes or mosques, because the Turks, whofrequently endured the campaigns of the Crusaders and were continuouslyon guard against them, had long possessed the warlike qualities that the geo-political conditions of Anatolia demanded of them. Because warfare was essentiallya religious command, religious feelings and feelings of heroism coalesced, indeedcomplemented each other, among the Turks as they did among other nationswho fought religious wars in the Middle Ages. If the nefc legends that flourishedin this era of alps were analyzed even superficially, the following point wouldbecome quite obvious: There is an enormous difference between the warlikeTurkish nefcs in these legends – who battle against unbelievers with woodenswords, crush huge enemy armies with a handful of disciples, capture fortresses,and spread Islam to the lands of the infidels by the power of the sword110 – andthe Arab and Persian nefcs who spent tranquil lives in the tekkes. The erens {saints,nefc spiritual leaders} of the era of alps were, as ‘Ashıq Pasha quiet rightly stated,“hero saints” {alp erenler}.In light of these cursory remarks, the aesthetic elements that constitutedAnatolian literature at that time should be readily apparent. The works thatwere to satisfy the needs of this religio-heroic life were naturally to arise as aresult of the coalescence of two kinds of sentiments, i.e. from a combination ofreligious and heroic feelings. And this is, in fact, what happened. The literaryworks of this period comprise legends of religious heroes who had acquired anational character or national heroes who had taken on an Islamic hue; didacticworks devoted to religious etiquette; and, to some extent, nefc poetry. After thefrontier had slowly advanced toward the west, and the eastern areas of Anatoliaceased to be a battlefield and were made secure, scholars who were preoccupiedwith translating and imitating Persian literature, and contemplative nefcs wholived in a deep state of mystic rapture in their tekkes, began to flourish there.But on the frontiers, the alp erens, i.e. dervishes engaged in jihAd, still flourished.Indeed, even the collapse of political centralization, the lapse of Anatolia intowidespread anarchy, and the outbreak of heretical uprisings under the screen ofnefism in the midst of these disorders could not prevent this. It is during theearly period of the foundation of the Ottoman state that the legendary memoryof the alp erens, who conquered fortresses with wooden swords and providedleadership to the armies, is attested in our histories.111In addition to the old religio-national heroic legends, nefc poetry, treatingsuch subjects as the transitoriness of the world and the philosophy of the unity ofbeing, also began to increase during the seventh/thirteenth century. The nefcswho wrote this poetry wanted to spread their beliefs among the common peopleand thus usually tried to introduce the philosophical element, which was foreign"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE214to them, in a manner that suited their taste. Consequently, they endeavored toclothe their ideas in a national garment with respect to language, style, form,and meter. This task was relatively easy, because the “arEQ metrical system, i.e.Persian influence, had not yet penetrated very deeply and was unable to makemuch progress among the mass of the people. Also, those early poets had beforethem, as a model, the Rikmats of Armad Yasawc and his imitators.It is quite natural, therefore, that while the madrasa-educated class, who hadbeen captivated by Persian literature, were busy translating the classical Persianworks, many nefcs, who were closer to the popular taste, wanted to spread theirown beliefs among the people in a national form. Among those who undertookthis task was, for example, Shayyad lamza. The milieu necessary for success,and the elements from which the new artistic form would be created, wereessentially present, but they still lacked a genius who would bring them together.It was Yenus Emre who combined this foreign philosophical element with thenational element, according to the peculiar genius of the Turkish aesthetic, andcreated a Turkish nefc literature that accorded with popular taste and, aestheticallyspeaking, was completely different from that of Persian nefc works. The role ofYenus Emre in the birth of this distinctive literature, which flourished vigorouslyin the bosom of the nation for centuries and was rooted in it, was to understandwith the genius of a national artist the need of the milieu and to combine andsynthesize with overwhelming success a number of different elements that thecenturies had brought forth. Thus, he was able to epitomize the national tastefor centuries.NOTES1 Ibn al-Athcr {al-KAmil}. The same historian states that these Oghuz had by thattime already entered the milieu of Islam, but this began only in the fourth/tenthcentury as Barthold quite rightly claims. Furthermore, {Zakariyya’ b. Murammad}al-Qazwcnc’s {d. 682/1283} report suggests that the Oghuz had accepted Christian-ity at an early date ({FthAr al-bilAd,} ed. F. Wüstenfeld {Göttingen, 1848; reprintedWiesbaden, 1967}, vol. 2, p. 394). Barthold states that these Oghuz were the peoplewho had succeeded in unifying all the Turkish tribes from China to the Black Seain a nomadic empire in the sixth century ce and that the Toquz Oghuz in theOrhon Inscriptions of the eighth century ce were, in fact, these people (see his article“Ghuzz” in EI1). The Orientalist Radloff had already understood this point quitewell before these inscriptions were discovered (Das Kudatku Bilik, p. 78). G. Ramstedthad claimed that these Oghuz were related to the Mongol Oirats and in like mannerB. Munkácsi had claimed that they were related to the Uighurs, but it is simplyimpossible to accept these claims from the linguistic point of view. Nevertheless,Thomsen, like the Orientalists Barthold and Radloff, also categorically states that theToquz Oghuz and the ancient Uighurs were the same people and that they werethe ones who founded the early Uighur empire (Inscriptions de l’Orkhon, pp. 147– 8).In the early Arabic sources, the name Tokuz-Guz, i.e. Toquz Oghuz, is last foundin al-oabarc ({Ta”rCkh (Leiden, 1879 –1901),} vol. 3, p. 1044; {English trans. underthe general editorship of Ehsan Yarshater as The History of al-OabarC (Albany, NY,1985 –), see vol. 32, trans. C. E. Bosworth as The Reunification of the “AbbAsid Caliphate"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE215(1987), p. 107}) in connection with their conquest of the region of Ushresana in205/820 –1. Subsequently, in the Western regions only Oghuz are mentioned, andthese Oghuz, after becoming Muslims, are usually called Turkmen, which had themeaning of Muslim Turk. I have given information above (Chapter 5, p. 150, n.23)on this title, which we found first in al-Muqaddasc (de Goeje edn, p. 274), then in{al-Kashgarc’s} DCwAn lughAt al-turk and {Nivam al-Mulk’s} SiyAsatnAme. In my view,the various etymological explanations of this word, which were first made by Araband Persian historians and, afterwards, which have been proposed since Nashrc{d. before 926/1520} up to the present time in both the East and West, are com-pletely unacceptable and have no scientific basis. {See Golden, “The Migrations ofthe Oxuz,” and An Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples.}2 The Syr Darya Oghuz had quickly accepted Islam because they had a commonborder with Muslim countries and were in continuous contact with Muslims, KhazarTurks, and Qipchaqs. They had already departed Transoxiana before the Seljuks asvarious tribes and appeared, after passing through northern Iran, in Azerbaijan andArran, i.e. along the frontier of the Byzantine Empire, and began to conduct raids.Nomadic Oghuz tribes were also frequently found in Transoxiana and Khurasan inthe fifth/eleventh century. Those in Khurasan had been transferred there fromTransoxiana as a skillful political expedient on the part of Sultan Marmed of Ghazna.For various reasons, they also went to the Byzantine frontier and joined the otherOghuz who had established themselves there. However, neither Transoxiananor Khurasan remained completely free of Turks. A number of new Turkish tribesappeared from beyond the Syr Darya and descended upon those same regions. Theymixed with the other Turks who were there and became a source of strength forthe Seljuks. Transoxiana in particular, because of continuous migration up to thattime, became rather Turkified and, to a considerable extent, lost its ancient Persiancharacter {clearly a Turkish nationalist assertion}. While the most importantethnographic factor in this respect was the Qarluqs, the role of the Oghuz cannot beconsidered wholly without significance. In any case, within a short period of oneor two centuries, under the command of the Seljuk rulers, the Oghuz who wereestablished on the Byzantine frontier achieved the complete Turkification of Anatolia.Before the Mongol invasion, Oghuz tribes were found in the regions of Transoxiana,Khurasan, northern Iran, the southern Caucasus, Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, andal-Jazcra. The Mongol invasion drove them toward the west and encouraged arenewed Oghuz migration into Anatolia in the Il-Khanid period. They later formedthe states of the Aq Qoyunlu and Qara Qoyunlu. Even the Turks who later returnedto the east and formed the basis of power of the nafavid state were all Oghuz.After the Mongol invasion, we no longer find the Oghuz in Transoxiana andKhurasan. Let me simply add, as I mentioned briefly above (pp. 177– 8), that thetribes presently living in the broad Turkmen area encompassed by the Caspian Sea,Iran, Khcva, and Bukhara are the descendants of the Oghuz who had originallygone there and of the other Oghuz who joined them as a consequence of theMongol invasion. Even this brief summary clearly demonstrates the huge extent ofthe ethnographic region that the Oghuz Turks had occupied before the founding ofthe Ottoman state in Anatolia.3 The capital of the Saltuqid state, which was founded by ‘Alc b. Abe ‘l-Qasim, aTurkmen bey, was Erzurum. This state, which often struggled against the Georgians,came to an end in 598/1202, after first coming under the protection of the Seljuksof Anatolia and then becoming directly subject to them. The Mengüchekid state,which was also founded by a Turkmen amCr {synonymous with bey}, Mengüj Ghazc,possessed Erzincan, Kemah, Konya, Sharkc Karahisar, and Divrixi, and theirsurrounding regions. Erzincan was the capital. The Mengüchekids fought for a long"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE216time against the Georgians, Abkhazians, and Byzantines. In 625/1227– 8, after thecollapse of the Danishmendid state, they handed the territory over to the Seljuks ofAnatolia. The date of the end of the Divrixi branch is not entirely clear. As for theDanishmendid state, which was established by the famous Malik Armad DanishmendGhazc, it took control of the entire region of Cappadocia by conquering Sivas,Amasya, Tokat, Niksar, Osmancık, Çorum and their surrounding areas and thenexpanded across the Kızıl Irmak and incorporated Kangırı and Kastamonu andtheir environs. This state showed a great capacity for expansion at the time of itsfoundation, but the subsequent struggles over succession and disputes with the Seljuksof Anatolia served only to postpone somewhat the Turkification of Anatolia. Withthe collapse of the Sivas branch of the Danishmendids in 569/1174 and the Malatyabranch in 573/1178, their territory passed to the Seljuks of Anatolia. The Akhlau-Shahs, who founded a state in 486/1093 – 4 and were extinguished by the Ayyebidsin 604/1207, often struggled against the Georgians. Akhlau passed from the Ayyebidsto Jalal al-Dcn the Khwarazm-Shah and then back to the Ayyebids. The Mongolslater completely destroyed this city and massacred its population. Nevertheless, withthe help of the Seljuk ruler ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Kai-Qubad I, it was revived to become oneof the major eastern cities of the Seljuks of Anatolia. The Saltuqid, Mengüchekid,and Danishmendid states were all founded by amCrs under the command of AlpArslan after his great and decisive victory at Malazgird. {For recent work on thesestates, see the references in their respective sections in Bosworth, The New IslamicDynasties (New York, 1996).}4 The political structures of the states established by Turks who had accepted Islamderived partly from the ‘Abbasids, i.e. from the old Sasanid traditions, and partlyfrom pre-Islamic Turkish traditions. The Seljuk state in Anatolia remained muchmore faithful to the old ethnic traditions than did the other Seljuk states. For example,it maintained such ancient institutions as the Zölen ( public banquets) and sıXır(public hunts {more properly “royal battue”} in addition to a structure based on thetwenty-four Oghuz clans and the clan beys, and even the kurultay {great assembly}.(For information on these subjects, see my article “Türk edebiyatı’nın menze’i.”) Thereason for this, so it would appear, is that the Turks came to Anatolia in greatmasses, and these great masses allowed them to maintain the traditions and institu-tions that they brought with them. Anatolia was, in fact, already a “dAr al-jihAd”{abode of war} at the time of Toghrıl Bey and Alp Arslan. Not only large groups butalso many individual adventurers hastened there (Nivam al-Mulk, SiyAsatnAme). Inshort, Oghuz traditions, which were called the Oghuz töre among the Seljuks ofAnatolia, remained strong until the end of the dynasty and had a great influence onpolitical and administrative structures. When the government organization of theSeljuks of Anatolia is studied historically in a comparative manner, the nature oftheir view of the state can be very clearly understood. The ancient Göktürk state wasa compound structure composed of ils {territories}, and the ruler possessed a kind ofpatrimonial guardianship over them {allusion to Max Weber, The Theory of Social andEconomic Organization, trans. A. M. Henderson and Talcott Parsons ( New York, 1947),pp. 346 –54}. Among the Qarakhanids, who suceeded the Samanids, the countrywas considered to be the property not just of the ruler but of the entire ruling family.Consequently, it was divided into many parts that were governed separately. Someof them in fact were independent of the central authority. The same state of affairsis encountered in the early Seljuk period. Because the ruler alone did not representthe state, in some cities of Khurasan the khuUba {Friday sermon} was recited in thename of Toghrıl Bey, while in other cities it was recited in the name of Da’ed {i.e.his brother Chaghrı Bey}. The concept of state advanced {i.e. became more rationalin the Weberian sense} during the reigns of the successors of Toghrıl Bey and the"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE217Seljuks of Anatolia, who definitely did not tolerate sharing such things as the khuUbaor coinage, which were perquisites of sovereignty. Even some neighboring states thatwere subordinate to the Seljuks were forced to mention on their coinage the name ofthe Seljuk sultan to whom they were subject. Nevertheless, the Seljuks still regardedit as legitimate for the ruler to divide the country among his children, so it is obviousthat the concept of the indivisability of the state had not yet taken hold. In light of allthis, it should now be clear that, among the Seljuks of Anatolia, there was anotherform of guardianship distinct from the ruler’s patrimonial guardianship and thatthe state of the Seljuks of Anatolia had already abandoned, from its inception, the{notion of } an il-khAnate, i.e. a composite entity in which the ruler possessed apatrimonial guardianship, and had become a sultanate. Still, it should not be for-gotten that this sultanate could not be considered complete and perfect in everyaspect of its formation and that a number of institutions, such as the twenty-four clans,Zölen, and division of the territory among the individual family members, whichdated from the early period of the Il-Khanate, survived until the end of the dynasty.As more research is done on the political structures of the Turkish states that wereformed up to that time, these points will be elucidated. {Cf. Köprülü’s “Selçukilerzamanında Anadoluda Türk medeniyyeti,” Leiser trans. pp. 48 –9.}5 The military and political organization of the Seljuks of Anatolia reached itsmost developed form during the reign of ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Kai-Qubad I. Not only was themachinery of centralized government properly established, but the administrativeapparatus in the provinces was also clearly defined and regularized. There wereqAQCs, muftCs, subaZıs {police chief, constable}, and tax collectors everywhere. Thefundamental organization of the Seljuk state, as of all the other Turkish states, wasof a military nature. The land was parcelled out to the sipAhCs {cavalry soldiers}, andhigh officials possessing large and rich timars {military land grants} maintained a setnumber of troops. The officials of the central government, “ulamA”, sayyids, and muqarrabs{court favorites} also had timars that provided them with set incomes. On the frontiers,however, the timars were given mainly to ghAzCs {warriors, warriors for the faith} andalps {heroes}. Being a sipAhC was a kind of dynastic right that passed from father toson. But the son first had to prove that he was a warrior in order to take his father’splace. Indeed, all folk traditions had a war-like quality. The alps held a very importantplace among the people. On all the frontiers, there were usually march {uc} beys whowere charged with protecting the border. In the capital, the Seljuks of Anatolia hadsubstantial standing military forces; and extensive training quarters were established,in the capital in particular, in order to prepare them for war. (For rather moredetailed information on the political relations, civil and military organization, palacelife, and many other special features of the Seljuks of Anatolia, and comparisons withsimilar institutions of the other Turkish states, see my article “Selçukiler zamanindaAnadoluda Türk medeniyyeti.” {Currently the most authoritative work on the Seljuksof Anatolia is Osman Turan, Selçuklular zamanında Türkiye tarihi, 2nd edn (Istanbul,1984); still useful is Cl.

We will see this greatinfluence more clearly below while discussing the nefc movement, Mawlana Jalalal-Dcn Remc, and the disaffection exhibited toward the national language and litera-ture in Anatolia before the Ottomans. The Anatolian Turks did not undergo a greatintellectual transformation as a result of their contact with Greeks and Armeniansand saw no need to change their old views regarding science, philosophy, and art.Greco-Roman and Christian civilization was bound to have no effect on the Turksof Anatolia as long as their world-views remained unchanged. Moreover, the MuslimTurks did not see the civilization of these defeated {Christian} nations as superiorto Islamic civilization. To the contrary, they considered it to be inferior in everyrespect. It was thus impossible for the Turks to escape the influence of Islamiccivilization, which was a unified structure embracing every aspect of life. This civiliza-tion was not inferior to Western civilization in all of its particulars; rather, it wassuperior to it in many respects. Based on such considerations, I am of the opinionthat Byzantine influence on the Anatolian Turks was very slight and superficial andthat the contrary view cannot be defended historically. {Köprülü later returned tothis subject in his “Bizans müesseselerinin osmanlı müesseselerine te’siri hakkındabâzı mülâhazalar,” Türk Hukuk ve Yktisat Tarihi Mecmuası, 1 (1931), 165 –313, Englishtrans. Leiser as Some Observations on the Influence of Byzantine Institutions on Ottoman Institutions(Ankara, 1999). There was much greater cultural exchange between the Turks andChristians in Anatolia than Köprülü allows here. Indeed, he later qualified his viewsin the aforesaid work. See now in particular Speros Vryonis, The Decline of MedievalHellenism in Asia Minor and the Process of Islamization from the Eleventh through the FifteenthCentury (Berkeley, CA, 1971).}8 The Anatolian Seljuk rulers Kılıch Arslan II, and then Ghiyath al-Dcn Kai-KhusrawI and ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Kai-Qubad I, had very close relations with the Byzantines. Indeed,they were familiar with their traditions from living in Byzantium. The famous qAQCal-Tirmidhc issued a strong fatwA saying that Kai-Khusraw was not suitable to besultan because he had taken refuge with the Byzantine ruler and had done variousthings that were religiously prohibited. Later, when the sultan assumed the thronein Konya, he took revenge by putting him to death. Nevertheless, we know thatin order to calm public opinion, which had been agitated over this incident – forthe execution of a qAQC was an unheard of event – the sultan granted a large numberof favors to his heirs. Ibn Bcbc interprets public opinion quite well by writing that,simply because of the inauspiciousness of this unjustified shedding of blood, thevineyards and gardens of Konya produced no crops for three years (Ibn Bcbc,{Yazıcı-oxlu’s} trans., p. 80). Now, this rather unconstrained behavior of the Seljuksof Anatolia was not, of course, condoned in the fanatical milieu of the neighboringcourts. It was asked whether the Seljuks had returned to the old idolatry or Zoroas-trianism. Indeed, the ruler of Aleppo, the famous Ner al-Dcn al-Zangc, who, in the"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE219early books of ethics, such as {Kınalı-Zâde ‘Ali Chelebi’s} AkhlAq-i “alA”i {Belaq,1248/1833}, is presented as a model ruler with respect to his Muslim zeal, justiceand integrity, wanted Kılıch Arslan II, whom he did not think was a true Muslim, torenew his faith in the presence of his envoy (Huart, Konia {La Ville des dervichestourneurs} [Paris, 1897], p. 215). Because the Seljuks of Anatolia used images of livingthings as decoration on public buildings, had figures and scenes carved in relief onthe walls of fortresses, saw no harm in having three-dimensional statues made, andeven had a cavalryman in the shape and person of Saint George on some of theircoins, used the falcon and double-headed eagle on their weapons and coats of arms,and had images carved on their tombstones – practices that were never regardedas {religiously} lawful by the Sunncs – it is easy to understand how such doubts couldarise about them. Yet the Seljuks of Anatolia were true Muslim-Turkish rulers, farremoved from every kind of fanaticism. The religious zeal that they showed inresponse to the attacks of the Crusaders and the effort they expended to turn Anatoliainto a Muslim country clearly demonstrate this. Indeed, the Turkish tribes that cameto Anatolia were also free of every kind of fanaticism.9 Gustave Mendel, “Les Monuments Seldjoukides en asie mineure,” {La Révue de l’ArtAncien et Moderne, 23 (1908), 9 –24, 113–27,}, Turkish trans. Vahid as “Anadolu’daselçuk âbîdeleri,” in YM, {1917}, no. 19, {369 –74}; no. 20, {389 –91}; no. 21,{409 –15}.10 Even before this, however, Persian influence was already clearly evident in allelements of Seljuk civilization in Anatolia. The Mongol invasion also brought to thecourts of the Seljuks of Anatolia – as was the case in the other courts of Western Asiathat were saved from that onslaught – some poets, nefcs, and artisans who no longerfound it possible to live in Iran, Khwarazm, and Turkistan. As a consequence of thisgreat invasion, some powerful new tribes of the Oghuz also migrated to Anatolia orthe Seljuk frontier. It should not be forgotten, however, that even before the Mongolinvasion, the ethnographic character and cultural composition of Western Anatoliawere in a state of formation and development.11 The Seljuk rulers who, like all enlightened men of the age, received a literary educationand thoroughly knew Persian literature, were also poets in their own right andcontinuously showered their fellow poets with favors. Indeed, no other kind of behaviorcould have been expected from such rulers as Sultan Rukn al-Dcn Qahir (SulaimanII}, Ghiyath al-Dcn Kai-Khusraw I, ‘Izz al-Dcn Kai-Ka’es I, and ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Kai-Qubad I, who were well known for their patronage of literature. When the famouspoet pahcr Faryabc sent to Sultan Rukn al-Dcn a qaTCda, the first verse of which reads{When he lets his drunken locks loose in the company / The soul would be sluggishif it did not sacrifice itself for him,} he received a reward of “five slaves, five slavegirls, 2000 pieces of gold, five camels, three horses, and fifty pieces of valuable wholecloth.” In like manner, because Nivamc Ganjawc composed his famous Makhzanal-asrAr for Sultan Rukn al-Dcn and presented it to him, the sultan sent one of hiscompanions to him with “5000 pieces of gold, five horses, sumptuous robes of honorand other gifts,” and said that if it had been possible, he would have also given him{other} treasures by way of thanks in return for this work that would immortalize hisname throughout the world. This information is extracted from my article, only partof which was published, entitled “Selçukîler zamanında Anadolu’da Türk medeniyyeti”{not in the published part}. Some critical material on this subject is found in thatstudy. Sultans Rukn al-Dcn Qahir, Ghiyath al-Dcn Kai-Khusraw I, and ‘Izz al-Dcn"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE220Kai-Ka’es I always discussed and debated issues with the scholars and poets in theircouncils and granted them royal favors. ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Kai-Qubad I, who was wellversed in various branches of the fine arts, composed some quatrains, mostly inPersian, and took great pleasure in reciting them at wine drinking parties. Accordingto a story of the translator {Yazıcı-oxlu} of Ibn Bcbc, his palace was truly a place ofscience and culture, Huzûrunda kasâid ve gazeller okunup, neyler vurulup, sazlar çalınıp,piZrevler pâre edilse, eZ“ârin meânîsi ve nükteleri ve san“atları ve evzânından bahis olunurdu ve makâmâtve durûb ve buhûr tahkîkinden söylenirdi.

There was no idle talk. All his booncompanions were men of culture, letters, and eloquence.} One sees Persian influence,of course, in all of this.12 As was explained in my study of the institutions of the Seljuks of Anatolia {seeprevious note}, Persian influence was very strong in their court life as well as in theiradministrative organization. As in the old Sasanid courts, the famous ball and stick{polo} game and, as in the oldest Turkish palaces, the battues that were held twicea year – and that were originally religious in character – were very well known inthe Seljuk palaces. I hope to publish soon a special study on these public hunts thathad great social value in early Iran and among various Turkish dynasties {neverpublished}.13 According to Mendel, Seljuk art was not a completely original art because a numberof different influences acted upon it. Thus, building plans were Arab or Persian.In architecture, Syrian and Armenian forms mixed with Persian. The columns,capitals, and meanders bear witness to definite Byzantine influence, but limited tocertain decorative details and without a significant effect on construction methods.In coverings of multicolored faience, Persian influence is again revealed. Geometricdesigns, i.e. the manner in which they are treated, and likewise vegetal designs andthe arabesque belonged wholly to Islamic art. Finally, the use of depictions of livingthings in place of {geometric} decoration was not unknown to these artisans. Some-times such different influences existed side by side without mixing and sometimesthey blended together more profoundly. In order for a completely original art formto have arisen out of all these elements, the Seljuks of Anatolia would have had topersist under prosperous conditions for a much longer time than that which fateallowed them. As for the Ottomans, their successors, they appreciated beauty thatwas simple and imposing and for this reason did not especially like the ornamentaland flowery motifs that the Seljuk sultans had loved so much in Konya. The realheirs of Kai-Khusraw I and Kai-Qubad I in art were the Qaramanids and Aydınids.The Qaramanid mosques in Qaraman and Konya and the Aydınid mosque of‘hsa Bey in Ayasuluk {Ephesus} still bear witness to the fact that Seljuk motifs andforms of ornamentation survived until the beginning of the ninth/fifteenth century(Gustave Mendel, “Les Monuments seldjoukides en Asie mineure,” {pp. 126 –7}.The author {Saladin} of the famous work entitled Manuel d’art musulman: l’architectureessentially agrees with Mendel on Seljuk art and its constituent elements.14 Heinrich Glück, {Türkische Kunst, a published lecture (Budapest-Constantinople, 1917)},Turkish trans. Ahmed Cemal as “Türk san‘atı,” YM, {1918}, no. 59 {129 –32}; no.60 {149 –52}; no. 61 {168 –72}. An assistant of the famous Prof. J. Strzygowski,the director of the Vienna Institute of Art History, he wrote an important workon Seljuk sculpture in Anatolia that was published in Istanbul in 1917 as thefourth publication of the Müze-i Humâyun {Imperial Museum}. The ideas thatProf. Strzygowski first advanced about early Turkish art in his recent and very"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE221important work Altai-Iran und Völkerwanderung {Leipzig, 1917} and {now} the studiesof Glück challenge everything known to date about Turkish art. The archeologistswho have studied Turkish art comprehensively from the earliest times to the present,just as I have done with literature, have quite rightly asserted that early Turkishelements are also found in Seljuk art. This wholly scientific approach, which allowsone to analyze an entire series of events successively from beginning to end, hasrescued the history of Turkish literature from obscurity during the past six or sevenyears, and will no doubt be equally productive for the history of art. {On Turkishart, now see, for example, Oktay Aslanapa, Turkish Art and Architecture (New York,1971), and Esin Atil (ed.), Turkish Art (Washington, DC, 1980).}15 During the time of Saladin {564 – 89/1169 –93}, tekkes and UarCqas multiplied in Egyptand Syria to such an extent that he found it necessary to create some structure forthem in order to maintain order and to prevent discord and confusion. Thus, heestablished the tekke of Sa‘cd al-Su‘ada’, which he called the “Duwairat al-nefcyya”{nefc cell}, and then gave the shaikh who was appointed to it a right of supervisionover the other shaikhs ({Zaydan,} Medeniyyet-i islâmiyye tarihi, vol. 1, p. 239). {On thisfacility, see al-Maqrczc, al-KhiUaU (Belaq, 1870), vol. 2, p. 415; and Leonore Fernandes,The Evolution of a Sufi Institution in Mamluk Egypt: the Khanqah (Berlin, 1988).}16 The biographies and commentaries, both important and trivial, that have beenwritten in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish about the famous Ibn al-‘Arabc, who isconsidered to be one of the most important and greatest nefcs to flourish in theMuslim world and who acquired the title the “Greatest Shaikh” and had a powerfulinfluence for centuries on Islamic mysticism through his important works like theFuTET and al-FutERAt, are too numerous to list here even briefly. The fact that noserious and detailed study has yet been produced on the life, works, career, andinfluence of Ibn al-‘Arabc truly constitutes a very great shortcoming for the {study}of the history of nefism. [ For the most concise information on the research that hasbeen done on Ibn al-‘Arabc in the years since this was written, one should see YA, s.v.“Muhyi-d-Din Arabî” (Ahmed Atez) {abridged in his article “Ibn al-‘Arabc” in EI2;now see, above all, William Chittick’s works on Ibn al-‘Arabc, notably those in thebibliography}.] By the seventh/thirteenth century, there had already developed amongMuslim mystics large and powerful movements both for and against Ibn al-‘Arabc.On the one hand were proponents of waRdat al-wujEd {unity of being} who believedthat he had reached the highest stage of nefism. On the other there appearedextremist opponents who went so far as to accuse him of unbelief and heresy. {SeeAlexander D. Knysh, Ibn “Arabi in the Later Islamic Tradition: The Making of a PolemicalImage in Medieval Islam (Albany, NY, 1999).} The famous Shaikh Kamal al-Dcn ‘Abdal-Razzaq al-Kashc, who wrote valuable commentaries on the FuTET and ManAzilal-sA”irCn {of al-Harawc}, considered deeming dhAt-i bArC {the essence of God} to bewujEd-i muUlaq {absolute being} to be the most advanced level of his knowledge,but his contemporary Shaikh Rukn al-Dcn ‘Ala’ al-Dawla {al-Simnanc} found thiscompletely unacceptable. Indeed, this issue alone resulted in some correspondencebetween them ({ Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., pp. 537– 47). According to thecommentator on the ManAzil al-sA”irCn, the last of all the stages was tawRCd. ShaikhRukn al-Dcn ‘Ala’ al-Dawla, however, considered tawRCd to be only the eightieth stageand replaced it with devotion to God (“ubEdiyya) as the ultimate, i.e. the hundredthstage. According to him, Devotion to God from the point of view of sanctity meansreturning to one’s initial condition. Indeed, when Sayyid al-oa’ifa al-Junaid al-Baghdadc was asked “What is the end of this business?” he answered, {Returning to the beginning}. Shaikh ‘Ala’ al-Dawla, who had written many quatrainson the theme of tawRCd, said that after placing qidam {eternal pre-existence of God}at the end of the stage of tawRCd, he realized that these quatrains were in sheer error"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE222and that to return to God was much better than remaining in falsehood (NafaRAt,{Turkish} trans., p. 547).17 When the influence of the caliphs of Baghdad declined and sovereignty passedinto the hands of various Turkish, Dailamc, Kurdish, and Persian amCrs and sultans,these new rulers needed a means of attracting the affection of the people in order toappropriate the religious aura of the caliphs. The easiest way to do this was to favorthe poor and honor and respect the “ulamA” and nefcs. Consequently, when a cleverand prudent sultan or amCr won sovereignty over a city, he first tried to win over its“ulamA”, faqChs, and nefcs, to construct mosques, caravansaries, tekkes, and soup kitchens,and to provide for the salaries {of their employees} and income {for their mainten-ance}. Nivam al-Mulk showed great skill and energy in this regard. Another reasonwhy such institutions multiplied in a short time was that the amCrs and the wealthypeople wanted to leave a means of livelihood to their heirs. Anyone who feared thatupon his death the ruler would confiscate his wealth would build, for example, a tekkeor madrasa, endow it with all his property and then place his children in charge of theadministration of the endowment {waqf} and set aside for them an amount that hespecified from its income ({Zaydan,} Medeniyyet-i islâmiyye tarihi, vol. 3, pp. 397–9).It would be completely incorrect, however, to attribute the creation of such charit-able institutions merely to material motives, such as, in particular, the desire of thefounder of a waqf to ensure an income for his children. Spiritual and altruistic factorsalso played a role in this. {There is a growing literature on waqf in Anatolia. See, forexample, Mehmet Köymen, “Selçuklu devri kaynakları olarak vakfiyeler,” in Studipreottomani e ottomani (Naples, 1976), pp. 153–63, and S. Bayram, “Selçuklu vakfiyeleriüzerine bazı düzünceler,” in IV. Milli Selçuklu kültür ve medeniyeti semineri bildirileri (Konya,1995), pp. 135 – 47.}18 The famous nefc Khwaja ‘Azczan {more properly known as Khwaja ‘Alc ‘AzczanRamctanc}, to whom Mawlana showed reverence in the couplet{If the science of mystical states (RAl) were not superior to standard religious know-ledge (qAl), why would the notable men of Bukhara be subservient to Khwaja-iNassaj (the weaver)}, left Bukhara and went to Khwarazm. When he arrived he senttwo of his dervishes to the ruler specifically requesting a written permit to residethere. Attributing this to the shaikh’s naiveté, the ruler cheerfully granted permission.A short time later, however, so many murCds had collected around the shaikh that theruler became frightened of this large assemblage and, for political reasons, decidedto expel the shaikh from the country. But when Khwaja ‘Azczan showed the permitthat he had received, the ruler was very embarrassed and, together with the leadingstate officials, joined the ranks of the shaikh’s murCds ({nafc,} RashaRAt, {Turkish}trans., pp. 48 –9). This curious incident, which was perhaps altered in transmission,should probably not be viewed as an isolated occurrence. {The story about Ramctanc’sarrival in Khwarazm, from the RashaRAt, seems to have been a floating anecdote,since much the same story is found about other nefcs in Central Asia (and Köprülüleft out the interesting part where Ramctanc is said to have paid people money tobecome his followers). As for Remc knowing about him, according to the RashaRAtRemc died nearly a half century before Ramctanc. The “Khwaja-i Nassaj” referredto in the couplet might be one of two much earlier figures: a Murammad al-Nassajof Baghdad, a contemporary of Junaid, or Abe Bakr al-Nassaj of oes (d. 487/1094).The link with Bukhara, however, suggests that it might refer to ‘Abd al-KhaliqGhujduwanc, who is also referred to as “a weaver” in some accounts, and is linked in"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE223several stories with one of the famous Tadrs of Bukhara. There may be somethingsignificant about the term “weaver” being applied to several early Khwajaganc saints.In any case, the term used for both Ramctanc and Ghujduwanc is the Persian one,bAfandah, rather than nassAj.} Let me mention another important incident from anearlier time in order to show the influence of the shaikhs on the rulers: when SultanSanjar went to war against the Khwarazm-Shah Atsız and entered Khwarazm, thefamous nefc Zahid-i fhe-Pesh, who was there – and about whom it is reportedthat he ate deer meat and wore deer skin – “presented himself before Sanjar andafter delivering a goodly sermon interceded for the people of the town” ( Juvainc,JahAn-GushA, vol. 2, p. 10 {Boyle trans., vol. 1, pp. 283 – 4}). Such efforts on the partof nefcs were generally productive and influential with rulers who were aware of “thenefc truths.” One can find many such incidents in the history of this period.19Birgün {eyh Mecdü”d-Dîn, derviZlerinden bir cemâatla oturmuZtu.

I took to the sea like a gosling, while the shaikh remainedon the shore.” Shaikh Najm al-Dcn, through the light of grace, learned of thisremark and the following emerged from his mouth: “Let him die in the sea.” ShaikhMajd al-Dcn heard this and was frightened. He came before Shaikh Sa‘d al-Dcnal-lammeyc, very obsequiously humbled himself and said, “One day when theshaikh is in good humor, inform me so that I can go and beg his pardon.” Once duringa samA“ the shaikh was in a good humor. Shaikh Sa‘d al-Dcn informed him. ShaikhMajd al-Dcn came barefoot and filled a large bowl with fire, placed it on his headand stood where they took off their shoes. Shaikh Najm al-Dcn looked at him andsaid, “Since you ask forgiveness with distraught speech according to the way of thedervishes, you have secured your faith and religion, but you will lose your life and"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE224die in the sea, and we will also die because of you and many a military commanderwill die because of you and the dominion of Khwarazm will be lost and the worldwill go to ruin.” Shaikh Majd al-Dcn fell before the foot of the Shaikh and a shorttime later what the Shaikh said came to pass. Shaikh Majd al-Dcn used to preach inKhwarazm and Sultan Murammad’s mother (who was a very beautiful woman)used to hear him and on occasion she used to visit him. Gossipers watched for anopportunity. One night the sultan was extremely drunk. They said to him “Yourmother has married Majd al-Dcn according to the madhhab of Abe lancfa.” Thesultan was very upset and ordered that the shaikh be cast into the water and theycast him in. Word of this reached Shaikh Najm al-Dcn Kubra and he became veryupset. (He said: “We belong to God and to Him we return. My son Majd al-Dcn hasbeen cast into the water and has died.” Then) he placed his head on his prayer rugand some time later raised it and said, “I prayed that God take the kingdom awayfrom Sultan Murammad as the blood-price of my son Majd al-Dcn. And my prayerhas been answered.” They told the sultan about this and he became extremelyremorseful. He went on foot to his excellency the shaikh and he brought a large bowlfull of gold. Over it he placed a sword and shroud and he bared his head. He stoodby the door where shoes are left on entering and said, “If it is blood money youwant, here is the gold. If it is revenge you want, here is the sword and head.” Theshaikh answered, saying, “The blood money is your kingdom. Your life will be lostand the lives of many people, and I too will lose my life because of you.” SultanMurammad was in despair. He returned and soon Chingiz Khan burst forth}({Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., pp. 481–2). This curious legend is recorded in allthe sources {this is not the case} and is very famous. Dawlat-Shah attributes theappearance of Chingiz Khan to a similar cause, especially noteworthy in showingthe great spiritual influence attributed to the shaikhs: Because there was a greatloathing between Sultan Murammad the Khwarazm-Shah, who was very proud ofhis greatness and power, and the ‘Abbasid caliph al-Natir, the sultan obtained fatwAsfrom the “ulamA” and imAms to the effect that the ‘Abbasids did not deserve thecaliphate and that it was reserved for the descendants of ‘Alc. His intention was todepose and expel the caliph and install in his place one of the sayyids of Tirmidh,Khanizade ‘Ala’ al-Mulk, and with this intention he marched on Baghdad. Caliphal-Natir sent the famous Shaikh Shihab al-Dcn ‘Umar al-Suhrawardc with an embassyto the sultan in order to seek a reconciliation. The shaikh met the sultan’s army atNihawand. When the shaikh entered the sultan’s tent, the sultan kept him standingand did not offer him a seat. While on his feet, he told the sultan of the dignity andhigh rank of the ‘Abbasids and of the harm of becoming the object of their maledic-tion. After a cool exchange of views, the shaikh returned empty handed. Numerousmaledictions befell the sultan. Dawlat-Shah is certain that these imprecations wereanswered. The same writer reports that whenever Sultan Murammad the Khwarazm-Shah met the Mongols {in battle} he heard a voice from among the men of theunseen world say, “Oh, unbelievers! Kill the sinners!” and, being struck with terror,fled. He adds the following anecdote in the same vein: It is reported from the peopleof unveiling {saints} and the great men of religion that they saw a great many menof God as well as Khaqir provide guidance at the front of the Mongol army. In theface of this divine wisdom, the discernment of the “ulamA” and the wisdom of thesages are weak and bewildered. But God is the Almighty and does what He wishes.As a result of this, Shaikh Najm al-Dcn Kubra recited the following quatrain:"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE225{O!

Juvainc, who hadthe best and most intimate knowledge of the history of the Khwarazm-Shahs, alsoreports that Sultan Murammad the Khwarazm-Shah’s behavior toward the caliphsof Baghdad did not bring him good luck (JahAn-GushA, vol. 2, p. 122). The biographyof Shihab al-Dcn ‘Umar al-Suhrawardc and extensive accounts of his exalted positionare found in all the Arab and Persian biographical dictionaries and collections ofnefc legends. It is also known from these works that he wrote a book of travels calledal-RisAla al-“A Timiyya (C. Fraehn, Indications Bibliographiques {relatives pour la plupart à lalittérature historico-géographique des arabs, des persans et des turcs. . . (St Petersburg, 1845)},p. 45, n.149). Descriptions of the Khwarazm-Shahs’ relations with the caliphs ofBaghdad can also be found in Barthold {Turkestan}, Nasawc {SCrat al-SulUAn JalAlal-DCn MingCrnC}, Ibn al-Athcr {al-KAmil}, and {Mcrkhwand} RawQat al-TafA.20 Imam al-Ghazalc, in his work al-Tafriqa bain al-islAm wa ”l-zandaqa, mentions certainfalse nefcs who claimed they were in a state of divine ecstasy and had no need for theobligations of this world, such as prayer and worship, and he wanted to have themarrested (see Huart, “Les Zindîqs en droit musulman,” {Actes du 11e Congrès Interna-tional des Orientalistes (1897), 3rd section, pp. 69 –92,} citing the MS in the AyasofyaLibrary, and Jacob, Die Bektaschijje, p. 44 {there is an English trans. of al-Tafriqa inR. J. McCarthy, Deliverance from Error . . . and Other Works of al-Ghazali (Louisville, n.d.;reprint of Twayne, 1980), pp. 125 – 49}.21 When the Mongols turned toward Khwarazm, Shaikh Najm al-Dcn Kubra collectedhis followers. Their number was more than 600. He said to some of them, such asShaikh Sa‘d al-Dcn al-lammeyc and Raqc ‘l-Dcn ‘Alc Lala, “Arise quickly! A con-flagration has appeared from the East and will burn all the way to the West.” Someof his followers asked him to pray in order to repel it. “It is not possible,” he said. “Inthat case, you come with us. Let us go to Khurasan,” they said. “I will be a martyrhere. I am not permitted to leave the country,” he replied. Thereupon a largenumber of murCds set out for Khurasan. When the Mongols came to Khwarazm, theshaikh and his remaining murCds went out to meet them. He wore a patched cloak{khirqa} open in front and had filled his arms with stones. Finally, the stones in hishand ran out. An arrow struck his chest. He plucked it out and fell dead (617/1220).Shaikh Najm al-Dcn, who is considered the founder of the Kubrawiyya UarCqa, was agreat nefc. There is a tradition that Mawlana Baha’ al-Dcn Walad {Remc’s father}was one of his murCds. His other leading khalCfas were shaikhs such as Majd al-DcnBaghdadc, Sa‘d al-Dcn al-lammeyc, Baba Kamal Jandc, Raqc ‘l-Dcn ‘Alc Lala, Saifal-Dcn Bakharzc, Najm al-Dcn Razc, and Jamal al-Dcn Gclc, all of whom held highpositions in the nefc world. In the famous poem by Jalal al-Dcn Remc that beginswith the line {O! We are of the noble band who graspthe cup of wine,. . . (thus in Afzal Iqbal, The Life and Work of Jalal-ud-din Rumi, 3rdrev. edn [Lahore, 1974], p. 46; but in Remc’s KulliyAt-i Shams-i TabrCz, ed. B. Furezanfaras KulliyAt-i Shams, ya DCvAn-i kabCr [Tehran, 1977], no. 785, the first words are [we are not of the noble band who grasp the cup of wine] )}, thereis an allusion to the martyrdom of Najm al-Dcn Kubra ({Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish}trans., p. 480). {See EI2, s.v. “Kubra” (Hamid Algar).}22 Sultan ‘Izz al-Dcn Kai-Ka’es I’s attachment to his shaikh Majd al-Dcn Israq, andlater ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Kai-Qubad I’s and his amCrs’ respect and reverence for Shaikh"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE226Shihab al-Dcn al-Suhrawardc, who was sent by Caliph al-Natir li-Dcn Allah, and,as will be seen below, the respect and kindness shown to Suluan al-‘Ulama’ Baha’al-Dcn Walad and a number of other nefcs are all evidence of this.23 Ibn al-‘Arabc, who spoke with him, says that this occurred in 602/1205 –6 ({ Jamc,}NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., p. 409). As a result of this encounter, Awrad al-DcnKirmanc {d. 635/1238}, who was associated with Shaikh Abe ’l-Najcb al-Suhrawardc{d. 563/1168}, was one of the nefcs who Zuhûd-i hakîkate mezâhir-i suverî ile tevessül edenve Cemâl-i Mutlak”ı suver-i mukayyedatta gören {approached the witnessing of Truth bymeans of the manifestations of form, and saw Absolute Beauty in earth-bound forms}.Because of this, Shihab al-Dcn al-Suhrawardc called him an “innovator” (ibid.,p. 660). In meetings with Shams Tabrczc, Shams would ask him what he had doneand he would reply, “I saw a bear in the water basin.” Shams then alluded to theerror into which he had fallen by asking, “If a boil did not erupt on your head, whydon’t you see it in the sky?” (ibid., p. 520). There are many stories about Awradal-Dcn Kirmanc’s being overly attracted to divine beauty in earthly form {huTn-iVAhirC}. Mawlana had great respect for Awrad al-Dcn Kirmanc, who composed thefollowing quatrain:{I look at the forms with the eyes of my head,Because in the forms there is a trace of meaning.This is the world of forms, and we are in the forms:One canot see meaning except in the forms.}The author of the NafaRAt describes the attraction of the great nefcs like ShaikhArmad al-Ghazalc, Awrad al-Dcn Kirmanc, and Fakhr al-Dcn ‘Iraqc to earthly beautyas follows: Ekâbirden bâzı cemâat ki cemâl-i mezâhir-i sûrî ve hissî mütâlâasına iZtigâlgöstermiZlerdir; Hüsn-i zan belki sıdk-ı i“tikâd evlâdır ki, onların ol mezâhirde Hak Sübhânehu veTe“âlâ”nın Cemâl-i Mutlak”ını müZâhede etmiZlerdir ve suver-i hüsn ile mukayyed olmamıZlardır veeXer bâzı küberâdan onlara nisbet inkâr vâkı“ olduysa ondan maksud oldur ki mahcuplar onu düsturbilmeyeler ve hâllerini onların hâllerine kıyâs etmeyeler {With regard to some of the greatmen who were preoccupied with observing formal, perceptible, outward beauty, it iscorrect opinion, or rather true belief, that they did witness God’s absolute beauty inthose manifestations and they were not confined to the (outward) forms of beauty. Ifcertain scholars have repudiated them, their motivation in doing so was to preventthe modest from considering those men as models and judging their own conditionby theirs} (p. 662). Mawlana’s warning {Do not judgethe deeds of the pure by your own (MathnawC, vol. 1, 263)} thus applies to suchconditions. One should not confuse Awrad al-Dcn Kirmanc, who wrote an imitatioto the famous orthodox {muwaRRidAne, confessing the unity of God} poem of Sana’c,which begins with the verse{Longing, oh lovely-walking lovers! / Joy, oh sweet-behaving beauties!} (Dawlat-Shah, Tadhkira, p. 98), and who also wrote a number of orthodox quatrains (p. 210),with his murCd and disciple Awrad al-Dcn Maraghc. In his section on the famous nefcAmcr Sayyid lusainc (d. 718/1318 –19), Dawlat-Shah says that this nefc {apparently"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE227lusainc}, who was a murCd of Shihab al-Dcn al-Suhrawardc, retired for religiousdevotions with Shaikh Fakhr al-Dcn ‘Iraqc and Shaikh Awrad al-Dcn {Maraghc}(d. 697/1297–8) {d. 738/1337–8 in EI2} in the tekke of Shaikh Awrad al-Dcn inKirman and that during this time ‘Iraqc wrote his Lama“At, Sayyid lusainc wrotehis ZAd al-musAfirCn, and Shaikh Awrad wrote his famous TarjC“ and they presentedthese works to Awrad al-Dcn Kirmanc (p. 233). Dawlat-Shah’s statement ( p. 210),in his section on Awrad al-Dcn Kirmanc, that he was a murCd of Shihab al-Dcnal-Suhrawardc is an error that derives from his being associated with ShaikhAbe al-Najcb al-Suhrawardc in this way. {See Badc‘ al-Zaman Furezanfar (ed.),ManAqib-i AwRad al-DCn LamCd b. AbC ”l-Fakhr KirmAnC (Tehran, 1347/1969); and EI2,s.v. “Kirmanc” (B. M. Weischer).}24 Shaikh Fakhr al-Dcn Ibn Ibrahcm ‘Iraqc, who died in Damascus in 709/1309–10,according to Dawlat-Shah, or in 688/1289 according to { Jamc’s} NafaRAt, holds animportant place among the Persian nefc poets because of his Lama“At and DCwAn.Dawlat-Shah says that he was associated with Shihab al-Dcn al-Suhrawardc who sent him to India to Shaikh Baha’ al-Dcn Zakariyya’ al-Multanc {cf. EI2, s.v. “‘Iraqc”(H. Massé), versus errors of Dawlat-Shah}, whose daughter he married (pp. 215 –16). In the NafaRAt, it is related that after he returned from India, he visited Meccaand Medina. From there he went to Anatolia and had conversations with nadral-Dcn al-Qenawc. He listened to al-Qenawc’s lectures on {Ibn al-‘Arabc’s} FuTET andwrote the Lama“At under its influence. We also know that the famous Mu‘cn al-DcnParwana was one of his murCds and firmly believed in him and had a tekke built forhim in Tokat (NafaRAt, pp. 671ff.). This also confirms that the report deriving fromDawlat-Shah according to which the Lama“At was written in Kirman and presentedto Shaikh Awrad al-Dcn Kirmanc, as mentioned in n.23 above, is not correct. Thelegendary deeds of this shaikh, who was known for contemplating divine beauty inearthly forms exactly like Awrad al-Dcn Kirmanc, are recorded in the NafaRAt. Itseems clear that this shaikh was under the influence of Ibn al-‘Arabc and nadr al-Dcnal-Qenawc. The Lama“At is a well known work written in the style of Armadal-Ghazalc’s RisAla-i SawAniR. The famous sultan Abe ’l-Qasim Babur enjoyed readingit very much. The shaikh of shaikhs nadr al-Dcn Murammad al-Rawasc, in responseto one of his {apparently Babur’s} questions on this work, described the religious worksof Shaikh ‘Iraqc as “maRQ-i CqAn wATil-i “irfAn” {pure certainty, a means of attainingspiritual knowledge} (Dawlat-Shah, Tadhkira, p. 233 {the Lama“At has been translatedby William Chittick and Peter Lamborn Wilson as Divine Flashes (New York, 1982)}).25 There is extensive information on Mu‘cn al-Dcn Sulaiman Parwana’s political lifein all the works on the Seljuks of Anatolia. He corresponded with al-Malik al-pahirBaibars, the ruler of Egypt who sent this correspondence to Abaqa Khan, andon Abaqa’s order he was executed in 676/1277. There is also information on hisrelations with Jalal al-Dcn Remc in the books of {nefc} legends. {See CaroleHillenbrand, “Mu“cn al-Dcn Parwana: the Servant of Two Masters?” in F. de Jong(ed.), Miscellanea Arabica et Islamica: Dissertationes in Academia Ultrajectina prolatae annoMCMXC (Leuven, 1993), 267–74.}26 Najm al-Dcn Razc, who had the byname Najm al-Dcn Daya, was a follower of Najmal-Dcn Kubra. His training was assigned to Shaikh Majd al-Dcn {Baghdadc}. He metboth nadr al-Dcn al-Qenawc and Jalal al-Dcn Remc, who had gone to Anatolia fromKhwarazm during the Mongol invasion. This shaikh, who was the author of MirTAdal-“ibAd and TafsCr-i baRr al-RaqA”iq, died in 654/1256, but his place of death is notknown for sure. Some assign a grave in Baghdad to him, but it has not been provento be his. In the second section of the first chapter of MirTAd al-“ibAd, it is stated thathe left Hamadan with some dervishes at the onset of the Mongol invasion in 617/1220 –1, that he went to the land of Anatolia {Rem} via Irbcl the following year,that he resided in Kayseri, which was one of the flourishing Anatolian cities thanks"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE228to the justice of the Seljuk rulers, that he began to write the MirTAd al-“ibAd there,and that he finished it in Sivas in 628/1230 –1 ({ Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans.,pp. 491–2) {on the date cf.

MirTAd al-“ibAdwas translated into Turkish under the title IrshAd al-murCd ilA ”l-murAd by Qasim b.Murammad of Karahisar in 825/1421–2 for Sultan Murad II (MSS in the IstanbulUniversity Library, Königlichen Bibliothek in Berlin, and elsewhere {English trans.by Hamid Algar as The Path of God’s Bondsmen from Origin to Return (Delmar, NY,1982)}).27 Shaikh nadr al-Dcn Murammad b. Israq al-Qenawc was born in Konya. AfterIbn al-‘Arabc had come to Konya, nadr al-Dcn’s father died and his mother waswidowed. Ibn al-‘Arabc married this widow and thus nadr al-Dcn grew up underhis spiritual instruction and was instrumental in spreading the doctrine of the “unityof being” in Anatolia {cf. EI2, s.v. “nadr al-Dcn al-menawc” (W. C. Chittick), ands.v. “Wardat al-Shuhed” (W. C. Chittick)}. Indeed, most of his works are devotedto explaining and criticizing the ideas and beliefs of Ibn al-‘Arabc. According to{Jamc’s} NafaRAt, Kelâm-i Neyh”in nakkâdıdır. Neyh”in maksûdunu Vahdet-i Vücûd mese”lesindeve bir vechile ki akl-ü ser“e mutâbık ola, onun tahkîkâtını tetebbu“ etmeksizin kemâyenbagî fehmetmekmüyesser deXildir ve bunlardan dahî musannifâtı vardır.

Without studying al-Qenawc, it is not easy to get a proper understanding ofthe Shaikh’s intention, with regard to the unity of being, in a way that accords withreason and the SharC“a. He wrote other works in addition to this, such as TafsCr-iFAtiRa, MafAtiR al-ghaib, FuTET, al-FukEk, SharR-i RadCth, and KitAb-ı NafaRAt-i IlAhC} (NafaRAt,{Turkish} trans., p. 632). nadr al-Dcn al-Qenawc met the chief khalCfas of Najmal-Dcn Kubra, like Sa‘d al-Dcn al-lammeyc and Najm al-Dcn Daya, and had acordial relationship with Mawlana. His death was after that of Mawlana. Accordingto one report, Mawlana enjoined him to perform his funeral prayer, but accordingto another, when it came time for him to serve as imAm, he was struck by a loud cryand fainted and qAQC Siraj al-Dcn served as imAm ({Farcden b. Armad} Sipahsalar,{ManAqib-i Radrat-i KhudAwandikAr, Turkish} trans. {Midhat Bahârî Hüsâmî (Istanbul,1331/1913),} p. 156). By interpreting the works of Ibn al-‘Arabc for his disciples andmurCds, and devoting his own works to these issues, this great nefc, some of whoseworks are extant in our libraries, performed a great service in spreading the doctrineof the unity of being in Anatolia.28 Mu’ayyad al-Dcn al-Jandc, whose Arabic nefc poetry was in the style of Ibn al-Fariq,and two couplets of which are even mentioned in the Lama“At of Shaikh ‘Iraqc, underthe influence of nadr al-Dcn al-Qenawc, wrote commentaries on the FuTET, the MawAqi“al-nujEm and other works of Ibn al-‘Arabc. The main source of virtually every sub-sequent commentary on the FuTET was that of Mu’ayyad al-Dcn ({ Jamc,} NafaRAt,{Turkish} trans., pp. 634 –5). {Al-Jandc’s Arabic SharR FuTEs al-Rikam has been editedby Sayyid Jalal al-Dcn fshtiyanc (Mashhad, 1361/1982) and his Persian NafRat al-rERva tuRfat al-futER by Najcb Mayil Haravc (Tehran, 1362/1403/1983).}29 Sa‘d al-Dcn Farghanc presented Ibn al-Fariq’s QaTCda al-tA”iyya with Persian com-mentary to his shaikh nadr al-Dcn al-Qenawc.

Ibn Bauueua encountered an old Rifa‘c shaikh from Iraqin the city of Majar on the Kuma River; and sixty or seventy dervishes, married andunmarried, Arabs, Persians, Turks and Greeks, were living in his zAwiya on alms.32 There are a number of such reports, legendary in part, in the Karaman tarihi, whichwas originally written in Persian in the style of a shAhnAme and was later translatedinto Turkish prose by Shikarc of Laranda. Shikarc writes, for example, that whenNer al-Dcn Bey, one of the Qaraman beys, went to Sivas he paid homage to thefamous Baba Ilyas and that after spending seven years in caves as hırka-pûZ-i uzlet {adervish-cloak wearing recluse} he took the name Ner al-Dcn nefc. Judging by Shikarc’saccount, shaikhs were definitely present in the consultative councils of the beys, andthey were asked to interpret dreams. The same writer also reports at length – withfantastic details appropriate to legend – that the Seljuk ruler always used to conferwith Mawlana; and later, when Qaraman Bey Murammad captured Konya, that hehastened to the same tekke to humble himself and show his devotion, and that, thanksto Mawlana’s authority, he gave up the plan to destroy the city and massacre thepopulace (from the copy belonging to Bursalı Tâhir). [This work, which Shikarctranslated into Turkish in the tenth/sixteenth century, was published by MesutKoman ({ikârî tarihi [Konya, 1946]), but it is not a good edition. {On Shikarc and hiswork, see Rudi Lindner, Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia (Bloomington, IN,1983), pp. 145–7.}] There are similar reports in the various legendary works aboutMawlana. It is recorded in Sipahsalar {ManAqib} that Shahzade Gaykhate orderedthe massacre of the people of Konya after becoming furious over the murder of theambassador he had sent to Konya by some unruly persons, but after seeing Mawlana,who had died by that time, in a dream he changed his mind, personally went toMawlana’s tomb, and made sacrifices and distributed alms (pp. 140ff.).33 When comparing the Turkish nefism of Central Asia with that of Anatolia, thesefactors should never be lost from view. The constraints of the social environmentwould naturally have influenced the UarCqas that developed in those places. We shallrefer to Mawlana’s own statements in order to demonstrate this influence of theenvironment on the nefcs. While discussing his preoccupation with poetry in Konya,Mawlana reveals that the reason for this is the requirements of the social milieu,thus: “I want to please people so much that when friends arrive, for example, I recitepoetry, so that they will not be bored. For a while I stopped reciting poetry, but theywanted me to recite again. Otherwise, what business do I have with poetry! By God,I am disgusted with poetry. In my opinion there is nothing worse than poetry...Aperson should see what merchandise is current in a city and immediately buy andsell it, even if it is the most insignificant thing. . . How much time have I spentacquiring knowledge! How much hardship have I suffered! The reason: in order tooffer sublime subjects to the excellent and the learned.

He wanted it this way, so what can I do about it? In our country andamong our people – i.e. in Khwarazm and among the Khwarazmians {Köprülü’sgloss} – nothing gives as much shame as being a poet. If I had remained in our owncountry, I would have lived in accordance with their norms and we would haveworked in a manner that they wanted – for example, lecturing, writing and givingsermons and advice” (Sipahsalar, {ManAqib, Turkish} trans. citing FChi mA fCh, pp. 96 –7 {English trans.

Thackston as Signs of the Unseen: The Discourses of Jalaluddin Rumi (Putney, VT,1994), pp. 77–8}). {In the narrative, we learn that the Yasawc dervishes streaminginto Anatolia from Central Asia (a fantasy) were not very committed to their pietyand asceticism and dropped them quickly under the influence of Anatolia broad-mindedness (another fantasy). Later Köprülü will project this broad-mindedness backonto Central Asia and onto Armad Yasawc’s shoulders.}The traveler Ibn Bauueua, in fact, describes in the following manner the greatinterest the people of Khwarazm, which was then subect to the state of the GoldenHorde, had in religious matters ({al-RiRla, Turkish trans.,} p. 405 {Gibb trans., vol.3, p. 542}): “They have a praiseworthy custom with regard to [the observance of ]prayer services which I have not seen elsewhere, namely that each of the muezzins intheir mosques goes around the houses of those persons neighboring his mosque,giving them notice of the approaching hour of prayer. Any person who absentshimself from the communal prayers is beaten by the imam [who leads the prayers]in the presence of the congregation, and in every mosque there is a whip hung up forthis purpose. He is also fined five dinars, which go toward the expenses of upkeep ofthe mosque, or of supplying food to the poor and destitute. They say that this customhas been an uninterrupted tradition among them from ancient times.” This lastsentence shows that this interest in religious matters was nothing new, that it hadcontinued since ancient times. Thus we can infer that such customs were alreadyfound in Khwarazm during the period of the Khwarazm-Shahs, and Mawlana’saccount corroborates this. Such Islamic traditions could not have been formed underthe national {sic} and very unconstrained government of the Golden Horde, whichhad not even dispensed with the yargu {a kind of court of interrogation} (ibid.,{Turkish trans.,} p. 408 {Gibb trans., vol. 3, p. 545}).34 By taking on a thousand different outward guises, Isma‘clism and other bAUinC ideo-logies, such as Qarmatianism, which was a branch of it, tried in fact to eliminateall Muslim articles of faith and take over political rule. Whenever one of theseideologies was deemed evil by the people and subjected to severe persecution, thebAUinCs who escaped from this persecution would reappear under another name andtry to propagate their beliefs in completely new guises. It was thus quite naturalfor certain men who, in fact, subscribed to bAUinC beliefs to conceal themselves underthe veil of nefism and even pantheism in order to play their role skillfully andsuccessfully. Most of the bAUinCs in Anatolia came from Syria, which had very closeintellectual and commercial ties with Anatolia and which had long been a haven forbAUinC beliefs. As will be seen below, we know that there were, indeed, a number ofbAUinCs in Syria disguised as nefcs. After Helage captured the fortress of Alamet andannihilated the Isma‘clcs there, a number of bAUinCs who had escaped went to Anatoliawhere they initiated provocations and sedition, naturally under the veil of nefism.As will be clear from the explanations given above, the social environment of Anatoliawas very conducive to such activity. In this respect, we can consider the Baba’cuprising, the institution of the akhCs, the lurefc and Bektashc movements and thereligious movements that followed them essentially to have originated from bauinism.It should not be forgotten, however, that various secondary factors also combinedwith this basic factor in each of these movements. We shall discuss later some of the"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE231movements that bAUinC beliefs spawned in Azerbaijan and Khurasan and some of thepoets associated with this ideology.35 Necib Âsım and Mehmed Ârif, Osmanlı tarihi, p. 444. Hammer, citing the historianJanabc, says that Baba Ilyas and his companion Israq were taken captive, butthe conquered beguiled the conqueror, and Jalal al-Dcn and the other Mawlawcshaikhs who were his friends withdrew from the court ({Geschichte des osmanischenReichs, Turkish trans.,} vol. 1, pp. 80 –1). According to [âkir Pasha, “At this time avagabond shaikh named Baba Ilyas Khurasanc appeared claiming to be a prophet orto be charged with reforming the world. His followers took the name Baba’c andorganized in the area around Amasya. They covered the territory in which theywere found with blood and fire. Out of fear, therefore, Ghiyath al-Dcn Kai-KhusrawII ordered Ertughrul to drive them out and punish them. Ertughrul raided them ata place called Chat near Amasya and routed them completely” (Yeni osmanlı tarihi{Istanbul, 1911–12}, vol. 1, p. 139). [âkir Pasha does not, however, clearly state hissource for this information. This is reason for not regarding his account as plausible.Indeed, there is nothing in the primary sources to link Ertughrul with this matter. Inthe {Turkish} translation of {Tashköprü-Zade’s} al-ShaqA”iq, this shaikh, under thename Baba Ilyas ‘Ajam, and this incident are discussed in the following manner:Amasya”da sâkin idi.

Sultan Ghiyath al-Dcn Ibn ‘Ala’ al-Dcn deemed it likely that thegroup would rebel, so he massacred all of his nefcs. Within a short time he was killedat the hands of his slaves and his descendants were cut off. Shaikh Mukhlit Baba wasruler (padiZah) in Yunan [according to Shikarc, Karaman tarihi, p. 4, Yunan = Konya,Larende, and Aksaray; also Tarsus] for six months. Then he placed on the throneof Yunan a five-year-old boy named Qaraman son of Ner al-Dcn who was one ofthe nefi8 of Baba Ilyas} (p. 23). This report, derived from Janabc’s account of theorigin of the Qaramanids, is not, in fact, credible. In the same work, in the descrip-tion of Shaikh Mukhlit Baba, it is also mentioned in a marginal note that he went toAnatolia during the Mongol troubles and that he was the son of Baba Ilyas ofKhurasan who settled near Amasya (p. 22). We know that the famous Geyikli Baba,a shaikh from the period of Sultan Orhan, was a member of the UarCqa of Sayyid Abe’l-Wafa’ – according to al-ShaqA”iq, Sayyid Abe ’l-Wafa-yi Baghdadc – and a murCdof Baba Ilyas (al-ShaqA”iq, {Turkish} trans., p. 32; ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade, {TawArCkh,}p. 46).

This scoundrel pretended to be someone whopracticed asceticism and turning away from the world. He attracted many murCds andfollowers from the Turkmens, villagers, and other simple-minded people. Manybelieved (his) trickery. He pretended to the people that his deceptions were miracles.Later he arrived in the vicinity of Amasya and established himself in a cave at thetop of a mountain in that area. He allowed no one except his special murCds toapproach him. For a while, he acted in this manner. Finally, he sent out his murCdsand led the people astray. One day he raised the banner of rebellion, pretending thatthis had been demanded by God. He went into action with the rabble who hadgathered around him. They made depredations in the areas of Amasya and Tokat.They plundered the country in which they appeared and defeated the beys who metthem. When news of this came to the attention of the Sultan, he sent against them adistinguished bey named Mubariz al-Dcn. He arrived and captured the aforesaidoutlaw and hanged him and his murCds. When the gang of mischief-makers who hadgathered under the banner of villainy learned what had happened, they were in astate of disorder and confusion and the evil of their sedition was erased from the faceof the earth. Those cursed ones believed, God forbid, that Baba Israq was a prophet}(NaRA ”if al-akhbAr {= Turkish trans. of Müneccim-bazı’s JAmi“ al-duwal (Istanbul, 1285/1868 –9)}, vol. 2, p. 568). This report, derived from various sources, shows that BabaIlyas was a nefc who had left Khurasan in the wake of the Mongol invasion and wasa murCd of Sayyid Abe ’l-Wafa’, and that after Sultan Ghiyath al-Dcn crushed theuprising of the Baba’cs, which had been incited by Baba Israq, the shaikh waspardoned and had to recognize Mukhlit Pasha as his son. Hüseyin Hüsâmeddinprovides an extensive and important account of this subject in Amasya tarihi, butunfortunately he does not clearly specify his sources. According to him, Baba IsraqKafarsedc, who prepared the ground for the Baba’c uprising, was originally a Greekconvert to Islam. He learned Shc‘ism and bauinism from the qAQC of Sivas Abe ‘AbdAllah Murammad, and after his death he became associated with Baba Ilyas. Thisman, who prepared the way for his emergence through various intrigues, appearedin 637/1239– 40 and declared that he was amCr al-mu”minCn {“Commander of theFaithful,” a title of the caliphs}. He marched on Konya. At that time, Sa‘d al-DcnKöpek, a Greek convert and intimate of the Seljuk sultan, had great influence overthe sultan. Meanwhile, the king of Trebizond also attacked Seljuk territory. Finally,after the execution of Sa‘d al-Dcn, Mubariz al-Dcn Armaghan-Shah defeated thisfalse prophet who had invaded the regions of Amasya, Tokat, and Sivas, apprehendedhim, and put him to death at Amasya. As for Baba Ilyas, he was, according to{[ükrullâh’s} Bahjat al-tawArCkh {MS 3059 in the Nuruosmaniye Library in Istanbul}one of the shaikhs of the Mas‘edc Khanqah that was built by the Seljuk SultanMas‘ed in 545/1150–1, viz. Shuja‘ al-Dcn Ilyas b. ‘Alc Khurasanc who won fameafter 628/1230 –1 and, although he had a hand in the Baba Israq incident, waspardoned and was sent to his estate near Amasya (Amasya tarihi, vols 1 and 2). Themanner in which this information was derived and the quality of the sourcesare unknown, however, so this description is not very credible. In any case, thereligio-political nature of this uprising shows that it was a bAUinC uprising. {Now seeAhmet Yazar Ocak, La Revolte de Baba Resul. . . (Ankara, 1989); and cf. Mertol Tulum’sstudy of Elvan Chelebi’s Menâkibü”l-Kudsiyye, Tarihi metin çalıZmalarında usul (Istanbul,2000), which is a study of Ocak’s primary source.}36 Ibn Bauueua states that all the people in the places that he visited in Anatolia werelanafcs, that there were no Qadircs, Rafiqcs, Mu‘tazilcs, Kharijcs, or innovators"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE233among them and that this was a virtue by which God had distinguished them({al-RiRla, Turkish trans.,} p. 310, {see Gibb trans., vol. 2, pp. 416 –17}). This claimis absolutely true with regard to lanafism in the cities, but it is patently impossibleto believe the assertion that there were no members of the Mu‘tazilc sects in Anatolia,given our knowledge of the important bAUinC uprisings in the seventh/thirteenth century.Ibn Bauueua writes that when they were in Sinop, the sultan’s deputy suspectedthat the people of that town were Rafiqcs and sent them a rabbit to see if this weretrue. After he saw that they ate it, his suspicion disappeared ({Turkish trans.,}p. 357, {Gibb trans., vol. 2, p. 468}). The testimony of a foreigner who spent threeto five days in the major cities of Anatolia, the language of which he did not under-stand, can only be so reliable. Bauinism took various nefc guises in order to escapethe attacks of the lanafcs in the cities, and disguised its true nature not only fromforeigners, but also from followers who had even been present at the founding ofthe UarCqa. It was quite common and widespread among the nomadic Turkmen inparticular, because it sanctioned many of their pre-Islamic customs and traditions.At all events, the urban populace of Anatolia, who were of the lanafc school, wereaware at that time of the existence of certain Rafiqcs who would not eat rabbit. Thespread of bauinism was facilitated by the fact that some of the Mongol rulers whomaintained political control of Anatolia encouraged, for various reasons, Mu‘tazilcmovements or else, by observing an old tradition of respect for religious freedom,tolerated, and were indifferent to, those who spread beliefs in opposition to Sunnctenets. Conceivably, the reign of Sultan Murammad Khudabanda {Öljeitü, 703 –16/1304 –16} had great influence in this respect. Aside from that, there were allkinds of bAUinC sects in various countries that had relations with the Turks. During theseventh/thirteenth and eighth/fourteenth centuries, when the environs of Latikiyyaand Aleppo and the ‘fmiq Plain were almost completely inhabited by Turkmen,there were in those areas, like Sarmcn, ahl-i sabb {“people of the curse”} who cursedthe “ashara-i mubashshara and thus the number ten. Later {in this region} there weremembers of many other sects, like the Isma‘clcs and Nutaircs, who lived in variousfortresses. The Turkmen residing in ‘Iraq al-‘Arab and ‘Iraq al-‘Ajam were also,of course, affected by external influences (Ibn Bauueua, {Turkish} trans., pp. 65, 74,76, 79, 81, 84). One should by no means overlook these points in examining thereligious history of Anatolia, the Qızılbash movement, and the beliefs of the present-day Turkmen. As for the Bektashiyya, this UarCqa did not later become corrupted bythe infiltration of the lurefiyya or lose its original character. Indeed, it came intoexistence from the appearance, under a new name, of some bAUinCs, perhaps includ-ing the Baba’cs after the true origin of the abdAls and akhCs, who were very close tothem, was for the most part forgotten, as I previously mentioned, and their doctrinewas ascribed to lajjc Bektash Veli, whose legends were widespread among thepeople. The views of Israq Efendi on this subject, and those of all the Europeanresearchers who have relied on him, are mistaken.37 According to the extensive information provided by Hüseyin Hüsâmeddin, citing{al-‘Aync’s} “Iqd al-jumAn, Baraq Baba was in fact the khalCfa of Aybek Baba, theshaikh of the Mas‘edc Khanqah, who, while striving to propagate bAUinC beliefs inAmasya, was forced to flee to Egypt in 670/1271–2. Because of his suspicious pro-nouncements in Egypt concerning the indewlling of God {RulEl, see EI2, s.v. “lulel”(L. Massignon-[G. C. Anawati] )} and spiritual union with God {ittiRAd, see EI2, s.v.“Ittirad” (R. Nicholson/G. C. Anawati)}, he was interrogated by an assembly ofreligious scholars convened in the presence of the ruler al-Malik al-pahir Baibarsal-Bunduqdarc and then chastised and flogged. He then left Egypt and joined AbaqaKhan (Amasya tarihi, pp. 405 –8). Again citing “Iqd al-jumAn, Hüsâmeddin Efendi alsosays that Baraq Baba was originally from Tokat, that he was born around 655/"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE2341257– 8, that he learned enlightenment in Amasya from Aybek Baba and ArmadBaba, that he had a large body and was very dirty and roamed from city to city. “Hewas completely naked above his waist. Below his waist he fastened an apron made ofred cloth. He wrapped his head in muslin in the shape of a light-weight red turban.He fastened water buffalo horns to each side of it. In his hand was a very large andlong trumpet and a large black begger’s cup made from a gourd. He would dancelike a bear and speak like a monkey. He was extremely filthy. He had eight or tencompanions who dressed and behaved the same way. They carried tambourineswith cymbals attached and wherever they went they would stand in a circle and playwhile Baraq Baba danced. Baraq Baba was an absolute heretic. He believed in RulEland disbelieved in the hereafter. He considered all things forbidden by canon lawto be permissible and claimed that God had first been incarnate {RulEl} in ‘Alcand afterwards was united spiritually {ittiRAd} with Sultan Khudabanda {Öljeitü}.He would be overcome by sexual desire, call beautiful women “god” and prostratehimself before them. When he went to Damascus, poets satirized this behavior.Nevertheless, despite this strange state of affairs, it is reported that he was an importantnefc poet. When it became evident to the populace of Damascus that he belonged tothe antinomian sect, he was subject to canonical punishment and died in Damascustoward the end of Dhe ’l-Qa‘da 706/May 1307 from the injuries suffered fromflogging” (Amasya tarihi, pp. 460 –4). Certain nefc sayings and some other traditionsattributed to Baraq Baba, and his Qalender life style, lead one to conjecture todaythat he was a popular poet, an ozan, who wrote nefc poetry in the popular meter.{See EIr, s.v. “Baraq Baba” (H. Algar); Ahmet Yazar Ocak, Osmanlı YmparatorluXundamarjinal sûfîlik: Kalenderîler (Ankara, 1992), index; and Ahmet T. Karamustafa, God’sUnruly Friends: Dervish Groups in the Islamic Later Middle Period 1200 –1550 (Salt LakeCity, 1994), index.}38 Shaikh Sulaiman Turkmanc, who died in Damascus in 714/1314 –15, is a personalitystrongly reminiscent of Baraq Baba. This Turkmen nefc wore an old and tatteredcloak, rarely stood up, said little, and would not fast during Ramaqan or performdaily prayers, but he did exhibit miraculous powers. In order to explain this strangecontradiction, Imam al-Yafi‘c attributed his situation to satr-i RAl {concealing the(true) state} and claimed that he prayed when no one saw him and that what he atein plain sight he did not swallow ({Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., p. 652). In anycase, it is highly likely that this Turkmen shaikh was an adherent of bAUinC beliefs andperhaps was also an Anatolian Baba’c. Also in Damascus in the seventh/thirteenthcentury, we come across a majdhEb {one obsessed with divine love} named Shaikh‘Alc Kurdc who behaved contrary to the SharC“a in several respects, usually evenexposing his genitals. Nevertheless, by performing a number of miracles, he beguiledthe people of Damascus. Shaikh Shihab al-Dcn al-Suhrawardc even went out of hisway to visit him while on an embassy to Damascus (ibid., pp. 652–3). All of theseaccounts go to show how strongly bAUinC beliefs were entrenched in Anatolia andSyria in the seventh/thirteenth century. In addition to these leading bAUinCs who areknown to history, there were countless unknown bAbAs like them who carried outpropaganda while wandering among the Turkmen from encampment to encampment.In Sipahsalar’s ManAqib, it is recorded that the Seljuk ruler Rukn al-Dcn Qahir{Sulaiman II}, whom Mawlana used to address as “Child” {Awlad}, was goaded byone of his slaves to visit an old nefc named Buzaghe {“Calf ”}, who had just thenarrived in Konya and, it was said, every night was attended by jinns. When Buzaghespoke to the sultan, he addressed him as “Child.” Mawlana was moved by this andsaid, “In that case, we have to find another Child” (ibid., pp. 117–19). According toSipahsalar, this old bAbA named Buzaghe was from among the common people. Inmy view, this man was one of the bAUinCs who were so ubiquitous in Anatolia at that"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE235time. The story found in some histories, according to which Mawlana, who wastouched by this incident, adopted Osman Ghazc as his spiritual son – and from thattime Seljuk grandeur began to decline and the Ottoman dynasty began to rise – is acorruption of this tale and has no historical value. While discussing the Baba’csabove, I stated that Janabc and Hammer wrote that “they beguiled the Seljuk rulerand as a result Mawlana and the Mawlawcs withdrew from the court.” Janabc’sreport may also be a corruption of the aforesaid incident.39 The most detailed information on the akhC organization in Anatolia is in the book oftravels of Ibn Bauueua, who traveled in that region in the first half of the eighth/fourteenth century. Only Turks were found in this mystical professional organ-ization, which had the title Akhiyya-i fityAn, i.e. “Youth Fraternity.” Ibn Bauueuaencountered akhC lodges in various cities of Anatolia, first Antalya and then Burdur,Gölhisar, Ladik, Milas, Barçin, Konya, Nixde, Aksaray, Kayseri, Sivas, Gümüz, Erzin-can, Erzurum, Birgi, Tire, Manisa, Balıkesir, Bursa, Görele, Geyve, Yenice, Mudurnu,Bolu, Kastamonu, and Sinop – and also in the port of Azov, which was subject tothe Golden Horde – and he was their guest. He gives the following importantinformation about the akhCs with whom he thus had very close contact (Ibn Bauueua,{al-RiRla, Turkish} trans., pp. 372–3, {Gibb trans., vol. 2, pp. 419–20}): “They existin all the lands of the Turkmens of al-Rem, in every district, city, and village.Nowhere in the world are there to be found any to compare with them in solicitudefor strangers, and in ardour to serve food and satisfy wants, to restrain the hands ofthe tyrannous, and to kill the agents of police and those ruffians who joined withthem. An Akhc, in their idiom, is a man whom the assembled members of his trade,together with others of the young unmarried men and those who have adopted thecelibate life, choose to be their leader. That is [what is called] al-futuwwa also. TheAkhc builds a hospice and furnishes it with rugs, lamps, and what other equipment itrequires. His associates work during the day to gain their livelihood, and after theafternoon prayer they bring him their collective earnings; with this they buy fruit,food, and the other things needed for consumption in the hospice. If, during thatday, a traveler alights at the town, they give him lodging with them; what they havepurchased serves for their hospitality to him and he remains with them until hisdeparture. If no newcomer arrives, they assemble themselves to partake of the food,and after eating they sing and dance. On the morrow they disperse to their occupa-tions, and after the afternoon prayer they bring their collective earnings to theirleader. The members are called fityAn, and their leader, as we have said, is the Akhc.Nowhere in the world have I seen men more chivalrous in conduct than they are.”Afterwards, Ibn Bauueua describes the lodge in Antalya ({Turkish} trans., pp. 313 –14, {Gibb trans., vol. 2, pp. 420 –1}): “We found it to be a fine building, carpetedwith beautiful Remc rugs, and with a large number of lustres of Iraqi glass. In thechamber there were five [candelabra of the kind called] baisEs; this resembles acolumn of brass, having three feet and on top of it a kind of lamp, also of brass,in the centre of which is a tube for the wick. It is filled with melted grease, andalongside it are vessels of brass also filled with grease, in which are placed scissorsfor trimming the wicks. One of their company is put in charge of them; he is calledin their language the jarAjC {çıracı/çıraXcı?} Standing in rows in the chamber were anumber of young men wearing long cloaks, and with boots on their feet. Each one ofthem had a knife about two cubits long attached to a girdle round his waist, and ontheir heads were white bonnets of wool with a piece of stuff about a cubit long andtwo fingers broad attached to a peak of each bonnet. When they take their places inthe chamber, each one of them removes his bonnet and puts it down in front of him,but retains on his head another bonnet, an ornamental one, of silk taffeta or someother fabric. In the centre of their hall was a sort of platform placed there for visitors."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE236When we had taken our places among them, they brought in a great banquet, withfruits and sweetmeats, after which they began their singing and dancing. Everythingabout them filled us with admiration and we were greatly astonished at their gener-osity and innate nobility.” When Ibn Bauueua was in Ladik, there was some argumentbetween the associates of Akhc Sinan and Akhc ouman over which party he wouldlodge with first. Finally, it was decided to cast lots ({Turkish trans.,} p. 318, {Gibbtrans., vol. 2, p. 426}). Describing a Ramaqan procession of Sultan ynanç Beyin Ladik, this traveler gives the following information on the Akhc organization({Turkish trans.,} p. 320, {Gibb trans., vol. 2, pp. 427– 8}): “So we went out to themuTallA; the sultan also came out with his troops and the Young akhCs too, all of themfully armed. The members of each trade carried flags, trumpets, drums and fifes, allaiming to rival and outdo one another in magnificence and in perfection of theirweapons. Every group of these artisans would come out with cattle, sheep, and loadsof bread, and after slaughtering the animals in the cemetery give them away in alms,along with the bread. On coming out they went first to the cemetery, and from thereon to the muTallA.” Again the same traveler, telling us that he stayed in the lodgeof Akhc Amcr ‘Alc in Kayseri and describing its importance and wealth, clarifiessomewhat the political position of the akhCs ({Turkish trans.,} p. 326, {Gibb trans.,vol. 2, pp. 434}): “It is one of the customs in this land that in any part of it wherethere is no sultan, it is the Akhc who acts as governor; it is he who gives horsesand robes to the visitor and shows hospitality to him in the measure of his means,and his manner of command and prohibition and riding out {with a retinue} is thesame as that of the princes.” In like manner, he shows clearly the nature of therelations between Akhc Chelebi and Amcr ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Eretna, and the importance ofthe akhCs of Sivas ({Turkish trans.,} p. 327, {Gibb trans., vol. 2, pp. 434 –5}). Thefirst to collect Ibn Bauueua’s information on the akhCs was the Orientalist C. Defrémery({“Fragments de géographes et d’historiens arabes et persans inédits relatifs auxanciens peuples du Caucase et de la Russie méridionale,”} JA, 4th series, 16 [1850],68 –70). {See EI2, s.v. “Akhc” (Fr. Taeschner); Nezet Çaxatay, who tries to prove thatthe akhC organization was purely a Turkish institution, Bir Türk kurumu olan ahilik(Ankara, 1989).}40 This path of the futuwwa that the akhCs followed was, according to tradition, tracedback to ‘Alc and thus to the Prophet. The saying {No fatA (youth) except ‘Alc, no sword except Dhe ’l-Faqar}, which was attributedto the Prophet (H. Zotenberg, trans. of {Persian version of} al-oabarc, {as Chroniqued” Abou Djafer Mohammed b.

The personwho first turned the futuwwa into a code of behavior in this sense was the ‘Abbasidcaliph al-Natir li-Dcn Allah (575 – 622/1180 –1225), who according to {Ibnal-oiquaqa’s} KitAb al-fakhrC {published as Ta”rCkh al-duwal al-islAmiyya (Beirut, 1960),p. 322}, Abe ’l-Fida’ {MukhtaTar ta”rCkh al-bashar (Istanbul, 1286/1869–70), vol. 3,p. 142} and other sources was an Imamc Shc‘c. {This claim is, to say the least, ratherextreme. See Angelika Hartmann, an-NATir li-DCn AllAh (1180–1225): Politik, Religion,Kultur in der späten “AbbAsidenzeit (Berlin, 1975) and EI2, s.v. “al-Natir li-Dcn Allah”(Angelika Hartmann)}. This man, whose relations with the Khwarazmians and Seljuksof Anatolia I mentioned above, had long been especially addicted to fındık-endâzlık{pellet shooting}, which was a custom that had been adopted from the Persiansaround the end of the caliphate of ‘Uthman (Ibn al-Athcr, {al-KAmil,} vol. 3, p. 90).Around that time, {the practice of } this pellet shooting had spread considerably in"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE237Baghdad and was considered a kind of bravado. Participants had their ownspecial outfit and a distinctive kind of trousers. When al-Natir li-Dcn Allah becamecaliph, he gave great importance to this. He personally wore futuwwa trousers. Thus– like the freemasons, for example – in order to establish sincere and strong bondsamong the members of this professional fraternity, he ordered that those who didnot wear the futuwwa trousers and who did not drink from the futuwwa bowl wouldnot be able to do ramy bunduq, i.e. fındık-endâzlık {pellet shooting}. Having declaredhimself the patron saint of this UarCqa, he accepted whomever he wished. Thosewho attained this distinction were permitted to inscribe on their weapons the symbolof a bowl or a pair of trousers or both. In 607/1210 –11, this caliph wrote to theprinces and amCrs who recognized his caliphate and proposed that they wear thefutuwwa trousers, drink from the futuwwa bowl, and consider him the pCr in pelletshooting. Those who accepted went to Baghdad where they received from himtrousers to wear and futuwwa bowls from which to drink. The pellet shooters in Iraqand other places, like it or not, joined this UarCqa (Ibn al-Athcr, vol. 12, p. 202; Abe’l-Fida’, vol. 3., pp. 119, 142; Ibn Khalden, {KitAb al-“ibar, Turkish trans. SubhîPasha as Miftâh ül-iber (Istanbul, 1276/1859 – 60),} vol. 2, p. 535). According to {Ibn‘Inaba,} KitAb “umdat al-UAlib, after the death of al-Natir the position of head of thisUarCqa passed to another family, and al-Naqcb Taj al-Dcn Murammad from thatfamily began to wear the khirqa-i taTawwuf {nefc patched cloak} at the same time([ Bombay, 1318/1900 –1], p. 153). Ibn Jubair also mentions a group in Syriawho firmly opposed the Rafiqcs and fully observed the futuwwa oath that they hadsworn ({al-RiRla, ed. de Goeje,} 2nd edn {Leiden, 1907}, p. 280). Ibn Bauueua states({al-RiRla, Turkish trans.,} p. 322, {Gibb trans., vol. 2, p. 430}): “We lodged there{Konya} in the hospice of its qAQC, who is known as Ibn Qalam Shah; he is one ofthe FityAn, and his hospice is among the largest of its kind. He has a large body ofdisciples, and they have a chain of affiliation in the Futuwwa which goes back tothe Commander of the Faithful ‘Alc b. Abc oalib (God be pleased with him). The[distinctive] garment of the Futuwwa in their system is the trousers, just as the tefcswear the patched robe [as their distinctive dress].” Ahmed Âsım Efendi in {hisTurkish trans. of Murammad lusain Ibn Khalaf al-Tabrczc’s Persian lexicon}BurhAn-i qAUi“ {Istanbul, 1214/1799 –1800} defines futuwwa as follows: “It is usedfor anything worthy of admiration or admirable; it has wider application than wordand deed. It is used for anyone who is generous {mürüvvet} and public spirited {ehl-ihamiyyet}. Its application to the chiefs of the craftsmen is derived from this usage”(p. 67). There are important details about futuwwa in the manuals on nefism – likeal-Qushairc’s RisAla and {al-Sayyid al-Sharcf al-Jurjanc’s} Ta“rCfAt – and also in thefutuwwatnAmes. The violent actions of the members of the futuwwa in Syria againstthe Rafiqcs should not be attributed to their excessive attachment to the doctrines ofSunnism. Hatred and antagonism were endemic among all the groups that sprangfrom bauinism, even among the various sub-branches.

See, for example, Abdülbaki Gölpınarlı, “Les organisa-tions de la futuvvet dans les pays musulmans et turcs et ses origines,” Revue de laFaculté des Sciences Économiques de l’Université d’Istanbul, 11 (1949 –50), 5 – 49, and hislonger, “yslâm ve Türk illerinde fütüvvet tezkilâtı ve kaynakları,” Ystanbul ÜniversitesiYktisat Fakültesi Mecmuası, 11 (1949 –50 [1953] ), 3 –354; EI2, s.v. “Futuwwa” (Cl.

I thinkthat this {name} is nothing other than ören, which is mentioned as an altered form ofthe word viran in {al-Kashgharc’s} DCwAn lughAt al-turk. Consequently, it is not quitecorrect to read it as evren with a fatRa over the alif. According to all the early historicalsources, Akhc Ören was a prominent figure during the reign of Sultan Orhan {724 –61/1324 – 60}. [Fr. Taeschner, in his article “Akhc Ewran” in EI2, gives this name as“Akhc Evren” without commenting on any other pronunciation for it, but as is clearfrom the text above, Köprülü preferred to read it {incorrectly} as Akhc Ören.] {SeeMikâil Bayram, Ahi Evren ve ahi teZkilâtının kuruluZu (Konya, 1991), who places hisdeath between 658/1260 and 660/1262, pp. 97–101.}42 Such as Akhc lasan (pp. 29, 36), Akhc Qadam (p. 101), and Akhc Ya‘qeb (p. 101), forexample, in ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade, {TawArCkh}. Among them, we know that Akhc lasan,who had participated in the conquest of Bursa, had a tekke near the Bey Sarayı insidethe fortress of Bursa and held an important office at the time of Osman Ghazc’sdeath {724/1324}. Akhc Qadam and Akhc Ya‘qeb, who were akhCs in Bursa at thetime of the Düzme Mutuafa incident, saved that city in an appropriate manner fromhis attack {1421}. These points demonstrate that the state organization was still veryprimitive at that time and that the Akhc organization fulfilled its function to someextent. We also learn from {Tashköprü-Zade’s} al-ShaqA”iq that Akhc lasan hada zAwiya near the Dar al-Sa‘ada in Bursa and that he was a devotee {of God} andan ascetic (al-ShaqA”iq, {Turkish} trans., vol. 1, p. 23). We also know that amongthe shaikhs having the title Akhc was ‘Alc Mitrc, who was a murCd of Rukn al-Dcn ‘Ala’al-Dawla {al-Simnanc} and a notable figure in the eighth/fourteenth century amongthe shaikhs in Damascus and Anatolia ({ Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., p. 500).43 The source that provides the best information on the etiquette and rules of conductof the akhCs, and thus is most important for showing that they were bAUinCs, is {Yaryab. al-Khalcl’s} FutuwwatnAme {MS in Köprülü’s private library; ed. AbdülbâkiGölpınarlı as “Burgazi ve Fütüvvetnamesi,” Yktisat Fakültesi Mecmuası, 15 (1953 –5),76 –153; German trans. Fr. Taeschner in Zünfte und Bruderschaften im Islam, usingKöprülü’s MS}. The copy of the FutuwwatnAme that I studied with the assistance ofCevdet {the well-known Muallim Cevdet (Mehmet Cevdet ynançalp)}, a teacherin the Muallim Mektebi {Teachers’ College}, belongs to Mehmed Ârif, a member ofthe Tarih Encümeni {Historical Society}, and was written – probably before IbnBauueua – by Yarya b. al-Khalcl b. al-Chuban al-Yarya Fata ’l-Burghazc. He statesthat he was jAhil {unenlightened in faith} until age twenty-seven, and then tooklessons for a short time from Mawlana Khwaja Mutlir al-Dcn of Antalya. When theFranks captured Alexandria, they brought the books that they had acquired thereto Anatolia and sold them, including some books on futuwwa, which he bought{Alexandria was attacked several times during the Crusades, in 1154, 1167, and1174. Louis IX occupied nearby Damietta in 1249 and Peter I of Cyprus sackedAlexandria in 1365}. He recommends that this work, which he wrote on akhism, notbe shown to strangers. The author, who cites some passages from Mawlana andNatir-i Khusraw, also says that he quoted a number of works such as Salwat al-“ArifCn,{Ilyas al-Khartaburtc’s} TuRfat al-waTAyA, MusammA, ManAqib al-“ArifCn, Tadhkiratal-awliyA”, QalA”id, and AsrAr al-“ArifCn. Citing the TuRfat al-waTAyA, he states that thefutuwwa doctrine began with Salman Farisc, then passed to the Caliph al-Natir li-DcnAllah, and from him to Saladin. This information {in this book}, which can veryeasily be accorded with the material that I provided in n.40 in this chapter, revealsquite well the nature of akhism. In this book, it is stated that akhism had 740 rules ofetiquette that had been handed down from the time of Neshcrwan {i.e. Aneshirwan,"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE239the Sasanid ruler Khusraw I, 531–79 ce}, that the shaikhs knew them all, but it wasnecessary for the akhC to know only 124. In addition, citing the QalA”id, it is explainedthat there were two paths of the futuwwa – one deriving from ‘Alc and the other fromAbe Bakr – called Saifc and Qawlc. Then a lengthy description is given of theircustoms, ceremonies, and rules of conduct, their costume, the colors of their trousers,and their ranks. The members of the futuwwa were divided into {groups of } nine,six being arkAn {pillars} of the UarCqa and three being aTRAb {companions} of theUarCqa. Every novitiate had to retain two “brothers of the path” and also a “father ofthe path.” Many conditions had to be met in order to pass from one degree toanother, and each degree held different secrets. All of this strongly suggests the bAUinCcharacter of akhism. With respect to ceremonies and rules of conduct, we findBektashism and Qızılbashism, which differs very little from Bektashism, to be verysimilar to akhism. Consequently, in my view, it is not unlikely that around the end ofthe eighth/fourteenth century, the akhCs took the name Bektashc, ascribed their silsilato lajjc Bektash Veli, and traced it back to him. Even if this is not accepted, thebAUinC nature of akhism certainly cannot be denied. A thorough analysis of the varioussources that I have mentioned above on the futuwwa would thus, I believe, tend tosupport these hypotheses.44 The poet Gülsherc, in his translation of, and expansion upon, ‘Auuar’s ManUiq al-Uair,which he completed in 717/1317, asks one of the birds a question about the futuwwaand akhism, and then answers from the mouth of the hoopoe. According to him, thefirst principle of the akhCs is that they should be blameless, the second is that theirdining table should be open to all, and the third is that their doors should be opento all. Gülshehrc, who, in addition to these positive attributes, also lists a number ofnegative attributes, speaks of the need for akhCs to be very closely bound to theSharC“a, but he eventually complains at length that not even one in a thousand of hiscontemporary akhCs possessed these positive qualities (see the full description givenbelow on Gülshehrc and his work).45 [Köprülü planned to expound upon this idea of his in a separate monograph basedon the notes that he had collected on akhism over many years, and he announcedthis in the second edition of Early Mystics, but his untimely death prevented it.]Ahmed Tevhid published a short article on these Ankara akhCs and on akhism ingeneral ({“Ankarada ahiler hükûmeti,”} TOEM, no. 19 {1328/1910}, pp. 1200 – 4),but it is obvious that this study, which is based only on Ibn Bauueua and {AhmedRifat’s} Lughât-i ta”rîkhiyya ve jughrâfiyya {Istanbul, 1299/1881}, can have no greatimportance. However, the information on the Ankara akhCs that is cited from a scrollbrought from the Mosque of Akhc Sharaf al-Dcn in Ankara is worthy of note.According to it, lusam al-Dcn lusain Efendi, the father of Akhc Sharaf al-DcnMurammad, died in 695/1295 – 6 at the age of seventy and the silsilanAme of this mangoes as far back as ‘Alc. This supports the idea that the futuwwa code of behaviorderived from ‘Alc. Akhc Sharaf al-Dcn’s three sons, lusain, lasan, and Yesuf, andsome of the children and grandchildren of the first two, are mentioned in this scroll,but there is no other biographical information. Tevhid says that in the Il-Khanidperiod the internal affairs of Ankara were probably in the hands of the akhCs, and herejects the assertion that they were united against the Ottoman state, but he saysnothing about the form of government of their {city} state. I think the informationthat I provided above on the akhCs of Anatolia can clarify these matters. The reportsof Ibn Bauueua and ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade definitely show that the akhCs of Ankara shouldnot be viewed as constituting a state. The role they played in handing Ankara overto the Ottomans was the same as the one they played in Bursa during the DüzmeMutuafa affair, for they took upon themselves this task in places where there was nostate organization."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE24046 This summary is derived primarily from the works on the legendary deeds of thesaints by Sipahsalar {ManAqib} and Aflakc {ManAqib al-“ArifCn, French trans.

The Orientalist Nicholson published some selections, with English transla-tion, from { Jalal al-Dcn Remc’s} DCvAn-i Shamsi TabrCz, and in the introduction to thiswork provided some noteworthy information on the life and works of Mawlanaand the nefc path. Hüseyin Dâniz made a summary translation of this informationfor the section on Mawlana in his Ser-Âmedân-ı Suhan. Unfortunately Nicholson madeno use whatsoever of the most important sources, such as Sipahsalar, and he wascompletely ignorant of the mathnawCs of Suluan Walad, which contain many import-ant details on his father, and other sources. Indeed, in his book Nicholson did noteven touch on a great many important subjects that need thorough investigation,such as Mawlana’s great influence on Persian, Indian, and Turkish literature, theestablishment and development of the Mawlawc UarCqa, the ideas of subsequent gen-erations – i.e. poets, nefcs, and jurists – about Mawlana and the imitators of Mawlanain Persian and Turkish literature. In addition, because absolutely no research hasbeen done to date on the spiritual climate of Anatolia in the period when Mawlanaflourished, it is not yet possible to depict clearly his personality and influence. Thebibliography that Carra de Vaux gives for his article on Jalal al-Dcn Remc in EI1 isquite deficient {cf. EI2, s.v. “Djalal al-Dcn Remc” (A. Bausani)}. For example, hedoes not mention Nicholson’s work at all, nor can he even give sufficient informationon Mawlana’s works. Unfortunately, because this subject is beyond the scope ofmy book, I cannot provide here the Oriental sources concerning Mawlana, nor thevarious works in manuscript about him that have not been studied, nor even thebriefest account of his own works. [There is valuable information in YA, s.v. “CelâleddinRumî” (H. Ritter) on the life and works of Mawlana as well as on his bibliography.]{Publications on Remc have become something of a cottage industry. For an ideasee M.

According to him, Mawlana and his father were the Sayyid’smurCds. The Sayyid accompanied them on their journeys to Damascus and the lijaz,died in Damascus, and before his death advised them to go to the land of Rem(Dawlat-Shah, pp. 193 – 4). According to { Jamc’s} NafaRAt, however, the Sayyid wasa murCd of Suluan Baha’ al-Dcn Walad, a descendant of lusain and an inhabitant ofTirmidh. According to legend, he went to Konya on spiritual direction at the deathof his shaikh and provided spiritual guidance to Mawlana for nine years. He used tosay, “I gave my mystical state (RAl) to Shaikh nalar al-Dcn and my teaching (qAl)to Mawlana” {cf. Aflakc, ManAqib, O’Kane trans., p. 491}. His tomb is in Kayseri(NafaRAt, {Turkish trans.,} pp. 515–16). The passages on the Sayyid Burhan al-Dcnin Sipahsalar’s book of legends {ManAqib} confirm the NafaRAt. According to thatwork, when the Sayyid learned of the death of his shaikh he spent a year in mourn-ing. Afterwards, he saw Suluan al-‘Ulama’ {Mawlana’s father} in a dream and on hisdirection went to Konya and took upon himself Mawlana’s spiritual training. Thisbeing the case, one could surmise that the Sayyid Burhan al-Dcn went to Konyaaround 629 –30/1231–2 and was with Mawlana until about 640/1242–3 (Sipahsalar,{Turkish} trans., pp. 159 – 64)."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE24148 The accounts in { Jamc’s} NafaRAt and Sipahsalar’s {ManAqib} on the manner andnature of this meeting are basically very similar. According to the NafaRAt, Shamsstayed at the Sugar Sprinklers’ Inn. Mawlana left his madrasa accompanied by agroup and, while passing that place, he {Shams} caught his donkey and asked “Whois greater, Bayezid {i.e. Abe Yazcd Bistamc} or Murammad?” According to Sipahsalar,Shams stayed at the Rice Dealers’ Inn. In the morning, as he sat on the bench infront of the inn, Mawlana came by and sat opposite him. He then answered Shams’squestions. There are lengthy accounts in both of these sources on these questionsand answers (NafaRAt, {Turkish trans.,} p. 521; ManAqib, {Turkish trans.,} p. 170).Abe Yazcd, who said {“Glory be to me! Howgreat is my majesty!” and “I am the Sultan of Sultans”}, quenched his thirst withone gulp; thus he spoke of being sated {cf. Aflakc, ManAqib, O’Kane trans., p. 425}.The Prophet, on the other hand, who said {“We have notknown you as you ought to be known”}. His blessed heart, which was as vast asGod’s earth, had been expanded according to the Koranic verse {“Have we not expanded your heart for you?”}; thus he was never sated with water,and so {he spoke of being thirsty, and} every day he wished to come closer to God.Discussing the meeting of these two lovers of God, Suluan Walad compared them totwo seas embracing each other between pounding waves.49 Neither { Jamc’s} NafaRAt nor Sipahsalar’s {ManAqib} say anything about Shamsal-Dcn Murammad b. ‘Alc b. Malik-dad al-Tabrczc. Only Dawlat-Shah providessome information on this subject, which he took from different sources. According tohim, Shams Tabrczc was the son of Khwand Jalal al-Dcn, a descendant of KiyaBuzurg Umcd, an Isma‘clc dA“C {propagandist} – he was no ordinary dA“C, however,but the successor of lasan al-nabar (Dozy, Essai sur l’histoire de l’Islamisme, Turkishtrans., vol. 2, p. 403; Hammer-Purgstall, Geschichte der Assasinen {Stuttgart, 1818},French trans., J. Hellert {as Histoire de l’ordre des assasins} [Paris, 1833], p. 114; StGuyard, “Fragments relatifs à la doctrine des ismaélis,” Notices et Extraits {des Manuscritsde la Bibliothèque Nationale, 22, i (1874),} p. 8 {sic, the article is on pp. 177–428}). Thisman reportedly did not accept the things in which his ancestors had believed, burnedthe books and treatises about the Isma‘clc heretics, and sent his son Shams secretly toTabrcz so that he would be taught the Islamic sciences. While still a child, Shamswas renowned for his exceptional beauty and he learned embroidering from thewomen of Tabrcz. The author { Jamc} of Silsilat al-dhahab {Bombay, 1289/1872–3}disagrees with this, however, and says that Shams Tabrczc was not the son of KhwandJalal al-Dcn, who had the byname Naw-Musulman, but was the son of a clothmerchant from Tabrcz – or, according to another report, a cloth merchant fromthe province of Ba-zer in Khurasan who had gone to Tabrcz to trade – and was bornin Tabrcz. Dawlat-Shah, saying{Wherever he may be from, deeds are judged by meaning not by form, and mysticaldiscernment lies in knowing the world of spirits not in producing bodies}, refrainsfrom advancing any definite opinion on this matter ({Tadhkira,} p. 195). At the endof the edition of { Jalal al-Dcn Remc’s} KulliyyAt-i Shams-i TabrCz that was published inIndia {Lucknow, 1302/1885}, there is a simple biography that merely repeats theaccount in the NafaRAt and a death date cited from {Lahawrc’s} KhazCnat al-aTfiyA”,which also tells us little."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE24250 According to Dawlat-Shah, he was the murCd of Rukn al-Dcn Sinjabc (Tadhkira,p. 196). The relational name {i.e. nisba} of this shaikh was not, however, as Prof.Browne has reported, Sinjabc, but Sinjasc, as all the other sources unanimously state.Nicholson records this name correctly and also includes in his work verbatim thesilsilatnAme of the UarCqa that Dawlat-Shah mentions. Reportedly, Rukn al-Dcn hadordered him to go to Anatolia and inspired him with the fire of love for a theologicalstudent there, i.e. Mawlana. According to { Jamc’s} NafaRAt, even before puberty,Shams had fasted for days for the love of Murammad. According to a widely knownreport, he became a mystic through {the teachings of } Shaikh Abe Bakr Selabaf{the garment maker} Tabrczc, or, according to another report, through Rukn al-DcnSinjasc, or, according to another report, through Baba Kamal Jandc. The mostreasonable theory, as the author of the NafaRAt also acknowledges, is that this wellknown dervish met each one of them separately (NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., p. 520).51 { Jamc’s} NafaRAt records the following incident that occurred while he was in thecompany of Baba Kamal: Her keZf-ü feth ki {eyh Fahre”d-Dîn “Irâkî”ye yüz gösterirdi, ânınazm ve nesr libâsında izhâr ederdi ve Baba Kemâl”in nazarına eriZtirirdi. {eyh {emse”d-Dînândan hiç nesne izhâr etmezdi.

Shaikh Shams al-Dcn neverrevealed anything. One day Baba Kamal said to him, “My son Shams al-Dcn, doesnothing ever occur to you of those secrets and truths that my son Fakhr al-Dcnreveals?” He replied: “Even more than him. But because he knows the rightterminology, he is able to clothe them in a lovely dress. I do not have that capacity.”Baba Kamal said, “May God provide you with a companion who will reveal in yourname (i.e. under your auspices) the teachings and truths of the ancients and themoderns, may the rivers of wisdom flow from his heart to his tongue and enter thegarb of letters and sounds, and may the UirAz {embroidery} of that garb be in yourname”} (NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., pp. 520–1). { Jamc’s source for this story was, infact, the JawAhir al-asrAr of lusain Khwarazmc, the fifteenth-century shaikh in thelineage of Baba Kamal Jandc. See the edition by Murammad Javad Sharc‘at (Isfahan,1360/1981), p. 131.} As will be seen below, Mawlana’s creation of DCwAn-i Shamsal-RaqA”iq was attributed to this miracle and prayer of Baba Kamal.52 Nicholson describes his personality in the following manner: “He was comparativelyilliterate, but his tremendous spiritual enthusiasm, based on the conviction thathe was a chosen organ and mouth-piece of Diety, cast a spell over all who enteredthe enchanted circle of his power. In this respect, as in many others, for example,in his strong passions, his poverty, and his violent death, Shamsi Tabrcz curiouslyresembles Socrates; both imposed themselves upon men of genius, who gave theircrude ideas artistic expression; both proclaim the futility of external knowledge, theneed of illumination, the value of love” (DCvAni Shamsi TabrCz, p. xx).53 According to an exceptionally widespread report, Shams Tabrczc’s death occurredin a very horrible manner. And the manAqib books add to it a mysterious twist. Onenight while Shams was sitting with Mawlana, someone called him outside. Shamswent out, saying that they were summoning him to be killed. An ambush awaitedoutside {the original says: Seven people had conspired and had laid an ambush}.They were about to kill him by attacking him with knives.

One night he appeared to Suluan Walad in a dream and told himwhere he could be found. So he went in the middle of the night with his intimatecompanions and buried him next to Amcr Badr al-Dcn, who had built Mawlana’smadrasa ({Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., p. 523). It is recorded in Sipahsalar,however, that he suddenly disappeared and that Mawlana even went as far asDamascus to search for him ({ManAqib,} p. 179). Dawlat-Shah also says that hewithdrew to Damascus from Konya ({Tadhkira,} p. 197). When we take into con-sideration Mawlana’s search, and the fact that there is absolutely nothing about thisterrible murder in Sipahsalar, which is a very trustworthy source on these matters,then the account of the NafaRAt, according to which he was murdered, becomes verydubious. Therefore, in my opinion, Nicholson’s acceptance of the account of theNafaRAt is mistaken. If he had seen Sipahsalar and if he had known that Mawlanahad searched for Shams after his disappearance, he could not have concluded thatShams was murdered. Evliya Chelebi says that he visited the head of Shams Tabrczcin Khey {in Iranian Azerbaijan} (SeyARatnAme, Book 2, fo. 307b).54 Dancing and whirling {samA“}, which were strictly forbidden to ordinary people whogave in to their carnal appetites, were always regarded as permissible to “Ashıqs andnefcs. Indeed, many treatises were written on this subject. Many of the great nefcs, inresponse to a need that arose from their spirit, practiced the samA“ and considered itto be a means of reaching mystical ecstasy. For example, Yesuf b. al-lusain, whomthe jurists of Rayy accused of being a heretic, used to perform the samA“. The greatnefc poet Shaikh Abe Sa‘cd Ibn Abc ’l-Khair was a frequent practitioner of the samA“.During that time, he would be carried away by mystical ecstasy and tear apart hisclothing. Shaikh Najm al-Dcn Kubra first denounced the samA“, but later became afrequent practitioner of it. Shaikh Majd al-Dcn Baghdadc also did the samA“. Thegreat nefc contemporaries of Mawlana, such as nadr al-Dcn al-Qenawc and Sa‘dal-Dcn al-lammeyc, did the samA“ as well ({ Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., pp. 378,385, 402, 478, 483, 486). Mawlana began the samA“ instructed by Shams Tabrczc andcontinued to practice it for the rest of his life. Indeed, he adopted the samA“ as areligious ceremony and {part of } the mystical path. There are many passages inMawlana’s poetry to the effect that “the samA“ is the nourishment of the lovers thatallows one to imagine union with the Beloved,” and others regarding the rules andconduct of the samA“. A chapter in Sipahsalar’s book of nefc legends is devoted toa description of the true samA“, its rules and conduct ({ManAqib,} pp. 91–5). Whilemany religious scholars have declared the nefc samA“ to be permissible and haveadvocated it, others up to the present time have persistently considered it to beforbidden.55 The following couplets, which are very significant, are found in one of the ghazalsthat Mawlana sent to Damascus (Sipahsalar, {ManAqib, Turkish} trans., p. 174):"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE244{Without your presence, samA“ is not lawful.Joy, like satan, has become the victim of stoning.Without you, not one ghazal has been utteredThat attains the dignity of understanding.So, for the pleasure of hearing (samA“) your nameSome five or six ghazals have been composed.May the night (Sham) be illuminated with the light of dawn,Oh you who are the source of pride for Damascus (Sham) andArmenia and Rem (cf. Aflakc, ManAqib, O’Kane trans. pp. 488 –9).}56 Sipahsalar, {ManAqib, Turkish} trans., p. 179. Dawlat-Shah says nothing in his Tadhkiraabout Mawlana going to Damascus, p. 197:{At this juncture Shams al-Dcn had to go to Damascus, where he remained for twoyears, during which Mawlana burned with desire for him. He ordered the musiciansto compose love songs, and night and day he engaged in samA“. Most of the ghazalscontained in Mawlana’s dCwAn were composed in separation from Shams al-Dcn. It issaid that Mawlana’s house had a column, and whenever he was drowned in the seaof love, he would grasp that column and turn round about it, reciting poems withgreat excitement, and others would write those poems down.}57 These poems, today collected under the title DCwAn-i Shams al-RaqA”iq, were composedin different periods. Nicholson is correct in believing that a large number werewritten after the departure of Shams. Hüseyin Dâniz writes that Dawlat-Shah statesthat they were written in Damascus after Shams had disappeared (Ser-Âmedân-ı-Suhan, p. 343), but this is completely mistaken, for he cites verbatim the passage ofDawlat-Shah on this matter, which is given above in the previous note. Dawlat-Shahsays that Mawlana wrote most of the ghazals in the DCwAn after Shams went toDamascus for the last time, and this is also what Nicholson claims. {These collectedpoems are known under several titles. See the bibliography.}58 Even in the brief forward that he wrote to the DCvAni Shamsi TabrCz, Nicholson showsquite clearly and categorically the major relationships between Mawlana’s nefc viewsand Neoplatonist ideas. This ancient philosophical system, which based the questionof takwCn {creation} on love {“ishq} and was in harmony with Pantheism, was nodifferent from the principles taught by Jalal al-Dcn Remc. This is fairly well describedin E. J. W. Gibb’s History of Ottoman Poetry {vol. 1, Chapter 2}. While discussingbelow the nefc ideas of Yenus Emre and the overwhelming similarity between hisworks and those of Mawlana, I will give a brief account of Neoplatonist thought,which constitutes, in fact, the basis of our nefc literature.59 Such an endeavor, which would lay the foundation for a strictly philosophical study,would be extremely important and very useful with respect to literary history, but it"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE245is outside my field and belongs to specialists in Islamic philosophy. The brief notesgiven below do not even form the basis for such an effort.60 One day Mawlana was passing in front of the jewelry shops in Konya. While passingbefore the shop of nalar al-Dcn, he became exalted with the rhythm of the hammerand began the samA“. He then recited a poem that began with the following verse:{A treasure has appeared in that gold-beater’s shop. / Such form! Such essence! Ohbeauty! Such beauty! (Aflakc, ManAqib, O’Kane trans. p. 495).} As soon as he real-ized what was happening, nalar al-Dcn continued to strike his hammer withoutthinking about the damage he was doing to the gold that he was beating. A littlelater, he left his shop on Mawlana’s invitation and offered him his services (Sipahsalar,{ManAqib, Turkish} trans., p. 181; { Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., p. 523). Weknow that nalar al-Dcn had already attached himself to Mawlana before Shamsarrived (Sipahsalar, ManAqib, p. 171). And after the departure of Shams, Mawlanaadopted nalar al-Dcn as his companion and assuaged his grief with him. SuluanWalad describes at length how Mawlana valued and respected him and, indeed, howthe other murCds were jealous of him:{When that mystic Shaikh saw nalar al-DcnHe chose him from among the ranks of saints.Turned his face towards him, put all else aside,Reckoned all others in error, in the wrong.“That Shams-i Dcn of whom we always spokeHas come back to us! Why do we slumber?”...Because of him the Shaikh’s agitation was stilled.All the pain of talk and gossip was stilled.The Shaikh was with him as he had been with that king,Shams-i Tabrcz, just as God’s intimate friend.They mingled pleasantly, like milk and sugar.They made gold out of one another. (Cf. Lewis, Rumi, p. 206.)}61 On the occasion of his death, Mawlana recited a ghazal that began with the followingverse (Sipahsalar, {ManAqib, Turkish trans.,} p. 189):"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE246{Oh you at whose departure the heavens wept in pain! / The heart wallowed inblood, while mind and soul wept. (Ed. Furezanfar, no. 2364. See Aflakc, ManAqib,O’Kane trans. p. 510.)} Furthermore, in {Mawlana’s} DCwAn-i kabCr, there are manyghazals that are addressed to him or that describe his exalted spiritual rank, such asthe ghazals that include the following couplets:{You have made the gold-beaters’ work golden, golden,Oh king, nalar al-Dcn, you are (worth) a hundred men....Because nalar al-Dcn is the well-being (TalAR) of our soulReveal that well-being of souls....nalar al-laqq wa ’l-Dcn shows to youThe beauty of the King of Kings, our Sultan....The face of that Turk is surely the well-being of heart and religion.Rub your eyes and see the face of the heart, the face of the heart....That is the king, nalar al-Dcn, may he live forever!May his hand of favor always be a necklace on my neck.}62 Dawlat-Shah, {Tadhkira,} p. 195, states that Mawlana Jalal al-Dcn Remc receivedthe khirqa-i sulEk {patched cloak of his order} through several intermediaries fromShaikh al-Shuyekh nalar al-Dcn Zarkeb who was associated with kiya’ al-Dcn Abe’l-Najcb al-Suhrawardc, but this is completely mistaken.63 The Sayyid Abe ’l-Wafa-yi Baghdadc, who died in 501/1107– 8 and was known bythe byname Taj al-‘frifcn, was a very great nefc. For information on him, one can"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE247consult the famous work ManAqib-i TAj al-“FrifCn (MS in my private library). Sipahsalar,who is the most credible source on this matter, says, {ManAqib, Turkish trans.,}p. 191, that Chelebi lusam al-Dcn was a descendant of this shaikh. The same sourceis cited in this regard in { Jamc’s} NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., p. 525. {On Baghdadc,see Alya Krupp, Studien zum MenAqybnAme des Abu l-WafA” TAX al-“FrifCn, part 1, Dashistorische Leben des Abu l-WafA” TAX al-“FrifCn (Munich, 1976).}64 Hüseyin Dâniz provides the following information on this without naming the source:“It has not been determined exactly when the MathnawC began to be written. It iscomposed of six large sections and a total of 2666 couplets {sic, probably 12,666couplets or 26,000 verses}. The second section began to be composed two years afterthe completion of the first, i.e. in 1263 ce However, because lasan lusam al-Dcn,Jalal al-Dcn’s excellent student, who was preoccupied with writing the MathnawCdirectly from his master’s dictation, died at that time, the task of writing this workwas interrupted” (Ser-Âmedân-ı Suhan, p. 342). As for the number of couplets in theMathnawC, Dawlat-Shah says ({Tadhkira,} p. 197):{They say that the MathnawC contains 48,000 couplets. Some say more, some less},but this is an exaggeration. I cannot go into detail here on the question of theseventh volume of the MathnawC, which did not belong to Mawlana but was laterattributed to him. Let me simply state here that Hüseyin Dâniz’s attempt to showthat Chelebi lusam al-Dcn died after finishing the first volume of the MathnawC doesnot conform to any of the historical sources and is a very serious mistake. The onewho died was his wife. The death of Chelebi lusam al-Dcn was actually twelve yearsafter that of Mawlana.65 In India, Iran, and Turkey, where Persian culture was very widespread, the MathnawChad an almost sacred character. The opinion that it was “the heart of the Koran”{maghz-i Qur”An} is quite old. Indeed, Mawlana’s DCwAn, like that of lafiv, was usedfor telling fortunes ({Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., p. 423). If all the differentassessments and views that have been presented of the MathnawC since a very earlytime were collected, they would form a rather long treatise. It is claimed that thiswork has not had a direct influence on the great mass of the Turkish people and thatits influence has been confined to the Mawlawcs and those under the spell of Persianliterature, but its indirect influence on the great mass of the Turkish people has, infact, been much greater than has been thought.66 This spiritual influence, which began with Gülshehrc, took very clear form with‘fshıq Pasha. The latter’s GharCbnAme, which is very famous among the Turks, isvirtually a Turkish MathnawC. As for Yenus Emre, the influence of the DCwAn-i Shamsal-RaqA”iq is much more striking.67 I have discussed above, citing his FChi mA fCh, why and for what purpose Mawlanawrote poetry (see n.33 of this chapter). Mawlana distinguished himself from ordinarypoets with such laments as{What is poetry to me that I should boast of it? I have another art, different from thearts of the poet} and"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE248{What have I to do with poetry? But it breathes within me.When a Turk comes along, he says to me, Hey kim sen “Hey who areyou?”Who is Turk, who Tajik? Who is Remc, who Zangc?Who knows the Kingship, hair by hair, hidden and manifest?}Suluan Walad put forth an excellent and quite correct opinion of the poetry ofMawlana: “The “Ashıq, i.e. the true nefc, and the poet are distinct from each other.The Koranic dictum {26:224} {As for the poets: the erringfollow them} concerns the latter, for while the poetry of the “Ashıq is a commentaryon the words of God, that of the poet is like the odor of garlic. The poetry of the“Ashıq is the result of wonder and intoxication {with the love of God}, but that ofthe poet is the product of the self.” In various poems, Mawlana requests from Godthe tongue of RAl {mystical state} and opposes the tongue of qAl {speech of thereligious scholars}:{This talk of mine is a curtain covering my inner states.What a disgrace: the rose-garden of conscience comes from my thorn-like thoughts.Oh Lord, give my soul a fluent tongue other than this tongue,So that in cutting through to union with Your oneness, my zunnAr(Christian belt) will break off.One day I shall go outside myself, go beyond good and evil;I shall utter the attributes of that Eternal One in the storehouse of myheart, without speech.}Ziya Pasha’s saying, {âir dimen öyle ehl-i hâle / Yrâs-i nakîsedir kemâl”e {Don’t call amystic a poet / That is to attribute imperfection to perfection} in the KharAbAt {hisHarâbât (Istanbul, 1291–2/1874)}, results from such ideas. In order to understandbetter this difference between the works of ordinary poets and the poetry of nefcs, seethe section below on the poetry of Yenus Emre.68 In many places in the MathnawC, lakcm Sana’c and, to a lesser degree, ‘Auuar arementioned. There are also a great many allusions to them in the DCwAn. Mawlanaconsidered himself to be a follower of Sana’c and ‘Auuar. In his works, especially inthe MathnawC, their influence is strikingly obvious.69 Chelebi lusam al-Dcn, who, while Mawlana was still alive, was his khalCfa for nineyears, died in 684/1285 –6 (Sipahsalar, {ManAqib, Turkish trans.,} pp. 197–201). Ifwe consider that the arrangement of the MathnawC was begun in 662, then we mustalso push back Chelebi lusam al-Dcn’s career as a khalCfa to Mawlana to that date.Chelebi lusam al-Dcn’s being instructed to begin recording the MathnawC must haveoccurred after he became a khalCfa of Mawlana. If we consider that the period duringwhich he served as a khalCfa was between 662 and 672, then it appears that 662 mustbe the date when he began the MathnawC, for this cannot be regarded as the begin-ning date of the second volume. Consequently, Hüseyin Dâniz’s statement {in hisSer-Âmedân-ı Suhan} that 662, which corresponds to 1263 – 4, must be regarded as the"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE249beginning date of the second volume and that the first book was completed in 660,i.e. 1261–2, is evidently mistaken. It is for this reason that I stated above that thisgreat book was written within a period of seven or eight years. Dawlat-Shah believesthat Ibn Akhc Turk and Chelebi lusam al-Dcn were two different persons and saysthat Mawlana “dest-i irâdeti Çelebî”nin dâmen-i terbiyetine vurduXunu” {applied the hand ofwill power to the skirt of Chelebi’s training} ({Tadhkira,} p. 195). The historical factsgiven above suffice to confirm the error of these two claims.70 Extensive information can be found in Dawlat-Shah {Tadhkira}, { Jamc’s} NafaRAt,{Turkish} trans., and in various other sources on these personalities, who occupyan important place in Persian nefc literature because of their poems imbued withmystical excitement. It is beyond the scope of my work to treat in detail all of thesenefcs who possess dCwAns, some of which have been published.71 One day they asked nadr al-Dcn al-Qenawc his opinion of Mawlana. He replied,“Bâyezîd ve Cüneyd bu zamânda olsalardı, bu merdler merdinin gâZiyesini görtürmeyi cânlarınaminnet bilirlerdi” {If Abe Yazcd and Junaid were alive, they would realize that to carrythe horse blanket of this excellent man would bestow a blessing on their souls}({ Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish trans.,} p. 520). Similar examples could fill many pages.72 Hüseyin Dâniz mentions the existence of FChi mA fCh, based on Nicholson’s account,and then says, “This work must be rather rare today” (Ser-Âmedân-ı Suhan, p. 343).Carra de Vaux says that this work was completely unknown in Iran, EI1, s.v. “Djalalal-Dcn Remc.” However, this small work is quite famous among the Mawlawcs inIstanbul. There are manuscript copies of it in our public libraries and in privatehands. {Ed. Badc‘ al-Zaman Furezanfar (Tehran, 1338 sh./1959), English trans.A. J. Arberry as Discourses of Rumi (London, 1961), and Thackston as Signs of theUnseen: The Discourses of Jalaluddin Rumi (Putney, VT, 1994).}73 It is quite clear from the statements of al-Kashgharc on this matter that some workswere written in the Oghuz dialect before the Turks came to Anatolia. The idea thatthere were two separate dialects called Seljuk Turkish and Ottoman Turkish has nohistorical or linguistic basis. There is no need to mention here the useless informa-tion of the nineteenth-century Orientalists on this matter because work like theirs isnot even worthy of scholarly criticism. Nevertheless, because the Hungarian Orien-talist Jozef Thúry has recently advanced extremely erroneous views on this import-ant problem, let me use him as an example to show briefly how poorly our linguistichistory has been studied to date. According to Thúry, “The most important massesof Turks who came to Anatolia were the Seljuks in the second half of the eleventhcentury and the Qayı in the first half of the thirteenth century. Because they wereboth from the Oghuz, there was a close blood and linguistic relationship betweenthem. The Seljuks were not, however, a distinct ethnic group. They were composedof a number of ethnic groups who had broken away and come from different linguisticregions in various places in Central Asia” (“Ondördüncü ‘asır sonlarına kadar Türkdili yâdıgârları,” pp. 100 –2). I have adequately discussed above the emigration ofthe Turks to Anatolia, so the erroneousness of this assertion is obvious. The mass ofthe Turks in Anatolia were composed of Oghuz, i.e. Turkmen. The migration of theQayı and their role in founding the Ottoman state are only of significance from apolitical perspective, not because they brought to Anatolia an ethnic block whospoke a different dialect – for their number was extremely limited and their dialectwas also that of the Turkmen. The aforesaid article by Thúry contains, from begin-ning to end, mistaken conclusions derived from very defective and very erroneousanalyses.74 Bauual Ghazc was a legendary Turkish hero who, according to legend, was namedAbe Murammad Ja‘far b. Suluan lusain b. Rabc‘ b. ‘Abbas al-Hashimc, was born inMalatya, and lived 900 years ago. Al-oabarc, however, mentions a historical figure"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE250named ‘Abd Allah al-Bauual who died a martyr in 122/739 – 40. Janabc and Hezarfencarelessly confuse these two accounts, i.e. the legendary with the historical. EvenHalil Edhem, citing {Yaqet’s} Mu“jam al-buldAn, vol. 8, p. 195, is not able to escapethis error, which was also shared by Katib Chelebi and Evliya Chelebi (Kayseriye Zehri{Istanbul, 1334/1915 –16}, p. 131). The legend of Bauual Ghazc, which had both anheroic and religious quality, lay behind the creation of many works about him{BaUUAlnAmes}, both in verse and in prose, since the earliest period of the Seljuks.Thus, the Orientalist H. Ethé quite rightly asserts that, basically, this work waswritten to prepare soldiers for the conquest of Anatolia. Whoever originally wrote it,and for whatever purpose, this work, which reflects the shared feelings of the Turksin those days, won great fame among the common people. Indeed, it spread as far aseastern Turkistan where there are a number of legends about this legendary hero;even his tomb is to be found there, in Aksu. According to legend there, Bauual Ghazcwas the fourth grandson of Murammad Ibn al-lanafiyya – who in fact died inMedina in 81/700 –1 and was buried in Baqc‘ – and was known by the name Imam‘Abd al-Rarman ‘Alawc (Ta”rCkh-i SairAmC {i.e. Mulla Mesa b. Mulla ‘hsa Sairamc’sTa”rCkh-i amanCyya (Kazan, 1905),} p. 254). This important subject, about which weTurks have not yet done any research, was first studied in detail by H. Fleischer(Kleinere Schriften {Leipzig, 1885 – 8} vol. 3, pp. 226ff.). Ethé later translated thislegend into German (Die Fahrten des Sajjid Batthâl [Leipzig, 1871]). There is alsoimportant information on this in the ZDMG {i.e. A. D. Mordtmann’s “Die Dynastieder Danischmende,”} 30 {1876}, pp. 468 –9; and Georg Hüsing’s work {Beiträge}zurRostahmsage (Sajjid Battâl) (Leipzig, 1913), is worthy of note. Yet, despite all thesestudies, it cannot be claimed that this subject has been adequately investigated.What is certain is that the legend was first written down at the time of the Seljuks.The tomb attributed to the famous Sayyid Bauual Ghazc south of Eskizehir is greatlyvenerated in that region and a Bektashc tekke, mosque, and soup kitchen are alsofound nearby (see EI1, s.v. “Bauual” [editors]). There are important details in EvliyaChelebi on Bauual Ghazc (SeyARatnAme, Book 3, fo. 7a, Book 4, fos 192b, 196a) and Ihave collected extensive information from various sources for the analytical workthat I am preparing on the Bektashcs and abdAls, on his place among the Bektashcsand, especially, the abdAls, and on the history of the Sayyid Ghazc Tekke. For now,see my article “Abdal” in Türk halk edebiyatı ansiklopedisi (Istanbul, 1935). [For addi-tional material and bibliographical information on both the historical and legendaryfigures of the Sayyid Bauual, as well as on other related matters, see YA, s.v. “Battal”(Pertev N. Boratav), and EI2, s.v. “al-Bauual” (M. Canard and I. Mélikoff ).] {ForEnglish trans. and Turkish transcription of the legend of Bauual Ghazc, see Y. Dedes,Battalname (Cambridge, MA, 1996).

It would bebeyond our subject to go into further detail on this matter here.76 “Afterward the governing council was established. Because all records and ordershad been written in Persian, Turkish had almost disappeared. Consequently, alldocuments that were to be read in the council were to be in Turkish and conversingin other languages was strictly forbidden. Because the registers and other accountbooks had been written up to that time in Arabic and Persian, Turkish was writtenwith difficulty and everyone who wrote in the registers used a different spelling”(Hayrullâh Efendi, Tarih-i âl-i osmân, vol. 1, p. 110). It is very uncertain how long thisimportant action, which occurred after the Qaramanids took de facto control ofKonya on 10 Dhe ’l-lijja 676/May 5, 1278, remained in effect. Nevertheless, thisevent is enough to show that Turkish had reached a level of development whereby itcould replace Persian and Arabic as the official language of that period. This eventalso definitely confirms that works were produced in Turkish in Anatolia since thevery first arrival of the Seljuks. {Köprülü implies that Persian was the language ofinstruction in the madrasas, but provides no evidence of this. Traditionally Arabic wasthe language of instruction in these schools of Islamic law. All the major relevanttexts were in that language. Cf. his note 87 below.}77 The poet Gülshehrc recounts at length {ManUiq al-Uair, facsimile edn [Ankara, 1957],p. 51, and MSS in the Istanbul Archeology Museum Library and the Hâlis EfendiLibrary in the Süleymaniye in Istanbul} the famous story of Shaikh nan‘an underthe heading DAsitAn-i “Abd al-RazzAq in the first part of his work and at the end of ithe states:Bir kiZi bu dâstânı eylemiZYlla lafzın gey çepürdük söylemiZVezniçün lafzın gidermiZ harfınıArtuk eksük söylemiZ söz sarfını{imdi GülZehrî giyürdi bu ayaLefgerî tonlar ki benzedi bayaAnber ile saçın ördi sünbülünGönlegin atlasdan eyledi gülünSöz hurûfın artuk eksük kılmadıÂlim anladı vü câhil bilmediTanrı”nun kudretlerin yâd eylediMustafâ”nun cânını Zâd eylediBöyle rengîn böyle datlu böyle terHusrev-û {îrîn sözü oldı meXer.{Someone told this story,but made the words very complicatedHe left out letters for the sake of the meter,and added or subtracted word endings.Now Gülshehrc has clothed this moonin Livorno (?) garments, so it resembles a rich man.He plaited the hyacinth’s locks with ambergris,and made the rose’s dress out of satin."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE252He did not add or subtract letters.The wise understood, the foolish did not know.He recalled God’s powersand gladdened Murammad’s soul.His words have such color, such taste, such freshness,that they might very well be Khusraw and Shcrcn.}It is evident from this that before Gülshehrc, i.e. in the sixth/twelfth or seventh/thirteenth century, a poet had written about this subject in verse, but because hislanguage was coarse and primitive and his use of meter was naturally very defective,Gülshehrc felt it necessary to rewrite it. This information is of historical value inshowing that the “arEQ meters had begun to be used by the Turks of Anatolia muchearlier than has been thought, and in showing how old subjects were taken up againby later poets.78 There are some fragments of poetry in Greek and Turkish in Mawlana’s DCwAn-ikabCr, {the latter} are not of a quality or quantity that would permit us to considerhim a Turkish poet. Some of these fragments, which are mainly macaronic{mulamma“}, sometimes satirical, and occasionally consist of complete passages, wereincluded in Necib Âsım’s Türk tarihi {Istanbul, 1316/1898 –9}, pp. 439 – 42, citinga treatise by Veled Chelebi. In addition, two lines of poetry not found there appearin Fâik Rezad’s book, Tarih-i edebiyat-ı osmâniyye {Istanbul, 1329/1911}, p. 30. TheTurkish passages from Mawlana, however, do not consist of { just} these fragments.Moreover, there are even great differences in the form in which they appear indifferent copies of the DCwAn. The publication of the requisite commentary on, andexplanation of, this poetry by Veled Chelebi, who has a truly profound knowledgeof this subject, is awaited with great anticipation {see [erefeddin ( Yaltkaya),“Mevlânâ’da türkçe kelimeler ve türkçe ziirler,” TM, 4 (1934), 111– 67}. Ziya Pashadid not mention Mawlana as a Turkish poet, and Namık Kemal in his Tahrîb-iharâbât {Istanbul, 1301/1883 –4 and again in 1304/1886 –7} found fault with this,but Namık Kemal’s judgment is not altogether correct. In order to give an idea ofthis poetry and the variants found in the manuscripts, I can cite verbatim from anold anthology another version of a ghazal in the Türk tarihi {Turkish words underlined}:{It means that I in the world, I only love you. If you do not want me, stillI love you.On the day of thirst, I want to be alone at your side.You’ll drink a full goblet and I’ll play the kopuz."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE253Every moment you say in anger: Go, depart from my side.

If you do not ask forme, I’ll come myself and ask.}79 In Hacı Kemal’s JAmi“ al-naVA”ir {MS in the Beyazıt Umumi Library in Istanbul},which includes works of the earliest Anatolian poets, the names of whom are noteven mentioned in the tadhkiras, there is an ethical nefc poem written in simplelanguage and elementary “arEQ meter by a poet named Shayyad lamza. Its language,subject, and form of versification clearly reveal that it is an early work. There is anaccount of this man, who is not mentioned in any of the tadhkiras or biographicaldictionaries, in Lami‘c’s LaUA ”if, which states that he was a contemporary of Natral-Dcn Khwaja and was a nefc who performed miracles. If we bear in mind thatNatr al-Dcn Khwaja died in 683/1284–5 (Köprülü, Nasrettin Hoca [ Istanbul, 1918],p. 3), we may assert that Shayyad lamza was also a figure of the seventh /thirteenthcentury {Bayram identifies Natr al-Dcn Khwaja with Akhc Evren, Tarihin ıZıXındaNasreddin Hoca ve Ahi Evren (Istanbul, 2001), with a death date between 658/1260 and660/1262, see n.41 above}. Indeed, the nature of his work corroborates this. Withthe following couplets,Ecel tutmıZ elinde bir ulu câmKi ol câmın içi dolu ser-encâmKime ayak sunar, kime içürmiZKimi esrük yatar toprakta müdâmKi bir bir içer ol sâkî elindenBay-û yohsul, ulu kiçi, hâs-û “âmZehî Zerbet ki bir kez andan içenNe subh olduXunu bilür ne ahZâm{Death has a large cup in his hand.The cup is full of the end.He offers the cup to some people and lets them drink.Some lie drunk in the earth forever.One by one they drink from the hand of that cupbearer.Rich and poor, great and small, elite and common folk.What beverage is this that he who drinks it once,Knows not whether it is morning or evening}found at the end of a poem of nineteen couplets which begins by complaining of thetransitory nature of this world, the poet tries to awaken the heedless. He also statesthat favor and benefaction from the mercy of God reached his own heart, and thathe was otherwise innocent of the poetic arts:Bu sâkî cümlesin esrüdiserdirNe cemâat geliserdir, ne îmâmNe gül-ruh kurtulısar, ne Zeker-lebNe “anber-hat kalısar, ne gül-endâmBu gafletten niçin uyanmadın sen"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE254Niçin gâfil yatırsın sen ey “âvâm{eyyâd Lamza”nın gönlüne her demGelir Hak rahmetinden lutf-ü in“âmNe “arûz bilir ol ne nahv-ü tasrîfNe kâfiye, redîf ne tecnis-i tâm.{This cupbearer will make everyone drunk.No congregation will come and no imAm.Neither the rose-checkered one will escape, nor the sugar-lipped;Neither the one with perfumed beauty-spot nor the one with rose-like body.Why then have you not awakened from this heedlessness?Why do you lie heedless, O foolish folk?To Shayyad lamza’s heart at every momentComes grace and favor from God’s mercy.He does not know metrics or grammar,He does not know rhyme or radCf or figures of speech.}It can plausibly be inferred that Shayyad lamza, who reveals with this short poemthat he was not an artist but an ordinary nefc, must have written more hymns in thesyllabic meter than such poems in the “arEQ meter, but they were later forgotten. Thedifference in time between this nefc poet, whose work was probably in circulation upto the tenth/sixteenth century, and Gülshehrc, was at the most – as a best guess –about half a century. [ Köprülü was the first to introduce Shayyad lamza to theliterary world. See his “Anatolische Dichter in der Seldschukenzeit, i. ]ejjad ‘lamza,”Körösi Csoma Archivum, 1 (1921–5), 183 –90. This article appeared in Turkish transla-tion in Türk Yurdu, 1 (1340/1921–2), 27–34. One should also consult YA, s.v. “[eyyadHamza” (Sâdettin Buluç) on the subsequent writings of Köprülü and the articlesand texts published by Mecdut Mansuroxlu and other writers concerning this poet.]{Now see EI2, s.v. “Sheyyad lamza” ( Kathleen Burrill). Metin Akar has shown thatShayyad lamza lived in the first half of the fourteenth century, i.e. after YenusEmre. See his article “[eyyad Hamza hakkında yeni bilgiler,” Türklük ArastırmalarıDergisi, 2 (1986), 1–14, and Semih Tezcan, “Anadolu Türk yazınının bazlangiçdöneminde bir yazar ve çarh-name’nin tarihlendirilmesi üzerine,” Türk DilleriAraZtırmaları, 3 (1994), 75 – 88.}80 Suluan Walad’s Turkish poetry consists only of this. The poetry attributed to SuluanWalad in {Ziyâ Pasha’s} Harâbât does not belong to him, and the poem that beginswith the famous line “Ben bilmez idim gizli “iyân hep sen imiZsin” {I did not knowthat, visible and invisible, all is You}, which Namık Kemal has attributed to himas well, belongs to Naw‘c. It was translated from Jamc’s quatrain that begins {You have been visible but I was negligent}. Thúry givesconsiderable importance to the passages in the Harâbât and also is of the opinionthat “This poem has fourteen syllables per line and the rhyme scheme is abab,whereas Seljuk verse has eleven syllables per line and consists of rhymed couplets”(“Ondördüncü ‘asır sonlarına kadar Türk dili yâdıgârları,” p. 105). This is very odd.First of all, it is certain that, with respect to their language and versification, theseverses cannot belong to that period. Second, the works of Mawlana and SuluanWalad were not, as he believed, written in the syllabic meter. Third, there arepassages in both Mawlana and Suluan Walad written in various “arEQ meters and indifferent styles, i.e. in ghazal as well as mathnawC style. I believe that this brief critiquesuffices to show how poorly the Hungarian academician has studied this subject.{See EI2, s.v. “Suluan Walad” (Gudrun Schubert), and Franklin Lewis, Rumi, index.}81 This poetry was first published in 1829 in Vienna {by Hammer} in the Jahrbücherder Literatur. Subsequently, all sorts of opinions have been expressed about it, and it"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE255has been translated into various languages from this edition.

Veled Chelebi has collectedthem, but unfortunately he has not yet published them. In the sixth volume ofE. J. W. Gibb’s {History of Ottoman Poetry}, there are about sixty-seven couplets fromthe RabAbnAme and also a few short fragments of verses from Suluan Walad’s DCwAn(pp. 1–5).82 The few couplets given below suffice to show that Suluan Walad pursued this goaland did not think that even his Turkish was adequate for this (RabAbnAme) {MecdutMansuroxlu, Sultan Veled”in Türkçe manzumeleri ( Istanbul, 1958), pp. 24–5, = RabAbnAme,lines 97–100}:Türkçe bilseydüm ben eydeydüm sizeSırları kim Tañrıdan deXdi bizeBildüreydüm sözile bildüXümiBulduraydum ben size bulduXumıDilerem kim göreler kamu anıCümle yoksullar ola benden ganiBildürem dükeline bildüXümiBulalar ulu kiçi bulduXumı{If I had known Turkish, I would have told youThe secrets that God has imparted to me.I would have informed you in words of what I knowAnd let you find what I have found.I wish that all could see that (truth)And that all the poor would be rich because of me;That I would inform all of what I knowAnd let great and small find what I have found.}83 See above on the story of Shaikh nan‘an, the Qaramanid Murammad Bey’s attemptto make Turkish the official language, and Shayyad lamza. Because historians whorecorded Seljuk history did not wish to attribute any literary quality to the basicworks written in that period on a popular level, they claimed that “there was notyet any Turkish poetry in that period” (MukhtaTar SaljEqnAme trans., p. 216 {i.e.Yazıcı-oxlu ‘Alc’s Turkish trans. of Ibn Bcbc’s al-AwAmir al-“alA”iyya}). Later, Ottomanhistorians and tezkirecis {biographers}, as a result of a lack of knowledge combinedwith this literary prejudice, held the same opinion. ‘fshıq Chelebi says, “There wasno Turkish poetry at the time of Orhan Ghazc {1324 – 60}. At the time of MuradI, only one poet, named Armad, translated from Persian an epic called Suhail wanaw-bahAr in the shAhnAme meter. While it is Turkish in manner, it does have certain"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE256peculiarities of style, but copies of it are rare” (Tadhkira {i.e. his MashA“ir al-shu“arA”},fo. 24). Similarly, ‘flc says, Hafî olmaya ki Osman Han ve Orhan Han ve Sultân MuradHan zamânlarında Zu“arâdan kimse zuhûru mâlûm deXildir. Mücerred sâde nazma kâdir bâzıvarsaXı-gûlar dahî Zöhret bulmamıZtır; zirâ ol zamânda sükkân-i mülk-i Rûm ekseriyâ guzât-ıEtrâk ve Tatar idügi mâlûm ve sâir ahâlî merz-ü bûm ise evlâd-ı kefereden zuhûr etmiZ bir bölüksâde-levh idügleri mefhûm olmaXın içlerinde Zi“ir-Zinâsları bile ma“dûm idi {It is not known ifany poets appeared during the time of Osman Khan, Orhan Khan and MuradKhan. Even folk singers, who were capable of simple, plain verse, did not achievefame; for it is known that at that time most of the inhabitants of the kingdom ofRem were Turkish and Tatar ghAzCs. The rest of the people of the country were abunch of simpletons who were descendants of infidels, so it is obvious that therewere none among them who knew poetry} (Kunh al-akhbAr, vol. 5, p. 115). He thusexpresses an opinion quite the opposite to reality. The documents in our possessiontoday clearly demonstrate that the early historians and tezkirecis were definitelyunable to acquire an adequate knowledge of the first stages of Ottoman literature.Consequently, it is necessary to regard the similar accounts of the Seljuk historians{about early Seljuk literature} as equally unreliable, although few documents havecome down to us.84 Gülshehrc’s version of ManUiq al-Uair is dated 717/1317. There is one manuscript,copied in Egypt at the beginning of the tenth/sixteenth century, in the Hâlis Efendi{Library in Istanbul} and another, defective, manuscript in the Müze-i HumâyûnLibrary {Istanbul Archeological Museum}. There is no information on Gülshehrc atall in the tadhkiras {biographical works}. We only know that this poet first wrote awork in Persian called FalaknAme and also wrote ghazals and qaTCdas in addition to theManUiq al-Uair. Three ghazal-like didactic nefc poems are found in {Hacı Kemal’s}JAmi“ al-naVA ”ir. Gülshehrc, who in the ManUiq al-Uair reveals himself to be a follower ofthe great Persian nefcs and, especially, Mawlana and Suluan Walad, mentions thathe had exceptional authority in {the town of } Gül-Shehrc and was not the shaikh ofany village or town, as was often the case at that time, so it was necessary to regardhim as a great nefc whose fame had spread in all directions. If we take into consid-eration the fact that Gülshehrc was Kırshehrc, as recorded in the VelAyetnAme of lajjcBektash Veli, then it would appear that this great nefc poet was from Kırshehir{Kırzehir}. At the end of a Persian commentary on the Arabic Amthila {paradigmsfor the conjugation of verbs} registered as number 4837 in the Ayasofya Library, itis recorded that it was written by Shaikh Mas‘ed b. ‘Uthman, who was associatedwith the small town of Gülshehrc in Anatolia, on 4 Murarram 741/July 1, 1340. Iwonder if this Shaikh Mas‘ed b. ‘Uthman Gülshehrc is the same man as our Gülshehrc.If not, must we conclude, based on the difference in date of composition of these twoworks, that they are two different persons? Or there is a third possibility: becauseShaikh ‘Uthman Gülshehrc was the father of Shaikh Mas‘ed Gülshehrc, perhaps theformer was the author of the ManUiq al-Uair translation and the latter the author of theAmthila commentary. For now, nothing definite can be said about this. In a veryvaluable work by Shaikh-oghlu dating from the early years of the ninth/fifteenthcentury and including poetry from quite a few, mostly unknown, poets of the eighth/fourteenth century, I came across several passages attributed to Khwaja Mas‘ed aswell as two hemistichs belonging to Khwaja Gülshehrc (from the Kanz al-kubarA”,a unique copy in my private library written in the author’s hand). As likely as it isthat these two verses and the ManUiq al-Uair translation and the poems in the JAmi“al-naVA ”ir belong to the well known poet named Gülshehrc who lived at the end of theseventh/thirteenth and the beginning of the eighth/fourteenth century, it is equallylikely that there is no connection between this and the author of the Amthila com-mentary and Khwaja Mas‘ed. At any rate, it is difficult to believe that Gülshehrc,"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE257who must have been a man of mature age when he wrote the ManUiq al-Uair, wouldhave composed the Amthila commentary twenty-four years later. Also, Shaikh-oghlu, who undoubtedly had a good knowledge of the men of this period, carefullydistinguishes between Khwaja Gülshehrc and Khwaja Mas‘ed and shows themto be two different poets. In the manuscript in the Hâlis Efendi Library, there isthe following entry: KitAb-i ManUiq al-Uair min kalAm-i shaikh al-muRaqqiqCn murshidal-UAlibCn al-“Amil al-fAQil al-shaikh ARmad al-GülshehrC {the book of ManUiq al-Uair byShaikh . . . Armad al-Gülshehrc}, which clearly shows that our Gülshehrc was ArmadGülshehrc and corroborates the ideas that I have proposed. {See EI2, s.v. “Gülshehrc”(Fr. Taeschner).}85 Gülshehrc, who by the standards of that period paid serious attention to purity oflanguage and faultlessness of versification, and who achieved considerable success,shows that he was a true artist. In contrast to his contemporaries, who generallythought of nothing other than propagating an idea and a goal, there is a perceptiblelyricism in the works of this poet who paid close attention to the aesthetic effectthat his work would have. Even while giving the most abstract moral advice, he canconvey to the reader an aesthetic delight. Then, while describing scenes of nature,he possesses a rather artful and lively style that is at once very colorful and verysimple. Artistically, there is a great difference between the poetry of Gülshehrcand the works of Shayyad lamza or oersen Faqch, Naqcb-oghlu, Mu‘arrif of Ladik,lasan of Beypazar and even Suluan Walad, which are dry, dull, and devoid ofartistic concern. Gülshehrc, who had a good idea of his own worth, claimed that histranslation of the ManUiq al-Uair was not inferior to ‘Auuar’s original version – havinggiven it, along with many additions, a quality that was richer and more personalthan the original – and that before him no work of such beauty had been writtenin Turkish. He is not completely unjustified in saying this. ( I hope to publish soona study devoted to Gülshehrc and his work. See that study for abundant detailsuseful for comparing him with his contemporaries and the Persian poets {neverpublished}.)86 This enormous didactic nefc work that ‘fshıq Pasha, the grandson of the famousBaba Ilyas Khurasanc, wrote in Kırzehir in 730/1330 is a kind of MathnawC inTurkish. It is written in the same meter and form, and is divided into ten chapters often sections each. In this long didactic work, which was written for the religiouspurpose of teaching the rules of the order to Turks who did not know Persian, thereare many quotations from Persian nefc poets and, especially, from Mawlana. Despiteextensive research, I was able to find in this huge work only very few passages thatreveal the particular features of life in Anatolia at that time. ‘fshıq Pasha, who,in one passage, expresses his longing for the misty mountains of Turkistan, is muchinferior to Gülshehrc artistically. Still, this huge work also deserves a comprehensivestudy with respect to lingustic history. My study of ‘fshıq Pasha and his son ElvanChelebi is almost ready for publication. [For considerable information on both‘fshıqPasha and his son Elvan Chelebi, one should see YA, s.v. “Âzık Çelebi” ( M. F.Köprülü). The critical bibliography in this article is a valuable guide for those workingon this subject. In addition, see also Semavi Eyice, “Çorum’un Mecidözü’nde ÂzıkPaza-Oxlu Elvan Çelebi zâviyesi,” TM, 15 (1969), 211–44.] {See EI2, s.v. “‘fshısPasha” ( Fahir yz), and Kemal Yavuz (ed.), ÂZık PaZa, Garib-nâme (Istanbul, 2000).}87 These ozans were the earliest priest-sorcerer-poets of the Oghuz. The men who heldthe same position among the Tunguz were called shamans, among the Altay Turkskam, and among the Qirghiz bakhshi. These men, who combined in themselves anumber of functions, including sorcerer, dancer, musician, and physician, had greatimportance among the people. The extent of this importance, their costume, musicalinstruments, and the kind of tasks they performed differed, of course, in time and"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE258place. Nevertheless, their duties included such things as making sacrifices to thesky gods, sending the souls of the dead to the underworld, preventing evils fromdemons, and preserving the memory of the dead. There were separate ceremoniesfor each of these things. Some of these practices are still current among the AltayTurks and the Qirghiz. The ozans would enter an exuberant state during theseceremonies, recite poems, and play the kopuz to accompany them. These literaryrecitals, which were accompanied by music and had a magical effect, are the earliestform of Turkish poetry. Although the Turks of various regions and in differentperiods were subject to the influence of Chinese, Indian, Persian, or Islamic civiliza-tion, the social function of these ozans was constant. Their social influence wasespecially great in those places and times in which the primitive national religion waspreserved. Later, of course, their importance decreased. Still, in the early armiesof the Turks, as far back as that of Attila, the ruler was invariably accompanied byan ozan. Their heroic poems, which they recited to the accompaniment of the kopuz,flattered the sensibilities of an entire people. We know quite well from Latin sourceswhat a profound effect these epic poems had on the audience in Attila’s militarycamp. The ozans did not confine themselves to composing poems about recentevents and heroic legends, or elegies in praise of the dead; they also sang the oldpoems belonging to the Oghuz Destanı. Even after falling under the influence of Islam,these ozans did not disappear. As a result of the social division of labor in the greatcenters, the professions of poet, fortune-teller, sorcerer, astrologer, and physicianbecame separate from one another. Illnesses were treated by physicians; musicalinstruments were played by musicians; poetry and literature became the preserve ofscholars who studied Arabic and Persian religious and literary topics in the madrasas;and the legends of the old bakhshi-ozans were taken up by the nefcs. Yet the ozanssurvived as Muslim folk poets. We find them in Anatolia until the ninth/fifteenthcentury. Afterwards, “Ashıqs take the place of ozans (for more information, see my“Türk edebiyatının menze’i,” pp. 12–27). [After extensive research on the word ozan,Köprülü published a study on it under the heading “Ozan” in the book Türk dil veedebiyatı hakkında araZtırmalar ( Istanbul, 1934), pp. 273–92. This was reprinted in hiscollection of articles entitled Edebiyat araZtırmaları (Ankara, 1966), pp. 131– 44.] {SeeEI2, s.v. “Ozan” (P. N. Boratav).}88 Every nation has a national instrument especially used for accompanying itsprimordial national songs. This instrument is incorporated into the nation’s tales andlegends, and memory of it is preserved for centuries. The oldest musical instrumentthat the earliest Turkish popular poets, i.e. the precursors of the bakhshi-ozan, usedin relgious ceremonies and later in assemblies of an artistic nature was the kopuz.This instrument, which resembles the “Ed {lute} of the Arabs, has been continuouslyfound over the centuries from the earliest times in various Turkish countries. In allthe legends in which we find the ozan, he has, without fail, a kopuz in his hands. Weencounter this in the earliest Uighur texts, in Central Asia from the fifth/eleventhcentury on, and in Anatolia since the early Seljuk period. The kopuz is mentioned inthe works of Mawlana, Yenus Emre, and Gülshehrc. Indeed, in the Seljuk periodand in the courts of the rulers, there were also, in addition to the ozans, kopuz playerswho were distingushed from them. For considerable information on this instrument,which is also found among the Hungarians and the Ukrainians, see my article “Türkedebiyatının menze’i,” pp. 57– 63. I am also preparing a brief study of this subject.[ For concise information on the kopuz, see YA, s.v. “Kopuz” ( Mirza Bala).]89 “Selçukîler zamanında Anadolu’da Türk medeniyyeti,” pp. 213 –14, {Leiser trans.,pp. 50 –1.}.90 A passage of sixty-four couplets in the ninth chapter of his GharCbnAme mentions theetiquette of the alps and the requirements {for being an alp}. It begins:"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE259Kanı ol kim ister alp”lık adınıAlmak ister düZmeninden dâdınıDüZmeni kahreyleyip basmak dilerBaZını at yanına asmak dilerGelsün iZitsün ki alp”lık nicedürAlp”ların sermâyesi gör kim nedürEydeyim bir bir sana ahvâliniKim bilesin Alp-erenler hâlini{Where is he who desires the name of alp?He who wishes to punish his enemy?He who wants to subdue and trample the foe,And to hang his head at his horse’s side?Let him come and hear what being an alp means.See what is the stock and capital of the alps.Let me tell you their qualities one by one,So you will know the status of the alp-erenler.}This fine passage goes on to say that nine things are required of the alps: “a stoutheart, a strong arm, zeal, a good horse, a special garment {i.e. armor}, a bow, agood sword, a lance, and a suitable companion” (GharCbnAme, Beyazıt Umumi Library,MS 333 {see the Yavuz edn, vol. 2/2, p. 549, lines 8487–90}).

Allthese details show that we must consider that period of Anatolian history to be atime of alps. {On minstrels and kopuz players, see Karl Reichl, Turkic Oral Epic Poetry"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE260(New York, 1992) and Singing the Past: Turkic and Medieval Heroic Poetry ( Ithaca, NY,2000).}94 Women like Seljan Khaten and Banc Chichek Khaten in the stories in the KitAb-ıDede Korkut are nothing more nor less than alps. When Kanlı Koja wants to marry offhis hero son Kan ouralı, his son replies, Baba, çün meni iverim dirsin, mana lâyık kız niceolur?

She must be able to reach the bloody land of the infidelsbefore I do, and she must bring me an enemy head” ({ed. Kilisli Rifat ( Istanbul,1332/1916), p. 96, {English trans.

This shows very clearly the general conception of women at thetime of the alps. The kind of woman that Kan ouralı, i.e. the alps of that period,wanted was not a beloved of the type that the later minstrels imagined but was aheroine with exactly the same martial qualities as the men. Indeed, the women of theera of the alps, i.e. the time of the ozans, could only have had such heroic traits.95 The türkü is a folk song with a musical setting peculiar to the Turks. Türküs werecomposed in the manner of modern-day art-songs {Zarkı}. What distinguished themwas not the literary form but the musical setting. In other words, this genre was notof a literary character but was completely musical. Indeed, because these türküs areunique to the early periods when music and poetry could not yet be distinguished,the fact that they differed from each other musically is quite natural. {See EI2, s.v.“Türkü” ( Edith Ambros).}96 The türkmAnC is a folk-song with a musical setting peculiar to the Turkmen. There isno difference in form between it and other türküs. The difference is strictly in themusical setting.97 The varsaXı is originally a kind of folk-song with a musical setting peculiar to theVarsaks. In addition to the various accounts of the Varsaks in our historical works,Pavet de Courteille provides considerable information on them in the notes at theend of his {French} translation of {Ibn Kamal or Kemal Pasha-Zade’s} famousMohaçnAme, p. 164. These Varsak Turks, who came to Anatolia early on and settledin the Tarsus region, continually caused difficulties for the Ottoman state. They evenparticipated in the uprising of the Qaramanids during the reign of Sultan MuradI. Varsak was also the name of the stony region west of Tarsus where they originallylived. VarsaXıs composed to be recited with a musical setting peculiar to them becamefamous in Anatolia and Azerbaijan at a very early time. Not only does ‘flc, forexample, mention a number of those who sang varsaXıs in the early Ottoman period,but ‘fshıq Chelebi also says that Yenus Emre wrote works in the varsaXı style (‘fshıqChelebi, Tadhkira {i.e. his MashA“ir al-shu“arA”}). We know that Mehmed Beg, a poetwith the pen name Shamsc who flourished in Azerbaijan in the tenth/sixteenthcentury, was well known for singing varsaXıs in that region (nadiqc Kitabdar, Tadhkira,Nuruosmaniye Library, MS 3720), that Sultan Murad IV wrote a varsaXı for hiscompanion Mesa Chelebi, and that Evliya Chelebi sang it in his presence (EvliyaChelebi, SeyARítnAme, Book 1, fo. 70a). With respect to meter, the rule for the varsaXısis not very strict. Sometimes our “Ashıqs composed varsaXıs of eleven syllables per line,but most often used eight. As for form, they were composed of four-line stanzas{quatrains}, just like koZmas {see the following note}, türküs, and türkmAnCs, with thefourth lines rhyming. VarsaXıs had to be written in somewhat coarse and masculinelanguage and in a dâXî manner {a vocal musical work having the character of uzun"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE261hava, i.e. no rhythmical pattern}. In this regard, Qaraja-oghlan can be consideredsuperior to virtually all other minstrels. From the fact that Na‘cma used the wordtürkü to designate the frontier folk-song that {Ibrâhîm} Pe-ewc {Peçevî} recorded asa varsaXı, we know that varsaXı, which differed from the koZma, türkü, and türkmAnCforms only in musical setting, had long been used synonymously with türkü (Ta”rCkh-i Na“CmA [ Istanbul, 1280/1863 – 4], vol. 1, p. 158; Hammer, {Geschichte des OsmanischenReichs, Turkish} trans., vol. 7, p. 216).98 The koZma, or koZug as it was known among the Eastern Turks, is one of the oldestand most popular forms in the syllabic meter. We can accept that the koZug, which isdefined as rajaz, qaTCda in {al-Kashgarc’s} DCwAn lughAt al-turk, is one of the earliestsurviving forms of Turkish poetry, belonging to the time when there was no distinctionbetween words and music. The word koZmak, in fact, means “to add a musical settingto a text.” The koZma of the “Ashıq type is an independent and much used verse formwith a specific musical setting and sung in a special way. The koZmas sung with thismusical setting have, in recent centuries, usually been of eleven syllables per line andcomposed as quatrains. But in the past, koZmas were sung in various meters (for adiscussion of the koZma and other verse forms in “Ashıq literature, see my series ofarticles in the newspaper Ykdam, “Sazzâirleri,” I–II; April 3, 7, 11, 16, 19, 25; May 2,7, 9, 31; June 6, 1914.)99 We know the antiquity of deyiZ {a folk poem or song}, which means approximately“singing,” from one of Mawlana’s Turkish verses: Hem men çakır içer men, hem men teyiZbilir men {I also drink wine and I also know teyiZ.} This shows that deyiZes were alreadyquite famous by Mawlana’s time. This is also a rudimentary form in which musicalsetting and text were not yet distinguished.100 As will be easily understood from its name, this was also a simple, primordial and“rustic” from of verse that definitely was sung. The poet Vehbi, while satirizing atlength popular poetry and popular poets in the famous Sukhan {poetry} qaTCda, speaksdisparagingly of these forms as well:Kimi mânî kimisi vâdi-i Türkmânî”deKara-oXlan Kaya-baZısı yellellâ-yi suhan.{Some write mânî (folk quatrains); some, in the valley of türkmani,Write kayabaZı of Qara Oghlan with the refrain: yellellâ.Cf. translation in Kemal Silay, Nedim and the Poetics of the Ottoman Court ( Bloomington,IN, 1994), p. 131, verse no. 46.}101 For a comprehensive treatment of this strange attitude and the psychological factorsthat gave rise to it, see my article “Türk edebiyatında âzık tarzının menze’ vetekâmülü,” pp. 5 – 46. In the view of the old madrasa-educated class, who reserved forthemselves a privileged place in society and regarded everything belonging to thecommon people to be, invariably, base and trivial, “Mevzû-i ilm-i edeb, kelâm-i Arab”dır”{the subject of the science of literature is the Arabic language} ({Tashköprü-Zade,}MawQE“At al-“ulEm, {Turkish trans.

Consequently, let alone preservingand appreciating what remained of that early national literature, they vehementlydenigrated it, considering works that even hinted at popular taste to be “meaninglessand worthless.” Unfortunately, we find that this medieval mentality has endured tothe present day.102 See my discussion of this matter above in Chapter 1, p. 17, n.31.

When Rashcd al-Dcn beganto write this enormous work at the order of Ghazan Khan, there were learned menfrom various ethnic groups in his retinue and they made use of the earliest sourcesfor the history of their own peoples. (On this subject, see the edition of JAmi“al-tawArCkh published {ed. and Russian trans.} by I.

For various editions of the JAmi“ al-tawArCkh, see The Cambridge History ofIran, vol. 5, ed. J. A. Boyle (Cambridge, 1968), p. 705}.) All of these sources clearlyshow that Rashcd al-Dcn, while writing the section on the Turks and Mongols,benefited from a certain Amcr Pelad Chingsang, and also obtained information fromreports and documents preserved in the treasury. Reference to this is also foundin Shams al-Dcn Kashanc’s work in verse ShAhnAme-i ChingCzC, which cites the JAmi“al-tawArCkh ( Hamidiye Library, Lala Vakfı MS 354 {now in the Süleymaniye Libraryin Istanbul}). {On Kashanc’s versified history of the Mongols, see the Russian trans-lation by Iu.

Alî Emîrî Efendi, in the introduction to {Beyâtî Shaikh Mahmûd’s}JAm-i jam AyCn, also thought that the OghuznAme was a history of the ancient Turks,JAm-i jam AyCn ( Istanbul, 1331/1913), p. 5 {a modern Turkish trans. of Beyâtî’s workis included in Atsız, Osmanlı tarihleri (Istanbul, 1949)}. Bursalı Tâhir Bey was of thesame opinion, stating, “In light of certain evidence that we possess, the OghuznAmemust be considered the most valuable of the national histories written about thetribes constituting the Turks. It has been established, based on certain documents,that this great history existed in the area of Azerbaijan up to around 1000 ah, but itis no longer extant” ({“Azık Paza,”} Türk DerneXi, no. 1 {1327/1911}, p. 12).105 In the Bahjat al-tawArCkh, a brief history of Islam – which also mentions the Ottomansup to the accession of Murammad II – composed by the historian Shükrullâh anddedicated to the famous Marmed Pasha, one of the viziers of Murammad II, thefollowing important note is found attesting to the existence and nature of the OghuznAme( Nuruosmaniye Library {in Istanbul}, MS 3059):"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE263{In the year 852, the late Sultan Murad sent me on a mission to Mcrza Jihanshah(the Qara Qoyunlu ruler in Tabrcz, reigned 841–72/1438 – 67). After I had arrivedand paid my respects, one day the officer in charge of foreign envoys came and saidthat the Mcrza wished to meet with me in private audience. “To hear is to obey,” Ireplied, and went. In the course of the conversation the Mcrza said: “Sultan Muradis my other-worldly (spiritual) brother, but he is also a brother by kin.” When I askedhim to explain kinship, he ordered the chronicle-reciter Mawlana Isma‘cl to besummoned and that he should bring the History of the Oghuz. Mawlana Isma‘clcame and brought a book written in Mongol (i.e. Uighur) script. From that book hereported that Oghuz had six sons: Gök Alp, Yer Alp, Dencz Alp, Gün Alp, Ay Alp,and Yıldız Alp. The Mcrza said: “The lineage of my brother Sultan Murad goesback to Gök Alp. The lineage of Qara Yesuf (Qara Qoyunlu ruler, reigned 791–823/1389 –1402) goes back to Dencz Alp.” A Turkish trans. of the section of Bahjatal-tawArCkh on the Ottomans is included in Atsız, Osmanlı tarihleri, while the Persiantext of the same section and a German trans. are provided by Theodor Seif in his“Der Abschnitt über die Osmanen in ]ükrullah’s persischer Universalgeschichte,”Mitteilungen zur osmanischen Geschichte, 2 (1923– 6), 63–128.} I think Tâhir based hisassertion that “the OghuznAme existed in the area of Azerbaijan up to around 1000ah” on this source. This copy of the OghuznAme, written in Uighur script, was eitherthe digest of a national epic that included legends belonging to the Oghuz lineages,or a historical work that began with the legend of Oghuz Khan and then includedhistorical information on one or more branches of the Oghuz and bore the nameOghuznAme because it concerned the Oghuz. If we consider that the traditions aboutthe early period of every nation are much more legendary than historical, it isnot surprising that the men of that time did not distinguish historical events fromlegends. In the Ottoman period, they called the general histories of the Turks, whichwent as far back as Oghuz Khan and included the Seljuks, oghuznAme by extensionbecause they were pan-Oghuz in character. The OghuznAme of the famous LûtfîPasha is, in fact, such a work. The original OghuznAme, however, was a collection oflegends. Searching for another great historical work, aside from these two, entitledOghuznAme is a fantasy arising from a misunderstanding of the true nature of theOghuznAme. Curiously, our recent historians have been deceived in this matter.106 In his SaljEqnAme, Yazıcı-oxlu ‘Alc says, “The narrative of the lineages of the Turkswas recorded in the OghuznAme in Uighur script from the tales of their sages andesteemed story tellers” ( Topkapı Sarayı MS). In this statement, he shows that someparts of his work were extracted from the OghuznAme written in Uighur script. Inaddition, while mentioning Oghuz Khan and Gün Khan, the author {Beyâtî ShaikhMahmûd} of the JAm-i jam AyCn, which was written in 886/1481–2, attributes theinformation on them to the OghuznAme ( p. 21). Furthermore, in {Yazıcı-oxlu ‘Alc’s}translation of Ibn Bcbc’s SaljEqnAme, ‘Ala’ al-Dcn Kai-Qubad is described as “knowingwell the OghuznAme and other histories” ( p. 217). In my view, all these statements"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE264concern the general histories of the Oghuz, which started with the Oghuz legend, asI have stated in the note above, and not a genuine original OghuznAme that was acollection of legends. I will mention one more conclusive piece of evidence to showthat all the various kinds of Turk-Oghuz histories were called oghuznAmes andthat oghuznAme was not the name of a single work as our recent historians imagine.The OghuznAme in the possession of Jihanshah considered the Ottoman rulers to bedescendants of Gün Khan, but the JAm-i jam AyCn, which is also based on an oghuznAme,shows them to be of the dynasty of Gök Khan. This means that the “OghuznAme” isnot a single, specific work, but was a name commonly given to all Turk-Oghuzhistories.107 This author wrote an abridged general history in Arabic entitled Durar al-tCjAn, whichincluded events up to 709/1309 –10. It is arranged chronologically and mainly dis-cusses events in Egypt and occasionally other related matters. It is dedicated to thefamous {Mamlek sultan} al-Malik al-Natir Murammad b. Qalawen. While describingthe events of 628/1230 –1, the author gives a long introduction on Chingiz Khan,part of which he cites as follows from the OghuznAme: “I intend to mention herethe first time this people {the Mongols} burst upon the scene and their origins.The noble SharC“a cannot, however, approve of certain aspects of this subject. Thisinformation was taken from their book JlE KhAn AUA BitigjC. The name of this bookmeans Great King Father. This is a book with which the Mongols and Qipchaqs,who are descendants of the ancient Turks, are pleased and happy. This book isgreatly revered by them, just as among the Oghuz Turks there is a book called theOghuznAme that circulates from hand to hand. The origins of the Oghuz and all oftheir early rulers are mentioned in this book. The Turks are called Oghuz, for one oftheir great leaders was named Oghuz. In this book called the OghuznAme, an accountis given of a certain Depegöz ( Tepegöz). This Tepegöz destroyed the countries of theearly Turks and killed their great leaders. According to their tradition, he was anugly and loathsome man. He had a single eye in his forehead. His mother was asprite from the ocean. He was immune to sword and lance. His father’s hat, whichcompletely covered his head, was made of the hide of ten rams. The Oghuz havemany famous tales about Tepegöz. These tales are still current. Wise men and sagesamong the Oghuz memorize these tales and recite them while playing their kopuz.Finally, the esteemed, famous, and powerful Basat son of Urus ( Uruz), who grew upamong the Turks, killed this Tepegöz. As to the reason for killing him, there was agirl who grew up among the Oghuz whom no one could surpass in marksmanship.This girl goaded Basat to kill Tepegöz. Basat’s father also played a role; for whenBasat overcame this girl, carried her off {i.e. married her} and brought the goodnews to his father, his father said, ‘I thought that you had killed Tepegöz.’ For thesereasons, when Basat heard about Tepegöz he conceived many cunning plans,carried them out, and killed him. Such things occurred between Basat and Tepegözthat are impossible to believe. They are among the superstitions of the Turks. Iwrote this introduction so that the readers of the book would understand that I knowmany things about the Turks” ( Damad Ibrahim Paza Library, MS 913). ThisTurkish writer, whose account of Tepegöz shows that he was familiar with the storiesof Dede Korkut, has made one minor error in this matter. There is no girl in thestory of Tepegöz. {See U. Haarmann, “Turkish Legends in the Popular Historio-graphy of Medieval Egypt,” Proceedings of the VI Congress of Arabic and Islamic Studies . . .1972 (Uppsala, 1975), pp. 97–107.}Muallim Cevdet also mentions the notes on the OghuznAme by the Egyptian writerZakc Pasha, who cites a copy of this work in the Khedival Library in Cairo. I havecited these above in Chapter 1, p. 17, n.33. Let me also cite from Cevdet’s article theauthor’s account of how and where he saw the MS and his description of it: “The"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE265other Turks also have a book, which is called the OghuznAme. This work is the historyof the first rulers of the Turks, the most famous of whom bore the name Oghuz. Iam familiar with both books. My knowledge of them allows me to affirm that I haveperfectly comprehended the history of the Turkish people and allows me to state thatthe stories that I will relate about this people can be regarded as very reliable. Myfather was the amCr of Sharqiyya province {in Egypt} in the year 709 {1309 –10}.The capital of this province is Bilbays. One of my friends, Amcn al-Dcn lamdc,brought me a manuscript after following a discussion with some “ulama” about theTatars. He said that he had acquired this work from the late Amcn al-Dcn Baysarcand that it was unique. Its paper was made in Baghdad and was of silk. It waswritten in the hand of a pupil of the famous ‘Alc b. Hilal al-Bawwab. Its text includedgilded decorations. Its binding was very refined and woven of yellow silk, and it hada gold case. My friends al-lammeyc, Jalal al-Dcn Ibn Zaiten, and Manter al-‘Abbasand I got together and studied this book. We read it together and I copied out thethings that we were able to understand. We could not understand certain passages.The author wrote that his name was Jibra’cl Ibn Bakhtcshe‘, that he was a physician,and that after this book had originally been translated from Turkish into Persian hehad translated it from Persian into Arabic in the year 211 {826–7}. This book camefrom the treasury of Abe Muslim Khurasanc. In fact, the author claims that AbeMuslim was descended from Bakhtu Khan and claims that he inherited this book”(Muallim Cevdet, “Oxuz-nâme – Kitâb-ı Dede Korkut,” in the special issue of YMcommemorating Çanakkale {Gallipoli}, March 5, 1331, vol. 2, pp. 89 –91). ThisJibra’cl Ibn Bakhtcshe‘ was from a Syriac {speaking} family of physicians who wongreat fame in the ‘Abbasid period. Like his father and grandfather, he served asthe chief physician of the ‘Abbasids ({Ibn Abc Utaybi‘a, “UyEn al-anbA” fC} UabaqAtal-aUibbA” {Cairo, 1299/1882}, vol. 1, p. 127). Because Cevdet did not mention hissource, we don’t know the work from which Zakc Pasha took this information. ZakcPasha also states, however, that the unique copy of the Durar al-tCjAn is in Istanbul{now ed. Gunhild Graf as Die Epitome der Universalchronik Ibn ad-Dawadaris ( Berlin,1990)}, and so it would probably be a mistake to believe that Cevdet cited thispassage from a second copy of that work in Egypt (Armad Zakc, Mémoire sur les moyenspropres à déterminer en Egypte une renaissance des lettres arabes [Cairo, 1910], pp. 13 –14){this was indeed the source; see Ibn al-Dawadarc, Kanz al-durar, vol. 7, ed. Sa‘cd ‘Abdal-Fattar ‘fsher (Cairo, 1972), pp. 218 –19}. If the Kanz al-durar wa jAmi“ al-“ibar {oral-ghurar}, which is an abridgement of the Durar al-tCjAn and of which volumes 1, 2, 4,and 5 are in the Ayasofya Library and volumes 3, 6, 8, and 9 are in the TopkapıSarayı Library, were properly studied, the subject of early Turkish mythology wouldcertainly be much better illuminated.108 The collection of legends found under the name KitAb-ı Dede Korkut is nothing otherthan the OghuznAme that Abe Bakr Ibn {‘Abd Allah b.} Aybak al-Dawadarc saw.The edition published in Istanbul based on the unique copy in Dresden containstwelve separate legends, each of which is also called an oghuznAme. The first Ottomanhistorian to see this KitAb-ı Dede Korkut was Rerc. The following narrative is citedfrom him in Müneccim-bazı’s JAmi“ al-duwal: Kadîmü”z-zamânda Türkmen kabâili beynindeKorkut Ata nâm bir ehl-i hâl azîz vardı; birgün buyurdu ki saltanat âkıbet OXuz-Han”ın vasıyyetiüzre OXlu Kayı-Han evlâdına nakledip ilâ âhiri”z-zamân ber-devâm olur {In olden timesthere was a saint named Korkut Ata among the Turkmen tribes.

Geoffry Lewis trans. The Book ofDede Korkut, p. 3; Orhan Gökyay, Dedem Korkudun kitabı ( Istanbul, 1973), p. lxviii}.This tradition is taken almost verbatim from the KitAb-ı Dede Korkut. Barthold has also"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE266provided some brief information on this work, which first attracted the attentionof H. O. Fleischer and then J. H. von Diez in Europe and was partially translated(see EI1, s.v. “Ghuzz”). This valuable collection of legends, which, judging from theproper names in it, evidently belongs to the Turks living in the region of Azerbaijan,Bayburt, and Georgia, i.e. in the region of the Eastern Oghuz, which we call the“Azerc language area,” needs a thorough linguistic and historical analysis. Some ofthese popular legends – such as the story of Bey Beyrek – which the ozans have sungfor centuries accompanied by the kopuz, exist in other written versions. Others, suchas that of Tepegöz, are still current orally among the people. Indeed, the figureof Dede Korkut is encountered among the Turkmen of Azerbaijan and in the SyrDarya region. This saint, who, according to one legend, went to Arabia to learnabout Islam and, after meeting Abe Bakr, became a Muslim, is not a historicalperson as K. Inostrantsev believes {see Gökyay (ed.), p. IX}, but a completelylegendary figure. In my view, the Ulug Turk in the Uighur Oghuz legend publishedby Radloff, the Irkıl Ata in Rashcd al-Dcn, and this Dede Korkut represent the samefigure and clearly show the religio-artistic position of the ozans in early Turkishsociety. Finally, let me say that I have also encountered among Turks other than theOghuz stories written in the same manner and style as those in the KitAb-ı DedeKorkut, i.e. in the same kind of metrical prose {or free verse}.109 Shaikh Süleyman Efendi gives the following information on the words ozan andozancı in his Lughat-i chaghatay ve türkî-yî “osmânî: “Ozan: a song without meter in themânî style that was sung in the story and epic of Qara Khan and Oghuz Khan.Ozancı: a man who plays the drum {davul} and tambourine {def} while singing anozan, i.e. mânî and song.” The definition in the Chaghatay-Persian lexicon of theBudapest Academy is as follows:{A kind of singing among the Turks which is sung in the story of Oghuz Khanand Qara Khan.} The famous Pavet de Courteille somehow misunderstood thisin his Dictionnaire Turc-Oriental and says “The invention of this was attributed toOghuz Khan and Qara Khan,” which is a mistake. This word, which is not found inVambéry’s |agataische Sprachstudien, appears among the Yakut in the form of oyun,meaning “shaman.” In any case, the definitions given by Süleyman Efendi show thatozans were well known for singing, above all, the epic of the Oghuz and that this epicwas “a song without meter in the mânî style,” which exactly characterizes the storiesof Dede Korkut. {See ylhan Bazgöz, “From Gosan to Ozan,” International Journal ofCentral Asian Studies, 2 (1997), 5 –13; on mânî, see EI2, s.v. “Mani” ( P. N. Boratav).}110 A number of legends – coming from many different sources – that constitute theBektashc tradition reveal this feature very clearly. Sarı Saltık, for example, was notan ordinary dervish, but a hero who conquered countries with a wooden sword andspread the faith.111 The famous Geyikli Baba, for example, mounted a gazelle in front of the armybesieging Bursa and went into battle with a sword weighing 60 okkas {1 = 1.28 kg}.In like manner, Abdal Murad carried out many heroic deeds with a wooden swordthat was four arZıns (68 cm) in length. Hammer considers Geyikli Baba to be theSaint George of the Ottomans, or to be the furious Roland {Orlando Furioso} whowas the subject of so much heroic poetry in Western literature – a very goodanalogy. As a sign of respect, Süleyman the Magnificent cut off one-third of hissword and had it placed in the royal treasury (for accounts of this, see the firstvolume of Hammer’s {Geschichte des osmanischen Reichs}; {Tashköprü-Zade’s} al-ShaqA”iq,"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"TURKISH LITERATURE IN ANATOLIA BEFORE YjNUS EMRE267{Turkish} trans.; {Sa‘d al-Dcn’s} TAj al-tawArCkh; ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade’s {TawArCkh-iAl-i “uthmAn}; {ysmâ‘îl Belig Bursalı’s} Güldeste-i riyâz-ı irfân; ‘flc’s {Kunh al-akhbAr};Neshrc’s {Kitâb-ı cihan-nümâ}; Lami‘c’s MunAVara-yi bahAr-u shitA”, and the specialhistories written about Bursa). {Cf.

Lowry finds Köprülü’s remarks confusing, but Köprülu is not concernedwith a particular sword or sword legend.}"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE268 8THE LIFE OFYjNUS EMREA Bektash¢ traditionThere is considerable information about Yenus Emre in Bektashc tradition, whichsought to present virtually every one of the early great nefcs who flourished inAnatolia as a disciple and follower of lajjc Bektash. Consequently, before Iprovide historical information on the life of Yenus Emre, it is useful to presenthis portrait in exactly the way it is given in Bektashc tradition. This tradition tookshape in the ninth/fifteenth century – in a somewhat forced manner – and is, forthe most part, highly contrary to historical reality because of the time in which itwas established. Nevertheless, it is still possible to extract some historical informa-tion from it by subjecting it to serious and rigorous criticism.According to this Bektashc tradition, when lajjc Bektash arrived in the landsof Rem {Anatolia}, among a number of great nefcs who were there, such as SayyidMarmed lairanc, Jalal al-Dcn Remc, and lajjc Ibrahcm Suluan,1 was a shaikhnamed Emre who “possessed great holiness.”2 lajjc Bektash summoned all theerens of Anatolia. But this shaikh, for some reason, did not accept the invitation.The other erens of Anatolia informed lajjc Bektash that he did not want to come.lajjc Bektash then sent his dervish named Sarı Isma‘cl,3 who had previously joinedhim along with Qaraja Armad,4 to Emre to summon him. He asked him thereason why he had not come previously. Emre said that a hand, appearing frombehind a curtain, had granted him permission to enter the nefc path, and that hehad never seen anyone called lajjc Bektash at that banquet of erens that he hadattended. When lajjc Bektash asked whether that hand had a mark on it, hesaid that he saw a green mole on the palm. lajjc Bektash immediately extendedhis hand. Emre was astonished to see the green mole on his palm, and when herealized that he was in the presence of the spiritual guide {murshid} who hadpreviously given him his hand, in amazement he uttered three times, “TapdukpadiZahım” {At your service my Padishah}!5 From that day forth, his name wasTapduk Emre.6In one of the surrounding villages, there was a very poor man named Yenuswho earned his living as a farmhand. One year, there was a famine and Yenus’spoverty intensified. Finally, it occurred to him to go to lajjc Bektash – having"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF YjNUS EMRE269heard of his many miracles and graces – and ask for help. He loaded somemedlars on his ox and went to the dargAh {dervish convent [of lajjc Bektash]}.Prostrating himself at the feet of the pCr, he gave him his gift and requested somewheat in exchange. lajjc Bektash treated him with kindness and had him as aguest for several days in his dargAh. But Yenus was anxious to return. When thedervishes told the pCr that Yenus wished to leave, he sent word, saying “Does hewant wheat or the miraculous influence {himma} of the erens?” The heedlessYenus asked for the wheat. When lajjc Bektash learned this, he again sentword, saying “If he wishes, let me blow on each medlar fruit.” Yenus continuedto insist on the wheat. lajjc Bektash sent word a third time, saying “If he wishes,let me exert my miraculous influence for each seed {in the medlar fruit}.” WhenYenus again insisted on the wheat, he finally ordered that they give it to him.Yenus left the dargAh and set out for home. He had not gone far, however,before he realized that he had made a big mistake. Greatly regretting it, heimmediately returned and admitted his blunder. lajjc Bektash then told himthat he had given Yenus’s “lock” to Tapduk Emre and, therefore, if he wished{to open it}, he should go to him. As soon as Yenus heard this, he rushed toTapduk’s dargAh and told him what had happened. Tapduk appointed Yenus togather firewood for his dargAh. During the fully forty years in which this devoteddervish carried out this task, he was never seen to bring in a bent or damp pieceof wood.One day, after these many years, an assembly of erens was held. The woodcutterYenus was present with his shaikh. Also present was a very well known composerof hymns named Yenus the Singer. In the assembly, Tapduk Emre entered astate of mystical ecstasy and addressed Yenus the Singer, saying “I am filled withlove. Come, sing a little!” He tried several times, but no sound emerged fromhis lips. Finally, Tapduk Emre turned to the woodcutter Yenus and said “Well,the time has come. Your lock has been opened. The words of lajjc Bektash havebeen fulfilled. Don’t stand there! Sing!” At this, the veil was removed fromYenus and the lock was opened and he immediately began to compose skillfuland eloquent orations and hymns.7B His lifeIf we put aside the legend and examine the life and personality of YenusEmre from a strictly historical and positivist point of view, we will be confrontedwith a number of major problems that, to some degree, are impossible to solve,because the information on him provided by the earliest historical sources isoften inadequate or contradictory, and even mixed somewhat with legends. Thereare, to be sure, several hints and clues to the life of Yenus Emre in his ownworks, but as will become quite clear from the following chapter on his DCwAn,they too must be used with great caution. Faced with these meager and conflictingmaterials, we must admit right away that the information that we will give on hislife cannot be regarded as positively established."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE270Yenus Emre – or, as he is usually called in his poetry, Qul Yenus, ‘fshıqYenus, or Yenus Emrem8 – was a simple dervish who lived in the second halfof the seventh/thirteenth century and the beginning of the eighth/fourteenthcentury. Some biographical works place his death date as late as 843/1439 – 40,as expressed by the chronogram gulshan-i tawRCd {actually amounts to 828}, butneither this claim nor the attempt by Tashköprü-Zade to show that he was ashaikh during the reign of Bayezid I {791– 804/1389 –1402} is correct.9 Somerecent scholars, like Melioransky, hold such opinions, but even in light of theinadequate documents that we possess today, they can very easily be rejected.10First of all, the Bektashc tradition is very strong evidence on this point. IfYenus Emre died in 843/1439 – 40, as was claimed, or if he lived into the earlyyears of Bayezid I, the Bektashc tradition, which is virtually confined to thenefcs belonging to the second half of the seventh/thirteenth century and theearly years of the eighth/fourteenth century, could not have appropriated him.In order to include him in the Bektashc tradition, which was certainly establishedby the end of the eighth/fourteenth century or the beginning of the ninth/fifteenth century, it would have been necessary for Yenus Emre to have lived ata much earlier time and for his historical character to have subsequently beenmore or less forgotten.11Second, ‘Ashıq Pasha-Zade, who provides fairly accurate and reliable informa-tion on the shaikhs and religious scholars of these early periods, such as lajjcBektash, considers Yenus Emre to have been contemporary with such nefcs as‘fshıq Pasha, Akhc Ören {Evren}, Qaraja Armad, and Geyikli Baba, and writesthat they were among the leading personalities of the reign of Orhan {c.724 –61/1324 – 60} and that some of them reached as far as the time of Murad I{761–91/1360 – 89}.12 It is more reasonable that Yenus Emre, who was con-sidered to be a contemporary of ‘fshıq Pasha, lived in the second half of theseventh/thirteenth century than that he died in 843/1439 – 40.Third, the fact that several of ‘Ashıq Pasha’s poems are listed in {Hacı Kemal’s}JAmi“ al-naVA ”ir as imitations {naVA ”ir} of those of Yenus Emre, shows that Yenuslived some time before him.13Fourth, a foreigner named Mühlbacher who was taken prisoner by the Turksin 841 or 842/1438 and later, after spending about twenty years in Edirne,Bergama, Bursa, and Chios {incorrectly given as Cyprus in the 1st edn}, returnedto his country, copied down two of Yenus’s hymns in Gothic letters and translatedthem into Latin. If Yenus Emre belonged, in fact, to the eighth/fourteenth orninth/fifteenth centuries, it would have been impossible for his poems to havebeen so widespread at that time. It would appear, therefore, that Yenus Emrelived only into the early years of the eighth/fourteenth century and that his hymnshad spread throughout Anatolia and Rumelia by the time of Mühlbacher’s cap-tivity.14 In light of this historical evidence, the view put forward by Melioransky –that Yenus Emre lived at a later time than we suppose – can hardly be defended.15Yenus Emre was a Turkmen peasant who lived in the second half of theseventh/thirteenth century in a village close to Sivrihisar, or one of the villages"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF YjNUS EMRE271dependent on Bolu, near the Sakarya River.16 It is apparent from the literaryworks in his DCwAn that he tried for a long time to set out on the mystic path, buthe was unsuccessful in achieving this goal until he became a disciple of TapdukEmre.17 It is also clear from Bektashc tradition that this man, whom ‘fshıqPasha-Zade mistakenly presents as eminent during the reign of Sultan Orhan,and whom Tashköprü-Zade presents as eminent during the reign of BayezidI, was one of many well known shaikhs who filled Anatolia in the seventh/thirteenth century; he lived a solitary life in a village near the Sakarya River.18The legendary reports according to which he was a blind shaikh belonging to theQadirc UarCqa are not based on any historical evidence.19 The information thatI have given {above} on nefc life in Anatolia at that time renders it likely thatTapduk Emre belonged not to the Qadirc but rather to the Baba’c UarCqa; and thefact that there are a number of features that would not be welcomed by theSharC“a-minded in Yenus’s belief system also supports this conclusion. And while,as I will show at length in the next chapter, it would not be correct to considerYenus’s nefc personality to have been formed solely under the influence ofTapduk Emre, it would be equally incorrect to believe that he completely escapedhis influence. When the personality of Yenus Emre is studied in the context ofthe nefc movements in seventh/thirteenth-century Anatolia, the spiritual figureof Tapduk Emre also becomes more or less clear. There is a tradition that haslong existed among the Anatolian dervishes according to which Tapduk Emrereceived spiritual instruction from a certain Sinan Efendi, or Sinan Ata, a CentralAsian Turkish shaikh who went to Anatolia from Bukhara following the Mongolinvasion. This tradition goes far to explain the influence of Armad Yasawc onYenus Emre.20Tapduk Emre, who, according to the translator of {Tashköprü-Zade’s}al-Shaqâ”iq, Müddet-i ömründe halk âleminden uzlet ve intıkâ“ üzre olup silâh-ı salâh ilehabl-i alâkayı kat“etmi ve Zîme-i kerîme-i aktâb üzre seccâde-i irZâda cülûs eyleyib, kerâmât-ıâliye izhâr eylemiZ {spent his life in isolation and cut off from the world, severed thecord of worldly ties with the sword of righteousness, sat on the carpet of spirituallearning with the chief saints of the noble qualities, and performed sublimemiracles}, was a famous nefc who acquired enormous spiritual influence through-out the Sakarya region. It was especially during that confused period, whichcorresponds with the decline of the Seljuks, that the influence of the nefcs overthe people increased markedly. Yenus Emre also succumbed to this widespreadspiritual state and followed Tapduk Emre’s path of religious instruction. Yenusspent a lengthy period practicing austerities. In order to complete his religioustraining, he labored for years with an enthusiasm unique to the dervishes. Summerand winter, he carried wood to the dargAh from the Sakarya forests. His beingthus occupied collecting wood in the mountains naturally led to the creation andspread of many stories about him among the people. These legends have evencome down to our time. One day, according to tradition, Tapduk Emre lookedat the wood that Yenus had brought and noticed that it was all straight and dry.“Is there no bent wood left in the mountains?” he asked, feigning ignorance."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE272“There is a lot of crooked wood in the mountains,” Yenus replied, “but at yourgate it is not proper for anything to be bent, even the wood.”21 In any case, amongthe adherents of the UarCqa, Yenus was known for centuries as the model of adervish who was able to reach the highest levels of spirituality by showing absolutedevotion to his spiritual guide. We frequently find passages in his DCwAn thatshow his deep and very sincere affection for, and devotion to, Tapduk Emre.22All the stages of Yenus’s life after his association with Tapduk Emre areshrouded in darkness. According to legend, he completed his religious trainingafter serving his shaikh for a full forty years – because it was not possible to dothis in less than forty years23 – and reached the level of enlightenment. At thatpoint, he began to write his hymns. Another legend relates that, on the order ofhis shaikh, he wandered from country to country for forty years and only thenreached the stage of enlightenment.24 Whatever the case, some of the poems inhis DCwAn indicate that both Mawlana and his shaikh Emre Suluan died before hedid,25 and that he went to Damascus for a while on the order of his spiritualguide, stopped in ‘Ayntab en route, and delivered a number of orations there.26Indeed, there are even some poems in his DCwAn that imply that he went toMecca to visit the Ka‘ba {i.e. make the pilgrimage}.27It appears, therefore, that ‘fshıq Yenus labored for years in his shaikh’s tekke;after he obtained spiritual maturity and after legends of his miraculous deedsspread among the people, he departed from there – with Tapduk’s permission,naturally; he visited various countries and then became chief of a dervish order{sajjAda-nishCn} – in all likelihood in a place different from that of his shaikh. Onepoem in his DCwAn alludes to his leaving Tapduk’s dargAh and going to othercountries,28 while another poem states that “dervishes came to him from thecountry of his shaikh.”29 It is evident from all this that Yenus Emre was hisshaikh’s most renowned khalCfa and that after his shaikh’s death his dervishesflocked around Yenus. Thus, Yenus Emre, about whom legends spread through-out Anatolia during his lifetime, lived a rather long time and, after writing manyhymns and orations and seeing them spread among the people, died some timeafter 707/1307.30 Given the documents in our possession, it is, unfortunately,not possible to determine precisely the date of his death.CY§nus Emre’s illiteracyBased on all the documents currently in our possession, we must consider YenusEmre to have been an illiterate dervish. The translator of {Tashköprü-Zade’s}al-ShaqA”iq states, Zâhir-i hâlde okumaXa dili varmayıb, hâme gibi hurûf-ı teheccînin edâsındakâsır olduXu {his tongue could not read in a clear fashion and, like a reed pen, helacked the ability to pronounce the letters of the alphabet}. And ‘fshıq Chelebialleges that Okumak kasdettiXi hâlde, hurûf-ı teheccîyi ikmâle dili dönmediXi {he triedto read, but his tongue did not properly pronounce the letters of the alphabet}.31E. J. W. Gibb, who was unable to add any more to this and reports it verbatim,also concluded that he was illiterate, but Melioransky disagreed and claimed that"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF YjNUS EMRE273Yenus certainly knew how to read and write.32 This issue cannot be resolveduntil proper research is done on similar phenomena in the history of nefism andon the meaning and nature of illiteracy according to the nefcs.In the view of the nefcs, knowledge was divided into two kinds: exotericknowledge, or the knowledge of the SharC“a, and esoteric knowledge, or knowledgeof truth. The nefcs referred to the latter with the special term “irfAn {spiritualknowledge}. The first kind, i.e. primary knowledge, is mediated by the sensesor the intellect and can be transmitted. The source of spiritual knowledge, on theother hand, is divine inspiration {ilhAm}. The madrasas were the centers of exotericknowledge or the knowledge of canonical law, while the tekkes were the centers ofspiritual knowledge, which was obtained from spiritual guides {s. murshid} throughdivine inspiration. This is why the people of the SharC“a were called “the peopleof words” {ahl-i qAl}, while the people of true knowledge {ahl-i RaqCqa} werecalled “the people of mystical states” {ahl-i RAl}.33 Just as anyone could be a legalscholar or physician without being ahl-i “irfAn, i.e. possessor of mystical ecstasy,so anyone, despite inability to read and write, could become “Arif bi”llAh – aknower of God, a mystic. Although some nefcs among the religious scholarstried to show that exoteric knowledge was a necessary basic foundation for esotericknowledge,34 still all the great nefcs unceasingly opposed the ahl-i qAl.35 Indeed,if one were to study the history of nefism, one would find many great nefcs whowere famous for being “illiterate,” yet had spiritual knowledge. The countlessexamples of this phenomenon suffice to prove that Yenus Emre was by no meansexceptional in this respect.36In one of his poems, Yenus Emre speaks boastfully of his illiteracy, sayingYûnus Emrem öldü fakîr / Ecel öfkesini {ensesini in 1st edn} dokur / Gönül kitabındanokur / Eline kalem almadı {My Yenus Emre died a dervish / Death struck him onthe neck / He read from the book of the heart / He did not take pen in hand;this ghazal is not in the standard editions by Gölpınarlı, Yunus Emre: Risâlatal-nushiyya ve Dîvân (Istanbul, 1965) and Faruk Timurtaz, Yûnus Emre Divanı, 3rd edn(Ankara, 1986)}. And in one of his hymns, he reveals the pride he felt in beingilliterate as opposed to the ahl-i qAl, saying Erenlerin sohbeti artırır ma“rifeti / Câhillerisohbetten her dem süresim gelür {Company with the erens increases knowledge / Iwould like to drive away the ignorant ones from the company}. But was YenusEmre in fact such an illiterate dervish that “he could not pronounce the letters ofthe alphabet”? Did he not know how to read and write at all? We cannot acceptat face value Yenus Emre’s confession that he did not take pen in hand, or thereports in the early sources on this matter. It may have been possible for acompletely illiterate dervish to write short hymns, but not a long mathnawC ofalmost 500 couplets, such as the one at the beginning of Yenus Emre’s DCwAn.Still, even though his claim that he could not pronounce the letters of thealphabet may be an exaggeration, it would also be going too far to regard thissimple dervish as a man who was fully literate and who had a madrasa education.As I will explain in the next chapter, there are very clear indications in his workthat he knew well the legends of the prophets and saints, old Iranian mythology,"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE274even the general concepts of the religious knowledge {“ilm} of his day. YenusEmre was not one who delved deeply into Arabic or Persian literature or intothe madrasa sciences. He had neither the Persian eloquence of Jalal al-Dcn Remcnor the profound knowledge of ‘fshıq Pasha. Nevertheless, although this verysimple Turkish dervish, who said Mescid ve medresede çok çok tâ“at kılmıZam / AZkod”una yanuben andan ben kâl”e geldim {I performed a great many acts of piety inthe mosque and madrasa / I was burned in the fire of love and then I cameto speech}, did not have a firm knowledge of the rules of Persian literary style,he surely knew Persian literature sufficiently to enjoy Mawlana’s poems.Otherwise, the strong and clear influence of Mawlana on his work would notbe so obvious.This man, who grasped the nefc philosophy that was prevalent in Anatolia inhis time with a spiritual facility in no way inferior to that of Jalal al-Dcn Remcand who succeeded in expressing it in the simplest terms with unmatched power,certainly did not “lack the ability to pronounce the letters of the alphabet.” Inorder to raise the level of his spirituality to a higher plain, the translator of{Tashköprü-Zade’s} al-ShaqA”iq and ‘Âshıq Chelebi related this report {of hisilliteracy}, which arose from the popular imagination, with full sincerity andconviction, because if this were the case then his poetry could be considered toderive from an altogether divine source.37D His burial place and tombThere is also considerable confusion about the burial place of Yenus Emre,whose place and date of death are unknown. In Muslim countries, even promin-ent figures whose burial places are well known may have various grave sites ortombs – and not just persons like Yenus Emre whose place of death is uncertain.People everywhere wanted important nefcs {to be buried} in their own region sothat they could benefit from their spirituality and holiness. In the East, therefore,there have been many disputes over such sites. The following are the majorburial places and tombs in Anatolia said to belong to Yenus Emre.1.In Bursa, in the dargAh of ‘Abd al-Razzaq of the Sa‘dc UarCqa in the [ibliQuarter between {the districts of } Chelebi Sultan Mehmet and Emir Sultan,there are three tombs in the names of Yenus Emre, ‘fshıq Yenus, and ‘Abdal-Razzaq, along with an inscription. Shaikh Armad ‘Izzc-Zade Sayyid ‘Abd al-Laucf briefly mentions this tomb {of Yenus Emre} in his work KhulATat al-wafayAt,38and Rızâ Tevfik, who visited it, also gives some details about it.39 According totradition, this burial place was originally determined by Murammad NiyazcMitrc based on a spiritual revelation. There are many reasons why it cannot beaccepted as Yenus Emre’s true burial place. First, various authors, such as EvliyaChelebi, ysmâ‘îl Belig, and Lami‘c Chelebi, who, before Niyazc, discuss thoseburied in Bursa and the türbes found there, say nothing of such a türbe. Furthermore,not only is it likely that Yenus Emre died before the conquest of Bursa, but thereis also absolutely no record of his being present at the conquest of that city or"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF YjNUS EMRE275visiting it afterward. In fact, we know quite well the early nefcs who lived inBursa during the years following its conquest. If a renowned nefc like YenusEmre had lived and died there, the authors whom I have mentioned, as wellas the older historians, would surely have recorded this fact. In addition, thereis a report that Yenus Emre had a khalCfa named ‘fshıq Yenus. But this isa dubious tradition of no historical value, because there is no mention of it inthe older historical sources and because it spread among the people at most acentury ago.402.In the province of Manisa, in a village named Emre, composed of seventyhouses lying between the districts of Kula and Sâlihli {i.e. the village of YenusEmre about twenty kilometers west of the town of Kula}, there is a stone türbe.Inside are the graves of Tapduk Emre, his children and grandchildren, and,in front of the threshold, the grave of ‘fshıq Yenus {see photographs, p. 276}.There are no inscriptions on the graves; there is only a small ax carved on thegrave of ‘fshıq Yenus.41 Mehmed Tâhir, who visited this site, says that thisparticular gravestone is at most fifty or sixty years old. In my view, an ax is asymbol related to the famous legend about the firewood that I mentioned above.According to a tradition widespread among the villagers, Yenus, who showedgreat reverence for his shaikh, specifically willed that he be buried at the thres-hold to his tomb, so that those who visited the shaikh would have to tread uponand step over his own grave. The fact is, it cannot be claimed by any means thatthis burial place belongs to Yenus Emre’s shaikh or to Yenus Emre.3.An hour and a half from Erzurum, at the foot of the PalandökenMountains, is the village of Dutcu, which overlooks the Erzurum plain from theeast. In this village is the türbe of Tapduk Emre and Yenus Emre. It is protectedby a wall and furnished with a thick wooden railing. The village and the landsaround it were established as a pious foundation for the dargAh of ‘Alc Baba.After prayers, the villagers of Dutcu always dedicate a FAtiRa to the spirit ofYenus Emre and in summer many people come from Erzurum to visit his tomband recite the hymn Yemen illerinde Veyse”l-Karanî.42 However, we have no historicalevidence that Yenus Emre went to, or settled in, that region. And because weknow that Tapduk Emre lived as a hermit in the Sakarya region, it is impossibleto consider this grave to be Yenus Emre’s true burial place.4.According to a report {told by} ysmâ‘îl Hakkı {d. 1137/1725}, the gravesof Yenus Emre, his shaikh Tapduk Emre, and his shaikh Sinan Efendi are undera dome Kiçiborlu kasabası kurbündeki gadîr-i “azîmin cânib-i Zarkîsinde olan puZte tarafındabir karyede {in a village by a hill east of a large pond near the town of Kiçiborlu}.43This report, which is not found in any other historical source, is not worthy ofany credence. We possess no historical evidence to corroborate it.5.It therefore remains to prefer and accept the fifth and last possibility,namely the report in Lami‘c Chelebi’s translation of { Jamc’s} NafaRAt and itssupplement {Dhail} that Yenus Emre is buried at the confluence of the Porsuk-suyu and the Sakarya. While this report has not been positively proven, itcertainly seems more plausible than the others.44 However, when we recall that"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE276Figure 4The cenotaph of Tapduk Emre in the tomb next to the grave of Yenus Emre.(Photo courtesy of Berrin Dirim.)Figure 3One of the reputed burial sites of Yenus Emre, east of yzmir in the province ofManisa, Turkey.

(Photo courtesy of Berrin Dirim.)"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF YjNUS EMRE277Yenus Emre established a zAwiya in a different place from his shaikh’s residence,this strengthens the likelihood that Tapduk Emre is buried in the place specifiedby Lami‘c and that Yenus Emre was buried in the place mentioned by Shaikhysmâ‘îl Hakkı. The intimacy between shaikh and disciple surely prevented theseparation of the two in the popular imagination, so that one could not helpbut believe they were buried in the same place. In any case, the many graves ofYenus Emre scattered about the vast area of Anatolia are very significant indica-tions of the sanctity ascribed to him by the people. Mehmed Tâhir also states, inaddition to the above, that Yenus has another burial place in Karaman, but hegives no details about it.45E His fameAfter Yenus Emre’s death, he was not quickly forgotten, as were other popularnefcs who were his contemporaries or predecessors. To the contrary, his famespread throughout Anatolia and Rumelia and lived on for centuries amongpeople of all classes. From this point of view, we can certainly regard him as arepresentative of the Turkish genius. In the last chapter, I will explain how thisgreat folk poet created a new type of literature, or, more accurately, how hecombined an old type with his own personality and gave it new life. Therefore,instead of going into literary details here, I would like to prepare the groundfor an internal and literary analysis of his work by showing – to the extent thatthe few documents in our possession allow – how Yenus Emre was viewed bypeople of different classes after his death. For this purpose, let me first examinethe extent of his fame among the nefcs, then his fame among the popular masseswho were directly influenced by these nefcs, and finally the views of him heldby the classic {Turkish} poets who imitated Persian models.By the beginning of the eighth/fourteenth century, Yenus Emre had alreadyacquired many important and respected followers, such as ‘fshıq Pasha andQayghusuz Baba. His fame continued unabated among the nefcs in the ninth/fifteenth century. I have described above, citing the VelAyetnAme, the importantplace that was given to him in the Bektashc tradition, which had been fixed inthat century. We also find Yenus Emre mentioned among the great Bektashcsin the KhaQirnAme, which records and confirms the same tradition.46 Beginningwith histories like that of ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade {d. after 889/1484}, which startedto be written in the tenth/sixteenth century, and then in {Tashköprü-Zade’s}al-ShaqA”iq, {Sa‘d al-Dcn’s} TAj al-tawArCkh, the translation of { Jamc’s} NafaRAt,{‘flc’s} Kunh al-akhbAr, and later histories and biographical dictionaries, Yenus isalways described as a great nefc. Indeed, even Tashköprü-Zade could not refrainfrom mentioning the famous legend about the firewood, which passed intoBektashc tradition.This evidence, however, no matter what its value, cannot be consideredas important as the views advanced by genuine nefcs. For example, there is acurious report in {Hüda’c’s} WAqi“At UftAda that shows what great importance"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE278Yenus Emre had among the nefcs of the tenth/sixteenth century. Supposedly,Jalal al-Dcn Remc confirmed the high rank {of spirituality} that he had reachedby saying, “Whatever levels of spirituality I advanced to, this Turkman elder,Yenus, preceeded me.”47 This legend cannot, of course, be accepted from ahistorical point of view, but it is nevertheless quite significant. On the otherhand, according to this source, the ascetic and devout man Shaikh Uftada, whileinfluenced by Ibn al-‘Arabc, was generally hostile to Yenus’s broad-minded andfree-thinking views.48 The famous Olanlar Shaikhi Ibrahcm Efendi, the authorof the Dil-i Dânâ {MS in Köprülü’s private library}, who died in 1066/1655 – 6,was an admirer of Yenus Emre and he used to say Lisân-ı kadîm üzre ma“nâ icrâeylemiZ er, Yûnus Emre Hazretleri”dir {The man (or, saint) who expressed spiritualmeaning in the old language was his excellency Yenus Emre}.49 Similarly, thefamous Murammad Niyazc Mitrc, the founder of the Mitrc branch of theKhalwatiyya UarCqa who died in 1105/1694, honored and glorified Yenus Emrein some of his poems.50 He also wrote a commentary on his famous hymn thatbegins with the verse Çıktım erik dalına anda yedim üzümü / Bostan ısı kakıyub derne yersin kozumu {I climbed up a plum branch and there ate grapes / The ownerof the garden became angry and said “Why are you eating my walnuts?”}.51ysmâ‘îl Hakkı of Bursa, a nefc writer who appeared after Niyazc, also cited andcommented on several of Yenus Emre’s couplets in his commentary on theMuRammadiyya {of Yazıcı-oxlu Mehmed} and had much praise for him.52 And ina separate work, following Niyazc, he wrote a detailed commentary on YenusEmre’s {aforementioned} hymn.53 All of this material shows that Yenus Emreacquired great fame among the nefcs beginning in the eighth/fourteenth centuryand that, rather than being forgotten, he was glorified and admired moreardently in each succeeding period.Yenus Emre’s great renown among the nefcs also explains how it is that thefame he acquired among the popular masses – who were, for the most part,directly under the influence of the nefcs – flourished unabatedly since the eighth/fourteenth century. Indeed, the presence of his shrines in various places in Anatoliaand the proliferation of legends about him over the centuries fully support thiscontention. We can clearly see the extent of the influence of Yenus Emre’shymns on the people by leafing through the old collections of folk poetry (cönk{see n.54}). We invariably find Yenus’s poems in all these miscellanies, whichspan various periods and belong to people of different cultural levels.54 Just asthe testimony of the captive Mühlbacher in the ninth/fifteenth century shows thatthe hymns of Yenus Emre were already popular during his time, {Hacı Kemal’s}JAmi“ al-naVA ”ir, which belongs to the early years of the tenth/sixteenth century,indicates the importance of these works in the following century. The works ofYenus Emre, which we can regard as a native production with respect to incor-porating artistic elements that appealed to the Turkish national taste, not onlyhad a great influence on the Bektashcs, because they adumbrate a broad-mindedand free-thinking nefc philosophy, but were also deemed significant among theQızılbash Turkmen from an early date. One of Khaua’c’s {i.e. the Safavid Shah"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF YjNUS EMRE279Isma‘cl I, 907–30/1501–24} poems clearly reveals Yenus’s spiritual influence onthese simple Turkmen already at that time.55The Persian-imitating poets, seeing that Yenus’s hymns written in the syllabicmeter were read with great pleasure among the people, feigned indifference tohis work, or belittled it, or showed their spite by considering it to be outside thesphere of poetry. Some of those who wrote biographical dictionaries of poets,and whom we can call our first literary historians, such as Sehî Bey {d. 955/1548 – 49, see EI2, s.v. “Sehc Bey” (G. A. Tekin)} and Laucfc {d. 990/1582, seeEI2, s.v. “Laucfc” (M. Çetin)}, did not find it necessary to mention Yenus Emre,although they discussed many other shaikhs and nefcs who wrote in the “arEQmeter. ‘fshıq Chelebi did devote seven or eight lines to him, following Tashköprü-Zade, but could not refrain from considering his work to be nefc hymns ratherthan poetry. Because an ancient classification made a sharp distinction betweenthe poet and the “Ashıq, i.e. between the artist who was preoccupied withnon-religious subjects and the one who took his inspiration from religion andmysticism,56 the fact that Yenus was known by the nefcs as a great “Ashıq was ahighly respected view. But this notion, in the biased view of the Persian-imitatingpoets, was somewhat belittling, and many of the biographers would not evendescribe him as a nefc. These points suffice to show that the early poets didnot have a very good opinion of him. The author of the Dih-murghnAme, eventhough he was a poet whose work is full of nefc ideas, could not use respectfullanguage with regard to Yenus Emre.57 Similary, Vehbî spoke of his hymnswith downright ridicule and scorn.58 Yet even this attitude, expressed in variousperiods, is significant historically as pointing to Yenus’s unshakable fame amongthe people.Thus, despite the inadequate documentation in our possession, it is clearthat Yenus Emre exercised enormous influence for centuries over the Turksin Anatolia, Rumelia, and even Azerbaijan; and his fame has survived up to thepresent, overcoming all the vicissitudes of his time. This influence, whose causesand consequences I will try to explicate in the last chapter, was not confined tojust one period, one milieu, or a certain class, but was propagated from thehighest intellectual and cultural level down to the lowest and, therefore, we mustrecognize Yenus Emre – after Armad Yasawc – as the most renowned poet toappear among the countless Turkish poets who flourished over the centuries andthe one whose work has been the most enduring. The influence of Yenus Emreon the Anatolia Turks and their mystical folk literature was of the same natureand extent as that of Armad Yasawc on the Eastern Turks. In the followingpages, I will also show the relationship and similarities between the two. The cryof Yemen illerinde Veyse”l-Karanî, which is raised most evenings in the poor andalmost deserted streets of Istanbul and Anatolia in a lonesome and melancholystrain, and the simple and beautiful hymns that issue from the large, broken,iron-grilled windows of the neighborhood schools, and are always recited withspecial melodies in the mevlid assemblies {generally in a mosque or a privatehome} and in the tekkes, show that Yenus Emre is still very much alive among"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE280the people and that he still dominates the popular spirit. Our biographers, whoconsidered art to consist of imitation and artificiality, did not appreciate theimportance of this popular nefc poet because he wrote according to the populartaste in the folk meters and language. But, in fact, he is a most worthy figure ofstudy in our literature. A man whose work is still recited, after six centuries,among all classes of people and in all parts of the country with passion andenthusiasm must surely be considered a rare representative of the national taste.59NOTES1 I have provided some information above on the nature of the Bektashc tradition,on the period of its formation, and on its firm establishment (Chapter 4, pp. 102–5).The Bektashcs tried to increase the prestige of this tradition by mixing historicalpersonalities, such as Sayyid Marmed lairanc, Jalal al-Dcn Remc, and lajjc IbrahcmSuluan, who had won fame in Anatolia in the seventh/thirteenth century, into theirown legends. Not only are legends about these figures found in the velAyetnAmes, theyare also mentioned in a long poem entitled KhaQirnAme that {the Bektashc saint}Muryc ’l-Dcn wrote in 880/1475 – 6 {MS in Köprülü’s private library}. The waq fdocument of Sayyid Marmed lairanc, which was drawn up in 655/1257–8, and thatof lajjc Ibrahcm Suluan, which was drawn up in 665/1266 –7, have survived to thepresent and are still in force. Consequently, the historical nature of these personalitiesand their time is fairly well known. Here I only want to point out, in particular, thatthose nefcs who were genuine historical figures and were mentioned as having arelationship with lajjc Bektash lived in either the seventh/thirteenth or early eighth/fourteenth century.2 Unfortunately, the linguistic research that has been done to date on the word emre hasnot yielded anything very definite. Let me simply describe the various theories thathave been proposed on this matter and indicate the one that I support. Hammer readthis word as a variant of imre in his famous Geschichte der osmanischen Dichtkunst {bis aufunsere Zeit (Pest, 1836 – 8)} and wanted to equate it with the same word in Hungarianmeaning “Ashıq. He indicates this by translating it into German as emmerich. NecibÂsım says that this word, which was used in the form amrak, emre in Turkish and imrein Hungarian, means “Ashıq. Rızâ Tevfik also simply accepts Hammer’s theory, saying“There is no doubt that imre means “Ashıq, that is, ‘poet’; other meanings are randomconjectures that can be easily rejected,” ({Yûnus Emre hakkında biraz daha tafsilât,”}Büyük Duygu, nos 10–13, {1 (1331/1913),} p. 178). However, as Karl Foy has quiterightly objected, this is a very whimsical explanation that is based on no evidencewhatsoever (“Die ältesten osmanischen Transscriptionstexte in gothischen Lettern,”p. 237). Indeed, as Foy also very correctly writes, the forms emre or emrem are found inall the early texts having vowel marks, but the form imre is not. J. H. Mordtmannagrees with this and gives the following noteworthy information on this subject:“The exact meaning of the word emre is not known. The former owner of the copyof T. Bianchi’s dictionary {Dictionnaire Turc-Français (1835; reprinted Paris, 1871)} thatis in my possession records next to this word that it meant ‘brother’ in old Turkish,but he does not give an example. I can give one, however. In the introduction to theferman {edict} given to Ghazc Evrenos Bey, and published by Diez {‘Murat I, Sultanof the Turks. Abschrift [und Text] der Stiftungs- und Statthalterschafts-Urkunde...,’Denkwürdigkeiten von Asien, 2 (1815), 101–32}, the word occurs in the meaning of‘brother,’ ” ({“Türkisches zu Foy’s ‘älteste osmanische Transscriptionstexte,’ ” BerlinUniversität, Seminar für Orientalische Sprachen, Mitteilungen, Westasiatische Studien, 5 (1902),}"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF YjNUS EMRE281p. 168). Mordtmann goes on to say that this word was written in different ways – suchas emrem, emirem, emir, emre – in various copies of this ferman. It is found, in fact, as emrein the copy of this ferman in Ferîdûn Bey’s MünZeat (MünZeat-ı selâtîn {Istanbul, 1274/1857– 8}, vol. 1, p. 87); as emir in a manuscript copy that appears to have been writtenin the eleventh/seventeenth century and is in my private library; and as emrem in aberat {sultanic diploma, letter-patent} in the Königlichen Bibliothek zu Berlin {nowthe Staatsbibliothek} and published by F. Kräelitz ({“ylk osmanlı padizahlarının ısdaretmiz oldukları bazı beratlar,”} TOEM, no. 28 {1330/1912}, p. 246). In a footnote,Kräelitz states that this word is a mistake for emirem, but this is a strictly subjectiveinterpretation. If we refer to the opinions of the early writers on this matter, we findthat the author {Mehmed b. Ahmed Nizânci-Zâde} of Mir”At al-kA”inAt {MS 2420 inthe Nuruosmaniye Library in Istanbul} says that the word emre means “eldest brother,”thus supporting Mordtmann’s opinion. In my view, the opinion of Shaikh Isma‘cllaqqc Bursawc {Bursalı Shaikh ysmâ‘îl Hakkı, d. 1137/1725, see EI2, s.v. “Isma‘cllassc” (Günay Kut)} is perhaps closest to the truth. He says, Emre zâhir budur kiTürkî”de elkâb-ı medihdendir. Etrâk arasında Atabeg ve Rûmiyân meyânında lala ve emsâli gibi{Evidently emre is an honorific title in Turkish, similar to atabeg among the Turksand to lala and the like among the Ottomans} ({erh-i Rumûzât-ı Yûnus Emre, copy in myprivate library). This explanation of the word emre shows rather clearly that theword emrem in the berat {in this case granted by Bayezid I (1389–1402)} of Evrenos(Evren-uz) {this etymology is dubious; see EI2, s.v. “Ewrenos” (Irène Mélikoff )} Bey,was used instead of atabeg-i devlet {“father bey of state,” minister} and indeed meant“elder brother.” We know that in addition to titles like ata and bAbA for Turkishshaikhs, the word akhC was especially used at that time in the meaning “brother.” It isvery likely that the words emre and emrem were the Turkish equivalents of the titles akhand akhC. Despite all my research to date, I have found no additional information toshed light on this subject, in either the major contemporary linguistic sources, such as{Abe layyan al-Gharnauc’s} KitAb al-idrAk li-lisAn al-atrAk {712/1313}, {the anonymous}TarjumAn-i turkC wa “arabC {743/1343, ed. Houtsma as Ein türkisch-arabisches Glossar}, and{the anonymous} al-TuRfa al-zakiyya fC ”l-lugha al-turkiyya {eighth/fourteenth century,ed. T. Halasi-Kun as La Langue des Kiptchaks (Budapest, 1942),} or in {al-Kashgarc’s}DCwAn lughAt al-turk {begun in 464/1072 and completed in 469/1077}. If the seventh/thirteenth- and eighth/fourteenth-century works from Anatolia that are in our pos-session were subjected to lengthy and detailed linguistic analysis, or if valuable newdocuments from that period were to appear, perhaps this minor linguistic problem,like a great many others, could be more definitely solved. The views that I haveadvanced are the most defensible based on our current knowledge.3 Sarı Isma‘cl was very famous in the Bektashc tradition. He was one of the leadingkhalCfas of lajjc Bektash. One comes across a great many legends concerning himin the velAyetnAmes, but unfortunately we have no information on his {true} historicalexistence. But if we consider how the Bektashc tradition was created by blending theavailable legends, we can grant the possibility that a dervish with this name livedin western Anatolia in the seventh/thirteenth century or early years of the eighth/fourteenth century.4 According to the Bektashc velAyetnAmes and the KhaQirnAme, Qaraja Armad was one ofthe great saints of Anatolia who received spiritual enlightenment from lajjc Bektash.{Tashköprü-Zade’s} al-ShaqA”iq also mentions him among the high officials duringthe reign of Orhan. According to that source, his father was a king of the country ofthe Persians. He himself went to Anatolia because he was overwhelmed by mysticalrapture. He lived and died near Akhisar. Subsequently, his tomb gained fame amongthe people for curing the ill (al-ShaqA”iq, {Turkish} trans., vol. 1, p. 33). Citing Bektashctradition, ‘flc also describes his importance, Ol tarihte Rûm-erenleri”nin kutb-ı nâm-dârı"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE282Karaca Ahmed Sultân idi; Sivrihisar”da sâkin Seyyid Nûre”d-Dîn nâm “umde-i vâsılîn terbiyesiyleseccâde-niZîn olmuZtu, asrında elliyedi bin mürîd-i hidâyet-nüvîd, Karaca Ahmed Sultân”in taht-ıhükmünde bedîd idi {At that time, the most famous of the saints of Anatolia was QarajaArmad Suluan. He became the chief of a religious order under the tutelage of aleading mystic named Sayyid Ner al-Dcn, who lived in Sivrihisar. During his time,57,000 disciples seeking spiritual guidance appeared under the authority of QarajaArmad Suluan} (Kunh al-akhbAr, vol. 5, p. 55). E. J. W. Gibb thought that there wasgood reason to doubt the veracity of ‘flc’s information on the shaikhs of this earlyperiod. Of course, if he had known that this information derived from the BektashcvelAyetnAmes, he would not have given it any credence.5 Lexicons such as {Abe layyan al-Gharnauc’s} al-IdrAk, {the anonymous} al-TuRfatal-zakiyya, and {the anonymous} TarjumAn-i turkC wa “arabC, which are the most import-ant linguistic sources for this period, give the following definitions: tapmak = to find;tapıZmak = to get together, to meet; tapZırmak = to bring people together, to have peoplemeet; tapu, tabu = service; serving God, worship; tapu eylemek = to serve; tapuci, tabuci =servant. The semantic development through which this word – which today we alsouse to mean “to worship” – gradually passed appears here very clearly. This word wasfirst used simply with the meaning “to seek out.” Then it gradually began to expressthe concept “to seek out God, to reach God, to adore and worship God.” MehmedTâhir Bursawc {Bursalı Tâhir} says that in the vicinity of Erzurum the word tapdakis used to mean “smooth, even” {düz, ârızasız} (Osmanlı müellifleri {Istanbul, 1334 – 43/1916 –25}, p. 194 {sic; it is unlikely that this has anything to do with tapduk}). Theexplanation given here suffices to indicate the meaning of tapduk during the period inquestion {i.e. served, worshipped}.6VelAyetnAme-i LAjjC Bektash VelC, fo. 30 (cited from the copy in my private library{see the Gölpınarlı edn, p. 21}). This is also mentioned in the section entitled {Concerning the arrival of lajjcBektash in Anatolia by permission of Khwaja Armad Yasawc} in the versified versionof the VelAyetnAme {also in Köprülü’s private library}. Originally written in prose byFirdevsc {-i Rumi, d. after 1500}, this work was later versified in approximately 6000couplets by a novice poet with the pen name Nihanc at the behest of Faiq AllahEfendi, a descendant of lajjc Bektash. The historian ‘flc also mentions this legend inhis history, citing the VelAyetnAme (Kunh, vol. 5, p. 56).7 Citing the section entitled {Con-cerning lajjc Bektash Veli’s sending Yenus Emre to Tapduk Emre} in Nihanc’sversified version of the VelAyetnAme. The historian ‘flc also briefly reports this story ofthe VelAyetnAme in the sentence Yûnus Emre hizmet-i âlîlerinde iken terbiyetini Tapduk Emre”yebunlar buyurmuZlardır {While Yenus Emre was in the service of the exalted one (i.e.lajjc Bektash), he ordered him to receive his training from Tapduk Emre} ({Kunh,vol. 5,} p. 57). In the prose version of the VelAyetnAme, there are a few more minordetails on this subject that were ignored when this work was rendered into verse.According to this text, Yenus was occupied with plowing and sowing at a place calledSarı-göl north of Sivrihisar; and after he entered the service of Tapduk Emre, hecarried wood on his back for fully forty years for the convent (VelAyetnAme, fo. 68 {seethe Gölpınarlı edn, pp. 48 –9}).8 In addition to these, we also find in the poetry of Yenus Emre the pen names MiskcnYenus, Dervish Yenus, Koja Yenus, or simply Yenus. We encounter the same kind ofthing; that is, a poet using various forms of his pen name, with Armad Yasawc. Nohistorical authority can be given to the reports that Yenus Emre had a khalCfa named‘fshıq Yenus. While discussing the burial places and graves of Yenus Emre below, Iwill state the source of this report, which appears at the beginning of the publishededition of his DCwAn. The Russian Orientalist Melioransky also mentions an ‘fshıq"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF YjNUS EMRE283Yenus as a disciple of Yenus Emre, but this results from his uncritical acceptance ofthis report in the DCwAn (“K voprosu o znachenii i proiskhozhdenii slov ‘chäläb’(chalap) i ‘chäläbi’ v turetskom iazyke,” {ZVO, (St Petersburg), 15 (1902–3), pp. 36 –43}). The mCm () at the end of the word emre’m is the possessive pronoun like that atthe end of the words paZam and hacım. It is not part of the original word. Indeed, weknow of various examples of contemporary nefcs who had such additions to theirnames. Thus, ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade mentions ‘fshıq Pasham and Kochum Seydî({TawArCkh-i Al-i “uthmAn,} p. 199). Another well known example is lajjim Suluan, akhalCfa of lajjc Bektash, many of whose legends have been recorded and even published.9Al-ShaqA”iq, among the personalities of the fourth Uabaqa, published on the marginsof Ibn Khallikan, p. 119 {i.e. published on the margins of the Belaq edition ofthe WafayAt in 1300/1882}. Al-ShaqA”iq, {Turkish} trans., and supplement {LadA”iq},vol. 1, p. 78.10 Based on the couplet Tarîh dahi yediyüz yedi idi / Yûnus cânı bu yolda kodı idi {The datewas 707 (1307–8) / when Yenus set his heart on this path}, which is found in YenusEmre’s DCwAn and to which Walad Chelebi first drew attention, the Orientalist E. J. W.Gibb considers him to be a nefc who lived at the end of the seventh/thirteenth andbeginning of the eighth/fourteenth century (A History of Ottoman Poetry, vol. 1 {, p. 165}).Mehmed Tâhir and Necib Âsım agree with this (Mehmed Tâhir, Aydın vilâyetinemensûb ricâlin terâcim-i ahvâli {(Izmir, 1324/1906), new ed. M. Akıf Erdoxru (Izmir,1994)}, the section on Yenus Emre; Osmanlı müellifleri, vol. 1, p. 193; Âsım, Millî arûz,[Istanbul, 1329/1911], p. 7). Melioransky, who was aware of studies on Yenus Emreby Gibb, Foy, and Mordtmann and who also had recourse to {Tashköprü-Zade’s}al-ShaqA”iq and {Shams al-Dcn Samc’s} QAmEs al-a“lAm, gives the following opinion inorder to defend the information on Yenus Emre provided by al-ShaqA”iq and refuteGibb: “Reading these couplets, Mr Gibb concludes that the date given by Tashköprü-Zade is mistaken and that Yenus Emre lived a hundred years before that date. Inmy view, however, such a deduction is baseless. The problem arises from the factthat, shortly before these couplets, there are other couplets praising uprightness. Con-sequently, in my view, we are completely justified in saying that what this coupletstates is that Yenus Emre should be included among the murCds of Tapduk Emre, whois called NARib-i irshAd {the one who guides on the right path} by Tashköprü-Zade.How old could Yenus have been when he set out on this path? I cannot answer thisquestion directly, but it is worthy of note that the Central Asian nefcs joined the UarCqasat a very young age. As Gibb has stated, for example, the famous Khwaja ArmadYasawc, who has some points in common with Yenus Emre, says several times that heentered the service of Shaikh Arslan Baba at the age of seven. Thus, there is somebasis for us to conclude that Yenus Emre was a child when he entered the UarCqa in707 {1307– 8}. In that case, he could undoubtedly have lived until the early years ofthe sultanate of Bayezid I. If we were eventually to learn that 707 was simply YenusEmre’s date of birth, I personally would not be the least surprised” (Melioransky,“K voprosu o znachenii”). Hammer’s discussion of this matter is very confusingand erroneous. In one place in his book {Geschichte der osmanischen Dichtkunst}, hewrites, without giving a source, that he was a poet during the reign of Süleyman theMagnificent (926 –74/1520 – 66), while in another he indicates that he was a poet ofthe eleventh/seventeenth century. Similarly, he mentions these two Yenus Emres inthe index as the same person, but he says nothing about when they lived. G. Flügelalso considers him to be a poet of the tenth/sixteenth century (Mordtmann, “Türkischeszu Foy’s”).11 Indeed, in this tradition, which was fixed in such works as the VelAyetnAme and KhaQirnAme,he is always mentioned among nefcs of the seventh/thirteenth century. A few of these,such as Qaraja Armad and Yenus Emre, could have lived into the eighth/fourteenth"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE284century. In my opinion, this evidence of the Bektashc tradition is very valuable andworthy of credence in determining the time when Yenus Emre lived.12‘fshıq Pasha-Zade, TawArCkh-i Al-i “uthmAn, pp. 199 –200.13 If there were no other evidence, by itself this would mean nothing, for it is alsooccasionally reported, mistakenly, in the JAmi“ al-naVA ”ir that an earlier poet composedimitations {naVA ”ir} of another poet who came after him. But when this is added to theother evidence, Hacı Kemal’s testimony on this matter gains additional value.14 Foy, “Die ältesten osmanischen Transscriptionstexte in gothischen Lettern,” 4 (1901).In this work, entitled Tractat, which appeared in the fifteenth century, had manyreaders as late as the seventeenth century, and was published in many editions, thereis, among some miscellaneous information on the Turks, the text of two hymns bya poet named Yenus. They are written in Gothic letters and are accompanied bya Latin translation. Foy devoted extensive research to these hymns (ibid., 4 [1901], 5[1902]), especially with regard to linguistic history. They also attracted the attentionof J. H. Mordtmann, M. Hartmann, Brockelmann, and Houtsma. Foy did not believethat these hymns belonged to Yenus Emre, but they must in fact be his, as Mordtmannand Hartmann conceded. Anyone who is somewhat familiar with the works of YenusEmre will conclude that, linguistically and stylistically, the passages that I will includein the next chapter can only be attributed to Yenus Emre. Furthermore, in thatperiod, there was no other nefc poet named Yenus to whom it might be possible toattribute these works. The anonymous recorder of these hymns, who was only fifteenor sixteen years old when taken prisoner at the Ottoman capture of the fortressof Mühlbach and who remained among the Turks a full twenty years, being soldseventeen times, states that he knew Turkish language and literature very well andthat Turkish khwAjas {masters, religious scholars} even took lessons from him. IfYenus Emre, who lived in one corner of Anatolia, had died in 843/1439 – 40 – that is,one year before Mühlbacher was taken prisoner – his works would not have beensufficiently widespread and famous for him to know about them and to record andtranslate in preference to other works of this kind. To my way of thinking, this problemcan be solved very easily. It is quite natural that the hymns of Yenus Emre, who livedone century earlier than Melioransky conjectured, whose legends were famous enoughto enter Bektashc tradition, whose historical personality had been forgotten, and whoseworks had spread in all directions, would have been recorded and translated byMühlbacher in preference to other such works. On the one hand, this reveals thefame of Yenus Emre at that time and, on the other, it supports Mühlbacher’s claimthat he knew the contemporary literature of the Turks fairly well. Hammer alsomentions Mühlbacher’s captivity and his work, which was first printed in 1530(Hammer, {Geschichte des osmanischen Reiches, Turkish} trans., vol. 2, pp. 205, 350).15 In certain poems in the various printed and manuscript copies of Yenus Emre’sDCwAn, one finds praise and veneration of, or else allusions to, some of the great nefcswho came after Yenus Emre, such as lajjc Bayram Veli or Amcr Suluan. In the hymnwith the refrain Bize derviZler geldi {The dervishes came to us}, for example, lajjcBayram is mentioned.Hacı Beyram-Yli”ndeBergüzâr var elinde{eker damlar dilindeBize derviZler geldi{In the province of lajjc Bayram, With gifts in their hands, With sugar dripping fromtheir tongues, The dervishes came to us.} Now, lajjc Bayram died in 833/1429 –30.Similarly, there are passages in Yenus Emre’s DCwAn that describe Shaikh Shamsal-Dcn Murammad b. ‘Alc lusain al-Bukharc, known as Amcr Suluan, who died in thesame year, such as the poems that end with the following couplets:"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF YjNUS EMRE285Bahr-i isyândan halâs olmaX için ihlâs ileSıdk ile Sultân Emîr”in eteXini tutalımYûnus Emre söyler sözü, âZık olmuZ gönlü gözüUnutman duâdan bizi Emîr Sultân Türbesi”ndeYûnus sana cândan tutmuZtur özüHem mübârek rûhuna sürer yüzüEfendim ceddine ulaZtır biziYeZil tonlu Emîr Sultân merhabâ{To be rescued from the sea of rebellion, with sincerity,With honesty, let us grasp the skirt of Suluan Amcr.Yenus Emre says the words.

Would not the factthat Yenus Emre recited poetry about these nefcs who died in 833 confirm the viewthat he died in 843 rather than the idea advanced by Melioransky that he was born in707? {Still,} as I will demonstrate in detail when speaking of Yenus Emre’s DCwAnin the next chapter, the DCwAn currently in our possession is not composed entirely ofpassages belonging to Yenus Emre. The works of a number of subsequent poets –even including other poets with the pen name Yenus – are mixed into it. Therefore,we can definitely conclude that neither the passages concerning lajjc Bayram northose concerning Amcr Suluan were written by Yenus Emre.16 It is clearly stated in the Bektashc tradition that he was from Sivrihisar. The translatorof {Tashköprü-Zade’s} al-ShaqA”iq writes that he was from Bolu (p. 78), whereas theauthor of that work does not specifically state where he was from, but simply statesthat he was a disciple of Tapduk Emre (on the margins of Ibn Khallikan, {WafayAt,}vol. 1, p. 119). Shams al-Dcn Samc indicates that he lived at the confluence of theSakarya and Porsuk rivers, but Melioransky disagrees and claims that this resultedfrom emending the information provided by Tashköprü-Zade on Tapduk Emre. Thetruth is that this account in Samc’s QAmEs al-a“lAm derives from the material aboutthe tomb of Yenus Emre given in Lami‘c’s supplement to his {Turkish} translation of{Jamc’s} NafaRAt (NafaRAt trans., p. 691). Because I will discuss his tomb at lengthbelow, I will not go into the subject here. Let me simply say that, although it is notpossible to assert with certainty where Yenus Emre was from, it could not be farwrong to believe that he was born in the vicinity of Bolu.17 In the works of Yenus Emre, there are quite a few passages showing this. Shaikh{Shams al-Dcn} Murammad Niyazc Mitrc {d. 1105/1694, see EI2, s.v. “Niyazc”(F. Babinger); Baha Doxramacı, Niyazi-yi Mısri hayatı ve eserleri (Ankara, 1988); MustafaKara, Niyazi-i Mısri (Ankara, 1994); and Derin Terzioxlu, “Sufi and Dissident in theOttoman Empire: Niyazi-i Misri (1618 –1694),” dissertation, Harvard University, 1999},for example, also supports this notion in the commentary that he wrote on the poem"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE286Çıktım erik dalına anda yidim üzümü / Bostan ısı kakıyıb der ne yersin kozumu {I climbed upthe plum tree branch and there ate grapes / The garden’s owner became angry andsaid, “Why are you eating my walnuts?”}, which was very famous among the nefcs:Ymdi Azîz”in bu beyitten muradları, mürZîdsiz ben Zarî“at ve tarîkat ve hakîkati kendi bildiXimin ileindîce sülûk edüb vâsıl-ı Hak olurum diye sa“y edenlerin ahvâlini temsîl tarîkiyle beyân etmektir.Yâni, böyle eden kimsenin hâl-ü Zânı, kangı meyve ne Zecerden bittiXin bilmeyib, gönlü üzüm istedikte,erik aXacından biter diye erik aXacından arayan, gönlü erik istedikte ceviz aXacından erik biter diyeceviz aXacına çıkan bî-akl kimseler gibi olur.

In otherwords, the condition of someone who does this is like that of those who do not knowwhat fruit grows from which tree. They are like ignorant ones who, desiring grapes,look for them on a plum tree because that is where they think they grow, or desiringplums climb up a walnut tree because that is where they think they grow. This is likesomeone who is blind thinking that all colors are black. The saint must have com-pared this situation to his own. He once exerted himself in this way without a spiritualguide, but he was unable to achieve anything. Then he attached himself to a perfectguide (and was successful)} (commentary {SharR-i nuUuq-i YEnus Emre} published on themargins of the DCwAn of Yenus Emre {Belaq, 1254/1838 –9}).18‘fshıq Pasha-Zade, TawArCkh-i Al-i “uthmAn, p. 200; {Tashköprü-Zade,} al-ShaqA”iq,p. 119; al-ShaqA”iq, {Turkish} trans., vol. 1, p. 78; {Sa‘d al-Dcn,} TAj al-tawArCkh, vol. 2,p. 429.

I will discuss this problem below while dealing with the burial places ofYenus Emre.19 This is a legendary report that is widespread among the dervishes, but it has nohistorical value. One or two hymns in the DCwAn of Yenus Emre, which have therefrains Abdü”l-Kâdir gibi bir er bulunmaz {There is no er like ‘Abd al-Qadir} and Mededet Sultânım {eyh Abdü”l-Kâdir {Shaikh ‘Abd al-Qadir is my helper and sultan}, havegiven rise, I think, to the belief that both Yenus Emre and his shaikh were Qadircs(Mehmed Tâhir, Osmanlı müellifleri, vol. 1, p. 192). We have no knowledge, however, ofthe presence of the Qadiriyya in Anatolia at that time. There were then Rifa‘c tekkes inAnatolia, so it would be more reasonable to assert that they were Rifa‘cs. As will beseen from the discussion in the next chapter on Yenus’s DCwAn, it is virtually certainthat these hymns do not belong to Yenus Emre. {On the hymn with the formerrefrain, see Mustafa Tatçı, ÂZık Yunus ve diXer Yunusların Ziirleri (Ankara, 1991), p. 61.}20 Shaikh ysmâ‘îl Hakkı gives the following important account on this matter: NezîlolduXum Bursa”dan bitarîkı”l-hac Antakya tarafına sevk-ı esb-i “azîmet edib kasaba-i mezbûrenevâhîsinden mürurumda orada mâder-zâd olan ehl-i tarîkatten birine mülâkî oldum.

I met a memberof the UarCqa who was native to that place and I lent an ear to his pearl-like words.He said: “A long time ago, when the storm-wind of disquiet and suffering blew in theregion of Bukhara from the invasion of the Turks (i.e. Mongols) and the petals of thesaints were blown helter-skelter from the rose-garden palace of their residence, oneof them, a saint of mankind named Shaikh Sinan Efendi, traveling in the wilderness ofwandering, sojourned in the (future) village of Shaikh Yenus Emre and became thespiritual guide of Tapduk Emre. Some time later, Yenus Emre appeared and servedTapduk outwardly and inwardly, drinking from the cup of abundant enlightenment.As he states: ‘Yenus was a falcon / he alighted on Tapduk’s hand / he went huntingand in search of prey / this was not a nesting bird’ ”} (commentary {SharR-i rumEzAt-iYEnus Emre} on the same ghazal, same folio). Although this dervish tradition, recordedtwo centuries ago, is not to be found in any other source, that is no reason tocompletely discount its importance. The time when Tapduk Emre was alive correspondsquite well with the time when Shaikh Sinan of Bukhara arrived in Anatolia aftermigrating because of the Mongol invasion. According to the account that I gave inthe first part of this book on the spread of the Yasawiyya, it is quite likely that thisshaikh was a Yasawc dervish. We cannot exclude the possibility that the influence ofArmad Yasawc, which is frequently encountered in the works of Yenus Emre, can bepartially ascribed to this event.21 Tashköprü-Zade records this in particular,{There was not a single piece of bent firewood. When the shaikh asked him aboutthis, he said, “Nothing crooked is worthy of this gate,” al-ShaqA”iq, Furat edn p. 57}.The translator also cites this, embellishing it with a stroph of Persian that discussesthe benefits of uprightness. In the history of nefcsm up to the time of the Bektashctradition, one often finds incidents similar to this story of the firewood. In the legendsof certain Yasawc shaikhs, it is stated that they reached the rank of spiritual guide bycarrying wood to the dervish dargAh ({lazcnc,} JawAhir, p. 279). Similar things arefound in the legends of other nefcs. When Shaikh Abe ’l-Ghaib Jamcl al-Yamanc wentout into the open country to collect wood, a lion ate his donkey. As punishment, heloaded his wood on the lion and brought it in ({Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans.,p. 641). Similarly, Sayyid Armad al-Bukharc was the wood gatherer for the famousylâhî-i Simâvc dargAh (ibid., p. 466). {It is curious that Köprülü did not link this storywith the accounts of lakcm Ata.}22 Thus, in various copies of his DCwAn, I have come across such passages as the follow-ing: ÂZık Yûnus girdi yola / UXradı Tapduk Emre”ye / Her dem ciXer kanı ile / Vasf-ı hâlim yazaroldu {The lover Yenus entered upon the path / He visited Tapduk Emre / Everymoment with his heart’s blood / He writes the attribute “the Forbearing”}; Yûnuseydür azıklıyım / Tapduk”umuz dost yüzüdür / YZte bu söze inanmayan / Bunda bulsun ettiXini{Yenus says: I am provided for the journey / Our Tapduk is the face of the Friend /Those who do not believe these words / Will find what they have done here (i.e. willget their just deserts in this world?)}; Yûnus Emre”m sen tek otur / Da“vâ-yı ma“nâyı bitür /Tapduk”leyin bir er getür / Câna baZa kalmaz ola {Yenus Emre, you sit quiet / Finish yourclaim to (spiritual) meaning / Bring a man (or, saint) like Tapduk / Let nothing remain(?) for soul and head}; Yûnus sen Tapduk”a kılgıl duâlar / ÂZıklar meydânı “arZ”dan uludur{Yenus, recite benedictions for Tapduk / The field of the lovers is bigger than God’sthrone}; Miskîn Yûnus bu sözü cân içinde söyledi / Söyleyen de bî-haber Tapduk Emre kârıdır{Miserable Yenus said these words in his soul / The sayer was unaware that it wasthe work of Tapduk Emre}; Yûnus sen Tapduk”una kıl duâlar / Yçme sen zehr-i kâtil aZk"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE288elinden {Yenus, recite benedictions for Tapduk / Do not drink lethal poison from thehand of Love}; AZk sultânı Tapduk”tur, Yûnus gedâ ol kapuda / Gedâlara lûfteylemek kâidedirSultâna {The sultan of Love is Tapduk and Yenus is a beggar at the gate / Kindnessto beggars is a rule for sultans}; Yûnus”tur bunu söyleyen / Tapduk”a kulluk eyleyen / Dinyoksulun bay eyleyen / Ol Subhâna”llâh deXil mi {It is Yenus who says this / Who servesTapduk / Is it not that Praise of God / Who makes rich the one who is poor inreligion?}; Yûnus yine esrüdi Tapduk yüzün görelden / MeXer anın elinden bir cur“a Zerbet içmiZ{Again Yenus has been intoxicated, ever since he saw Tapduk’s face / Perhaps he hasdrunk a cup of wine at his hand}; Miskîn Yûnus biliZeli / Cân-ü gönül veriZeli / Tapduk”umaeriZeli / Gizlü râzım açar oldum {Ever since miserable Yenus became acquainted / Eversince he gave up heart and soul / Ever since I attained Tapduk / I have begun toreveal my secrets}; Sorun Tapduk”lu Yûnus”a bu dünyâdan ne anladı / Bu dünyânın kararı yok,sen ne imiZ, ben ne imiZ {Ask Tapduk’s Yenus what he understands of this world / Thisworld has no stability.

Nicholson) “Thosephantasies which ensnare the saints are the reflection of the fair ones of the gardenof God”; and Yenus Emre’s verse, “Yenus was a falcon. . . etc.,” the answer is: by“phantasies” (khayAlAt) he means external reality, which is the reflection and the traceof the divine attributes; by “snare of the saints and the mystics” he means that eachone is the locus (= place of manifestation) of one of His names and attributes, so thatif people of insight look at it, that is a kind of hunting for witness (of the divine). Themystics’ hunt for this prey actually results from he himself being the prey of God(= divine Truth)} (commentary on the MuRammadiyya, p. 111).23 While commenting on a couplet in the MuRammadiyya, ysmâ‘îl Hakkı says, Nâzımınkelâmında iZâret vardır ki mazmûnu üzre bu yolun yetîmi ola.

If the question is asked, how can one who found thespiritual guidance of Shaikh lajjc Bayram be an orphan and stay uveysi-meZreb [i.e.be of the “school” of Uways al-Qaranc, a contemporary of the Prophet who livedin Yemen and reached illumination without a guide, see Schimmel, Mystical Dimensionsof Islam (Chapel Hill, NC, 1975), pp. 28, 89, 105], the answer is this, that the followerof a mystic path needs guidance on that path for as long as forty years. As for theguidance of lajjc Bayram, it did not last that long. Similarly, Shaikh [Muryc ’l-DcnMurammad] Uftada Bursawc remained in the company of Hızır Dede for abouteight years, but after Hızır Dede’s death, when he reached the last desired stage [ofspiritual development], he suffered great difficulties. And again, after the aforesaidUftada died [988/1580], Shaikh [Marmed b. Faql Allah b. Marmed] Hüda’c [hiskhalCfa, d. 1038/1628–9, see EI2, s.v. “Hüda’c” (I. Beldiceanu-Steinherr)] also encoun-tered many tribulations, as one gathers from some hymns that he recited in the formof entreaty. In short, most of the men of the mystic path remained orphans, butbecause they had drunk at the hand of men of pure character they became the objectof God’s spiritual guidance and were not deprived of the chastisement referred toin the maxim, “God chastised me and did well” [in other words, God punished meand it was an act of kindness on His part to do so]} (commentary on the MuRammadiyya,p. 255). It appears that Yenus Emre was fortunate: by spending forty years withhis shaikh, he successfully completed all the stages of the path, and so did not remainan orphan.24 In several of Yenus’s poems, we find passages showing that he traveled in thisway from country to country. For example: Gel ey Yûnus-ı bîçâre / Var derdine eyle çâre /Gezin Zöyle Zardan Zara / Yoktur garCb benciliyin {Come, oh helpless Yenus / Go, find helpfor your ailment / Wander thus from city to city / There is no homeless one like me}.As a rule among the nefcs, except for those who preferred solitude and seclusion, itwas an old custom to visit various places and travel abroad. Among the people ofAnatolia, there is a widespread legend about Yenus Emre. Supposedly, his shaikh,for some reason, ordered him to travel for forty years. After wandering about for a fullforty years, he returned to his shaikh’s dargAh. Finding Ana Baji – that is, his shaikh’swife – he asked her his shaikh’s opinion of him. She said, “Tomorrow at the time ofthe morning prayer, lie down on the shaikh’s path. The shaikh, of course, will ask mewho you are. I will say to him, ‘Yenus.’ If he asks, ‘Is this our Yenus?’ understand thatyour ordeal has finally come to an end.” The next morning Yenus took this adviceand lay down on the path. When his shaikh asked, “Is this our Yenus?” he understoodthat his ordeal had finally come to an end, and as a gesture of thanks he fell at hisshaikh’s feet. From that day forward, by order and permission of his shaikh, he beganto recite those famous hymns. This legend, which is quite reminiscent of an earlierlegend concerning Zangc Ata and Sayyid Ata in the first part of this book, Chapter 4,pp. 89–94, and the Bektashc legend in section A of this chapter agree in showing thepoetry of Yenus Emre to be completely of divine origin.25Hakîkat erenleri gitti dünyâdan her biriKonya”da Mevlânâ HudâvendiXâr yatur"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE290Yûnus sen de ölürsün, kara yere girersinMürZidlerin ulu”su ol Emre Sultân yatur{The saints of truth have gone from this world, every oneIn Konya the lordly Mawlana lies buriedYou too will die, Yenus, and enter the black earthThe great one of the murshids, that Emre Suluan lies buried.}26Emr-i mürZid ile oldum {âm”a revâneNe mümkindir gide {âm”a böyle dîvâneMurâd olan Anteb imiZ çıktı beyâneYûnus bir nutuk söyledi Anteb”de (!?){By order of my murshid, I went to Sham (Syria or Damascus)How is it possible for such a madman to go to Sham?It turned out that by Sham he meant ‘AyntabSo Yenus delivered an oration in ‘Ayntab.}27 As, for example, in the poems that begin: Rûm”dan çıktım yürüdüm, mûm olup sızdım eridim/ {ükür Hakk”a yüzler sürdüm ne güzel Ka“be yolları {I set out from Rem and walked,I became a candle and melted / Thanks to God, I rubbed my face (in the dust of )the roads to the Ka‘ba the beautiful} and Edüb niyyet gittik Ka“be iline / Vardık tavâf ettikEl-hamdü li”llâh / Ol cennetten çıkan Hacer (-i) esved”e / Yüzümüzü sürdük El-hamdü li”llâh{We made the resolution and went to the country of the Ka‘ba / We arrived andperformed circumambulation – praise be to God! / Upon that black stone whichemerged from Paradise / We rubbed our face – praise be to God!}.

It is related that,whenever he tried to read something, he could not get his tongue around the lettersof the alphabet and the mirror of his heart was not darkened by the turbiditiesof inscriptions and writings. He recited the following couplet extempore: Nazar eyleebteri bâzâr eyle götürü / Yaradılanı hoZ gör, Yaradan”dan ötürü (Regard “the one cut off ”[cf. Koran, 108:3, referring to enemies of the Prophet]. Do business wholesale. / Betolerant toward creatures, for the sake of the Creator)} (‘fshıq Chelebi, Tadhkira{i.e. MashA“ir al-shu“arA”}, the entry on Yenus Emre {we used the Meredith-Owensedn, 98b}). The translator of {Tashköprü-Zade’s} al-ShaqA”iq agrees with this, saying:Zâhir-i hâlde okumaXa dili varmayıp, hâme gibi hurûf-i teheccînin edâsında kâsır idi; ammâdebistân-ı kudsün hurûf-i maârif-i ledünnîyesinde mâhir idi {It was obvious that he could notbring himself to read. Like a reed pen, he was cut short to produce the letters ofthe alphabet. But he was expert in the letters of the sciences of the knowledge of theconsciousness of God learned in the school of holiness} (p. 78). This claim of illiteracy,however, is found neither in the original Arabic version of al-ShaqA”iq nor in Sa‘dal-Dcn, who, for the most part, cites it (TAj al-tawArCkh, vol. 2, p. 429). This is additionalevidence for the legendary nature of this claim. Nevertheless, there is frequentreference to his illiteracy in the DCwAn, as in the following:Ol dost bana ümmî demiZ, hem adımı ümmî komuZDilim Zeker, gövdem kamıZ, bu söyleyen nemdir benimÜmmî benem Yûnus benem, dokuz atam dörttür anamAZk odu”na düZüb yanam sûk-u bâzâr nemdir benim{That Friend called me illiterate (ummC) He gave me the nickname “Ummc.”My tongue is sugar, my body is reed.

Outwardly, the effect of their knowledge is behavior in accordancewith the stipulations of the SharC“a; inwardly the effect of their illiteracy is to receiveknowledge directly from God. For, as long as one is not simple and pure of heart, thebook of the heart cannot be exposed to divine manifestations. Consequently, it ismore difficult for the learned to enter upon the mystic path. This is why it was said ofthe Prophet that he was both illiterate and learned. He was illiterate for the sake ofspiritual Truth but learned for the sake of the SharC“a, for, although he did not learnknowledge of spiritual Truth from anyone, he acquired the SharC“a from Gabriel.There is a difference between mediated and unmediated knowledge. Mediatedknowledge is knowledge that can be expressed; {unmediated knowledge is knowledgethat can be (this phrase seems to be missing in the text)} pointed to. The knowledgethat Moses learned from Khaqir was such “pointed to” knowledge. Unmediatedknowledge is pure Truth. Therefore it is necessary for the followers of the path toacquire “expressed” knowledge from a master of the outward, i.e. a mudarris, andto acquire “pointed to” knowledge from a master of the inward, i.e. a murshid. {The“ulamA” have knowledge that can be expressed in words, “ibAra.

Bil ki insân-ı kâmil sohbeti ve dildezevk-ı mahabbet hâleti lâzımdır; ammâ ol ki bu zamânede bâzı ümmîler ilm-i zâhire müteallıkzebân-dırâzlık ederler, yerinde deXildir; bil ki hatâ-yı mahzdır. KiZinin zâhiri âlim ve bâtını ümmîgerektir. Ol ma“nâya ki levh-i dil cümle nukûZtan sâde olmadıkça, esrâr-ı ilâhiyyeye mahal olamaz.YZte, bu bidâyet hâlidir, nihâyette ise zâhir ve bâtın bütün ilim olur {One’s body does notbecome refined merely by acts of piety and worship in the mosque or madrasa, nordoes one’s heart gain annihilation in God from performing obligatory acts. Rather,one must keep company with spiritual masters and taste love in one’s heart. But thefact that in this age some illiterates are abusive in their talk about outward knowledgeis not proper. Rather, it is pure error. A man should be outwardly learned andinwardly illiterate. The reason is that if the tablet of the heart is not completely blank,it cannot become the locus of the divine mysteries. This is the beginning state. As forthe final state, outward and inward become total knowledge} (commentary on theMuRammadiyya, p. 114). The same author also explains the words of those who wereopposed to qAl (“words”) in the following manner: Nâzımın bu ma“nâyı kâl”ı terk ile emirdensonra zikrettiXinin vechi budur ki, kâl”de emr-i Zer“î dâhil deXildir. Bil ki emr-i Zer“î hâl denilenma“nâya vusûle vesîledir. Vesîle dahî makâsıda mülhaktır. Pes kangı sûf î-sûretin ki zâhirinde emr-iZer“î riâyeti olmaya, elbette hâl-ehli olmaz {The reason that the poet mentioned this ma“nAafter declaring that qAl be abandoned is that SharC“a matters are not included in qAl.Rather, SharC“a matters are a means of arriving at the ma“nA called RAl. The means isalso dependent upon the objectives. Therefore, any would-be nefc who does notoutwardly observe the SharC“a definitely cannot become possessor of RAl (mystical states)}(ibid., same part, p. 216). The early nefc Abe ‘Abd Allah Mukhtar b. Murammad b.Armad al-Harawc said, Ubûdiyyetin aslı oldur ki, zâhirde Zöyle olasın ki senden cemi“ Zer“ zâhirola ve bâtında Zöyle olasın ki, zikrin gayrı anda sıXmaya {The essence of devotion to God isthat you should behave outwardly such that your behavior conforms completely to"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF YjNUS EMRE293the law of God; and you should behave inwardly such that your behavior containsnothing but dhikr (remembrance of God)} ({ Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., p. 391).However, the true ecstatics and possessors of RAl, the pantheist nefcs, were not verydevoted to the outward appearances.35 Hundreds, indeed, thousands, of examples of this can be found in Mawlana, lafiv,Jamc, and the Turkish nefc poets.36 Citing Kharqanc, Shaikh al-Islam al-Harawc says that the famous nefc Khwaja Khayirjawas so illiterate that he could not pronounce al-Ramdu li-llAh {praise be to God}but that nevertheless he was ghawth-i rEzgAr {“Help of the age,” i.e. the highest nefcspiritual authority or “pole”} ({ Jamc,} NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans., p. 378). Similarly,Shaikh al-Islam Abe Natr Armad al-Jamc, known for several of his works, was illiter-ate. At the age of twenty-two, he retired to the mountains. After eighteen years ofmortification of the flesh, he returned and, when he mixed with the people, the doorsof “ilm-i ladunnC {knowledge imparted directly by God through mystic intuition} wereopened to him (ibid., p. 392). Shaikh Berke al-Hamadanc also knew nothing apartfrom the FAtiRa and a few sEras, and he could not even recite these properly. Neverthe-less, the famous ‘Ayn al-Quqat al-Hamadanc {i.e. ‘Abd Allah b. Abc Bakr al-Miyanajc,d. 526/1131, see EI2, Supplement, s.v. both names ( J. K. Teubner)} admitted that thisdervish, who did not know what qAla yaqElu {past and present forms of the Arabic verb“to say,” i.e. the first thing about Arabic grammar} was, knew the Koranic truthsmuch better than he did, and that he greatly benefited from him in this respect (ibid.,p. 473). The famous shaikh nadr al-Dcn al-Khiyawc al-Shirwanc was also completelyilliterate, and made his living as a weaver (ibid., p. 572). So, those who truly deservethe title of RakCm {sage} are these illiterate “Arifs {mystics who had attained trueknowledge of God}. In determining what is meant by wisdom {Rikma} in the Arabic {We gave Luqman wisdom, Koran 31:12}, the religious scholarsdiffered. According to the nefcs, Rikma means to be aware of the reality of things andto act accordingly; and to know the most sublime of things, who is God, throughdivine knowledge. If someone knows all things but does not know God through divineknowledge, he cannot be called RakCm. But those who are “Arifs, even if they areignorant of the formal and exoteric sciences, deserve this attribute. Because Ibn Scna,for example, tried to reach God through reason, the nefcs do not consider him to bea RakCm.37 The renowned Ummc {illiterate} Sinan, who is known for the hymns that he wrotein the manner of Yenus Emre, and was the founder of the Sinaniyya branch of theKhalwatiyya, was in fact an “Alim, but he adopted the nickname Ummc as a result ofa dream that he had. Aside from this famous nefc who died in 958/1551–2, ElmalılıShaikh Murammad Sinan – the murshid of Niyazc – who was from the Yixit Bazı {i.e.Armad Shams al-Dcn b. ‘hsa al-Marmarawc Yigitbashc, d. 910/1504} branch of theKhalwatiyya, is also known by the byname Sinan-i Ummc. This nefc poet died in1075/1664 –5 {1069/1658 in EI2, s.v. “Niyazc,” p. 65}.38 In KhulATat al-wafayAt, concerning Bursa, that this individual wrote based on {Tashköprü-Zade’s} al-ShaqA”iq, {ysmâ‘îl Belig’s} Güldeste-i riyAQ-i “irfAn, {Mehmed b.

Some verses describingthem are inscribed over the door of the türbe} (MS in the library of the lateHâzim Paza). Mehmed Tâhir also briefly mentions this shrine of Yenus Emre (inthe entries on Yenus Emre in his Aydın vilâyetine mensûb ricâlin terâcim-i ahvâli andOsmanlı müellifleri).39 “If you turn to the right just before reaching the mosque of Amcr Suluan and enter asmall street, you will immediately come to a tiny square. This place is the Qara ‘Abdal-Razzaq district. To the right of that little square there is a ruined house and in thewall there is a tiny window, partially overlooking the garden of that house, andcovered with an iron grill. Just opposite that courtyard, the grand Yenus Emre isburied along with two of his companions. I carefully read the inscription over thewindow and copied it in my notebook. Aside from Yenus Emre and ‘fshıq Yenus,it also mentions someone called ‘Abd al-Razzaq. The Qara ‘Abd al-Razzaq whogave his name to this district is this person. I give the inscription verbatim:Asl-ı sütûde gevherü”l-Hak Yedekci-zâdeCûd-ü keremle yektâ zât-i cihân-pesendiRaXbet edüb bu câyı ihyâya kıldı hikmetÜçler makâmın icrâ etti gören beXendiEvvelki Yûnus Emre, ÂZık Yûnus ikinciÜçüncü Abdü”r-Razzâk UZZâk-ı ser-bülendîHayrât-ı pâki olsun makbûl-i kurb-i BâriOla Zefâ”atiyle bânîsi behre-mendiYlhâm olundu geldi bir zât dedi tarîhÜç kabri kıldı ma“mûr li-llâh “Alî Efendi{God’s jewel, of blessed origin, Yedekci-ZâdeUnique in generosity, one with whom the world is pleasedDesired to restore this place and did it with wisdom.He made the shrine of the three saints, which pleased those who saw.First Yenus Emre, second ‘fshıq Yenus,Third ‘Abd al-Razzaq, Lovers with head held high.May his pure good deed be acceptable with the Creator.May he who built it partake of His intercession.Someone was inspired and came up with this chronogram:“Ali Efendi renovated the three tombs for the sake of God.”}“It is evident from this that a certain charitable individual named Yedekci-Zâde AlîEfendi repaired and restored the tombs of these three venerable men. According tothe abjad method of reckoning {enumeration by letters of the alphabet}, the chronogramindicates exactly 1252/1836 –7. There is also a puzzle here, for this means that it hadbeen repaired in 1252, that is, 77 {mistakenly given as 114 in 3rd edn} years ago.But according to my research, Yenus Emre’s tomb was completely in ruins for sometime and so inconspicuous that its location was not evident. The famous Niyazcbecame especially interested in this tomb and determined its true location” (RızâTevfik, his article “Yûnus Emre’yi ziyâret” in Peyâm ilâve-i edebiyyesi {literary supple-ment to the newspaper Peyâm}, June 19, 1329 {1911}). I am of the opinion that thereis no basis to the report, which was widespread among the leading members of theUarCqa in Bursa, that Niyazc discovered this tomb of Yenus Emre, because ysmâ‘îlHakkı, who, just like Niyazc, held the works of Yenus Emre in high regard, saysnothing at all about the tomb of Yenus Emre in Bursa in his SharR-i rumEzAt-i YEnusEmre, which he wrote thirteen years after Niyazc’s death, that is, in 1118/1706 –7.Instead, he indicates that he was buried in a town near Kiçiborlu. If Niyazc had really"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF YjNUS EMRE295discovered this place, ysmâ‘îl Hakkı would certainly have mentioned this claim, evenif he did not accept it.40 In n.8 of this chapter, I stated that there was no historical basis to the report that therewas also an ‘fshıq Yenus who was a khalCfa of Yenus Emre. The source of this reportis the tombs in Bursa that are at most a hundred years old and have no historicalvalue. When the DCwAn was published, ‘fshıq Yenus was also mentioned, based ofcourse on this report. When we realize that this new story, which has been around foronly a hundred years, is not found in any of the various historical sources written overso many earlier centuries, and cannot be traced back even as far as the time of Niyazc,then no historical and positive significance can be attributed to it. The errors ofMelioransky and Rızâ Tevfik on this point derive from their accepting every reportthey saw without subjecting it to critical inquiry.41 The section on Yenus Emre in Mehmed Tâhir’s Aydın vilâyeti”ne mensûb ricâlin terâcim-iahvâli and Osmanlı müellifleri.42 One of my students from Erzurum gave me this information. And Rızâ Tevfik, citinga friend from Erzurum in his article in Peyâm, corroborates it. It was told by a second-hand book-dealer, an old man from Erzurum, that there was an old and very largecopy of Yenus Emre’s DCwAn in that türbe. The works and legends of Yenus Emrewere very well known and widespread in all of those regions. {The hymn Yemenillerinde Veyse”l-Karanî (Uways al-Qaranc in the lands of Yemen) refers to Uwaysal-Qaranc, a legendary or semi-legendary contemporary of the Prophet Murammad.He supposedly lived in Yemen and corresponded with the Prophet by telepathy.

There are MSS of this work, some parts of which have been translated intoTurkish, in the libraries of the Hüda’c Dergâh {apparently the Hüdâiyye Tekkesi,now known as the Cafer Axa Mosque in Istanbul}, Atlama Tazı {i.e. the Hacı HalilMosque in Istanbul}, Bayezid Mosque, the Great Mosque {i.e. Ulu Cami in Bursa?},and in other places. If we take into consideration the date of Mawlana’s death, it isclear that this statement has only legendary value and cannot be accepted historically.48 What ysmâ‘îl Hakkı says on this subject is quite significant: ve bu makûle kelimât ekseresnâ-i Zevk ve galebe-i hâlde sâdır olmaXla kadh ve cerhe sâlih deXildir; zîrâ sâhibi ma“zûrdur ve lâkinmümkün oldukça ibârette edebe riâyet etmek gerektir.

Nevertheless, in the expression (of such utterances), one must observepropriety as far as possible. Thus, concerning the following utterance of Yenus Emre:“Paradise – what they call Paradise – A few slaves, a few houris / Let him give itto the one who wants it, I need You, You.” Afqal al-Muta’akhkhircn (the best of thelater ones [nefcs] ), Amthal al-Muta’addibcn (the epitome of the well cultured ones)Shaikh Uftada was not pleased and said, “It is not proper! And many a muftC hasdeemed foolish nefcs, who recite this utterance in order to express their scorn ofParadise, to be (guilty of ) kufr (unbelief )”} (commentary on the MuRammadiyya, p. 75).Indeed, the men of the madrasas, who are blindly suspicious of any ascetic or nefc,have never hesitated to use the weapon of takfCr {accusation of unbelief } against suchunrestrained views.49 Ghaibc, one of the khalCfas of Ibrahcm Efendi, collected the nefc sayings of his murshidin a work entitled SuRbatnAme-i GhaibC. In it we find the following opinions about YenusEmre: Lisân-i kadîm üzre ma“nâ icrâ eylemiZ er Yûnus Emre Hazretleri”dir ki bu siyakta bizimbu suâlimize ki: DerviZ dilinde söyleyen kim idigin bilir misin / Ya kulaXında dinleyen kim idiginbilirmisin kelâmıdır ki ânların / Bu dilimde söyleyen kendisidir va”llâhi / KulaXımda dinleyenkendisidir va”llâhi / Gördüm iki âdemdir biri sen ve biri ben / Hakîkatte sen ben yok kendisidirva”llâhi {The saint who expressed spiritual truth in the old language was his excellencyYenus Emre. I asked him the following question: “Do you know who it is who speakswith the dervishes’ tongue? / Do you know who it is who listens with the dervishes’ear?” He answered appropriately, saying, “The one who speaks with my tongueis Himself, by God! / The one who listens with my ear is Himself, by God! / I sawthat among men one is you and one is me / In truth, there is no you and I; thereis Himself, by God!”} (SuRbatnAme-i GhaibC, MS in Hâzim Pasha Library {in theSüleymaniye Library in Istanbul} ).50 As, for example, in the following couplet found in his DCwAn: BaZsız kabak gibi sentekerleme söz ile / Yûnus”leyin Niyâzî irfânı arzularsın {Talking nonsense like a headless"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"THE LIFE OF YjNUS EMRE297squash / You desire the spiritual knowledge of someone like Yenus and Niyazc}. ThisDCwAn is widely known among the nefcs. Various editions have been published, but themost reliable one was published in Cairo {Belaq} in 1254/1838 –9. {Now see KenanErdoxan (ed.) Niyazî-i Mısrî ve Divanı (Ankara, 1998), where the verse is on p. 169.}51 There exist several MSS of this commentary {SharR-i nuUuq-i YEnus Emre} and itwas printed on the margins of Yenus Emre’s DCwAn. Niyazc exhibits a great andsincere respect and affection for Yenus Emre in this commentary. {See the edn ofthis commentary by Neclâ Pekolcay and Emine Sevim, Yunus Emre Zerhleri (Ankara,1991), pp. 137–52, and the discussion of it in Schimmel, Mystical Dimensions of Islam,pp. 334 –5.}52ysmâ‘îl Hakkı claims that, because it is not possible to attain God rationally, suchpeople – even the likes of Ibn Scna – cannot be called RakCms. He then advances thenotion that Yenus Emre was a “mystic sage” {hakîm-i ârif}: Diyâr-ı Rûm”da Anadolu”damedfûn olan Yûnus Emre demekle Zöhret-yâb olan böyle deXil iken yine Lisânü”l-Gayb”dır ve ânınnazmettiXi maârif, Lisân-ı Türkî üzre kimseye makdûr olmamıZtır ve cümle ândan sonra gelib nazm-ı ma“ârif edenler ânın mâidesine tufeylî olmuZtur. “Yûnus Emrem öldü fakîr/ Ecel öksesini {sic, ensesini in 1st edn} dokur / Gönül kitâbından okur / Eline kalem almadı.”Pes bu makûleye hakîkatta hakîm denilir; zirâ ecell-i ma“ârif ile muttasıftır.

And the mystical doctrines that he versified were not vouchsafed to anyonein Turkish (other than to him). And all those who came after him and versifiedmystical doctrines were parasites at his table. The late (Yenus Emre), may (God)hallow his secret (said of deceased Muslim saints), said, “Yenus Emre died a dervish /Death struck him on the neck / He read from the book of the heart / He did not takepen in hand.” This sort of person truly deserves to be called RakCm, for he is endowedwith the noblest of sciences. The doctrines that the philosophers called Rikma (wisdom)are not in fact Rikma, for the believer and unbeliever share in them equally, and theyare not free from the defeats of harmful fancy and conjecture. A notion that isobtained by exercising the mind is conjectural; and a command that occurs by divinerevelation is certain. Just as divine inspiration is granted to the prophets, Rikma isgranted to the saints} (commentary on the MuRammadiyya, vol. 1, p. 82). It is obviousthat ysmâ‘îl Hakkı has recognized Yenus Emre as the greatest of our nefc folk poetsand their leader.53 One of his commentaries is an explanation of the hymn Çıktım erik dalına anda yedimüzümü {I climbed up a plum branch and there ate grapes}, which Niyazc had alsopreviously commented on. It was written in 1118/1706 –7. Another was a commentaryon the hymn Çıktım bâdem dalına anda yedim üzümü {I climbed up an almond branchand there ate grapes}. It was written in 1123/1711–12. Both are unpublished. MehmedTâhir mentions the commentary on only one of Yenus Emre’s ghazals among theworks of ysmâ‘îl Hakkı (Osmanlı müellifleri, vol. 1, p. 29). As I have indicated, ysmâ‘îlHakkı wrote separate commentaries on these two ghazals. There is a MS of each inmy private library {see the editions of these commentaries in Pekolcay and Sevim,Yunus Emre Zerhleri, pp. 153 – 81}. At the end of his commentary on the second ghazal,while explaining the line Kul çalmadan uyandım hem çalarım sazımı {I awoke withoutstriking anyone, all my striking was on my saz}, he expounds Yenus’s perfection in thefollowing manner: ve bundan, Zeyh-i mezbûrun ekâmil-i nâstan olduXu bâhir oldu. Ânın içinkelimâtı, kemâle dâirdir; yoksa beyne”l-Cemâl ve”l-Celâl mütereddid deXildir, sâir kelimât-ı “uZZâkgibi {It is evident from this that the aforesaid shaikh was among the most perfect of"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE298men.

But he does not waver between thebeauty of God and the awesome might of God, as is the case with other “Ashıqs (theimplication being that he chose beauty)}.54 In the past, everyone who had some literary taste, no matter what his social class,possessed miscellanies (s. majmE“a) and collections of folk poems {s. cönk}. Cönk, meaningmemorandum book, is a majmE“a that opens lengthwise. These miscellanies contain,according to the taste of their owners, bits and pieces of poetry, letters, wise advice,pleasantries, and a thousand other such things. Some of these majmE“as simply consistof hymns belonging to the dervishes.

Still, because poetry and eloquence had acquiredgreat importance in Arab life (see {Zaydan,} Medeniyyet-i islâmiyye tarihi, vol. 3, p. 49,citing such sources as {al-Suyeuc’s} Muzhir, BulEgh al-arib {?} and {Ibn ‘Abd Rabbihi’s}al-“Iqd al-farCd; Brockelmann’s and Huart’s histories of Arab literature {respectivelyGeschichte der arabischen Litteratur, 2nd edn (Leipzig, 1909), not to be confused withBrockelmann’s multi-volume catalogue of Arabic works with the same title, and AHistory of Arabic Literature (London, 1903)}, the Prophet treated very favorably the poetswho had accepted Islam. He had poetry recited in his presence and even encouragedlassan b. Thabit to write satirical poetry about polytheists. Ka‘b b. Malik once askedwhether or not it was legitimate to satirize unbelievers. The answer he received fromthe Prophet was “satirizing unbelievers is like shooting arrows at them with the tongueand thus is tantamount to fighting {jihAd} for the sake of God” (Surerc {d. 969/1562},at the end of BaRr al-ma“Arif, from the MS in my private library {on this writer see EI2,s.v. “Surerc” (Edith Ambros)}; there are very important materials concerning thepermissibility of poetry and its benefits in Naw‘c’s {apparently the Ottoman poet, d.1007/1599, and not the Persian poet, d. 1019/1610} famous letter {?}, and especiallyin the introduction to ‘fshıq Chelebi’s Tadhkira {i.e. MashA“ir al-shu“arA”} and lashmet’s{d. 1181/1768} Sanad al-Zu“arA”, MS in my private library {on the latter, see EI2, s.v.“lashmet” (Mehmed Kaplan)}. For poetry to be acceptable, in this manner, theupholders of religious law and the nefcs subsequently restricted it to such subjects astawRCd {profession of the unity of God}, na“t {praising the Prophet}, and akhlAqiyyAt{ethics}, and for a long time any other, non-religious, poetry was viewed with disfavor.Taking advantage of this, the nefcs distinguished between the poetry of “Ashıqs,i.e. themselves, and that of the poets in order to separate true love, with which theywere preoccupied, from physical love, about which the other poets sang. We sawabove how Suluan Walad – conforming to this old nefc view – distinguished the poetryof the “Ashıq from that of the poet. Sinan Pasha {d. 891/1486} too, after criticizingpoets at length in his Tadhkirat al-awliyA”, explains the difference between them andnefcs:...Ammâ sakın bu sözden Hoca “Attâr, {eyh Irâkî emsâlini Zâir sanma, Hazret-i Mevlânâgazeliyyâtını bu kabilden addeyleme; ânların kelimâtı derd-i dildir ki söylerler ve ânlar gazelleriniharâret-i aZkla takrîr eylerler.

Before analyzing this text, whichwas first published lithographically in 1302/1884 –5 {in Istanbul as Dîvân-ı âZıkYûnus Emre} and again in 1320/1902–3, we need to understand how reliable it isand, if it is a faithful text, whether or not Yenus composed any other work. Tobe sure, the analysis that I made above of the DCwAn-i Likmat, which has longbeen attributed to Armad Yasawc, has shown the erroneousness of several pointsthat researchers up to the present time have generally accepted as axiomatic(Chapter 5, pp. 127–9). But the surviving work of Yenus Emre, along with con-temporary linguistic and literary products, considerably facilitates our researchon this topic.As with the DCwAn-i Likmat, manuscript copies of Yenus Emre’s DCwAn arequite numerous. Nothing could be more natural for a poet whose hymns reachedthe most remote corners of Anatolia and Rumelia and were well known forcenturies among the people. Yet, despite all my research, I have not been able tofind a copy of this DCwAn dating from the eighth/fourteenth or ninth/fifteenthcentury. The manuscripts in our possession are, in fact, all products of recentcenturies. The reason for this is that Yenus Emre’s DCwAn was compiled andarranged centuries after his death by a dervish who was very devoted to him.1As far as we know, the oldest texts belonging to Yenus Emre are the hymnspublished by Mühlbacher.2 After these hymns, which were written down in thefirst half of the ninth/fifteenth century, we can consider a few hymns recordedand identified by Hacı Kemal of Exridir, the author of JAmi“ al-naVA ”ir, to be theoldest text belonging to him.3 Subsequently, hymns recorded in the name ofYenus Emre appeared in various poetic anthologies compiled at various periods,and later on, whoever it was who compiled the DCwAn made use of them. Con-sequently, it is obvious that we cannot fully attribute to Yenus Emre the printedversion of his DCwAn or the various manuscript copies of it that belong to laterperiods, nor can we reject the possibility that he wrote some hymns in additionto those in the DCwAn. A casual examination of the printed DCwAn suffices to"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE303confirm this. This DCwAn, consisting of 10,000 –12,000 verses, contains manypassages that do not belong to Yenus Emre4 and, at the same time, it lacks manyitems that we know definitely do belong to him, such as the passages publishedby Mühlbacher. The variation among the manuscript copies of the work derivesfrom the fact that, in the absence of any reliable early copy, each compilerincluded, according to his own understanding, whatever poems {of Yenus Emre}he happened to come across. Apparently Yenus recited many hymns withoutintending for them to be compiled into a dCwAn;5 the DCwAn was later compiledfrom those hymns that had been recorded, with a number of differences, invarious anthologies. This is why the same hymns appear in such different versionsin various works6and also why we cannot regard either the published version ofthe DCwAn or the manuscript copies that we possess as reliable documents withrespect to linguistic history. To compile a reliable version of Yenus Emre’sDCwAn, it is necessary – keeping in mind the basic points that I have outlinedabove – to collect the passages of his work scattered among the various manu-scripts and anthologies and then subject them to a rigorous comparative linguisticcritique according to the characteristics of contemporary Anatolian Turkish, andproduce a new DCwAn by the method of reconstitution philologique. Still, from thepoint of view of literary {as opposed to linguistic} history, we can say that themost basic historical critique will suffice to show the place of Yenus Emre in ourliterature and the literary character of his work.7B Linguistic characterOur discussion of Yenus Emre’s DCwAn has shown that long preparatory workwould be required in order to make a linguistic analysis of it. Indeed, a thoroughlinguistic analysis is beyond the scope of this book, but we do possess sufficientinformation to give a general idea about the linguistic and dialectical features ofthe DCwAn. Because we find in Yenus Emre’s works exactly the same linguisticcharacteristics as in the works of Shayyad lamza, Suluan Walad, Gülshehrc,‘fshıq Pasha, and other contemporary writers, we can consider them to beamong the oldest {Turkish} works in Anatolia. Although no scholarly analysishas been made to date on these works with respect to phonology and lexicon,this old Anatolian Turkish, which immediately strikes one as being closely akinto the Azerc dialect,8is nothing but a later and more developed form of the oldOghuz Turkish.9This Oghuz Turkish, which very early had become a written language, con-tinued as such after the Turks settled in Anatolia, although it underwent certainchanges under the influence of environment and other factors. Relatively fewworks, including some books, produced in this language – those that I havementioned above – have come down to us, but thanks to them we have a fairlygood understanding of Anatolian Turkish in the seventh/thirteenth and eighth/fourteenth centuries. The linguistic characteristics of Anatolian Turkish that arepeculiar to these early periods, and that are rather different from those that"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE304appeared later, after the conquest of Constantinople, are later found as well inYenus Emre’s DCwAn, so one naturally includes it within this same domain.Although it is likely that there were some insignificant local variations betweenit and the other old works belonging to the same periods, research on this topic,as I stated above, requires a complete rearrangement and restoration of thetext of the DCwAn according to its earliest form. To be sure, such a study may beof greater value to linguistic than to literary history. In any case, the language ofYenus Emre is, like that of other contemporary Anatolian works, despite somearchaic features, pure Anatolian Turkish.10C Literary characterYenus Emre’s DCwAn is composed of several mathnawCs and numerous ghazals andstrophic poems (musammaUs). It contains altogether some 5000 – 6000 couplets,most of which are in the syllabic meter.The mathnawCs, which constitute a minor part of the work, about 600 couplets,and which come after a short prose introduction at the beginning of the DCwAn,11actually form a unit that is divided into the following sections: DAstAn-i rER wa nafswa mA yata“allaqu bihimA min al-aRwAl {Poem of the spirit and carnal soul and theconditions concerning them}, DAstAn-i qanA“at {Poem of contentment}, DAstAn-ighaQab {Poem of wrath}, Dar-bayAn-i aRwAl-i Tabr wa RikAyat-i YEsuf “alayhi’s-salAm{Concerning patience and the story of Joseph, upon him be peace}, Dar-bayAn-iRAlAt-i bukhl {Concerning avarice}, Dar-bayAn-i aRwAl-i QArEn {Concerning Korah},and Dar-bayAn-i dAstAn-i “aql {Concerning the intellect}. These mathnawCs, whichdiscuss the conditions of the spirit and the carnal soul and such moral issues asavarice, contentment, patience, and generosity, are inspired by the rules of nefcethics; and the influence of ‘Auuar, Sana‘c, and Mawlana on them is immediatelyapparent. In a manner replete with allusive symbols that were very popularamong the nefcs, Yenus expounds the distinctions of reason and faith, the natureof the four elements {earth, water, air, and fire}, the merciful and satanic powersthat govern the world of the heart, the temptations of the carnal soul, and theimportance of contentment and patience. Occasionally, in order to emphasizeand clarify a point, he will illustrate it by means of a simple story, such as thegreed of Korah, or Joseph’s patient trust in God when he was in the well, andshow the dangers {awaiting one} on the Day of Judgment.His descriptive style is generally quite artful. For example, after the Emperorof Intellect captures the Land of Greed, he raises Contentment to the throne.But there is a bandit on the road leading to that land. He dwells at the top of themountain and never descends from it. Those who follow this rebel, whose nameis Pride, never consider that the long rope of death will reach them whereverthey are. Yenus Emre advises them to implore Intellect, a great man who possessesJustice. Intellect orders Humility to drive Pride from the top of the mountain.Then Humility takes the form of a river and flows into the sea. Those who diveinto that sea under the guidance of Intellect find there unheard of pearls, coral,"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE305garnets, and rubies. When Intellect learns that Pride has been defeated with thehelp of Humility and Contentment, he joyfully thanks God. This does not,however, end the disorders in the kingdom of the body. Two antagonists, Comfortand Pleasure, are about to appear again. Intellect learns about this through hisspies and orders Patience to oppose them. Patience successfully puts an endto these difficulties. Nevertheless, the roads are long and dangerous. There areenemies like Avarice, Envy, Hatred, and Slander who prevent one from reachingthe goal. But Intellect finds a means to overcome them: Righteousness. Whenone puts on the honorable robe of Righteousness, i.e. when one attains divineTruth, the torch of faith burns brightly; the thief in the house of the body, thateternal seducer of mankind, comes into the open and can no longer hide.12Written in 707/1307– 8, this rather long mathnawC, which forms a unit, showsthat Yenus Emre was not an illiterate poet as has been claimed, but, to thecontrary, can be regarded as a nefc inspired by the mystical moralist poets ofIran. Anyone who briefly studies our literary works that were produced betweenthe second half of the seventh/thirteenth and the first half of the eighth/four-teenth century may easily judge that this mathnawC exactly fits this period withrespect to its subject, world view, and form of expression. Composing this mathnawCin the Persian “arEQ meter is also completely in accordance with the literarytraditions of that period, because contemporary Anatolian poets, under the influ-ence of the great Persian nefcs, had accepted the Persian “arEQ meter along withthe mathnawC form. Yet, because the {Turkish} language was still not suitablefor the “arEQ meter, the words could by no means be read naturally. Instead, theyhad to be lengthened or shortened. And because artistic excellence could not beachieved, the rhymes are almost always faulty. Therefore, those who have studiedthe work of Yenus Emre up to the present have usually regarded this mathnawC aswritten in the syllabic meter.13 This moralistic poem, of a more or less didacticnature, is technically very defective and cannot be compared aesthetically toYenus’s other works, because it was nearly impossible to add something of hisown personality to such didactic versifying. The need to remain bound to aforeign technique to which neither he nor the language was accustomed was alsoa factor in this.After this long mathnawC, there appears a short invocation {munAjAt}, awkwardlymade to fit the fA“ilAtun, fA“ilAtun, fA“ilAt meter. Following this, the hymns, i.e.Yenus Emre’s original, important, and personal works, are arranged in a seriesaccording to the last letters of the rhyming element. Indeed, the most popular ofYenus Emre’s works for centuries have been these hymns or orations {s. nuUuq}(in Bektashc terms, nefes {hymn}). As one finds generally among the Muslimmystics, some of these works express views that are broad and lofty – i.e. thatdefend honor and dignity – or are even quite humanistic. Others are orationsurging the need for prayer and fasting. Most of them are exuberant poemsconcerning the philosohy of waRdat al-wujEd {unity of being}. All of them breathea profound and pure excitement, a divine impulse combined with purity of heartand sincerity. This singer of hymns, who only cried out to offer sincere worship"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE306to his creator and to expound to the heedless the great divine Truth that he hadattained, was, in his own words, Hakk tecellîsini Zâir dilince eden bu âZık koca {thisenraptured old man who poetically described the self-disclosure of God}. Heknew perfectly all the stories and traditions of ancient history and the scientificand philosophical views and systems of the time. In various places in the DCwAn,there are eloquent references to Islamic and Persian traditions, such as thesultanate of Solomon, the treasure of Farcden, and the treasure of Neshirwan; toall the stages in the history of the prophets; to the legends of the great nefcs, suchas al-lallaj and Dhe ’l-Nen; and to contemporary intellectual and philosophicalsystems. After reviewing them, it is absolutely clear that the tradition of YenusEmre’s illiteracy can by no means be considered historically correct.In a state of mystical rapture and pious reverence, ‘fshıq Yenus Emresometimes speaks of a love that is sublime and replete with mysteries, or else ofthe fearful clamor of the Day of Judgment, or the rivers of milk in Paradise andthe divine nightingales’ singing of the unity of God. Yet like all Turkish mystics,he could not be completely indifferent to nature. Just as there is an enthusiasmfor, and attraction to, nature in the early Turkish poetry in {al-Kashgharc’s}DCwAn lughAt al-turk and in {Yesuf Khatt lajib’s} Kutadgu Bilig,14 there also existsa certain pleasure in nature in the works of Yenus Emre, who wandered aboutthe forests of the Sakarya obsessed with divine love. Yet, because his eyes could notescape from the depths of the inner world, even in the very few scenes of naturein the DCwAn one is again struck by colors and degrees of spirituality; and the resultappears in a completely unexpected manner, i.e. either as moralistic advice or asa mystical aphorism.15 In this respect, it would be quite subjective and mistakento try to establish a connection between Yenus Emre’s works and his milieu.16Also, compared to the moralistic and philosophical poems in the DCwAn, thereis very little of a mystical-satirical nature. Poems of this genre, which were alsowritten by conscientious nefcs in imitation of the utterances of certain of thoseobsessed with divine love {majdhEb}, had a very clear meaning to those whowere sufficiently familiar with nefc symbols, although the ahl-i qAl {conventionalreligious scholars}, who could not penetrate their depth of meaning, regardedthem as utter nonsense. Yenus Emre’s poems, such as his famous hymn Çıktımerik dalına anda yedim üzümü {I climbed the plum branch and there ate grapes},are exactly of this type, and extensive commentaries have been written aboutsome of them.17The meter and form of Yenus Emre’s works are also worthy of study. Up tonow researchers have concluded that he used only the syllabic meter, but thefact is that he used both “arEQ and the national {i.e. syllabic} meter. I describedbriefly above how the “arEQ meter was gradually applied to Turkish by theAnatolian poets of that time (Chapter 7, p. 209). In this respect, it should be seenas very natural that Yenus Emre, who was by no means an illiterate dervish,used the “arEQ meter, although he lived among the people and addressed himselfto them. Just as it is obvious that some of the poems in the DCwAn that werecomposed perfectly in the “arEQ meter do not belong to Yenus Emre, it is equally"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE307certain that the “arEQ works written in primitive form in Turkish – and usually insuch a defective manner that they are indistinguishable from {works in} thesyllabic meter – do belong to Yenus Emre. Basically Yenus Emre employed thesimple “arEQ meters that were the most compatible with the syllabic meter.18Although Yenus Emre used the “arEQ meter, he wrote a significant number ofhis hymns – and naturally the most beautiful and original of them – in thesyllabic meter. The major factor in this was his desire to address the popularmasses, among whom he grew up, more effectively by using a cadence to whichthey were accustomed. In addition, his desire not to differ from other suchpopular works, which were surely written before him under the influence ofArmad Yasawc and his imitators, played a strong role in this. A nefc poet whounderstood the affection and attachment that the people had for such workswould certainly, in the famous words of Mawlana, offer the same kind of goodsto his readers. Still, it should not be forgotten that, at that time, in addition toall of these factors, the foreign “arEQ meter was preferred in works of a didacticnature, whereas in lyrical works the artist tended to the national meter inaccordance with his disposition. Yenus Emre, who was quite unconcerned withart or artistry and composed his poems simply by divine impulse, quite naturallyconformed to the natural and national cadence that was stored in his conscience.One encounters virtually every form of the syllabic meter in the DCwAn, namely,6; 7; 8; 5 + 5 = 10; 6 + 5 = 11; 6 + 6 = 12; 7 + 7 = 14; 8 + 8 = 16. Among these,the ten- and twelve-syllable forms are quite rare in our literature. While oneobserves that Yenus was not bound to the caesura in these forms, or that he wasindifferent to various deficiencies, generally speaking he was very successful inhis use of these meters.In addition to the Persian mathnawC and ghazal forms in the DCwAn, there is alsothe old koZma form, which we may also call quatrains or musammaUs. Yenus Emre’smost beautiful poems are arranged above all in this latter form. As I stated abovewhile discussing Armad Yasawc, the koZma or quatrain form is the oldest andmost widespread form in Turkish folk literature. Yenus Emre preferred this formnot because he was imitating Persian quatrains or musammaUs, but simply becausehe was under the strong influence of folk literature.19 Thus, it is clear that YenusEmre did not depart from the popular taste with respect to either meter or formand that he unconsciously took advantage of the aesthetic source that the popularspirit had accumulated over the centuries.DY§nus Emre the moralistAs I mentioned above, some of Yenus Emre’s mathnawCs and hymns are of adidactic nature. With them he tried to propagate a type of nefc morality. Thereis no doubt that some of these works are of poor quality and lack originalitycompared to his genuine nefc works. In other words, the moralist persona of YenusEmre that we are going to examine here was very undistinguished compared tohis nefc persona. In any case, in order not to exclude from our study of Yenus"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE308Emre even the most insignificant aspects of his life, let me briefly describe thebases of the nefc morality that he tried to expound.20The nefc morality that Yenus Emre propagated is first of all a genuinesummons to conform to the teachings of the Koran and LadCth and to respect theprinciples of the SharC“a, even to the most minor details, because the SharC“a is theessential foundation of the UarCqa. Those who do not respect it are threatenedwith eternal punishment. Second, there are several negative and positive moralprinciples that are required by the Prophet’s Sunna {al-sunna al-muRammadiyya}.These are so well known that there is no need to repeat them here. In quite afew of his poems, Yenus expounds at length the need to remain bound by them:patience, contentment, generosity, benevolence, and so forth. But these are allgeneral points that constitute the moral bases of Islam. True nefc morality beginsafter this. While it includes much more serious obligations, it is also more refinedand more humane {insAnC}.Yenus begins this propaganda with an invitation to the nefc way. Many of hishymns instill the notion that “without attaching oneself to a perfect guide on themystical path, one cannot reach the goal.”21 But this way, this nefc way, is verydemanding. The difficulties to be undergone are not of the sort that could beendured by those subject to the physical self and carnal passion, which are closelybound to this world. For this reason, it is first necessary to make the adeptsaware of these difficulties. Thus many of Yenus Emre’s hymns are explanationsof these difficulties. Being a dervish does not simply mean being a disciple andwearing the cap {tAj} and patched cloak {khirqa}. One must put all this asideand, allowing oneself to be the target of arrows of censure {malAma}, eliminateall sense of shame and honor so that genuine {divine} love may be established{in one’s heart}. Only then, thanks to the power of this love, can duality {of theself and the divine} be transcended and only then will the secret of divine unitybe revealed. There is no other way, for this will not occur by studying thereligious sciences.22As I will explain below when discussing the nefc beliefs of Yenus Emre, sucha view of existence requires one to trust in God and submit to Him {tawakkul wataslCm} and to renounce, abandon, and divest oneself completely from worldlyaffairs. At that point, the dervish must tolerate everything and consider it good.Once he has attained this state, he no longer makes distinctions among people,whether good or bad, Muslim or mAjEsC {fire-worshipper}. Indeed, he even treatskindly those who have treated him badly.23 It is for this reason that the asceticYenus Emre, who, in some of his hymns, makes the most grave accusationsagainst “one who has never prayed,” reveals a broad, humane compassionin some of his most valuable compositions propagating the principles of nefcmorality, and goes as far as to say that he who does not look at the seventy-twosects as equal, he who makes distinctions among them, even if he is a religiousinstructor, he is still in fact a sinner.24It is, therefore, very clear that this nefc morality, the basic principles of whichI have tried to establish, was not something peculiar to Yenus Emre but was"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE309something that the great Persian nefc moralists had promulgated.25 While YenusEmre’s style is weak and insipid in some of his poems where he defends theprinciples of an orthodox pietistic asceticism, he comes across as a forceful,sincere, and distinctive individual in those passages that instill a very broad andhumane nefc morality. It is also quite obvious from this that nefism is not,according to this early Turkish nefc, a lifeless thing composed of terminology anda code of rules. Instead, just as with Abe Sa‘cd Ibn Abc ’l-Khair and Mawlana, itis something living and to be lived, a spiritual need, a divine impulse.EY§nus Emre the ∞§f¢Yenus Emre’s nefc views, like those of all the early Anatolian nefc poets, areeither directly borrowed from Jalal al-Dcn Remc or virtually identical to his. Inorder to understand the nefc ideas of Jalal al-Dcn Remc, to which we can give thename panthéisme idéaliste {i.e. wujEdiyya-i khayAliyya}, it would first be necessary toexplain the principles of the Neoplatonists, especially the late Neoplatonists. Butin order not to go beyond the scope of my work, which is merely a literary andhistorical study, I will be content to cite and elucidate briefly the nefc principlesthat are very beautifully summarized in the work of the Persian nefc poets, suchas Mawlana and Jamc.26 The basic principle is that of the unity of being {waRdatal-wujEd} or panthéisme idéaliste, which is common to all Muslim nefcs and isexpounded in perhaps its most perfect and refined form by Muryc ’l-Dcn Ibnal-‘Arabc.27{In the following three paragraphs, Köprülü paraphrased E. J. W. Gibb, AHistory of Ottoman Poetry, vol. 1, pp. 16 –19, but we have used Gibb’s text.}God is Absolute Being. He therefore necessarily comprises within Him-self all apparent existences whatsoever; and Absolute Good, thereforenecessarily Absolute Beauty, Beauty being one side or aspect of Good.Such is the Divine Nature; and having learned this, we may perceivehow the phenomenal universe came into existence. Ere yet time was,God dwelt alone in unrevealed loveliness and glory; alone in solitaryradiance shone Absolute Beauty; no eye was there to gaze enrapturedon Its unspeakable fairness, no heart to thrill in ecstasy at Its all-perfectharmony. A marked characteristic of Beauty, whatever be the formit may assume, is an innate desire of self-manisfestation. This is veryclearly expressed in a famous Hadis or “Apostolic Tradition,” continuallyon the lips of the poets, in which God, in answer to a question of Davidas to why He had created man, replies, “I was a Hidden Treasure,therefore was I fain to be known, and so I created creation in order thatI should be known.”28But how was this manifestation thus demanded by the Divine natureto be brought about? It is an axiom that things can be known onlythrough their opposites or negations. Now the opposite or negation of"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE310Absolute Being, which is one and the same with Absolute Beauty andAbsolute Good, is necessarily Not-Being, Not-Beauty, Not-Good. Butsuch can have no real existence, for all real existence is of necessitycomprised in Absolute Being, of which this is the negation. Not-Being isthen only a phantasm evoked for a season and for a special purpose. AsAbsolute Being could be known only through Its negation Not-Being,so Absolute Good could be known only through Its negation Not-Good;and as Absolute Being and Absolute Good are one, so also areNot-Being and Not-Good. Evil has therefore no real existence; there isno Absolute Evil as there is Absolute Good; by its very nature Evil istemporary and limited, it is but an illusion which the conditions ofmanifestation have rendered necessary for a while.The process of manifestation was accomplished thus. When Not-Being became opposed to Being there appeared on the former, as in amirror, a reflection or shadow of the latter. This reflection, which partakesof the nature of both Being and Not-Being, is called Contingent Being,and is none else than the phenomenal universe.29 Some nefcs liken thisto the reflection of the sun on a still lake. As the universe is thus theimage of Absolute Being, that is of God, reflected in the mirror Not-Being, so, they continue, is man the eye in that image, and as when welook in a mirror, we perceive a small image of ourselves reflected in thepupil, so is the image of God reflected in this eye which is man. Thus isGod revealed unto Himself and unto man, and thus moreover doesman contain in himself the image of God.30{In the following paragraph, Köprülü paraphrased Gibb, vol. 1, pp. 19 –21;again we have used Gibb’s text.}Man, like the phenomenal universe in which he finds himself, and ofwhich he presents an epitome, is double-natured, partaking at once ofBeing and Not-Being, of Good and Evil, in other words, of the elementsof existence and non-existence. This Divine particle in man, this spark ofPure Being, is ever seeking, consciously or unconsciously, to be reunitedto its source; but so long as the phenomenal state lasts, the presenceof the element of Not-Being holds it back. Man’s business then is toeliminate, so far as may be, this element of Not-Being, and to attainto that union with God, that absorption into the Divine, which thoughto be fully achieved only after death of the body, is possible in a certainmeasure even in this present life. Those who learn the mystery of {Die before you die} have successfully done this. Theway to do this is to conquer self; for self, which seems so real, is in truththe supreme illusion as it is the cause of all our woe. We have no self;whatever we have of Real Being is God’s not ours; the rest is merenothingness, the negation of Being, the negation of Good, to hug which"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE311can bring only sorrow. Thus, Love {“ishq, ecstatic love of God} is neces-sary to conquer the physical self. By Love, and by Love alone, can thedark shadow of Not-Being be done away, can the soul of man win backto its Divine source. Human love is not itself the end, it is but the meansto the end; it is the “Bridge” across which the pilgrim of the Truth mustpass. But fair as the Bridge may be, the pilgrim must beware of linger-ing thereon, lest haply he should fail to reach his journey’s end. Onceacross, his eyes are opened, his heart is made clairvoyant throughDivine Love; wherever he turn his gaze he sees the Face of God. If heturn his eyes inward and look into his own heart, there he can readletter by letter the very heart of God. For he has now become one withGod, knowing and feeling that there is naught beside God. Thus theannihilation in God which is called “becoming Truth with the True,”i.e. to perish in absolute being, is this. Al-Manter’s {al-lallaj’s} statement“I am the Truth,” and Abe Yazcd Bistamc’s exclamation “There is noneother than God within my cloak” are exact expressions of this.31What is needed for this is ecstasy {wajd wa RAl}. I have discussed above thenefc stages that follow this, i.e. baqA” {subsistence}, which comes after fanA”{annihilation}, and the final state, which is “ubEdiyya {servanthood} and rujE“ ilA”l-bidAya {returning to the beginning; on these terms see Chittick, The Sufi Path ofKnowledge, pp. 219, 310 –11, 105}.After briefly expounding these basic beliefs, which are found not only inYenus Emre but in virtually all Turkish and Persian nefc poets, it will be mucheasier to understand Yenus Emre’s nefc poems. As appears clearly and categor-ically in many places in his DCwAn, this great Turkish nefc was influenced bythe work of Jalal al-Dcn Remc,32 and like him was very closely attached to thepath of wujEdiyya-i khayAliyya = panthéisme idéaliste, which I have explained above.Sometimes, by saying that he could not further expound the truth because herevered the discipline of the SharC“a, he provides teaching that suits the upholdersof religious law and the ascetics. But usually he leaps beyond this boundary withdivine rapture,33 admitting that the path of love is true religion; that the followersof the SharC“a cannot attain that station; that his {i.e. Yenus Emre’s} religiouscommunity is different from every other, and his religion and piety are excep-tions to existing religions; and that even without ritual prayer and ablutions hehas attained the prayer-niche of the divine Friend.34 Yenus gives the followingcategorical and eloquent response to the objections to this by the “externalists”{zâhir ehli} – the legal scholars and jurists:Bana nâmâz kılmaz diyen, ben kıluram nâmâzımıKılur isem kılmaz isem ol Hak bilür niyâzımıHak”tan artık kimse bilmez kâfir, müsülmân kimdürürBen kıluram nâmâzımı Hak geçirdiyse nâzımı"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE312Ol nâz dergâhından geçen ma“nâ Zarâbından içenHicâbsız cân gözin açan ol bilür benim sözümü{They say that I do not pray – but I do pray.And whether I pray or not, God knows my supplication.Only God knows who is an infidel, who a Muslim.I do pray, if God has forgiven my pride.He who passes beyond the court of pride, who drinks the wine of SpiritualMeaning,Who opens the eyes of his soul without a veil – he knows what I am saying.}It is obvious that Yenus Emre has no business with the legal scholars and jurists,those concerned with the external or superficial meaning of scripture, i.e. theestablished religious authorities, because they claim to know truth simply bymeans of the intellect. Using only the intellect and the senses on this dangerouspath cannot be productive. For this, ecstasy (wajd, RAl) is required; but those arepeople who understand religion and God from books (qAl):Hakîkat bir denizdir Zerî“at anın gemisiÇoklar gemiden çıkıp denize dalmadılarDört Kitâb”ı Zerheden hakîkatte âsîdirZîrâ tefsîr okuyup ma“nâsın bilmediler{Truth is a sea, and the SharC“a is a boat.Many never leave the boat and plunge into the sea.Those who expound the Four Books are sinners in truth:They read exegesis, but do not know the meaning of what they read.}Because Yenus Emre entered this path with Love, his DCwAn is replete with criesof Love. Just as Love occupies the prime place in Plato, Plotinus, and later inMawlana, so it does in Yenus Emre. He shouts “Ever since I drank the wine ofLove, I don’t know what I am. In order to reach You, I passed beyond my ownexistence (i.e. I overcame the physical self and thus eliminated the element ofnon-existence). Now see me!” And he finally understands the nature of thisAssembly of Love {aZk meclisi}:Bir sâkîden içtik Zarâb “arZtan yüce meyhânesi35Ol sâkînin mestleriyüz cânlar anın peymânesiBunda dâim yananların küllî vücûdü nûr olurOl od bir od”a benzemez hiç belürmez zebbânesiBu meclisin mestlerinin Ene ”l-Hak demleri olurYüz Hallâc-ı Mansûr gibi en kemdürür dîvânesi"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE313Ol meclis kim bizde olur anda ciXer kebâb olurOl Zem”a kim bizde yanar ay ve güneZ pervânesiOl meclisin bekrîleri Ybrâhîm Edhem gibidirBelh Zehrince yüzbin ola her köZede bir dânesiAZk Zarâbın içenlere gel bir nazar eyleyi-görBunca yıldır nice döner ol meclisin piyâlesiYûnus bu cezbe sözlerin câhillere söylemegilBilmez misin câhillerin nice geçer zamânesi{We drank wine at the hands of a Cupbearer whose tavern is higherthan the heavenly throne.We are drunkards of that Cupbearer, our souls are His wine cup.Here those who constantly burn are wholly transformed into light.That fire is unlike any fire: there are no flames to be seen.Those drunk in this assembly only sing: I am Truth.Like a hundred lallajes, the lowliest of them is mad.In that assembly of ours the heart (lit.: liver) is the kebab.Of that candle which burns in us the sun and moon are moths.The drunkards of that assembly are like Ibrahcm b.

Many dangers must beovercome and many hardships must be met before one reaches the goal.36 Yetonce one has attained Truth on this path, all difficulties – ugliness, evil, andnon-existence – disappear and the traveler sees God everywhere. He findseverything consumed in absolute being.Ma“nâ bahrine daldık Vücûd seyrini kıldıkYki-Cihân ser-teser cümle Vücûd”da buldukGece ile gündüzü gökte yedi yılduzıLevh”te yazılan sözü cümle Vücûd”da buldukMûsâ çıktıXı Tûr”u gökte Beytü”l-Ma“mûruYsrâfîl”deki Sûr”u cümle Vücûd”da bulduk"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE314Tevrât ile Yncîl”i Furkân ile Zebûr”uBunlardan hem beyânı cümle Vücûd”da buldukYedi gök yedi yeri daXları denizleriUçmak ile tamuyu cümle Vücûd”da buldukYûnus”un sözleri Hak cümlemiz dedik sadakKande ister isen bak cümle Vücûd”da bulduk{We plunged into the sea of (spiritual) meaning.

We all said: “He has spoken truly.”Look wherever you will – we found all of them in Being.}After seeing everything in the universe consumed in absolute being, after theelement of non-existence is utterly destroyed, and after not separating himselffrom it {absolute being}, the follower of this path obtains absolute happiness.Therefore, in contrast to those who seek God outside oneself, Yenus Emre’ssaying Hak cihâna doludur kimseler Hakk”ı bilmez / Kendinden istesene ol senden ayrı olmaz{The Truth (or, God) fills the world, but no one knows the Truth. / Why don’tyou seek Him in yourself? He will not be apart from you} rings true, for accord-ing to this idea, even absolute being, which is the uniquely true existence and bymeans of which everything exists, is reflected within human consciousness. Thefollowing poem perfectly expounds this conviction:YstediXimi buldum âZkâre cân içinde37TaZra isteyen kendin kendi pinhân içindeKâimdir ol ırılmaz ansız kimse dirilmezAdım adım yer ölçer hükmü revân içindeBu tılısmı baXlayan cümle dili söyliyenYere göXe sıXmayan girmiZ bir cân içindeGirdim gönül Zehrine daldım anın bahrineAZk ile seyrederken iz buldum cân içinde"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE315{âh oluben oturur kula buyruk tuttururFermânını buyurur kendi fermân içinde{I found what I was seeking plainly evident in my soul.He who seeks his self outside himself is himself hidden within.He is everlasting and never departs.

Thenefc belief, however, accepts nothing but absolute being, as I mentioned above.38The hymn below, which reveals Yenus Emre’s concept of emanation {TudEr}and self-disclosure of God {tajallC}, shows that he did not differ from the othergreat nefcs in this matter as well; and that is why we can by no means attributethe above words to incarnation or union.Oradan gönderildim aZk ile bile geldim39Bu âleme çıkıcak bir aceb hâle geldimGör ne yuvadan uçtum halka râzımı açtımAZk tuzaXına düZtüm tutuldum ele geldimGeldim uZ yine varam yine Rahmân”ım bulamSanurlar beni bunda davara mâla geldimKudret sûret yapmadan firiZteler tapmadanÂlemi halk tutmadan ilerü yola geldimÇün dost açtı yüzümü gösterdi kendözümüGönlümdeki râzımı söyledim dile geldimTuzaktayım ne gülem ne hâldeyim ne bilemBir garîbçe bülbülem ötmeXe güle geldimTuzaXa düZen gülmez âZık hiç râhat olmazKimse hâlimden bilmez bir aceb ile geldim"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE316{I have been sent from there. I have come with Love.When I emerged into this world, I came into a wondrous state.See from what a nest I have flown. I divulged my secret to the people.I fell into Love’s trap. I was caught and now I am in the handsof others.I come, and lo! I will return. I will find my Merciful One again.They think that I have come here looking for cattle!Before divine power made the forms, before the angels worshipped,Before the world was created, I came forth on the way.When the Friend uncovered my face and made me manifest,I spoke and revealed the secret in my heart.I’m in the trap: why should I laugh? How do I know what state I’m in?I’m a nightingale far from home. I have come to the rose to sing.One who falls in the trap does not laugh. The lover is never at ease.No one knows of my condition. I have come to a wondrous country.}In saying here “The lover is never at ease,” Yenus means that lovers haveno peace in this transitory world, because they wish to obtain divinity immedi-ately and go quickly to their original abodes. The divine bird of the heart,which has flown from the nest, keeps fluttering in order to return to its nestas soon as possible. This is why Mawlana said: {The bird of my heart is fluttering. It never rests.It has seen its original abode. It has found rest there.}The externalists do not know the condition of lovers, nor understand theirlanguage. Thus, it is a torment for lovers to live amidst creatures not of their ownkind, in a world that does not belong to them.40 This is what Yenus Emreexpresses with these moving cries. They are a commentary on Plato’s principle,“to die is to live.”Ben bunda garîb geldim ben bu ilden bezerem41Bu tutsaklık tuzaXın demi geldi üzeremYetmiZiki millete suçum budur hak dedimKırkı hiyânet durur ya ben niçin kızaramBir çeZmeden akan su acı tatlı olmayaEdebdir bana yirmek bir lüleden sızaram{erî“at erenleri nice yol ide banaHakîkat deryâsında bahrî oldum yüzeremÇü ben suçumu bildim cümlesin bende buldumMansûr”em dâre geldim kül oluben tozaram"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE317{I have come here as a stranger.

I am ashes – let me beblown away!}I stated above the reason for honoring man, that he was created as the mostperfect form {aRsan-i taqwCm} and that divine attributes are manifest in him.42The major reason for his moral exaltedness is the heart. Some of Yenus Emre’spoems on the heart, and especially the hymn below, are no less precious than themost beautiful passages of the Persian nefcs on this subject.Ak sakallı bir koca hiç bilmez kim hâl niceEmek vermesin hacc”a bir gönül yıkar iseSaXır iZitmez sözü gece sanur gündüzüKördür münkirler gözü âlem münevver iseGönül Çalab”ın tahtı Çalap gönüle bahdıDört Kitâb”ın ma“nâsı budur eXer var ise{An old man with a white beard who does not know what ecstasy is:Let him make no effort to go on the lajj, if he is going to break a heart.He is deaf and cannot hear speech. He thinks day is night.The deniers’ eyes are blind, although the world is brightly lit.The heart is God’s throne. God has regard for the heart.If the Four Books mean anything, this is what they mean.}I described above the kinds of moralistic conclusions that could be derivedfrom this mystical theory. According to the nefcs, if man, i.e. the perfect manwho overcomes the element of non-existence and attains divine Truth, is soimportant then naturally the most sublime knowledge also belongs to him. Becauseour primary task is to know God, and knowing Him occurs through knowingourselves, the most important science, or, more correctly, the fundamental scienceis that which teaches the mysteries of man. This cannot be found in books like"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE318the science of conventional religious scholars. It can only be found via the pathof Love and by means of a spiritual guide, in other words by the science ofmysticism. Yenus Emre also knows this reality, but he favors stating it not tojurists and religious scholars who are heedless of it, but to lovers.Ylm okumak bilmektir hem kendüyü bilmektir43Çünkü kendin bilmezsen bir hayvândan betersinYûnus iZbu sözleri âZık”a di âZık”aGir gönüle yararsa birkaç dahi katarsın44{Knowledge is knowing how to read, and also knowing one’s self.Because if you don’t know yourself you are worse than an animal.Yenus: utter these words to lovers, to lovers.Enter the heart. If it suits, you will add even more (?).}Just as the idea of the perfect man arises from the theory of emanation andself-disclosure {of God} in nefc philosophy, so does the idea of dawr {the cycle ofexistence passing out from the Divine Reality down through the Arc of Descentand then back into the Godhead in the form of the Perfect Man}, which isrelated to it. Hence, we have creation poems {dawriyyas}, which are very famousin nefc literature. According to the theory of emanation and self-disclosure that Idescribed above, something that comes into existence in this material world,which is the lowest of the existing worlds, is first manifest in the form of aninanimate object, then as a plant, animal, and man, and finally it enters the formof the perfect man and reaches God. This then is the secret of {Existence originates from Him and returns to Him}, i.e. existence emergesfrom absolute being, descends to this world, leaves it again, and returns to thesource. The nefcs likened this cyclical movement to a circle and divided it intothe arc of descent and the arc of ascent.The divine light, which emerges from absolute being, passes in a sequence fromUniversal Intellect {God} to the nine intelligences, to the nine souls, to the ninecelestial spheres, to the four natures {heat, cold, wetness, and dryness} and as faras the earth to the four elements {earth, water, fire, and air}; this is the origin ofthe arc of descent. Following this, the same light passes from earth to mineral, thento plant, then to animal, then to man and then to the perfect man and returnsagain to its source. This second cycle is called the return or arc of ascent.45Mawlana depicts this cyclical movement very well in one of his famous lyricpoems,46 and there are also passages that touch on this celebrated nefc doctrinein the MathnawC,47 Natir-i Khusraw {d. between 465 and 471/1072 and 1078},48Ibn Yamcn {d. 769/1368},49 Faiq-i Hindc,50 and {Marmed Shabistarc’s}Gulshan-irAz.51 This teaching, which Turkish nefcs used with great skill as a subject of poetry,is essentially Neoplatonic. The doctrine of metempsychosis, on the other hand, isfound neither in the great nefcs nor in Yenus Emre.52"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE319So, just as we find dawriyyas in the poetry of the great Persian nefcs, Mawlanain particular, we also find quite a few in Yenus Emre’s DCwAn, usually pennedwith great freedom and excitement. Yenus writes in fervent language that in thebeginning he was together with the Beloved, i.e. absolute being; then he becamemineral, plant, animal, and man; then he took the form of Moses and went upMount Sinai, he became Abraham and wanted to sacrifice Ishmael, he becamethe ram that was sacrificed, he became Joseph and was sold, he became theone who purchased him, he became Jesus and went up to heaven, and hewas present at the Prophet’s ascension . . . etc. From this it is evident that Yunuswas not afraid of the chastisement of the SharC“a, despite his admission to thecontrary. The description that I have given above of the spiritual state ofAnatolia at that time, suffices to show how Yenus Emre could have had suchunrestrained ideas and, more importantly, how he did not hesitate to expressthem. Let me give as an example one of the most unrestrained dawriyyas thathe wrote:Ol Kâdir-i kün feyekûn lutf edici Rahmân benem53Kesmeden rızkını veren cümlelere Sultân benemNutfadan âdem yaratan yumurtadan kuZ dürüdenKudret dilini söyleten zikreyleyen Subhân benemKimisini zâhid kılan kimisine fısk iZletenAyıplarını örtücü ol Delîl ve Burhân benemBenem ebed benem bekâ ol Kâdir-i Hak – mutlakâYarın Hızır ola sakâ anı kılan gufrân benemEt ve deri, sögük ve cân, ten perdelerini tutanKudret iZim çoktur benim hem Zâhir u “Ayân benemHem bâtinem hem zâhirem hem evvelem hem âhiremHem ben Ol”um hem Ol benem Ol Kerîm-i Subhân benemYoktur arada tercemân andagı iZ bana beyânOldur bana veren lisân ol deniz ve ummân benemBu yeri gökü yaratan bu “arZ ve kürsî devridenBinbir adı vardır Yûnus ol sâhib-i Kur”ân benem{I am He with power over “Be and it was,” the Beneficent, the Merciful.I am Sultan over all, who gives their nourishment without stint.I am He who created Adam from semen, who produces birds from eggs,Who gives speech to the tongue of Power, the reciter of praise and theOne who is praised.I am He who makes some ascetics and others fornicators.And who conceals their faults; I am the Evidence and the Proof."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE320I am the Eternal, the Powerful, absolute Truth.Tomorrow Khaqir will provide you with water: I am He whoforgives him.I am He who keeps body and soul together, flesh and skin and bones.I have many deeds of Power.

I am the possessor of theKoran.}From these accounts, to which many more examples could be added, it isclear that Yenus Emre grasped with great intuitive power – a power no less thanthat of Jalal al-Dcn Remc – the most extensive and refined nefc philosophy thatprevailed in Anatolia at that time and succeeded in expressing it with astoundingforce and eloquence using the primitive Turkish of that period. While we can byno means consider Yenus Emre to be an illiterate dervish, we may not fault himbecause he was not able to create a wholly individual philosophical system. Heappropriated to himself entirely the broad and unrestrained views of Muryc’l-Dcn Ibn al-‘Arabc, Jalal al-Dcn Remc, and their disciples. In his spirit a mystic,in his character he was a great and genuine artist. A number of leading Persianpoets and nefcs had adopted Neoplatonism in its Islamic form while making noattempt to create an individual system; and Yenus Emre followed their lead. Yethe succeeded in expressing all the nefc principles in the simplest language and insuch an artistic manner, and he made his works live so vigorously among thepeople that his like has never been seen in our literature or in Persian literature.Yenus Emre was not a great philosopher, but he was a sincere, enthusiastic, andgenuine nefc and above all a poet of genius. After Armad Yasawc, one encoun-ters no other nefc poet in all Turkish literature who had as much influence asYenus Emre.54It would be totally incorrect to regard Yenus Emre as a bAUinC, i.e. “as afollower of the creeds that did not conform to the official doctrines,”55 becausehe did not go beyond the principles found in Muryc ’l-Dcn Ibn al-‘Arabc andJalal al-Dcn Remc, principles that were not even regarded as contrary to theSharC“a – albeit interpreted allegorically – even by a large segment of the orthodoxreligious establishment.56 If Muryc ’l-Dcn Ibn al-‘Arabc, Jalal al-Dcn Remc andtheir followers are to be considered as bAUinCs, then Yenus Emre would also haveto be included among them, but Muslim scholars never understood the termbAUiniyya in this fashion."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE321FY§nus Emre and ¡ur§fismlurefism is a creed that was spread by Faql Allah al-Na‘cmc Astarabadhc in theeighth/fourteenth century and penetrated Anatolia in the ninth/fifteenth andtenth/sixteenth centuries. Its fundamental beliefs and the reasons for its appear-ance have been very well studied.57 Although a number of Turkish nefc poets likeNescmc, Rafc‘c, and Tamannayc adopted this creed,58 no one to date has madethe slightest suggestion that Yenus Emre was a lurefc; neither the old historiansand biographers nor modern researchers have spoken of such a likelihood. RızâTevfik, probably believing Yenus Emre was a ninth/fifteenth-century poet, wasthe first to conclude from certain passages he saw in the DCwAn that he was alurefc.59 The information I provided in the previous section on the life of YenusEmre showed that it is virtually certain that he died long before the appearanceof Faql Allah Astarabadhc and thus to regard him as a lurefc is completelywithout foundation. Indeed, no evidence whatsoever has come to light indicatingthat he was in fact a lurefc. Some things do exist in his work pertaining toArabic letters and their secrets,60 but they are common to all the great nefcs andare a part of nefc Islam, not as a fundamental principle but as an appendage,and it is impossible to attribute lurefism to those nefcs who speak of them.61 Ifone were to consider everyone who believed in the secrets of the Arabic letters tobe a lurefc, then one would have to accept that lurefism was established longbefore Faql Allah. But because it is certain that the strange and childish systemthat we know under the name lurefism originated with this figure, such a claimis untenable.62 In short, because all nefcs believed in the secrets of the letters, andbecause this belief has no connection with lurefism, nothing further need besaid on this matter. Rızâ Tevfik apparently ignored the importance that Muslimmystics gave to the Arabic script and never considered whether Yenus Emrecame before or after Faql Allah. He created the issue of Yenus Emre’s lurefismout of nothing and tried to include him among the lurefc poets. In light of thisbrief discussion, it is obvious how baseless and fanciful this claim is.G ConclusionIn Chapter 7 of this book, I outlined the spiritual and literary character ofAnatolia before Yenus Emre and described the milieu in which he flourished.After providing descriptions of Yenus Emre’s poetry with respect to its linguisticand literary character and its ethical and mystical features, I would now like todraw the threads together and make some brief general remarks concerning hisartistic achievement and his similarity to Armad Yasawc.First, was Yenus Emre an artist, and what inherent value does his work havefrom a strictly aesthetic perspective? From the time of our early biographers,whose elementary and limited views of art we know quite well, to the present –which has naturally been influenced by these same elementary views – YenusEmre has never been thought of as an artist. Indeed, as I have shown above,"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE322Yenus Emre, who was an ardent nefc, was not concerned in the least with artand artistry. He simply sang of his soul and his spiritual excitement, his needsand inspirations. As with all nefcs, the single external factor that drove him inthis matter was his desire to assist people by giving them spiritual guidance.Nevertheless, his lack of concern for art, his disregard of the regularities oflanguage and rhymes, were never obstacles to his becoming an artist, indeed agreat artist. To the contrary, if he had been preoccupied with artistry accordingto the conception of that time, he would not have been able to avoid an affecta-tion of style, i.e. the rules of old classical literature, and consequently he wouldnot have been able to pour out his soul with such sincerity. The basis of art ispersonality, and the most powerful personalities are those who are the mostsincere. In other words, the fact that Yenus Emre was ignorant of his ownartistry is by no means an obstacle to considering him a great artist.Yenus Emre’s art was a completely popular, i.e. a completely Turkish, art,so that when we analyze it we discover two major fundamental elements. First,the Islamic-Neoplatonist element gave Yenus Emre his mystical and ethicalprinciples. This constitutes the matter in his work. Second, the Turkish popularelement provided his language, style, meter, and verse-form. This constitutes theform of his work. Because form and matter cannot be separated from each other– and can only be analyzed by abstraction – these two elements have coalescedin Yenus Emre’s personality, resulting in art that is completely national, i.e.completely Turkish with respect to taste. Expressing this metaphorically, wecould say that Yenus dissolved these two elements in the crucible of his person-ality and brought forth brand new material possessing completely different anddistinctive qualities. Yenus Emre’s power – or, to use a more forceful and moreaccurate expression, his genius – derives from this capacity. And essentially thisform of genius is also completely Turkish.63Yenus Emre created this national art form and imprinted it – in a manner soforceful that it would not fade over the centuries – with the seal of his personality.The distinctive qualities of this art form are purity, sincerity, simplicity, clarity,and power. While reading Yenus, we sense that a simple ingenuous dervish, witheyes full of compassion and love, is singing to us in divine language. In hisaddresses and pleas to God, this dervish, who opens his soul to us like an oldfriend, shouts, weeps, or protests, or else, always with a most natural purity,simplicity, and sincerity, sings in a state of rapture. His work has no trace ofanything artificial, ostentatious, ceremonial, or in conformity with rules ofetiquette. The simplicity of his soul is reflected transparently in all his hymns.Yenus Emre speaks about the most profound and difficult metaphysical ques-tions with amazing clarity. Even those who know nothing about the subtleties ofIslamic mysticism or the doctrines of the Neoplatonist school become spirituallyacquainted with these subjects by reading his hymns, for they will have perceivedin their hearts the riddles of existence. Yenus Emre had the ability to instruct thepeople by making them sense these mysteries – albeit in the simplest manner –with the purity and directness of an illiterate. He expressed himself forcefully and"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE323convincingly and his way of presenting the most intractable problems was straight-forward. Indeed, his ingenuous boldness in expounding the most sublime truthsis too personal and sublime to be found even among the greatest Persian nefcs.Sırât kıldan incedir kılıçtan keskincedirVarıp anın üstüne evler yapasım gelirAltında gayyâ vardır içi nâr ile pürdürVarıp ol gölgelikte biraz yatasım gelirTa“n eylemen hocalar hatırınız hoZ olsunVaruben ol tamuda biraz yanasım gelir{Sırât (the eschatological bridge over hell) is thin as a hair and sharp as asword:I would like to go there and build houses on it.Below it is the inferno, blazing with fire:I would like to go and lie down a while in that shade.Don’t blame me, teachers – please think well of me –I would like to go and burn in hell a while.}This manner of expression, which the reader finds astounding and convincingat the same time, is so natural that we would almost think we were hearing itfrom the mouth of the famous illiterate shepherd whom Moses encountered.64But Yenus Emre was not illiterate like this shepherd. He was familiar with all thecontemporary {intellectual} systems. Still, it is marvellous how he can resolvethe most abstruse metaphysical questions with such purity of heart and simplicityand with such a sense of the popular taste, while lending them the sincerity of anilliterate. The primary features that we found in Yenus Emre’s art – simplicity,clarity, power – we also see clearly in other branches of Turkish art – forexample, in architecture – which is its most exemplary branch.65 This too showsthat Yenus’s literary genius was completely national and typical.This brief analysis of Yenus’s art also makes clear why his works have flourishedfor centuries among the people. The first of the two elements that shaped YenusEmre’s art, i.e. the Islamic-Neoplatonist element, has hardly diminished duringthe six centuries that have elapsed since his time. To the contrary, it has per-sisted, and indeed continually increased in importance right up to modern times.The intellectual heritage of the ancient Greeks, which was studied in the madrasas,and later the rich and valuable works of the Persian nefcs, which were read inthe tekkes, reinforced this manner of feeling and thought and spread it to themasses. As these views, which slowly spread from the upper classes to the com-mon people, eventually became pervasive among the public, it became impossible,of course, for the hymns of Yenus Emre to be forgotten. Above all, the fact thatthis element was presented in new dress with forms wholly derived from thepeople and in a manner that suited their taste, and thus the most sublime anddifficult metaphysical doctrines were expressed in a national form that was simple"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE324enough to be understood by the people, gave a very prominent place to YenusEmre’s hymns among even the simplest folk.As I said above while analyzing the reasons for the success of Armad Yasawc,the general conservativeness of popular literature over the centuries, i.e. the lackof a major change in the popular taste, was another factor contributing to thepopularity of his work for centuries. In addition, one must also search for Yenus’sartistic success, which endured for centuries, not only in the lack of a significantintellectual and spiritual change in the milieu that his art addressed, but alsosomewhat in his personality, in his genius. If this were not the case, our greatintellectual {Gökalp} would not have tried to imitate the national and sincerestyle of Yenus Emre’s hymns in a number of his own hymns written during therecent years of revolution in which great importance has been given to researchon the national taste.66Those who read separately my ideas about Armad Yasawc and Yenus Emrecould easily make for themselves a comparison between the two. In order to savethem the trouble, it will suffice for me to briefly list certain important differencesbetween them. First, it is certain that Armad Yasawc and his followers influencedYenus Emre and his predecessors in Anatolia. Even the artistic elements ofArmad Yasawc and Yenus Emre are virtually identical. In Yenus Emre, however,the philosophical element becomes broader and more sublime, assuming anexplicit form of pantheism {wujEdiyya-i khayAliyya}. At the same time, the expres-sion is no longer dry and didactic, but acquires a lyrical and lively form. Thedifference between them cannot be explained simply as the result of period andmilieu. Yenus Emre apparently never gave a thought to founding a UarCqa and sonever gained the spiritual influence of the founder of a UarCqa. Nevertheless, hehad a much more sensitive temperament than Armad Yasawc and was a muchmore individual artist. He was also a more exuberant and vigorous nefc thanArmad Yasawc. In all of Turkish literature, from its origin to the present, nogreater nefc poet has ever appeared.NOTES1 We possess no clear documentation on this matter, but the fact that all copies of theDCwAn belong to recent centuries leads us to accept this notion. Otherwise, because theworks of this early poet were so well known and widespread, we should certainly findan early copy of his DCwAn written in the eighth/fourteenth or ninth/fifteenth century.The lack of a dCwAn is the reason why early anthologies {majmE“as and cönks} are full ofYenus Emre’s hymns. I mentioned above that true nefcs who sang simply for the sakeof the divine, without any concern for artistry, and without any desire for fame, rarelyrecorded and arranged their works into dCwAns and that even the DCwAn-i Likmat wascollected and arranged by an enthusiastic murCd long after the death of Armad Yasawc.It is clear that the works of Armad Yasawc and Yenus Emre are quite similar in thisrespect.2 Foy, who made a number of extensive linguistic analyses of the two texts thatMühlbacher published, cites them in Arabic script as follows, transcribed here, withcertain corrections, as early texts of Yenus Emre {“Die ältesten osmanischen"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE325Transscriptionstexte in gothischen Lettern,” with further emendations based onrecent studies by Talât Tekin, “Yunus Emre’nin gotik harfleriyle iki manzumesi,”Erdem, 3 (1987), 367–92, and Heidi Stein, “Das türkische Sprachgut im ‘Tractatus deMoribus, Condictionibus et Nequicia Turcorum’ (1481) des Georg von Ungarn,”Archivum Ottomanicum, 14 (1995/6), 39 –78; 15 (1997), 89 –118}:Gâfil olma aç gözünüHâline bak öleni görKötülük etme dünyâdaYazukların dileni görNiceler yatır düZübenGirm ilan, çiyan üZübenSümükleri saçıZubanÇürüyen ovulanı görKim âh edüb kılır zârıGünâhdur elinde varıGöçmüZ yatır pîr u karıMiskînleri güleni görSorma hâlin kimisineYnanma yaramasına {?}Kim isini gövdesineUlZup yeni yılanı gör {?}Hanı Muhammed MustafâHüküm etti Kaf”tan kaf”aDünyâ kime kıldı vefâAldanıben kalanı görAldanma mâla davaraKulluk eyle Hakk”a yaraSevik ile bile varaBâkî yoldaZ olanı görYûnus bu sözleri çatarHalka ma“rifet satarKendisi nekadar dutarSöylediXi yalanı gör***Yanar içim göner özümBen ölümü anıçagÖlüm endîZesi ne hoZUlulara danıçagÖliseriz belli beyânGizli içimiz olur ayânTeneZir üstüne konupHalk önünde yunıçagHiç bilmezem ben nice idemHangi yana sefer idemYakasız don giyem gidemBaZsız ata biniçegGele bana kavum kardaZOla sine degi yoldaZKim olısar bana hâldaZBen sin”imde kalıçagKalam ben “amelim ileHer niceyse hâlim ileGide kavum güle güleEvden yana döniçegSana eydirem ey paZaNeler geliserdur baZaKimi isiden baXır piZeKim Zarâba kanıçagYarın siyâset kurulaCümle halâyık dirileKim emîr sâyevân birleKimi isiden yanıçag“Amel verer onda cevâb“Amelsize olur “itâb{ol kiZiye olmaz azâbBunda âzâd olıçagYûnus imdi kıl yarakUtanmayasın doXru bakCümle halâyık dirileAdlı adıyle sayılıçag{Don’t be neglectful: open your eyes; consider your condition; see the dying.Don’t do evil in this world; seek forgiveness for your sins.How many have fallen and lie in the grave, with swarms of worms, snakes andcentipedes,"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE326Their bones scattered.

For example, we encounterSuluan Walad’s concept of mâl davar {worldly goods} in his line YoX idi mâlım tavarım kimvirem {I had no worldly goods to give} here in the line aldanma mâla davara {Be notdeceived by worldly goods}. We also come across such adverbial and verbal forms asgeliben, kaliben, geliser, and kalıser, belonging to the early periods of Turkish and found inthe works of Suluan Walad, ‘fshıq Pasha, and Gülshehrc. Similarly, sin in the line Bensin”imde kalıçag means “grave.” We also find this word in {al-Kashgharc’s} DCwAn lughAt"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE327al-turk (vol. 3, p. 101). In the {anonymous lexicon} Tercemân-ı Türkî ve Arabî {743/1343}, which belongs to that period, this word is also found having the meaning“grave” and “statue.” It is very likely that this refers to the statue placed on the graveaccording to a well known custom among the early Turks. While Foy’s linguisticexplanations need to be criticized in many respects, I will not mention them here. Iwill say, however, that these texts, despite Foy’s claim to the contrary, definitelybelong to Yenus Emre. The second of these two poems has another characteristic thatwe find in our earliest folk poetry and in the work of Armad Yasawc, namely, that thefourth verse, which serves as a refrain, is always one syllable short compared to themain verses. In other words, the poem is mainly in 4 + 4 meter while the refrains haveseven syllables (on this subject see Chapter 5, pp. 160–1, nn.44 and 45).3 There are a number of poems belonging to Yenus Emre in the JAmi“ al-naVA”ir, whichwas collected and arranged by Hacı Kemal from Exridir in 918/1415 –16 {on thelatter, see EI2, s.v. “Mukhtarat” (Günay Kut), p. 531}. I will cite one of them hereverbatim in order to give an idea of their linguistic nature:DüZmüZem elden ayaXa {âh-u Sultânım mededDertliyem geldim kapuna derde dermânım mededSen hakîkat serveri ben bir kemîne kul seninHizmete geldim kabûl et ben kulun Hân”ın mededSendedir mühr-î Süleymân sana fermân ins-ü cânYeryüzünü tuttu dîvler ey Süleymân”ım mededFikr-ü zikrindir hemîZe gönlümün eXlencesiKimse yâr olmaz bana hiç tendeki cânım mededYanalıdan nâra baXrım aZkına Ceyhûn gibiDurmaz akar gözlerimden yaZ ile kanım mededKâfileden ayrı düZtüm ey Emîr Hâcı”m benim“Âsi hurma berkesinde kaldı kârvânım mededAZk ile geldi kapuna Tapduk”ım Yûnus seninGice gündüz endîZem Tapduk”um-ü cânım mededThis ghazal, which is not found in the published DCwAn, but is also in a manuscriptcopy {of the DCwAn} in my private library, is corrupt in many respects.4 There is no question that there are many poems in the printed and manuscript copiesof Yenus Emre’s DCwAn that do not belong to him. For example, the hymn thatmentions him in the couplet Yûnus idi pîZrevimiz ÂZık PaZa KüZterî”miz / Ol demde okuYsmâ“îl Miskîn niyâmında idi {Yenus was our forerunner, ‘fshıq Pasha our Kushterc /Recite at that time, Isma‘cl: Miskcn was asleep (?)} – which shows that Yenus hadprecedence followed by ‘fshıq Pasha and Shaikh Kushterc {d. c.767/1366} – clearlyappears to have been written by a nefc poet with the pen name Isma‘cl and cannotpossibly be attributed to him. Similarly, other hymns written by someone with the penname Amcr Sayyid do not belong to him. In addition, it would be incorrect to assumethat all the hymns by writers with the pen names Yenus, ‘fshıq Yenus, DervishYenus, Miskcn Yenus, Qul Yenus, and Yenus Emrem can be attributed to him. As Imentioned above while discussing Armad Yasawc, poems that a number of unknowndervishes who had the pen name Yenus wrote in imitation of those by Yenus Emre,which had for them a sacred quality, have been mixed with his genuine poetry. GivenYenus Emre’s great fame, hymns belonging to others could also have been attributedto him as they were copied from one anthology to another. For example, the famous"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE328hymn Abdu”l-Kâdir gibi bir er bulunmaz {There is no saint like ‘Abd al-Qadir}, which hasbeen presented as belonging to Yenus Emre, is attributed to Ezrefoxlu {d. 873/1469,see EI2, s.v. “Eshrefoghlu” (Fahir yz)} in an anthology in my possession. In my discussionabove of Armad Yasawc’s DCwAn-i Likmat, I dwelt on the factors that gave rise to thisphenomenon.5 One comes across traditions mixed with all sorts of superstitions that point to the largenumber of Yenus Emre’s hymns among the dervishes. According to these traditions,Yenus Emre recited improvised hymns – or, to use another well known term, orations{nuUuq} – wherever he stopped and there were so many of them that some were sungby animals, some by humans, and some by angels. Such traditions are very significantfor showing the place and influence of Yenus Emre among the people.6 For example, the hymn quoted above {in n.3} that was taken from {Hacı Kemal’s}JAmi“ al-naVA ”ir appears in the following form in the manuscript copy in my privatelibrary:DüZmüZ (em) elden ayaga Zâh(u) sultânım mededDertlüyüm geldim kapuna derde dermânım mededSen hakîkat severisin ben kemîne kemterinKulluXa geldim kapuna ben kula hânım mededSendedir mühr-i Süleymân sana fermân ins-ü cînYir yüzini tuttı dîvler hey Süleymân”ım mededYanalıdanberi baXrım aZkına Ceyhûn gibiDurmaz akar gözlerimden yaZ ile kanım mededKâfileden ayrı düZtüm ey Emîr Hâcı”m benim“Âsi hurma berkesinde kaldı kârbânım mededKulluXa bel baXlayub Tabdûk”a Yûnus ( ?!) gibiGice gündüz endîZem câna cânanım mededOne may also find different versions – often quite confused – of the same hymn invarious places in one DCwAn.7 There are numerous manuscript copies of Yenus Emre’s DCwAn. {In Turkey} copiesare found in many libraries, including the Galata Mevlevî-hânesi Library (no. 608)and the Âtıf Efendi Library {in Istanbul} (no. 1047). Many other copies are found inthe libraries of Europe. One frequently comes across not only the DCwAn but alsoanthologies containing the works of Yenus Emre in Flügel’s manuscript catalogue forVienna, in Pertsch’s catalogue for Berlin, and in catalogues of other libraries. Inaddition to a fairly good manuscript copy in my private library, I have been able toexamine five or six other copies of the DCwAn in private hands. In an anthology in theEsad Efendi Library {in the Süleymaniye Library in Istanbul}, quite a few hymns ofYenus Emre are given together with the names of the composer. My private libraryalso includes many anthologies that contain works of Yenus Emre. In any case, thosewho wish to make linguistic analyses of his DCwAn will be able to find numerous suchmanuscripts of it as well as anthologies.8 For the close relationship between Azerc dialect and early Anatolian Turkish, see YA,s.v. “Âzerî” ( M. F. Köprülü).9 On the classification of Turkish dialects in the fifth/eleventh century, see the longdiscussion above {in Chapter 5, pp. 130 – 4} concerning the dialect in which ArmadYasawc wrote.10 E. J. W. Gibb compares the language of Yenus Emre and Suluan Walad and reachesthe following conclusion: “The language, though naturally abounding in long-obsolete words and forms, is considerably more Ottoman than that of the Rebáb-Náme"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE329verses. This may probably be in some measure owing to the ‘corrections’ of successivecopyists, but it is no doubt chiefly attributable to the fact that the author was anorthern Turk” (A History of Ottoman Poetry, vol. 1, {p. 167}). I definitely cannot acceptthe idea that there was such a great difference, with regard to language, between theworks of Yenus Emre and Suluan Walad. If we possessed an early and reliable copy ofYenus Emre’s DCwAn, I could very easily prove my contention. But even without sucha copy – thanks to other works from Anatolia from those periods – I can assert verystrongly that morphologically and phonetically there is no significant difference betweenthe works of Yenus Emre and Suluan Walad and that their poetry should be includedin the same linguistic parameters. The fact that Gibb provides no evidence for hisclaim reveals its weakness. If Gibb had seen early contemporary copies of these works,he would not have attributed such a great difference to the works of Suluan Walad. Icould strengthen my contention with considerable evidence if necessary.11 In the printed edition of the DCwAn, and in most manuscript copies, this proseintroduction is laid out as verse. On closer examination, however, it is obvious that itis not verse but a kind of rhymed prose. I have only found this laid out as prose insome good and carefully written manuscripts.12 In the printed DCwAn, this mathnawC is found in a very corrupt and completely unreli-able form. The manuscript copy in my private library, however, is in the proper andcorrect form. It is written in the mafA“Clun, mafA“Clun, fa“Elun meter and has more or lesspreserved its early linguistic features {see Gölpınarlı edn, pp. 2–37}.13 Veled Chelebi {yzbudak}, in an article that he wrote in 1313/1895 –6 for a specialjoint issue of Tercümân-ı hakîkat-Servet-i fünûn {i.e. the daily newspaper Tercümân-ı hakîkatand the illustrated weekly Servet-i fünûn}, is of the same opinion. E. J. W. Gibb, whoperhaps follows him, also agrees: “All this verse is written in the Turkish metres,which is doubtless what Tash'öpri-záde means when he speaks of Yúnus’ words beingin the ‘ballad style.’. . . Yúnus’ verse is rugged beyond that of any other Turkish poet;this is in part owing to the fact that he alone used exclusively the uncultivated Turkishmetres; Sultán Veled. . . and Yúnus’ contemporaries and immediate successors . . .wrote in one of the established Persian metres” (A History of Ottoman Poetry, vol. 1,{pp. 167, 168}). Melioransky, in his treatise that I mentioned above {“K voprosu oznachenii”}, also says “The language of Yenus Emre is purer and sounder than thelanguage of subsequent Ottoman poets. His meter is the syllabic meter. These twofeatures, which were viewed unfavorably by Ottoman men of letters and historians,give, in my opinion, much greater value to his work.” The reason for this mistakenidea must be sought not only in the lack of a critical attitude, but in the unreliabilityof the text of the printed DCwAn and in the fact that even ‘fshıq Chelebi and Tashköprü-Zade indicate that he wrote only in the syllabic meter.14 In Chapter 1 (pp. 11–12), I touched on the feelings for nature in our early folk poetry.For more on this subject, see my Türk edebiyatı tarihi ( Istanbul, 1928), pp. 87, 184,194ff. In the Kutadgu Bilig, there are some passages that sincerely describe nature, suchas in the introduction to the ode about Bughra Khan. See the text published byRadloff {Das Kudatku-Bilik; and see Dankoff ’s Eng. trans., pp. 41–3, and his study “OnNature in Karakhanid Literature,” Journal of Turkish Studies, 4 (1980), 27–35}.15 As, for example, in the passages:Gitti bu kıZ zulmeti geldi bahâr nâz ileYeni nebâtlar bitti cünbüZ oldu yaz ileYine merg-zâr oldu uZ yeni gülzâr olduTer naXme düzer oldu mûsıkî de sâz ileHoZ haber geldi dosttan bezendi bâX-ü bostânÖtüZür hezâr destân bülbülleri râz ile"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE330Kim görmüZtür baykuZu gülsitâna girdiXinLeylekler zikredemez bir latîf âvâz ileNice mâh saklar isen dürdâne gevher olmazLeylek leylekle uçar hemîZe bâz bâz ileEl kuZu elden ele gül kuZu gülden güleBaykuZ vîrâne sever Zâhînler pervâz ile{Winter’s darkness is gone.

The poet, using artistic language,is interpreting its manifestation in a completely mystical fashion. Other such naturepoetry found in the DCwAn is generally of the same kind. For a true nefc who findswhat he is searching for wholly and exclusively in his own conscience, this should beconsidered normal.16 In a short monograph entitled Millî arûz, Necib Âsım attributes the ghazal Müsülmânlargönül Zehri açılmaz key alâmet var / nazar eylen bu dünyâya aceb dürlü melâmet var {Muslims:the city of the heart will not open. There is a good sign. / Look at this world: thereare wondrous kinds of blame}, which I very much doubt belonged to Yenus Emre, tothe confused time at the end of the Seljuk period and tries to establish an artificialrelationship between the works of this dervish, who was indifferent to the outsideworld, and his milieu. The poetic inspiration of the nefcs, however, is dependentonly on their own inner nature and conscious universe and is remote from anyconcern with time and place. The unity that is perceptible amidst the endlessvariety of phenomena in the universe and the existence that is concentrated in self-consciousness are the only stock-in-trade of a true nefc. The adorer of unity who findsabsolute being, which is the greatest reality, in the conscience would not deign tocomplain about his time in the following manner: Ne kâdî adl-ü dâd eyler ne kayguluyuZâd eyler / Ne ümmî i“tikâd eyler ne imâmda imâmet var {The qAQC neither practices justicenor cheers the distressed. / Neither does the illiterate have faith nor does the prayer-leader lead the prayer}. There are stories that persist among the people aboutthe evil, oppression, and irreligion of every period, government, and governmentofficial and there are various ballads and poems of this kind that we can consider anoutward manifestation of this spiritual condition, but they have no nefc significancewhatsoever. On the whole, the nefcs are not pleased with this world and are opposedto it. But this displeasure does not result from good times, bad times, or times ofpublic disorder, or from any such material reasons. Instead, it arises simply from thedesire to attain immediately the “original abode” {maskan-i aTlC, i.e. God}."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE33117 Shaikh Jamal al-Dcn Lerc, who was in Shcraz when Abe Bakr {the Salghurid, 628 –58/1231– 60} was the Atabeg of that city, was a nefc obsessed by divine love. Fromtime to time, he recited satirical verse. Using these satirical verses as a pretext, somereligious scholars issued a fatwA for his execution and wanted an authorization fromthe ruler to carry out the fatwA. The ruler said that he would not grant such anauthorization as long as Shaikh Najcb al-Dcn Buzghush and Mu‘cn al-Dcn did notdeclare him to be an infidel. They concluded that because he was overcome by divinelove, he could not be declared an infidel and he was therefore saved ({ Jamc,} NafaRAt,{Turkish} trans., pp. 533 – 4). Some nefcs, while not being obsessed by divine love butimitating those who were, did not hesitate to recite, from time to time, satirical versesof a nefc character. We have, for example, the following ghazal by Jalal al-Dcn Remc,for which Shams al-Dcn Scwasc provided a commentary {SharR-i ghazal-i MawlAnA,MS in Köprülü’s private library}:{Yesterday at dawn I found a pack-saddle in the wheel;I found an anvil in the middle of a poppy seed.I had a hat made of chickpeas. I lost it.I found it in the middle of Mulla Sulaiman’s register.A camel train on Mount Qaf was in the pass:I found it wandering at the shore of the boundless sea.nalir’s she-camel, Moses’ rod, father’s soul:I found all three alive and dead in mother’s belly.Jesus’ donkey and the needle that is a fetter:I found that donkey in the house and that needle in the collar.I ate a piece of boiled bread made from wheat and millet and barley,And without striking my teeth, I found the income of the seven climes."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE332I found 360 mountain-cows with their horns head downIn the oven of a roasted walnut.I found a hundred thousand fawns, their lips full of the milk of wisdom,Moaning in the middle of a nightingale’s egg.Yesterday at dawn I went to the tavern.I found Israfcl’s trumpet moaning in a barrel.Ten camels in Rem were shod one day.One ring was lost: I found it in the Khaqan’s ear.You have spoken these words nicely, Mulla Jalal al-Dcn Remc.I have found their meaning while transcribing the Koran.}According to the nefcs, this kind of satirical verse, which is also found in the DCwAn ofYenus Emre, can be interpreted in several ways. It seems that Yenus Emre, as I willexplain below, agreed with Mawlana in this matter as in many others. We often findsuch satire in subsequent imitators of Yenus Emre, such as Qayghusuz, who wrotethis kind of hymn, and in many Bektashc poets right up to recent times. It would bewrong to dismiss such poems as nonsense based on their outward form alone, withouttaking into account their true meaning from the nefc point of view. In the first line ofMawlana’s ghazal, for example, by dûZ {yesterday} he means “Alam-i alast {primordialworld}, by subhdem {dawn} he means tajallC-i af“Al {self-manifestation of acts}, by pâlân{pack-saddle} he means rER {soul}, by dâne-i haZhaZ {poppy seed} he means shay”-iRaqCr {insignificant thing}, and by sindân {anvil} he means nafs-i ammAra {soul thatcommands evil}. Thus the meaning of this first couplet becomes clear.18 This is an important characteristic that is noticeable not only in Yenus Emre but alsoin almost all the poets of that period. In periods when the language was still unable toaccommodate the “arEQ system, our poets could only use those “arEQ meters that werevery close to the syllabic meter. For the most part, they did this so poorly that, as Istated above, several scholars have not been able to tell if they were writing in the“arEQ or the syllabic meter. The errors of Thúry, E. J. W. Gibb, and even VeledChelebi on this subject have resulted from this. Indeed, “arEQ patterns like fA“ilAtun,fA“ilAtun, fA“ilAt and mafA“Clun, mafA“Clun, fa“Elun, when badly used, are difficult to distinguishfrom the eleven-syllable pattern.19 E. J. W. Gibb expresses the following opinion in this matter: “Yet Yúnus hadpractically no model; though inspired by Jelál, he did not, like the early mesnevi-writers, copy the Persian masters, and there was no lyric poetry in Western Turkish.There was nothing but some rude folk-songs and popular ballads; and it was in theway of these that Yúnus fashioned his verses. He may indeed have seen or heardthe Díwán-i Hikmet of Khoja Ahmed-i Yeseví, which has much in common with hisown both in manner and matter; but this is in Eastern, not Western, Turkish” (AHistory of Ottoman Poetry, vol. 1, {p. 169}). Also, “In most of the ghazels there is present,in greater or less measure, the favourite Turkish arrangement of a thrice-repeatedinternal sub-rhyme, an arrangement which, as has been said before, works out intopractical identity with what in more literary poetry is known as musemmat verse”(ibid. {p. 167}). The accounts that I have given above show that Gibb was in error onmany points. First, Yenus Emre imitated the Iranian masters in the composition ofmathnawCs. Second, poets like Shayyad lamza used the “arEQ meter and ghazal formbefore Yenus Emre. Third, on the relationship between Armad Yasawc and YenusEmre, I will shed further light below in addition to what I stated above. For therelationship between him and Jalal al-Dcn Remc, see the sections below on the ethicsand philosophy of Yenus Emre."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE33320 Muslim mystics advanced certain ideas about ethics in general and always regardedthe issue of ethics as a complementary aspect of their system. Al-Ghazalc was aconsummate teacher of ethics and Shihab al-Dcn al-Suhrawardc’s {d. 632/1234}“AwArif al-ma“Arif is an excellent handbook of nefc ethics {German trans. RichardGramlich as Die Gaben der Erkenntnisse des “Umar as-SuhrawardC (Wiesbaden, 1978)}.These ethics are a unified system that took shape not only from Neoplatonist doctrinesbut also from the Koran, Sunna, and the traditions of the great nefcs. It is beyond thescope of our subject to analyze them here. I will simply provide some information toshow the relationship of Yenus Emre with other nefc teachers of ethics. nefism,according to some nefcs, is founded on three virtues: adherence to poverty; persistentexertion; and abandoning contention and willfulness. Al-Suhrawardc distinguishesbetween poverty and nefism, but says that according to a noble RadCth love for theneedy and wretched is the key to paradise. The same writer shows humility – inYenus Emre’s term, alçaklık {lowliness} – as the first principle of nefc ethics. Othersinclude sociability, offering assistance and condolence, forgiveness, kindness, justice,and compassion. Concerning kindness, Sufyan al-Thawrc {d. 161/778} said, “Kind-ness is doing good to someone who does bad to you, because reciprocating good forgood is like paying for something you have purchased in the market.” Al-Suhrawardcdescribes the importance of compassion in the nefc view in the following manner:“If people loved each other and appreciated the benefits of compassion, there wouldno longer be a need for courts. Justice is the handmaiden of compassion. It is usedwhere compassion is lacking.” For the nefc, “Observing the principles of compassionis better than observing the principles of pious asceticism because observing compas-sion is inward whereas observing the acts of worship is outward.” It is clear that nefcethics were of a lofty and humane nature. As the basis of personal ethics, this systempromotes the cleansing of one’s mind of evil thoughts, and of the humbling of the self;and as a basis of social ethics it promotes meeting evil with good by loving one’sfellows with a love and compassion acquired from divine love. Generally speaking,these are the basic principles of Yenus’s ethics as well. It is clear, therefore, that thegoal of nefc ethics is to attain divine Truth as “the perfect man.”21 Like, for example, the hymn with the refrain Bir kâmil mürZide varmayınca olmaz{Nothingcan be achieved without a perfect guide}.22 As in the following hymn, for example {Cf. Gölpınarlı, Yunus Emre: Risâlat al-nushiyyave Dîvân, p. 74}:Ykilikten geçemedin, hâli kâl”den seçemedinHak”tan yana uçamadın fakîhlik oldu sana fakCübbe ve hırka taht u tâc versen gerektir aZka bâcDörtyüz mürîdle elli hac terk eyledi Abdü”r-RazzâkAnın gibi dîn ulusu haç öptü çaldı nâkûsuSen dahi bırak nâmûsu gel berü putun oda yakÂZık ma“Zûk birdir bile aZktan gelir her söz dileBî-çâre Yûnus ne bile ne kara okudu ne ak{You have not gone beyone duality.

Every word comes to the tongue out ofLove.What should helpless Yenus know? He has read neither black nor white.}There is an allusion here to the story of Shaikh nan‘an, which was very well knownamong the nefcs.23 The following lines of Yenus Emre, which are very much in harmony with the ethicsof the Gospels, are worthy of note:Kim bize taZ atar ise güller nisâr olsun anaUrmaklıXa kasdedenin düZem öpem ayaXınıHer kim bana söXer ise her dem duâ kılam anaÇırâXıma kasdedenin Hak yandırsun ocaXını{If someone throws stones at us, let us shower him with roses.If someone wants to strike me, let me fall down and kiss his feet.If someone curses me, let me respond with a blessing.If someone wants to take away my lamp, may God kindle his hearth.}The poem below also reveals the bases of nefc ethics and how humane they were buthow difficult to follow:DöXene elsiz gerek, söXene dilsiz gerekDerviZ gönülsüz gerek, sen derviZ olamazsınDerviZ baXrı baZ olur, gözü dolu yaZ olurKoyundan yavaZ olur, sen derviZ olamazsınMuhammed darılmazdı, sen yine darılırsınBu darılmak sende var, sen derviZ olamazsınDerviZ Yûnus sen dahi her gördüXün kakırsınBu kakımak sende var, sen derviZ olamazsın{To one who strikes you, you should be handless (not retaliate); to one whocurses you, you should be tongueless (dumb, silent).The dervish should be heartless (not take offense?) – you cannot be a dervish.The dervish should have wounds in his breast; his eyes should be fullof tears;He should be as gentle as a lamb – you cannot be a dervish.Murammad never took offense, yet you still do.As long as you take offense, you cannot be a dervish.Dervish Yenus: you too get angry at whatever you see.As long as you get angry, you cannot be a dervish.}Here Yenus Emre bases nefc ethics squarely on the Sunna. This great Turkish nefcpoet did not hesitate to freely reveal these broad humane views in many of his otherpoems as well. In one poem, he states the need to honor and serve guests, i.e.strangers, whether they be Muslim or Christian; and in various other poems he alsomentions the importance of the heart, which is the house of God, and the value of"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE335pleasing others. These principles have several ethical consequences. In one poem, hesays {cf. Gölpınarlı, Yunus Emre: Risâlat al-nushiyya ve Dîvân, p. 144}:DürüZ kazan ye yedir bir gönül ele getürBin Ka“be”den yegrekdur bir gönül “imâreti{Strive and earn, eat and feed others; take one heart into your hand (i.e. bekind to one person).Cultivating a single heart is better than a thousand Ka‘bas.}Elsewhere he states it even more beautifully:Gönül Çalab”ın tahtı Çalab gönüle bahtıYki cihân bedbahtı kim gönül yıkar iseSen sana ne sanursan ayruXa hem anı sanBir ma“nâ Dört-Kitâb”tan budur eXer var ise{The heart is God’s throne. God pays regard to the heart.It is the misfortune of both the worlds if someone breaks a heart.Whatever you think of yourself, think the same of others.If the Four Books have any meaning, this is it.}These lines forcefully express a sublime principle of nefc ethics. Compared to them,we can rate as rather uninspired Jamc’s famous poem:{Win a heart – that is the greatest lajj.One heart is better than a thousand Ka‘bas.The Ka‘ba is the shrine of Abraham;The heart is the shrine of the Glorious One.}We also find this influence of Yenus Emre in the following fine quatrain by Khaua’c:HatAyî hâl çaXındaHak gönül alçaXındaYüzbin Ka“be yapmaktırBir gönül al çaXında{Khaua’c is in a mystic state.Truth is in a humble heart.Building a hundred Ka‘basIs in winning a single heart (?).}Many other such examples of aphorisms concerning nefc ethics can be found inYenus Emre’s hymns. This is an important and broad subject that deserves its ownthorough study.24 The following poem is one of the best examples to show Yenus Emre’s nefc ethics{cf. Gölpınarlı, Yunus Emre: Risâlat al-nushiyya ve Dîvân, p. 49}:"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE336Söylememek harcısı söylemenin hâssıdırSöylemenin harcısı gönüllerin pasıdırGönüllerin pasını ger sileyin der isen{ol sözü söylegil kim sözün hulâsasıdırSözü doXru diyene kuli”l-hak dedi ÇalabBunda yalan söyleyen yarın utanasıdırYetmiZiki millete bir göz ile bakmayanHalka müderris olsa hakîkatte âsîdir{erî“atin haberin Zerhile diyem iZit{erî“at bir gemidir hakîkat deryâsıdırOl geminin tahtası nekadar muhkem iseDeniz mevc uruncaXız soyub uZadasıdırBundan içerü haber dinlegil benden ey yârHakîkatin kâfiri Zer“in evliyâsidir{The expense of not speaking is the income of speaking.The expense of speaking is rust on the heart.If you wish to wipe away the rust on your heart,Speak only those words that are the epitome of speech.To one who speaks truth, God has said: “Say: the truth . . .” (Koran, 18:29).He who speaks false today will be ashamed tomorrow.He who does not consider the 72 religious communities as equalIs a sinner in truth, though he be a religious instructor to the people.Listen and I’ll inform you about the SharC“a along with the commentary:The SharC“a is a boat in the sea of Truth.No matter how firm the planks of that boat,When the waves of the sea strike it, they will shake it to pieces.Now listen, my friend, and I’ll inform you of the hidden meaning:The infidel of Truth is the saint of the SharC“a.}25 In order to demonstrate the degree to which the ethics propagated by the Muslimmystics are based on Neoplatonism, it is necessary to touch on Plotinus’ conception ofethics. According to Plotinus, because God is absolute perfection, every created thingis perfect in its kind and degree. Nothing occurs subject to accident. Everything, everyphenomenon, has an ultimate cause. This theory of ultimate cause, which Plotinusexplains in great detail, naturally leads to optimism. His defense of the argumentagainst the existence of evil is very strong. “Evil does not exist of its own accord; itonly coexists with good. Inequality is a condition of order and regularity. To be sure,when evil is abstracted and exists in isolation, it is evil, not good. For example,ugliness is ugly, not beautiful; but if every part were beautiful, the whole could not bebeautiful.” He expresses the refutation of pain and death more clearly and elegantlythan Seneca and all of the Stoics. Death is so insignificant that on festival days peoplegather to watch it. It is a kind of stage play and cannot be taken seriously. Whatsuffers pain or dies is not our soul but our material existence. The only correct thingin life is duty. The cries and sobs that fill the world do not prove the existence of evil,but the cowardice of mankind. Plotinus, who was a panthiest and fatalist, should haveconfused duty with nature and nature with necessity. But, while denying free will, he"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE337speaks of it as though not denying it (for, like Spinoza, he accepts the existence of freewill only on condition of observing the laws of nature and agrees that actions based onperception and intelligence and without compulsion are voluntary). The ethics ofPlotinus, like those of Plato, are pure, severe, and take divine perfection as the goal.The influence of the Stoics on Plotinus in this respect is also quite obvious. Accordingto Plotinus, prudence, courage, and temperance are the virtues of man as a politicalanimal, i.e. the bases of social ethics. As for the virtues required for the philosophers,they comprise not only these virtues, to which the people are confined, but also thepurifying and inspiring virtues that save us from this world and prepare us for ecstacy,i.e. justice, knowledge, and love. These are the bases of individual ethics. For Plotinus,like Plato, knowledge is a virtue that elevates mankind and generates love. Finally,above all these ethical virtues there is mystical ecstasy, union with God, which isthe ultimate goal of ethics as well as the ultimate goal of metaphysics {except for thefirst sentence, Köprülü translated this footnote to this point from Adolphe Franck(ed.), Dictionnaire des sciences philosophiques, 2nd edn (Paris, 1875), s.v. “Plotin,” ( JulesSimon), p. 1349}. If we compare Plotinus’ ethical principles with nefc ethics, we canreadily see that nefc ethics have a close relationship with Muslim tradition, althoughwe find in it the influence of all the Greek ethical systems. The principles of socialethics in particular are broader, more humane, and stronger in nefc ethics than inthose of Plotinus.26 This great movement, which is famous in the history of philosophy under the generalname of Neoplatonism, and which continued strongly for a full three centuries fromthe second to the sixth century ce, was basically inspired by Platonic doctrine. Theoriginal founder of this movement was Ammonius Saccas, a Christian, and it aroseas a system of thought in Alexandria. If we take into consideration the status ofAlexandria at that time, we can more or less account for the basic features of thissystem. Alexandria was then a place where various philosophies and religions werefound. In addition to hosting disciples of Plato and Pythagorus, various Jewish sectsthat prepared the ground for the cabala by interpreting the Bible or else tried tocombine Philo and Greek philosophy with Judaism, and Gnostics who claimed aconnection with Zoroaster, it was home to a Christianity that had established a strongcenter of activity there with Saint Athanasius and sought to oppose Greek philosophy.A complex spiritual state resulted from this mixture of creeds. Critical skepticismand naive superstition reigned side by side. The destruction and transformation ofcustoms produced an ascetic reaction in all of these beliefs. The three basic qualitiesof Neoplatonism – eclecticism, mysticism, and asceticism – can be explained quitewell as a result of the influence of this environment. The greatest representative of thissystem of belief was Plotinus. This philosophical system, which constituted the lastactive stage of ancient Greek philosophy and formed a link between the ancientscientific mentality and the medieval mentality, ultimately acquired a completelymystical nature with Iamblichus and his students. (For more information on thesesubjects, see the following works: Étienne Vacherot, Histoire critique de l’école d’Alexandrie,3 vols, {1846 –51; reprinted Amsterdam, 1965}; Jules Simon, Histoire de l’école d’Alexandrie,2 vols, [ Paris, 1845]; Jules Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire, De l ’école d ’Alexandrie; {rapport àl’Académie des sciences morales et politiques, précédé d’un essai sur la méthode des Alexandrins et lemysticisme, et suive d’une traduction de morceaux choisis de Plotin}, [ Paris, 1845].

In the article on Plotinusin the latter work, there is an adequate account of the French translation of this work.)E. J. W. Gibb defends the connection of Muslim mysticism with Neoplatonismas follows: “Many Orientalists consider Súfiism to be an offshoot from the Vedántaphilosophy of India. My reasons for preferring to regard it as a development of"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE338Neo-Platonism are: Firstly, the practical identity of the two systems, except, of course,where coloured by the prevailing positive religion; Secondly, the circumstancethat Súfiism as a system is first heard of in Syria, the country of Iamblichus, whereNeo-Platonist ideas were widely spread;...; Thirdly, the fact that the other side ofMuhammedan philosophy is beyond question derived from the Neo-Platonist expo-nents of Aristotle” (A History of Ottoman Poetry, vol. 1, p. 53, n.2). I mentioned above(Chapter 7, p. 244, n.58) that Nicholson explained this subject very well in his intro-duction to the DCwAn Shams al-RaqA”iq {i.e. Selected Poems from the DCvAni Shamsi TabrCz}.27‘Azcz b.

For this reason, man’s soul loves its body,because the human body is a manifestation of the attributes of the human soul: thesoul sees its own body and witnesses its own names and qualities. And for this reason,it is said: Know yourself, so that you may know God. Now you may understand thatthis is the light that knows itself and that is the soul of the world, and the individualthings of the world are all manifestations of this light} (cited from al-Nasafc’s Zubdatal-RaqA”iq as found in Ferid Bey’s work entitled Vahdet-i vücûd [ Istanbul, 1331/1913],pp. 80–1 {the Zubdat has been edited by A. E. Bertel’s in Piat” filosofskikh traktatovna temu “FfAq va anfus” (O sootnosheniiakh mezhdu chelovekom i vselennoi) ( Moscow, 1970),pp. 90–207, and by laqq-virdc Natirc (Tehran, 1405/1363/1985)}). Because of thesimplicity of the passage, I have simply cited the text {without translating it!}.28 I will touch here on the way in which the nefcs resolved the problem of creation,which is always the weakest aspect of any philosophical system. According to nefcs,the cause of creation and emanation is Love. The poet who said Kendi hüsnünhûblar Zeklinde peydâ eyledin / ÇeZm-i âZıktan dönüp sonra temâZâ eyledin {You revealed yourown beauty in the form of beautiful (beings) / Then contemplated it with the eyes oflovers} expressed this as a very succinct principle. Many nefcs, however, includingJamc, the author of SalamAn wa AbsAl, explained the important subject of creation interms of a more explicit Neoplatonism that corresponds almost perfectly to Plotinus’theory of emanation. From it arose the view of LaQarAt-i khams, i.e. BeZ “âlem {the fiveworlds}, which are not separate worlds in separate places, but constitute differentstages of the same existence as they recede in a balanced relationship from wujEd-iRaqCqC {true existence, i.e. God} and descend stage by stage. As summarized by ‘AbdAllah Bosnawc {d. 1054/1644, in his commentary on Ibn al-‘Arabc’s FuTET al-Rikam,i.e. TajalliyAt “arA”is al-nuTET (Belaq, 1252/1836–7); English trans. Bulent Rauf et al. asIsmail Hakki Bursevi’s Translation of, and Commentary on, Fusus al-hikam by Muhyiddin Ibn“Arabi (attributed to “Abd AllAh BosnawC) (Oxford, 1986)}: above and beyond the universeis the divine world that is the source of everything. It is not included in the other fiveRaQarAt. The first of the five RaQarAt is RaQrat-i ghaib-i muUlaq {the world of the absolutelyinvisible}, or RaQrat-i “amA {world of nebulosity}. This is the world of immutableentities (a“yAn-i thAbita, which is essentially the same as Plato’s ideas). The second RaQrais ghaib-i muQAf {world of the relatively invisible} and is the world of intellects {“uqEl}and souls {arwAR}. They call this the world of domination {“Alam-i jabarEt}. The thirdRaQra is “Alam-i mithAl {world of images} or the world of sovereignty {“Alam-i malakEt, seeChittick, The Self-Disclosure of God (Albany, NY, 1998), pp. 259 – 60}. They also call thisthe intermediate world {“Alam-i barzakh, between the spiritual and corporeal; see Chittick,The Sufi Path of Knowledge, pp. 14, 117–18}. The fourth RaQra is “Alam-i shahAda {visibleworld, see Chittick, ibid., p. 114} or “Alam-i mulk {corporeal world, see Chittick, ibid.,p. 282}. This is the world in which we act. The fifth RaQra is “Alam-i insAn {world ofmankind}, which sums up and comprises all the others, for mankind is the microcosm(“Alam-i TughrA) {on these worlds, cf. E. J. W. Gibb, A History of Ottoman Poetry, vol. 1,pp. 55 –6}. These worlds are sometimes classified as “Alam-i ghaib – “Alam-i barzakh –“Alam-i shuhEd, but usually “Alam-i ghaib – “Alam-i shuhEd. Thus the concept of the fiveworlds, which gradually become more complex as they precede from the Unified"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE340Essence {God} and fall from grace, is actually an application to Islam of the theory ofemanation (tajallC), which was peculiar to the school of Alexandria. Their meaningof “aql-i kull {universal intellect (God)} and “aql-i awwal {first intellect} for nash”at-i ElAwa thAniya {first and second existence} was also under the influence of Plotinus’ nous{“The original Being first of all throws out the nous, which is a perfect image of theOne and the archetype of all existing things. It is at once being and thought, idealworld and idea. As image, the nous corresponds perfectly to the One, but as derived itis entirely different. What Plotinus understands by the nous is the highest sphereaccessible to the human mind, and, along with that, pure thought itself,” EncyclopaediaBritannica (1955), s.v. “Neoplatonism” (Adolf van Harnack; John Malcolm Mitchell)}.As in Mawlana’s couplet {MathnawC, Book 2, line 978}{This world is one thought (emanating) from the Universal Intellect / The Intellect islike a king, and the ideas (are his) envoys; Nicholson trans.} these Neoplatonist beliefsare quite obvious in ‘fshıq Pasha’s didactic mathnawC, GharCbnAme. Let me brieflydescribe the concept of a“yAn-i thAbita {immutable entities; see Chittick, The Sufi Path ofKnowledge, pp. 83–6} in order to finish this account of the RaQarAt. A“yAn-i thAbita “arethe possibile realities that exist in God’s knowledge and do not smell the fragrance ofexistence.” Because existence is more inclusive than immutability, not every immut-able thing requires the quality of existence. Thus, they are also immutable with respectto non-existence and are not qualified by existence. There are two aspects to a“yAn-ithAbita. On the one hand, they are divine realities, based on the consideration thatnames and attributes are formal {i.e. take the visible form}. On the other hand, theyare possible realities and supports {mustanad, phenomena of this world as “supported”by names; see Chittick, ibid., p. 37}. According to the first hypothesis, immutableentities are the equivalent of bodies for souls and according to the second hypothesisare the equivalent of souls for bodies. The immutability in God’s knowledge ofa“yAn-i thAbita results from “the most sacred spiritual effusion {faiQ-i aqdas},” while theexternal appearance of the form-taking possibilities of the entities {a“yAn} results from“the sacred spiritual effusion {faiQ-i muqaddas}.” Because a“yAn-i thAbita do not existexternally, they are not qualified by creation {ja“l}. Those things that exist are formsof the a“yAn that appear because of sacred spiritual effusion in mirrors of the a“yAn. Allthe forms of existing things and manifestations of the contingent world are the formsof the a“yAn-i thAbita or the divine names and attributes (FuTET sharRC, p. 15). {See EI2,s.v. “‘flam” (Tj. de Boer and L. Gardet)}.29 While describing al-Ghazalc’s ideas about Possible Existence in his note on Jalal{divine majesty}, Gelenbevî ysmâ‘îl Efendi provides important information on waRdatal-wujEd. I consider it useful to cite it briefly in order to summarize clearly the subjectof the self-disclosure of God {tajallC}: “What exists in reality is ascribed in the mind tosomething that exists thanks to existence itself. The nefcs considered it self-evidentthat there is no true existence apart from God. The ascription of existence to possibilities{of realities} is based on the connection of manifestation, for there are not variousnumerous existences of which some subsist with the Necessarily Existent {God} andothers with the possibilities. There is only one existence and that is God. To saythat possibilities exist is not to say that existence subsists with them but to say thatpossibilities have a certain relationship to the Necessarily Existent that exists by itselfand subsists by its own essence. This attachment occurs at the moment of the self-disclosure of God in the immutable entities. And the immutable entities are the divinesapiential forms that are the opposite of the capacity {for subsistence in God} asrequired by the mutually divine names like qAbiQ {Contractor}, bAsiU {Expander},"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE341raRCm {Merciful}, and qAhir {Compellor}. No one except God knows how this self-disclosure occurs. The immutable entities, which are in mutual opposition with regardto the need and capacity for the Necessarily Existent {dhAt-i wAjib}, are the manifesta-tions of the divine self-disclosures. The essence and attributes of God appear in themby means of that capacity for manifestation and appear in the form of mutuallyopposed existence because of the difference in capacity. Now multiplicity comes intoexistence from capacity. For example, there are many mirrors but the image of oneman is reflected in them. According to the capacity of the mirrors, that man appearsdifferently in each one but none of these {different} accidental qualities and attributesexists in him. There is one true existence, but with its appearance during the self-disclosure of God, it expands over the existing possibilities. However, it does not mixwith possibilities and is not incarnated in them. While this attachement remains, thepossibilities are figuratively called existing by virtue of the attainment of manifesta-tion. When attachment is stopped, there can be no attribution of existing either inreality or figuratively. Thus, the existing possibilities consist of immutable entities oncondition of attainment of the self-disclosure of God. This means that nothing existssubsisting in itself. Therefore, existing cannot in fact be attributed to them. They arenon-existent in past and future eternity. Therefore, it is said that immutable entitiesdo not smell the fragrance of existence” (cited from Ferid Bey’s treatise Vahdet-i vücûd,pp. 101– 6). Certain aspects of this are explained in greater detail below.30 According to nefc beliefs, the universe culminates in man, who is the central point.The things that exist in the universe can only reflect one or another of the divineattributes. Man, however, is the place of manifestation of all of them, for he is themanifestation of the greatest name {ism-i a“Vam}. As ‘Abd Allah Bosnawc, the com-mentator on the FuTET states, “The universe is the aggregate of the individual objectsthrough which are manifested the Divine Names; but as it was incapable of receivingthe form of the Divine Totality, and as the manifesting of the manifestation of univer-sality was not obtainable therethrough, God created Man, who is its soul, after theDivine image; so Man is the theatre of the Divine Names and the meeting-point ofthe Divine Attributes” {we have used Gibb’s translation, A History of Ottoman Poetry,vol. 1, p. 62}. Because of this, man has collected in himself the personal reflectionsof the divine attributes that are scattered throughout the universe. He is thus also theperfect mirror of the image of God. Because man is the sum and epitome of themacrocosm outside himself, and its miniature, he is called the microcosm. A numberof nefcs go beyond this, however, regarding man as the macrocosm and the universeas the microcosm. This lofty status of man is due to the heart, for the divine attributesare reflected there. Thus, in order to know God, one must first know oneself. The nefcprinciple {Who knows himself knows his Lord} is derivedfrom this {Köprülü again follows Gibb here, vol. 1, pp. 62–3}. Many examples of thiscan be found in the Persian and Turkish poets, in Jalal al-Dcn Remc, Faiq-i Hindi,then Yenus Emre, Ghaibc, Nescmc, Olanlar Shaikhc Ibrahcm Efendi, etc.31 This ecstasy or rapture, which our nefcs call RAl {the mystical state}, has a veryimportant place in Neoplatonism. Plotinus accepts the givens of the senses, but heplaces reason above them and above reason places ecstasy. Only this discloses AbsoluteUnity {God}, which the laws of reason do not have the ability to discover. Ecstasy isunification. In other words, it is the disappearance or the withdrawal of plurality,consciousness, and personality. It is the momentary absorption of the individual andthe variable in absolute existence. In this state, the spirit, which is united with God, isno longer in the body. Indeed, in any ecstatic state, one is also separated from thesoul, which drives and illuminates the body. The human body is then like an emptypalace that is subject to the laws of organic nature. Therefore, ecstasy is a death inadvance {of dying}, or, more correctly according to Plato’s mystical principle of “to"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE342die is to live,” it is a life in advance {of living}. The problem now remains to discoverits generative causes. Is it brought about through intellectual effort, or will, or love?The answer is quite simple. Love, which receives the help of intellectual effort andwill, is the generative cause of ecstasy. Intellectual effort, by scattering some of theclouds that hide our spirituality, brings us face to face with unity. Will tries hard toescape from plurality and tear down the final cover that conceals absolute existence.And Love, which finally discovers the sole thing that will nourish it, leaps out like aflame and thus unification occurs. It is virtue and prayer that allow us to reach thisultimate happiness. Prayer, according to Plotinus, is the directing of an energetic andabsolute love toward its object. In later Neoplatonism, as inspiration weakened, prayerand then mystical rites gradually took the place of Love. The lofty theories of Plotinusdegenerated into superstition at the hands of Iamblichus (Franck (ed.), Dictionnaire dessciences philosophiques, s.v. “Plotin” { Jules Simon}, p. 1347). Saint-Hilaire also criticallyanalyzes the characteristics of this system (De l’école d’Alexandrie, p. xxxv). It appearsfrom this entire account that the Neoplatonists’ views of ecstasy are virtually identicalwith our nefcs’ views of RAl.In al-Qushairc’s al-RisAla, there is a noteworthy description of our nefcs’ views ofRAl {cf. Michael Sells (trans. and ed.), Early Islamic Mysticism, (New York, 1996), p. 103;Rabia Harris (trans.), pp. 74 –5}. According to the nefcs, RAl means “a feeling of joyand sorrow, contraction and expansion, ardor and awe, that reaches the heart as a giftbestowed by God.” In this, human attainment and effort have no part. The stages{s. maqAm, level of enlightenment}, however, are acquired by intellectual effort andascetic exercises. The second distinguishing characteristic of RAl is transformation{tarawwul} and variegation {talawwun}, i.e. instability. “Stages,” on the other hand,are stable. So it is clear that the unstable and rarely appearing ecstasy that Plotinuspresented as the product of love in particular is basically the same as the mystical“state” {RAl} of our nefcs. Our nefcs only expand on what Plotinus hinted at. Theyreject – in accord with Plotinus’ idea of soul – the influence of intellectual effort andascetic discipline {in attaining ecstasy} and designate not one ecstatic state but differ-ent degrees of RAl. Some of them, however, do teach the permanence and persistanceof RAl, and consider those who dabbled in mystical experience as “not having attainedthe points of departure of the mystical states.” According to most nefcs, however, RAlhas no permanence other than the existence of time. In the opinion of the religiousscholars, it is analogous to something accidental {“araQ}. Ibn al-‘Arabc explains thisin Chapter 192 of his FutERAt. As expounded by the majority of the nefcs, this view iscompletely in accord with that of Plotinus, for he taught that ecstasy is momentaryand fleeting. Thus, the mystical state that al-Junaid describes in the couplet{Sudden gleams of light / when they appear, apparitions, / Revealing a secret,/telling of union (Sells, trans. in Early Islamic Mysticism, p. 105)} is no different than theecstasy of Plotinus (al-Qushairc, al-RisAla, {Turkish} trans., pp. 14 –18).32 The careful study of both of their dCwAns clearly shows this. For example, there is agreat similarity between Yenus Emre’s ghazalBir sâkîden içtik Zarâb “arZtan yüce meyhânesiOl sâkînin mestleriyüz cânlar anın peymânesi{I drank wine at the hands of a cupbearer whose tavern is higher than theheavenly throne.We are drunkards of that Cupbearer, our souls are His wine cup,}"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE343and Mawlana’s ghazal that begins with the verse{Before vineyard and grape were yet in the world,Our souls were drunk with the wine of everlastingness.}In like manner, Yenus Emre’s hymn beginning with the verse Bî-mekânem bu cihândamenzilim duraXım anda / Bunda seyreyleyu geldim bâXçe ve bâXım anda {cf. Gölpınarlı, YunusEmre: Risâlat al-nushiyya ve Dîvân, p. 123; I have no place in this world: my abode isthere / I have come here to sojourn: my garden is there} and Mawlana’s famousghazal{O heart, why art thou a captive in the earth that is passing away? / Fly forth fromthis enclosure, since thou art a bird of the spiritual world; Nicholson (trans.), SelectedPoems from the DCvAni Shamsi TabrCz, p. 175,} have almost the same meaning. MoreoverYenus Emre’s hymn Ey âZıkân ey âZıkân aZk mezhebi dîndir bana / Gördü gözüm dost yüzünüyas kamu düXündür bana {cf. Gölpınarlı, ibid., p. 41; O lovers, O lovers; the creed ofLove is my religion / My eyes have seen the loved one’s face: for me funerals areweddings} has the same meaning as Mawlana’s poem {O lovers,O lovers; Nicholson (trans.), Selected Poems, p. 141}. On this subject, for which manyother examples could be given, one should bear in mind that this influence originatesfrom Mawlana’s general personality and outlook, not from this or that poem.33 I stated above that those obsessed by divine love were not responsible for the deedsand words that issued from them. Aq Shams al-Dcn {d. 863/1459, see H. J. Kissling,“Aq ‡ems ed-Dcn: Ein türkischer Heiliger aus der Endzeit von Byzanz,” ByzantinischeZeitschrift, 44 (1951), 322–33, and EI2, s.v. “As Shams al-Dcn” (H. J. Kissling)} dis-cusses this subject in a treatise and says that for the nefcs it is not permitted to revealthe {spiritual} truths to the people. He excludes those obsessed by divine love fromthis and says, “If obsession (jadhba) is overpowering then it is manifest involuntarily.Such majdhEbs (those obsessed by divine love) are those in whom God is acting freely.They witness the pole of the world. The pole of the world commands them. Whateverin the world is or will be, they are first to go about that task,” (RisAla-i Aq Shams al-DCn,from the MS in the Hâlis Efendi Library {in the Süleymaniye Library in Istanbul}).There is also a useful and succinct discussion of majdhEbs in the ThamarAt al-fu”Ad{Istanbul, 1288/1871} of Sarı ‘Abd Allah Efendi {d. c.1071/1661, see EI2, vol. 3,p. 711, and s.v. “narı ‘Abd Allah Efendc (Cl. Huart [Kathleen Burrill])}. In much ofthe poetry of Yenus Emre, the notion that {spiritual} truths cannot be revealed to thecommon people is repeated, but it is curious that he could not refrain from doing so.34 This view is consistently found in all the nefcs from Abe Sa‘cd Ibn Abc ‘l-Khair, whosaid in a quatrain{With you my figurative speech becomes prayer / Apart from you my prayer becomesa mere figure. Murammad b. Munawwar, The Secrets of God’s Mystical Oneness, trans.John O’Kane, p. 514}, to Mawlana. The following passage from Mawlana expressesthe same meaning as the aforesaid quatrain of Abe Sa‘cd:"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE344{If the face of my heart is not directed toward youI do not consider this prayer to be prayer.I direct my face toward the qibla out of love for your face;Otherwise, I have nothing to do with prayers and qiblas.}We also constantly find passages with this meaning in Yenus Emre. It appears that insuch great nefcs as these, as in Plotinus, love {“ishq, ecstatic love of God} comes beforeeverything and is the true goal of everything. Such passages as these express thisnotion; they do not mean that prayer and the other religious duties are unnecessary.Because nefcs subsequently gave more importance to asceticism and religious exercises,the importance of love has declined somewhat – as was the case in the last periods ofdecline of the Neoplatonists.35 {Cf. Gölpınarlı, Yunus Emre: Risâlat al-nushiyya ve Dîvân, p. 203.}36 There is much in the poetry of Yenus Emre on love and the difficulties of love, as in,for example, the hymns beginning ÂZık-û mest-ü harâb etti bizi cânânemiz / Âlem içinde bugün hoZ söylenür efsânemiz {Our Beloved made us lovers and drunkards, and ruined us /Today in the world our story is nicely told}; or Gerçek âZık olanların iZi âh ile zâr olur/ Hasretinden ol dilberin gözü yaZı pınar olur {The task of true lovers is to sigh and moan/ Their tears flow like springs out of longing for the Beloved}; or Dürlü dürlü cefânınadını aZk komuZlar / Bu cefâya katlanan dosta halvet irmiZler {“Love” is the name given to allsorts of cruelty / Those who bear this cruelty attain privacy with the Beloved}.Mawlana, who says{Do not count a life as anything that has gone without Love / Love is the water oflife: accept it into your heart and soul}, also reveals the difficulties of love in thefollowing strophe:{Oh you who conjure love in every assembly,And on whose path our blood drips to mark the road for travelers:A hundred thousand wounds are in our breast, not wounds of Love’s arrow;A hundred fall prey, while there is no arrow visible and no bow.}Because men who enter the field of love consider their own physical existence to benothing and sometimes even give up their lives on that field, the nefcs frequently usethe comparison of “ball and stick” {i.e. being knocked about like a ball} in regard tothis subject. In a beautiful poem Mawlana describes quite eloquently the ecstasy ofthose who drink the wine of {spiritual} love from the cup bearer of eternity. Otherversions of this concept are frequently found in Yenus Emre."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE345{What is to be done, O Moslems? for I do not recognize myself.I am neither Christian, nor Jew, nor Gabr, nor Moslem.I am not of the East, nor of the West, nor of the land, nor of the sea;I am not of Nature’s mint, nor of the circling heavens.I am not of earth, nor of water, nor of air, nor of fire;I am not of the empyrean, nor of the dust, nor of existence, nor of entity.I am not of India, nor of China, nor of Bulgaria, nor of Saqscn;I am not of the kingdom of ‘Iraqain, nor of the country of Khorasan.I am not of this world, nor of the next, nor of Paradise, nor of Hell;I am not of Adam, nor of Eve, nor of Eden and Rivwan.My place is the Placeless, my trace is the Traceless;’Tis neither body nor soul, for I belong to the soul of the Beloved.I have put duality away, I have seen that the two worlds are one;One I seek, One I know, One I see, One I call.He is the first, He is the last, He is the outward, He is the inward;I know none other except ‘YA HE’ and ‘YA man HE.’I am intoxicated with Love’s cup, the two worlds have passed out of my ken;I have no business save carouse and revelry.If once in my life I spent a moment without thee,From that time and from that hour I repent of my life.If once in this world I win a moment with thee,I will trample on both worlds, I will dance in triumph for ever.O Shamsc Tabrcz, I am so drunken in this world,That except of drunkenness and revelry I have no tale to tell.Nicholson (trans.), Selected Poems from the DCvAni Shamsi TabrCz, pp. 125, 127 (Köprülüomitted the fifth and seventh verses).} Yenus Emre’s famous poem that includes the"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE346couplet Zâhir suya girmedin el ayak depretmedin / BaZ secdeye varmadın kılınur tâ“atimiz {Ourworship takes place without ablutions, without bodily movements, without bowing thehead [Gölpınarlı, Yunus Emre: Risâlat al-nushiyya ve Dîvân, p. 169]} is basically identicalwith this.The following rubA“C is very important for showing the nature of spiritual love innefcsm and is very beautiful:{From the dew of Love, Adam’s clay turned to mud;A tumult arose, a commotion broke out.The blade of the lancet touched the vein of the spirit,One drop fell from it: it was named “heart.”}According to Yenus Emre, in order “to go beyond duality and to distinguish qAl{book-learning} from RAl {mystical ecstasy},” the only way is love.

For union and incarnation result from those whoexist, and incarnation is also like this; because there is no existence other than theexistence of the One; because things exist by virtue of the existence of God and inthemselves are non-existent. How could something be united with God which existsonly by virtue of His existence and which by itself is non-existent?} (‘Abd AllahBosnawc, commentary on the FuTET, p. 16). Some conventional religious scholars{“ulamA”} have accused Ibn al-‘Arabc, and many of the great nefcs who accepted hisideas, of RulEl {incarnation, indwelling}, but this allegation is completely false. LulElis sometimes understood as resulting naturally and sometimes as subsisting with athing itself; whereas God, being pure existence, cannot subsist through another. Ibnal-‘Arabc fully explains this point and then says, Nûr-i Zems, bedr”de tecellî ettiXinde sâirgecelerdekinden baZka olduXu gibi, iktidâr-i ilâhîde “abdde tecellî etti?i vakıtta halktan birtakım ef“âlzuhûr eder.

Zuhûr, hulûl deXildir{ Just as the light of the sun is different each night when it is manifest on the moon, sowhen divine power is manifest in man numerous actions appear from mankind. Whileall manifest divine power, the effect is different, for this divine manifestation occurs bymeans of reflection like a mirror. As is known by reason, the moon is visible onlybecause the light of the sun is on it. The sun does not transfer anything of itself to it;the moon is only a mirror of it. Man is just like this. Not only is there nothing ofthe Creator in him, so there is no divine indwelling in him. Only he is especially thereflection and manifestation of God. Furthermore, the fact that something can bereflected in something else does not mean that it takes its place, because that whichappears in the mirror is not in itself of the mirror, which is not the case with respectto place. To be manifest is not to be indwelling (cf. Chittick, The Self-disclosure ofGod, pp. 84–5)}. This is why Ibn al-‘Arabc says {God is a cre-ation but the creation is not a god} in Chapter 148 of his FutERAt. And {He istheir essence} in the expression {Praise be to Him whoreveals things, He being their essence} is a true affirmation of this, for this means thatGod is the “ayn-i ashyA” {essence of things}. What is meant by things is existing forms{Tuwar-i mawjEda}. And this is absolute existence, in relation to one of the specialfeatures {khuTETiyya} that are necessary for the immutable entities.

How is it possible that Ibn al-‘Arabc would assert that the thing he said was“other” was the “same”? ‘Ala’ al-Dawla Simnanc’s many objections to this chapterdisappear in light of this elucidation. In another work, Ibn al-‘Arabc also rejects union{ittRAd}. He says that union is absurd, because the one next to you, with whom youwant union, still says “I,” and that is not union. Rather, it is not you who speaks, butHe through you. Also, when you say {I thus you} you have really said {I by virtue of my intending to be you} or {by virtue of intend-ing to be you}. If you have said {by virtue of intending to be you}, there isno union with respect to either meaning or forms. Because this is the way thatmost conventional religious scholars have understood this, they have attacked nefcsm.Abe Sa‘cd Ibn Abc ’l-Khair, the author {not further identified} of BustAn al-“ArifCn,and Imam al-Suyeuc both defended Ibn al-‘Arabc against the conventional religiousscholars on this point. In addition, Imam al-Ghazalc says in his Munqidh that thefollowers of the nefc path have progressed to the point that their words could beattributed to indwelling and union, but to accuse them of this would be a mistake.Qaqc Mu‘cn al-Dcn lusain Yazdc {i.e. Murammad Yazdc, d. 789/1387, see EI2, s.v.“Mu‘cn al-Dcn . . .

Yenus Emre’s hymn Sen”inle dirliXim Sen”den ayrılmaz / Hayât Sen”inledir Sen”sizdirilmez {I live through you, not separate from you / Life is through you: without youthere is no life} reveals complete conformity with Ibn al-‘Arabc’s view.39 {Cf.

It was created without man, like thecorporeal form. In its manifestations is found the perception of the divine names,whereas, in the manifestation of the all-comprehensive thing are found the essences ofthe beautiful names of God. Before any connection with the desire to perceive it,God created the cosmos like an undifferentiated body, without a soul. Thus, the worldwas like an unpolished mirror; for the cosmos, which was created before the creationof the all-comprehensive thing, is the manifestation of the divine names – includinghighest and lowest, dark and light, the world of command and the world of creation(see Chittick, ibid., pp. 250ff.). . . The world without man has no capacity for perfectappearance because it is incapable of the perfect manifestation of God, whether inessence or in form, whether in whole or in part, whether outwardly or inwardly.Thus, before man, the cosmos was like a body prepared for the human soul. It waslike an unpolished mirror capable of being polished with the polish of the existence of"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE350man . . . Then the divine command and divine judgment necessitated the polishing ofthe mirror of the world. Adam is identical to the polishing of that mirror and is thesoul of that undifferentiated body. Adam is the manifestation of the divine presencethat comprehends all of the divine names. Just as the divine presence comprehendsthe divine names and there is no intermediary between it and the essence (of God), sothe human presence also includes the divine names and there is no intermediarybetween it and the dhAt-i aRadiyyat (essence of unity). All of the names that are in thedivine presence are manifest in man. Thus Adam became the totality of the propertiesof necessity. Existence first descended from the collective presence (of bringingtogether; cf. Chittick, ibid., p. 179) to the divine presence and then became abundantaccording to the possible specific attributes in the stages of possible things. Existencewas tinged with (has the appearance of ) all the stages, but culminated in man. Thus,the perfect man included the quintessence of all the possible stages and also thepossible properties. Thus he found perfection with the world and God appeared uponthe world in the most perfect form, because the world (macrocosm) is in the form ofman (microcosm) who is the image of God. Thus the end result and product of theworld is man, from the point of view of appearance...} After this Ibn al-‘Arabcspeaks at length about man being God’s vicegerent and says that, if the perfect manwere detached from the treasurehouse of the world, nothing would be left in the worldthat God would treasure with Himself. The reason that the all-encompassing thing iscalled man is due to the generality of his creation and the fact that he comprises thetotality of the truths. The collective creation of the cosmos is summed up in man’screation, and man’s creation is differentiated in the collective creation. The greatestbarzakhiyya {intermediary realm} comprises all divine, created, and intermediary{barzakhC} truths with the truth of the unity of the cosmos.43 {Cf. Gölpınarlı, Yunus Emre: Risâlat al-nushiyya ve Dîvân, pp. 107– 8.}44 It is clear that Yenus Emre considered esoteric knowledge and not exoteric know-ledge to be important. The reason for this dichotomy in knowledge is that God is bothapparent and hidden. The dichotomy is necessary according to the nefcs because theapparent can only be known by the apparent and the hidden by the hidden. Thosewho regard only exoteric knowledge to be important cannot see God “with essentialperception in rational degrees {madArik} and essential stages”; and those who regardonly esoteric knowledge as important cannot see God “who is apparent in cosmicphenomena and sensory manifestations.” Because the perfection of Murammad is inthe joining of the apparent and hidden, and this is possible in the stage of qAb-i qawsain{being very close; see Chittick, The Self-disclosure of God, pp. 233 – 6}, which is the stageof the vicegerency {see Chittick; The Sufi Path of Knowledge, p. 286} and the perfectman, naturally it is not vouchsafed to everyone. Nevertheless, the nefc poets actedcoldly and contemptuously not only toward the conventional religious scholars butalso toward exoteric knowledge. Mawlana’s statement {theman of God is not learned from books; Nicholson (trans.), Selected Poems from the DCvAniShamsi TabrCz, p. 29} expresses this precisely.45 The subject of dawr is explained briefly and quite well in the introduction of ybrâhîmHakkı’s Ma“rifatnâme {Istanbul, 1294/1877}, pp. 27–9. For greater detail, see {‘AbdAllah Bosnawc’s} commentary on the FuTET, especially the first faTT {segment}. Thissubject is also briefly discussed in Sarı ‘Abd Allah Efendi’s ThamarAt al-fu”Ad (p. 10).Creation poems {dawriyyas} dealing with the arc of descent {transformation of thedivine light into the four elements} are termed “of the carpet” {farshiyya, i.e. earthly}and the others “of the throne” {“arshiyya, i.e. heavenly}. Niyazc Mitrc’s Dawriyya-i“arshiyya and Üsküdarlı Hâshim Baba’s Dawriyya-i farshiyya are very famous in ourliterature. In addition, there are many dawriyyas by the tekke poets beginning with Nescmcand including those such as Ibrahcm Efendi {i.e. Olanlar Shaikhi} and Qayghusuz,"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE351and also in Bektashc poetry. There is a simple commentary on this theory inQayghusuz’s “AbdAlnAme {MS in Köprülü’s private library}, p. 16.46{I turned a little in every sphere with the Nine Fathers(F. Steingass, Persian–English Dictionary [1892; reprinted Beirut, 1975], p. 1437:the seven planets with the dragon’s head and tail)I turned for years in the constellations with the stars.For a while I disappeared. I was at one place together with him.I was the lowliest in His kingdom. I saw whatever I saw.I get nourishment from divine Truth (God) like an embryo in the womb.A man is born once: I have been born many times.In the torn cloak of the body I was involved in many deeds,And with my own hand I often tore this cloak apart.I spent nights with monks in their cell.I slept with infidels in their idol temple, next to the idols.I am a thief of the rogues. I am the suffering of the sick.I am both cloud and rain: I have rained into the gardens.The dust of annihilation never settled on my shirt, O beggar!I have picked roses in abundance in the garden of eternity.}47 In Mawlana’s DCwAn, there is a ghazal beginning{Every design that you see has its type in the One Without Place (God). / No matterif the design disappears: its original is eternal.} Here Mawlana tries to explain thedawr theory in the following verses:"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE352{First you were mineral, then vegetable.You then became animal. How is this hidden from you?Then you became human, with knowledge, reason, and faith.See how that body, which is a part of the earth, turned into a rose.}In his MathnawC, Mawlana presents this clearly as well {Book 4, lines 3637–9, andBook 3, lines 3901– 6}:{He came first to the mineral realm.From a mineral he turned into a vegetable.He lived in the vegetable state for years,And because of the opposition (between them) remembered nothing of themineral state.Then from a vegetable he turned into an animal,And remembered nothing of the vegetable state....I died as a mineral and became a plant.I died as a plant and appeared as an animal.I died as an animal and became a man.So why should I fear that from dying I will be diminished?Let me die completely as a man,So that I may put forth angel’s wings.From the angels I must leap out of the air:“Everything passes away exept His face” (Koran, 55:22).Once again, as an angel, I will be sacrificed,So that I may become what has never been imagined.Then I will become non-being. Non-being says loud as an organ:“To Him we shall return” (Koran, 2:156).}"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE35348 In Natir-i Khusraw’s poem that begins{Three hundred ninety-four years had passed since the Hijra, / When my motherplaced me in the center of the earth} this belief in dawr is quite obvious.49 The famous strophe of Ibn Yamcn, the author of MuqaUUa“At {Calcutta, 1865}, whichbegins{From the concealment of non-being, I pitched a tent in the plain of being. / Ijourneyed from being mineral to being vegetable,} fully describes this theory.50 Faiq-i Hindc’s Markaz al-adwAr is a good example of a dawriyya.51 In the Gulshan-i rAz, the subjects of this dawr and the perfect man, and then that of theemanation and the self-disclosure of God, are clearly presented in a manner suitableto a didactic work. In order not to go beyond our subject, I will not cite it here.52 I believe that the descriptions that I have given above of the views of the Muslimmystics on the subject of creation have shown that they could not include a belief inmetempsychosis {tanAsukh} – just as they could not include a belief in indwelling{RulEl} or union {ittiRAd}. The author of Gulshan-i rAz thus rejects any possible imputa-tion {of this} by saying{These circuits are not transmigrations of souls, for verily / They are manifested inthe visions of Epiphanies; Whinfield (trans.), line 367, and in a footnote he explains“In metempsychosis one body perishes and another succeeds it as a receptacle ofthe soul, but in these circuits the truth may be manifested in teacher and discipleat once.”}. We also find the belief in metempsychosis, which we first encounter as aphilosophical view in Pythagorus and Plato, in the Neoplatonists. Their theory ofemanation and self-disclosure of God did not lend itself to the belief in metempsychosis,because, in their opinion, the soul is an idea and matter is a negation. Consequently,the notion of metempsychosis entered Neoplatonism not as a corollary of their system,but as a remnant of the Pythagorean theories.The first to try to reconcile this with the Neoplatonist system was the SyrianPorphyry {233–c.304}. According to him, the reason why our souls wear the garmentof the physical body is punishment for sins that we committed in a previous life. Theenvelope that covers our soul is proportionally thick or thin according to our offenseand punishment. Thus, some souls have been placed in an aerial body and some inthe human body. They fulfill their duties with resignation and thus slowly approachGod. This view is clearly nothing more than the extension of Plato’s spiritualismindiscriminately to all mankind. Porphyry believed that animals possessed a soul,perception, and reason, but he did not include them in this system. Furthermore, incontrast to this ascending ladder that goes from man to God, he also accepts adescending ladder that goes from man to hell.Among the cabalists, we find this theory assuming more of an ethical and spiritualquality. According to them, it is predestined for souls, like all existing things on theface of the earth, to return to the divine substance. In order to do this, it is necessaryfor the indestructible germ of perfection within the souls to acquire all the perfect"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE354qualities. If the soul cannot acquire them in the first life, then it begins, in turn, thesecond and third and finds in each the means of reaching perfection that it was notable to find in the previous one. Finally, when our soul reaches such perfection that itperceives the bliss of divine unity, this cycle ends. Moreover, if we persist in notturning away from our sins, this cycle will continue until the day of resurrection{Köprülü’s description of metempsychosis here is essentially a summary of an extractfrom Franck (ed.), Dictionnaire des sciences philosophiques, s.v. “Métempsychose” (AdolpheFranck), pp. 1096 –7}. It is clear that among the cabalists the cycle is restrictedto humans.In light of this entire account, the nature of the differences between our nefcs andthe Neoplatonists and the cabalists on the subject of the cycle is easily understood.Our nefcs included in the cycle not only mankind but also inanimate objects, plants,and animals. The view of some nefcs that the “soul is brought down to the corporealworld in order to find perfection through life experience” is somewhat compatiblewith the ideas of Porphyry and the cabalists, but differs from them with respect to thesystem. The great nefcs basically explain the descent of the soul not in this mannerbut as “the divine will’s desire to manifest its essence.” All the nefc poets acceptedthis. ybrâhîm Hakkı’s explanation of this in his Ma“rifatnâme is somewhat reminiscentof Porphyry and the cabalists, but when the nefc system of Ibn al-‘Arabc and Jalalal-Dcn Remc – and that of ybrâhîm Hakkı who follows them – is carefully examined,it becomes quite obvious that there is absolutely no inclination toward acceptingthe theory of metempsychosis. With respect to the origin of the belief in dawr, it didpass from the Neoplatonists and cabalists to our nefcs, but they changed its nature –broadening and refining it – and escaped from metempsychosis, which was not verycompatible with their views. The manifestations of the beliefs in indwelling and unionand metempsychosis in Islam constitute a separate subject that is of great importance.53 {Cf. Gölpınarlı, Yunus Emre: Risâlat al-nushiyya ve Dîvân, p. 179; Mustafa Tatçı, YunusEmre Divânı (Ankara, 1990) p. 161.}54 There is this difference, namely that Armad Yasawc was much more of an upholderof the religious law and a moralist, and had the spiritual influence of the founder of aUarCqa, while Yenus Emre was only a mystic, a simple dervish who was influential forcenturies as a passionate poet. Indeed, Yenus Emre was superior to Armad Yasawcnot only as an artist but also as a nefc.55 In his commentary {on Ibn al-‘Arabc’s FuTET}, ‘Abd Allah Bosnawc provides a briefbut fairly detailed description of how the nefcs perceive God (p. 11). If we compare itwith Plotinus’ theory of the three hypostases (i.e. unity, intelligence, and power) andhis ideas about the essence of God and the creation of the universe, it becomes clearnot only that our nefcs have essentially accepted the theory of Neoplatonism, butalso how they have modified and deepened it within the framework of Islam. YenusEmre, who lamented Ben bir kitâb okudum kalem onu yazmadı / Mürekkep eylerisem yetmeyeyedi deniz {I read a book not written with a pen. Seven seas of ink would not sufficefor it}, maintained a view that was no different from that of Mawlana, who cried out {Beware! If you see me, tell no one. I have seen(Him)}, and Ibn al-‘Arabc. And he wrote orations that could be easily reconciledwith SharC“a principles. Only by ignoring the rather subtle interpretations of Islamicmysticism and many of its other features can one consider Yenus’s beliefs contrary tothose of the Sunncs.56 Rızâ Tevfîk says in an article, “Yenus Emre was similar to other bAUinCs. I considerthem all to be proponents of religious doctrines that do not conform to conventionalbeliefs. His verse Hakîkatin kâfiri Zer“in evliyâsıdır {The infidel of divine Truth is the saintof the SharC“a} justifies including this beloved Turkish poet among this group, based onhis own admission. His beliefs were no different from those of the nefcs of Iran and"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE355India” (“Yûnus Emre hakkında biraz daha tafsilât,” p. 183). As I have explainedabove, it would be completely mistaken to consider Yenus Emre a bAUinC, because henever went beyond a clear limit that, by means of interpretation, could be reconciled{with orthodoxy}. As for the above verse, it must be interpreted in a completelydifferent sense. Otherwise, we must also not consider Mawlana, if we take his wordsliterally, to be a Muslim. The absurdity of this is obvious. If we do not carefully studythe special features of Islamic mysticism and simply accept it as an imitation ofNeoplatonism, we cannot escape such errors. A lengthy discussion here of theseimportant nefc issues is beyond my expertise.57 See the lurefc texts published by Huart, {Textes persans relatifs à la secte des houroufis(Leiden, 1909)}. There is a fairly detailed account of this in Khwaja yshak Efendi’sKâZifü”l-esrâr ve dâfi“ü”l-eZrâr {Istanbul, 1290/1873 – 4}. There is also some informationin {Karakazzâde Ömer Efendi’s} Nûrü”l-hüdâ li-men ihtadâ {Istanbul, 1286/1869 –70}and Rifat Ahmed Efendi’s Mir”âtü”l-makâsid {Istanbul, 1293/1876}. Rızâ Tevfik’s studyis disorganized and full of historical gaps and errors, but it is still useful. The lurefcs,who accept epiphany, i.e. the appearance of God in the form of the sect’s founderFaql Allah, are one of many similar bAUinC sects that arose from the bosom of Islam. Inits origins, it is a curious and rudimentary mixture of Jewish cabala and Neoplatonistbeliefs, plus a few religio-mystical traditions. Simply comparing it to other bAUinC sectsdoes not suffice to properly understand it. In addition, one should fully comprehendthe milieu in which it developed, the places to which it spread, and its connection andrelationship with other similar sects. Then a full explanation of it would be possibleand its historical development would be discernable. I am preparing a study that willinclude some important notes, especially from the historical point of view, on thelurefcs among various other unorthodox UarCqas and groups that were spread amongthe Anatolian Turks for centuries. {This was never published. Köprülü was supposedto prepare something on this subject for the supplement to the YA, see bibliograpy, s.v.“Hurûfîlik” (ed.). Now see EI2, s.v. “lurefiyya” (A. Bausani), and especially the worksof Gölpınarlı listed in the bibliography of his Hurûfîlik metinleri kataloXu, and Bashir’s“Enshrining Divinity.”}58 There are a fair number of lurefc poets in our literature. The aforementioned studywill also include details on them. It would be a mistake, however, to consider everypoet whose work included allusions to asrAr-i RurEf {the secrets of the letters} to be alurefc.59 In the DCwAn of Yenus Emre, who said, Ne elif okudum ne cîm ne varlıktandır kelecim /Okumaz yüzbin müneccim tâli“im yılduzdan gelür {I have read neither alif nor jCm, nor do mywords concern the world / A myriad astrologers cannot read it: my horoscope comesfrom the stars (cf. Gölpınarlı, Yunus Emre: Risâlat al-nushiyya ve Dîvân, p. 51),} there aresome important references to this issue of the letters. The following passages areexamples of such references:Yigirmisekiz hece okursun ucdan ucaSen elif dersin hoca ma“nâsı ne demektir{You read the twenty-eight letters from end to endYou say alif, teacher; but what does it mean?}...Dört Kitâb”ın ma“nâsı tamâmdır bir elifteBâ dedirmeniz bana ben bu yoldan azarımYedi Mushaf ma“nâsın okudum tamâm kıldımYa ne için karayı ak üstünde yazarım"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE356{The entire meaning of the Four Books is in a single alif.When you make me say bA”, I go astray.I have read completely the meaning of the seven variant readings(of the Koran).So why do I write black on white?}Rızâ Tevfik says, “According to authorities, there are clear references to the fact thatYenus Emre was a lurefc.” He uses two of these couplets as evidence of this andexplains them as follows: “In these expressions, {the letter} alif is Adam. BA” is thebeginning of b”ismillAh {the invocation, in the name of God}, so that the dot beneathit is the source of existence, which is the origin of all letters. The meaning of yedimushaf {seven variant readings of the Koran} is the seven basic facial lines of Adam.The expression ak üstünde kara yazı {writing black on white} is an allusion to hutût-iümmiyye {the maternal lines} and hutût-i ebiyye {the paternal lines}. These are some ofthe fundamental beliefs of the lurefcs. There are many examples, references andexplanations in my published work.” Apparently Rızâ Tevfik considers Yenus Emreto be a disciple of Faql Allah lurefc. It is absolutely mistaken, however, to explainthese four verses by Yenus Emre, who lived a century before Faql Allah, according tolurefc beliefs. The quatrain below, which belongs to the famous nefc Shaikh ‘Izz al-Dcn Marmed al-Kashc, who wrote a commentary on {Ibn al-Fariq’s} QaTCda-i tA”iyyaand translated {al-Suhrawardc’s} “AwArif al-ma“Arif, has the same meaning as YenusEmre’s line Dört Kitâb”ın ma“nâsı tamâmdır bir elifde {The entire meaning of the FourBooks is in an alif}.{My heart said to me: “I desire divine knowledge.Instruct me if you have attained it.”“Alif,” I said. “What else?” he asked. “Nothing,” said I.If someone is in the house, one word is enough.}This nefc, who was definitely not a lurefc, also considered spiritual knowledge tobe concentrated in the letter alif. This shows that it would be completely mistakento attribute the aforesaid words of Yenus Emre to lurefism and explain them inits terms.60 In addition to the passage that I have mentioned, there are a few trifling things in theDCwAn concerning the secrets of the letters, but none of them bears the slightestevidence of lurefism or faQl {i.e. Faql Allah}.61 To demonstrate the importance that genuine nefcs gave to the secrets of the letters,I will give verbatim the account of the commentator {‘Abd Allah Bosnawc} on theFuTET – by Ibn al-‘Arabc – concerning RurEf {letters} and kalimAt {words}: Hurûf ilekelimât iki kısım üzredir.

Thus, the invisible letters are thebeginning occurrences for the entifications of things} (commentary on the FuTET,p. 17). The visible and hidden letters of the word God {AllAh} and the symbols thatthey denote are explained at length in this commentary: . . .Kezâlik nefes-i Rahmânî elif”itecellî îcâdı bed”inde te“ayyün-i evvel”in kalbi bâtınından mümted olub, ilm-i zâtîde ehadiyyet cem“-ihazretinde olan cemi“ Zuûn-i zâtiyye ve a“yân-ı ilmiyye-i gaybiyye ve hakâyık-ı fi“liyye”yi ilâhiyye üzreHazret-i imkân”ın gâyetine müntehî olunca mürûr etti.

The oneness of God in the knowledge of thedivine essence continued over all the tasks of the divine essence, the invisible andknowable entities, and the divine actual realities, which are in the total divine presence,culminate in the divine possibility. Then, because there is no perfect place for theentification of self-disclosure, it returned to the hidden part of the first entification,which is also its origin. Then the cycle of self-disclosure was complete and the divinebreath encompassed the necessary and possible realities of the alif and its end is joinedto its beginning. Thus God encompassed all things, both in knowledge and in being}(p. 27). All of this goes to show that the mystery of the letters was also included in theMuslim system of mysticism – as was the case in all other systems of mysticism beginningwith those of India. ysmâ‘îl Hakkı summarizes the significance of {Iam the dot under the (Arabic) letter “b”} by citing Shaikh ‘Alc’s Aswalat al-Rikam andother such books acceptable to the (conventional) religious scholars.

The abjad is an allusion to it. The fourth is the stage of the worldof corporeal bodies. All composed words are an allusion to it. Because youths andmen who are equivalent to them are near the world of divine essence, which theybegan from alif, they are an allusion to the divine breath of the All Merciful. Like thebreath of the alif, they are extended to all possible entities.. . . In short, the firstentification of the divine essence came into being with the extension of the divinebreath. The single dot under the bA” is an allusion to it. Second, the entification of theattributes came into being. The two dots over the tA” are an allusion to it. Third, theentification of the acts was established. The three dots over the thA” are an allusion toit. In other words, the entifications that occur with the extension of the divine breath,which is the aforesaid alif, are three stages and the dots also number three. They arenot two or four. The world of the nEn, which is found on the tongues of the nefcs, is anallusion to the dot. That world is also called umm al-kitAb (mother of the book), becauseit is the original book of existence. In that nEn is the ink of the matter for designingthe world. It is on the tongue of the perfect man, who is the collective totality of all thedivine and engendered stages, that his excellency ‘Alc said: “I am the dot belowthe bA”,” whether one be prophet or saint. The fact that the reality of Murammadwas the first entification does not prevent the reality of ‘Alc being the first entifica-tion, because the totality of the perfect man is of the first rank and is united inexistence} (commentary on the MuRammadiyya, vol. 1, part 2, pp. 132–3). In thecouplet Kudret, sûret yapmadan firiZtehler tapmadan / Âlemi halk tutmadan ileri yola geldim{Before power and form were made, before the angels worshipped, / Before creationseized upon the world, I came to the forward path}, Yenus Emre uses “the forwardpath” (ileri yol) to mean the world of the dot that is the collective whole of the divineand engendered stages and the copy of the objective and subjective worlds. It isas meaningless to consider Yenus Emre to be a Nuquawc {one who believed the earthwas the starting point, nuqUa, of all things; see EI2, s.v. “Nusuawiyya” (H. Algar)} basedon this as it is to consider him a lurefc based on the couplets given above. {See“On Letter Symbolism in Sufi Literature” in Schimmel, Mystical Dimensions of Islam,pp. 411–25.}62 Comparable to some other bAtinC beliefs, lurefism was a creed that held, in effect,that God was manifest in the form of Faql Allah lurefc. In order to reach this absurdconclusion, however, the lurefcs advanced all kinds of lengthy preliminaries, whichone encounters explicitly or implicitly in all lurefc literature from {Faql Allah’s}JAwidAn {MS in Köprülü’s private library} to the works of Firishte-oghlu {d. 874/1469}, ‘Alc ’l-A‘la {d. 822/1419}, and the lurefc poets. This system includes several"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE359points that are basically held in common with Islamic mysticism. For example, thesecrets of the letters, the perfect man, the dawr, and esoteric interpretation {ta”wCl}were not inventions of Faql Allah lurefc. They were taken from Islamic mysticism,but were absurdly stuck together with such things as metempsychosis, indwelling, andunion, which cannot be reconciled with it, and with a number of childish interpreta-tions {ta”wCl} that go to show that Faql Allah is God. In this respect, lurefism was setup very awkwardly on the premises of Islamic mysticism and so, removed from themooring of a consistent philosophical system, can be considered a hodgepodge ofchildish beliefs without any philosophical and ethical value. Putting its premises to oneside, the fundamental belief of this system is as follows: God, who is manifest in theform of speech, is known with the letters. All of these letters have been made evidentin the face of the perfect man. Therefore, it is possible to see in the face of man thetwenty-eight letters that are the original elements of all created things. The highestknowledges teach us this. In the face of man are the seven maternal lines – foureylashes, two eyebrows, one hair line – which they call sawAd-i a“Vam {the greatestmass}. There are also seven paternal lines that appear later: two beard whiskers,whiskers on the other side of the lines, two moustache whiskers and one whiskerunder the lip. Seven and seven make fourteen. If we multiply this with regard tocondition and place, it makes twenty-eight. Faql Allah, adding to them the Persianletters increased the number to thirty-two. The lurefcs interpret every-thing with this twenty-eight and thirty-two. Then, after removing the twenty-eightconsonants occurring in the ambiguous verses of the Koran, they {lurefcs} call theremaining seventeen letters the incontrovertible letters and the others the ambiguousletters. They consider the verses that ordinary religious scholars consider ambiguousto be incontrovertible and the ones that these scholars consider incontrovertible tobe ambiguous and they pretend to comment on them at length and in a childishmanner. They make a great many strange interpretations. They say, for example,that {“That is the bounty of God,” Koran, 5:54, 57:21, 62:4} and {“God is the possessor of bounty abounding,” Koran, 2:105, 3:74,8:29, 57:21, 57:29, 62:4} refer to Faql Allah lurefc; the mi“rAj {Murammad’s ascen-sion to heaven} refers to looking at the lines in the human face; the sidrat al-muntahA{the lotus tree in seventh heaven} refers to the nostrils of Faql Allah seen in thecountenance of Adam; the shAbb-i amrAd {beardless youth} who appeared to theProphet in the mi“rAj was Faql Allah, and so forth. Such interpretations, which areusually forced, concerning the number and secrets of the letters are so childish andridiculous that there is no need to comment on them. With such additions andinterpretations, the lurefcs were also far removed from the philosophical views thatconstituted a basis for their system (summary of yshak Efendi’s KâZifü”l-esrâr and theworks of Firishte-oghlu). Absolutely no such childish ideas are found in the poetry ofYenus Emre, who was a genuine nefc like Jalal al-Dcn Remc.63 Stryzgowski and his students, such as Glück, in their valuable studies on Turkish arthave reached the same conclusions as I have on this feature of the Turkish artisticgenius. In architecture, for example, the Turks adopted local elements, combinedthem with their own personalities, and then created completely new styles of art of awholly unique nature. Many valuable works that in the past were assumed to havebelonged to the milieu of Iranian art, and then Seljuk and Ottoman art, reveal thesequalities in the full sense. Innovation means, in fact, not to create something fromnothing, but to arrange existing elements in a new style according to a new senseof appreciation. This general character of early Turkish art was unknown untilStryzgowski, so that the products of that art were attributed to the Iranian milieu or,as was the case with Seljuk art, their originality was denied. Unfortunately, until now,no light has been shed on the originality of our popular nefc literature, of which"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE360Yenus Emre was the most powerful representative, and its distinctive features. Indeed,it too has been denied.64 This story of the shepherd is described at length in the second volume of the MathnawC.When Moses first encounters him, the shepherd is searching for God as follows:{Moses saw a shepherd on the way, who was saying, “O God who choosest(whom Thou wilt),Where art Thou, that I may become Thy servant and sew Thy shoes andcomb Thy head?That I may wash Thy clothes and kill Thy lice and bring milk to Thee, Oworshipful One;That I may kiss Thy little hand and rub Thy little foot, (and when) bedtimecomes I may sweep Thy little room,O Thou to whom all my goats be a sacrifice, O Thou in remembrance ofwhom are my cries of ay and ah!”The shepherd was speaking foolish words in this wise, Moses said, “Man, towhom is this (addressed)?”He answered, “To that One who creates us; by whom this earth and sky werebrought to sight.”“Hark!” said Moses, “you have become very backsliding (depraved); indeedyou have not become a Moslem, you have become an infidel.”The MathnawC, Book 2, lines 1720 –7, Nicholson trans.}This shepherd worshipped God with the cry, “O my God! Where are you? Let meserve you! Let me sew your sandals! Let me comb your hair! Let me wash yourclothes! Let me bring you milk! When you are sleepy, let me make your bed! All of myhue and cry is for you.” When Moses reproved him and accused him of unbelief, thepoor shepherd rent his shirt collar from emotion and fled to the wilderness. But theword of God came at once to Moses: “You have separated one of my slaves from me.While you had come to unite {with me}, you have parted from me. Words andphrases have no importance. Look at the fire of love in the heart.”"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"THE WORK OF YjNUS EMRE361{To lovers there is a burning (which consumes them) at every moment: taxand tithe are not (imposed) on a ruined village.If he (the lover) speak faultily, do not call him faulty; and if he be bathed inblood, do not wash (those who are) martyrs.For martyrs, blood is better than water: this fault (committed by him) is betterthan a hundred right actions (of another).Within the Ka’ba the rule of the qibla does not exist: what matter if the diverhas no snow-shoes?Do not seek guidance from the drunken: why dost thou order those whosegarments are rent in pieces to mend them?The religion of Love is apart from all religions: for lovers, the (only) religionand creed is God.The MathnawC, Book 2, lines 1765–70, Nicholson trans.} Full of pain and grief as aresult of this, Moses found the shepherd and gave him the good news in the followingmanner:{Do not seek any rules or method (of worship); say whatsoever your distressfulheart desires.Your blasphemy is (the true) religion, and your religion is the light of the spirit:you are saved, and through you a (whole) world is in salvation.O you who are made secure by God doeth whatso he willeth, go loose your tonguewithout regard (for what you say).The MathnawC, Book 2, lines 1784 – 6, Nicholson trans.} This shepherd is a symbol ofthe sincere mystics who have gone beyond ordinary norms. If there are those who seethoughtlessness in certain passages of Yenus Emre, the aforesaid words of Mawlanaare an excellent response to them.65 All the specialists who have properly studied Turkish and Ottoman architecture arevirtually unanimous in finding these qualities in it.66 Read the hymns of Ziyâ Gökalp in his Yeni hayât {Istanbul, 1918}. The influenceof Yenus Emre is immediately apparent in them. With respect to inspiration andpower of expression, they are examples that most closely approach the hymns in themost masterly style of Yenus Emre. Because the style of Yenus Emre is “inimitablesimplicity,” it is very difficult to imitate it successfully."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE36210YjNUS EMRE’S INFLUENCEON TURKISH LITERATUREAND HIS IMITATORSAY§nus Emre’s influenceThe religious life in Anatolia from the seventh/thirteenth century to around theend of the tenth/sixteenth century offers a very important field of study. In thismilieu – in which numerous great nefcs and nefc poets, beginning with YenusEmre, flourished – many sects and UarCqas that could be included in the bAUinCgroup took form and spread, including those of the Baba’cs, Abdals, Bektashcs,lurefcs, Qızılbashes, Qalandarcs, and laidarcs. In addition, there occurred theuprising of the supporters of Badr al-Dcn {Ibn Qaqc} Samawna, which was areprise of the previous Baba’c uprising, and subsequent religio-political uprisingsor isolated incidents of the same kind. During these four centuries, therefore, theAnatolian Turks experienced a life of continuous crisis. False prophets and newcreeds, for which a great many adherents risked their lives, flourished. Becausethese events were influenced by many different factors and took many differentforms, it would not be prudent to advance unreservedly a general and definitiveidea about them.1 The religio-nefc life, which, on the one hand, gave rise to bAUinCcurrents like these that were contrary to the clear stipulations of the SharC“a and,on the other, created with the same strength and vigor new UarCqas that conformedperfectly to SharC“a principles, spread to every corner of the Ottoman Empire,indeed, as far as the borders of Rumelia and Bosnia. Simply for this reason, thisperiod of Ottoman history reveals two contradictory phases. On the one hand,there were religious uprisings, sectarian movements led by isolated individuals,punitive actions {against rebellions}, killings, and executions. On the other hand,there were shaikhs who enjoyed the honor and respect of the most fanaticalmembers of the official religious establishment and the palace, whose saintlycharisma spread among the people, and who exercised great spiritual influence.Indeed, these two contradictory phases were the result of the same event, twodifferent manifestations of the same thing. They reveal the importance of, andhigh regard for, the nefc movement among the people. In short, in the region ofAnatolia, from the time of the Turkish settlement until the end of the tenth/sixteenth century, the nefc movement in various guises gradually increased instrength. Indeed, it never subsided and has continued up to the present."},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE’S INFLUENCE ON TURKISH LITERATURE363The nefc poetry of Yenus Emre spread very quickly in Anatolia and in ashort time some rather important imitators appeared. Until the ninth/fifteenthcentury, Ottoman literature was under the influence of Persian nefc literature,and thus was thoroughly mystical in nature. Under the spell of Mawlana, SuluanWalad, ‘Auuar, Sana’c, and Sa‘dc, it adopted, with a success that grew daily, thePersian meters and {literary} forms. At the same time, however, it could notabandon the national style that Yenus Emre had invigorated with his powerfulpersonality. Thus it also followed his path. Yenus Emre played a great role inthe following of two such different courses of nefc inspiration, both of whichderived from the same source. If he had not reinvigorated the national style andstamped it with his genius, our literature would have followed the other courseexclusively and would have been influenced only by the great Persian nefcs. Infact, because no national genius like Yenus Emre flourished in non-religiousliterature, that field was neglected for centuries and no national literature ofthe originality and esteem of the nefc literature that we call the Yenus Emre styleever appeared in it.We find the influence that Yenus Emre vigorously maintained in contrast tothe Persian nefc poets, {i.e.} the fact that the nefc inspiration followed two suchdifferent paths, first in ‘fshıq Pasha, the son of a Turkish family from Khurasan.2This poet, whose GharCbnAme was completed in 730/1329 –30 under the directinfluence of the MathnawC, also wrote hymns in which the influence of YenusEmre is striking. But because he almost completely lacked the artistic genius ofYenus Emre, his works are virtually indistinguishable from Yenus’s ordinaryhymns, which incorporate none of his true artistic personality. The ability of anordinary dervish like Yenus Emre to have this much influence on such a nefcpoet, who was directly under the influence of the Persian nefcs and especiallyMawlana, is very worthy of note.3The earliest poet to understand the charm of Yenus Emre’s style and to writehymns in the same manner was Qayghusuz Abdal, the khalCfa of Abdal Mesa.The Bektashcs consider him, like many other poets, to be a member of theirUarCqa.4 Although the legends and poetry of this man, whom the Egyptians call‘Abd Allah Magharawc because he was buried in a cave {maghAra} in Egypt,have been established and are well known, his historical personality, indeed,whether or not he actually wrote the beautiful poetry attributed to him, still havenot been determined with scholarly precision.5 But whoever he was and wheneverhe lived, we must consider those fine poems of his that have come down to us tobe among the most valuable works of the special expressive style that we call thestyle of Yenus Emre. Exactly as with Yenus Emre, his poems, which werewritten in the national meter and style, are characterized by being clearly andvery forcefully expressed with a profound purity and sincerity that accords withtheir simplicity.6The next oldest imitator of Yenus Emre was the famous lajjc Bayram Veli.7After him, the influence of Yenus Emre became pervasive. On one hand, wefind the imitators of Yenus Emre among the members of the UarCqas that conformed"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE364to SharC“a principles and, on the other, we find them among the members of theUarCqas that, in fact, could be included among the esoteric maslaks {paths}. Weeven find them outside the UarCqas among the saz poets or “Ashıqs, the continuatorsof the old Turkish minstrels. It is not possible to discuss here one by one and atlength, or even briefly, all these imitators of Yenus Emre. Instead of undertakingsuch an ambitious task, which would require a completely separate study, andwhich would not, with respect to scholarship, be useful compared to the effortrequired, I find it sufficient, and also necessary within the general framework ofmy book, to synthesize and describe briefly, and in global fashion, all of what weknow about this influence.BTekke poetryBeginning in the eighth/fourteenth century, i.e. after the death of Yenus Emre,a number of UarCqas of various sizes were established throughout the Turkishregions {and spread among the Turks of Anatolia}. {At the same time,} UarCqasfounded in other regions also spread among the Turks of Anatolia. It wouldrequire a completely separate and lengthy study to determine historically whenthese different UarCqas were founded, how they entered our country, and theextent to which they spread there. Hammer does give some rather brief informa-tion in his history on when the various UarCqas were established, but it cannot beregarded as wholly trustworthy. In any case, as tekkes and zAwiyas were thusfounded throughout the Turkish regions and the principles of nefism were spreadamong the people, it was necessary to create a distinctive literature for eachUarCqa. Indeed, one finds today in virtually every UarCqa works written for its mem-bers and describing its rules of etiquette and basic regulations, nefc principles,and the legends and miracles of its early shaikhs. In order to spread the nefcpaths among the people and to win supporters among them, the nefcs resortedwithout fail to the medium of poetry – as was the case in almost the entireMuslim world, including the Arabs, Persians, and Central Asian Turks.8 Thenotion of taking advantage of the popular affection for poetry encouraged theshaikhs to create an intellectual and artistic milieu in the tekkes in order to makethem more appealing. For this reason, poetry, like music, occupied an importantplace in the religious services of the UarCqas.I have stated above that Armad Yasawc and his imitators wrote religiouspoems {Rikmats} in order to arouse the people’s love for Yasawism; that Jalalal-Dcn Remc composed his MathnawC only for his disciples; and that later SuluanWalad and ‘fshıq Pasha resorted to Turkish in order to propagate nefc doctrineamong the Turks who did not know Persian. Subsequent nefcs also wished tocompose poems, hymns, and books for the same reason. They then found beforethem the pure, simple, powerful hymns of Yenus Emre that he had written inthe popular meter and language. These works, for which the people had greataffection and respect because they were suited to their own taste, and also the"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE’S INFLUENCE ON TURKISH LITERATURE365fact that both the people and the nefcs considered Yenus Emre to be a “spokesmanof the unseen world,” encouraged later nefcs to follow suit. In this manner, theywould both observe a semi-sacred tradition and would present works in a styleunderstood and enjoyed by the mass of the people. The fact that, after ‘fshıqPasha and Qayghusuz, a great shaikh like lajjc Bayram wrote a number ofpoems in the style of Yenus Emre caught the attention of the tekke poets, so thatlater nefcs, indeed, right up to the present, wrote the great majority of theirhymns in this style. Almost all these nefcs were men who understood Persianliterature and were able to write almost faultless works in the “arEQ meter. Indeed,many of them did write in this style as well. But writing unlettered, simple, andinsightful poems in the style of Yenus Emre had become such a firmly rootedtradition in all the tekkes that it was virtually impossible to avoid. The fact thatthe national meter and forms won such a prominent and important place amongour nefc poets, indeed, the fact that even some poets whom we could not reallyconsider to be true nefcs occasionally wrote only on nefc subjects, are consequencesof this.9 The style of Yenus Emre, which inspired many imitators, was wellreceived in all the UarCqas that flourished in the Ottoman Empire except theMawlawiyya. It was not, compared to the others, able to win a place in Mawlawctekkes. We can attribute this to the supremacy of Persian over Turkish languageand culture in those circles because of { Jalal al-Dcn Remc’s} MathnawC andDCwAn-i kabCr.10There are many tekke poets who wrote hymns in the style of Yenus Emre, butfew whose works are somewhat reminiscent of his. Beginning with EzrefoxluRemc of Iznik (d. 873/1469),11 son-in-law of lajjc Bayram Veli, author of MuzakkC“l-nufEs, and founder of the Ezrefiyye branch of the Qadiriyya UarCqa, the poetswhose works more or less call to mind Yenus Emre are Ibrahcm Ummc Sinan(d. 958/1551–2),12 founder of the Sinaniyya branch of the Khalwatiyya UarCqa;Armad Sarban (d. 952/1545 – 6)13 of the Malamiyya-i Bayramiyya; EroghluNerc Efendi of Elmalı;14 Idrcs Mukhtafc (d. 1024/1615–16),15 a member of theMalamiyya-i Bayramiyya; Sayyid Saif Allah Khalwatc (d. 1010/1601–2);16 NaqshcAq Kirmanc (d. 1062/1651–2);17 Ibrahcm Efendi (d. 1066/1655 – 6),18 known asOlanlar Shaikhi; and his disciple nunu‘ Allah Ghaibc (d. after 1072/1661–2),19author of the famous dawriyya known as Kashf al-ghiUA ”. Because each of them hadhis own personality, one should not consider them merely as imitators of YenusEmre. Still, it can definitely be claimed that none of them was able to approachthe artistic level of Yenus Emre. There are many other tekke poets, such asUftada {d. 988/1580 –1}, Hüda’c {d. 1038/1628 –9}, and Niyazc {d. 1105/1694},but Yenus’s influence on them is not as obvious as it is on those mentionedabove. As a final observation, we can say that the influence of Yenus Emre’sstyle on tekke poetry, with few exceptions, was confined to form and meter, i.e. toits external nature, and was not able to affect its true spirit to the same extent.20Those who understood the true features of this style, its true taste, and appro-priated it were the Bektashcs, lurefcs, and Qızılbashes."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE366C Bektash¢ poetryI have stated above that the Bektashiyya, which was founded and took root inthe ninth/fifteenth century, acquired a bAUinC character in the very early years ofits establishment. It was a UarCqa that came into existence from a mixture of threedifferent NEfC sects, namely those of the Baba’cs, Akhcs, and Abdals, and then fellunder the influence of lurefism. It acquired no other features.21 It is just becausethe poetry of Yenus Emre was clearly expressed in an unrestrained and boldmanner and was able to reach the lowest level of society that it became veryimportant in the eyes of the Bektashcs, who reserved a major place for Turkisheven in their rituals and litanies. The Bektashc bAbAs, like the other shaikhs, didnot receive an extensive madrasa education and the Bektashc dervishes were also,for the most part, plain and simple souls who grew up among the people.22 Forthis reason, they held the national language and literature in high regard insteadof prizing and slavishly imitating Persian language and literature. It is for thisreason too that the poets who thrived among them – most of whom had nomadrasa education but were cognizant of the national taste – had a mentalitycapable of subtle and elegant thought, yet primitive to the extent of gullibility,and superstitious; and while they usually employed the “arEQ meter and forms ina very poor and defective manner,23 they wielded the national meter and formsin a manner perfectly suited to the Turkish taste. These Bektashc bAbAs, whosetaste was not corrupted by the awe and enthusiasm that we feel toward sublimeexamples of Persian literature and who thus preserved the simplicity and originalityunique to the people, naturally had the best sense of Yenus Emre’s taste andwere the most successful in approaching it.The original and truly esteemed examples of Bektashc poetry written in thenational meter and forms are known as nefeses and are recited in the tekkes withspecific melodies, analogous to the ilAhCs {hymns} and nuUuqs {orations} in theother UarCqas, and the Rikmets among the Yasawcs. There are also eulogies, elegies,dastAns, and dawriyyas concerning ‘Alc or other members of the family of theProphet Murammad, all composed in the syllabic meter. For example, the dawriyyaof Shcrc {‘Alc Bey Hersek-Zade, fl. first half of tenth/sixteenth century}, thedastAn of Mir’atc Baba and the nefeses of dervishes from various periods, suchas Turabc, Sham‘c, Ajrc, Percshanc, Pcr Suluan, Qalandar Abdal, Qul Nascmc,lamdc, Delc Shükrü, Shahc, Ibrahcm Baba, Niyazc, Güvench Abdal, SararAbdal, Kemterc, Khaua’c, Qul Himmat, Rumezc, and Veli Baba, are in thesyllabic meter and in a style modeled completely after that of Yenus Emre, oreven more lively, allusive, and refined. To be sure, it is virtually impossibleto make precise assertions about the time, place, ideas, and beliefs of thesepoets. Some of them, such as Khaua’c,24 Qul Himmat, Rumezc, and Veli Baba,not only accepted lurefism and the divinity of Faql Allah lurefc, but alsoassociated with many poets who belonged to the Qızılbash, who were distinctfrom, but connected with, the Bektashcs. Qalandarc and laidarc poets werealso associated with them. So, while we are discussing Bektashc poetry and poets,"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE’S INFLUENCE ON TURKISH LITERATURE367we have to discuss at the same time those who wrote Qızılbash,25 Qalandarc,laidarc, and lurefc26 poetry in the national meter, and the influence of YenusEmre on them. These bAUinC sects held a number of basic beliefs more or less incommon, so that the poetry of one of them was always accepted and read withpleasure by the others.In these poems, which we call Bektashc poetry and which in fact providecommentary and musical expression for a mélange of obscure beliefs – includingBaba’c, Akhc, Abdal, lurefc, Qızılbash, Qalandarc, and laidarc doctrines – wefind much concerning love {“ishq, maRaabba}, the trinity of God, Murammad,and ‘Alc, fl-i ‘Aba’ {the people of the cloak, Murammad and his family}, thedivinity of Faql Allah lurefc, the secret meanings of the letters, lajjc BektashVeli being indistinguishable from Murammad and ‘Alc, the difficulties of themystic path, ritual ceremonies, the legendary deeds of Pcr-i Abdalan and SayyidGhazc, and of the great Bektashcs like Qızıl Deli Suluan, and Balım Suluan,and the abominable deeds of Yazcd. With respect to style, the influence of YenusEmre is so pervasive that one sometimes comes across the same topics, indeed,even the same lines of verse. Nevertheless, Bektashc poetry is generally moreunrestrained, more elegant, more subtle and refined than his. Yet this poetrylacks the power of conviction that is found in Yenus Emre. It is not only lessconvincing but also conveys flashes of profound irony {istihzA} mixed withskepticism.27 Yenus Emre possessed a lofty nefc philosophy, as did Muryc ’l-DcnIbn al-‘Arabc and Jalal al-Dcn Remc. The Bektashcs, on the other hand, held anumber of childish beliefs – such as metempsychosis, indwelling, and union –that are barely reconcilable and far from a coherent system. This could accountfor their irony and skepticism. But however little value this mixture of beliefs hasas a system of nefc thought, with regard to method, taste, and style Bektashcpoetry is the branch of literature that is certainly the most Turkish and perhapsthe most influenced by Yenus Emre.28 Perhaps more than anything else, thisplain beautiful poetry, which suited the national taste and was simple enoughfor everyone to understand, helped to spread so forcefully the strange ideasthat appeared under the names of Bektashism, Qızılbashism, and lurefismamong the people.D«•shıq literatureI discussed above {in Chapters 6 and 7} the ozans, the earliest popular poets ofthe Turks, and especially the popular literature that they created as they sangto the accompaniment of the kopuz. These saz poets, who were the principalminstrels of the Turks of Anatolia from their first appearance in that region,continued their poetic activities during the eighth/fourteenth and ninth/fifteenthcenturies. In the course of the ninth/fifteenth century, we find that, even in thepalaces, an important place was still given to the ozans. After the UarCqas hadmultiplied and the nefc movement had spread and became thoroughly establishedamong the people, almost all the ozans attached themselves to a pCr and tried to"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE368give a nefc flavor to their work. At that point, instead of using the name ozan,which conjured up the pre-Islamic period, i.e. the memory of Korkut Ata andthe traditions of the OghuznAme, they adopted the title of “Ashıq, which meant nefcpoet, and the term ozan began to be used to mean a “prattler.”29 One couldstrongly argue that this differentiation took place in the second half of the ninth/fifteenth century, or, more likely, in the tenth/sixteenth century. By that time,significant works of “Ashıq literature, the particular forms and rules of these works,important and famous “Ashıqs, the “Ashıq life and “âshıq organization, and the placeof “Ashıqs in public life are all very well known. Because I have published adetailed study on this special style of literature, I will not mention here evenbriefly the many aspects of this broad topic.30This “Ashıq literature, which was established to fulfill the artistic needs of acertain class by a kind of division of labor, is completely separate from classicalliterature, tekke literature, and even folk literature, which is included in theanalytical framework of folklore. Although it derived its original tradition fromthe older folk literature, a number of elements from both the Persian-style classicalliterature, which fulfilled the needs of the upper class, and nefc literature, whichthrived in the tekkes, mingled with it; “Ashıq literature, or what we call saz liter-ature, was created from all these elements. In its early period of development, itconformed completely to the old folk literature with respect to meter and form.Later, however, after Fuqelc {d. 963/1556}, it also tried to apply the rules ofPersian versification – in a very defective and elementary manner – under theinfluence, on one hand, of classical literature and, on the other, of tekke literature,which had been subject to strong Persian influence. However, because it wasa literature that spoke directly to the popular masses and to the popular taste,the rules of Persian poetry could not make it neglect the Turkish tradition.The national meter and national forms remained as a fundamental element of“Ashıq literature.The influence of Yenus Emre on “Ashıq literature was indirect rather thandirect. Because virtually all “Ashıqs were associated with UarCqas, indeed, becausemost of them were in fact Bektashcs who flourished among the janissaries, “Ashıqliterature was very strongly influenced by the national nefc poetry of the Bektashcpoets and thus they {i.e. “Ashıq and Bektashc literature} had many features incommon. I have already discussed at length the relationship of the “Ashıqs withthe Bektashcs and the causes and consequences of this very close relationship.Now, as I explained a moment ago, Yenus Emre had a striking influence onBektashc poetry with regard to spirit and style. This influence, passing throughthat particular literary style into “Ashıq literature, reveals itself in the “Ashıq poetrythat has a more or less nefc nature, and even in some tekerlemes { jingle, playfulformula used in folk narratives} that are reminiscent of Yenus’s satirical writings.This influence is obvious to various degrees according to the personality andlevel of mystical capacity of each great “Ashıq. Therefore, while studying a given“Ashıq, one should never disregard the influence of Yenus Emre among theelements that contributed to his art."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE’S INFLUENCE ON TURKISH LITERATURE369E ConclusionI have described how popular nefc literature, by combining elements fromvarious sources, appeared among the Turks in a form that was peculiar to thepeople. I have done so by examining at length the causes and consequences ofthis process from the origins of the nefc movement among the Central AsianTurks and Armad Yasawc, who was our first great popular nefc poet, to YenusEmre, the greatest nefc poet of the Western Turks, and his imitators. Now,having reached the end of my investigation, it may be useful to pause a momentand reflect on the long and difficult road that we have traveled. We can thusrecapitulate, albeit briefly, in synthetic fashion and with greater clarity, the entirescope of my study. The many secondary details that I have given while passingfrom point to point may have tired my readers and my lengthy analyses mayhave made it somewhat difficult for a general synthesis to emerge in their minds.We have seen that a nefc literature whose major elements derived from popularliterature and the national taste began with Armad Yasawc and continued toYenus Emre, and beyond him to the present day in the form of a long chainconnecting one poet to another. This literature, which won the favor of thepeople from its first appearance because it was very closely related to our pre-Islamic popular literature, helped to spread the principles of nefism among theTurks. The development of nefc sentiments and perceptions among the Turkslater caused this literature to thrive for centuries among the people, and it hasmaintained its initial spiritual influence even today among the Central AsianTurks who have not yet undergone a renaissance or entered the modern world.The literature, and the nefc movement that brought it forth, took a broader,more unrestrained, and more profound form as soon as it entered the milieu ofthe Western Turks and was transformed from a system of asceticism and pietyinto a philosophy of divine love. This difference did not simply result from thedifferences between the personalities of Armad Yasawc and Yenus Emre. Thefree environment of Anatolia, which was conducive to the philosophy of panthéismidéaliste {wujEdiyya-i khayAliyya} under the influence of two such great nefcs asMuryc ’l-Dcn Ibn al-‘Arabc and Jalal al-Dcn Remc, cast the well defined, dry,orthodox, and pietistic views of Armad Yasawc into a broad, fluid system ofdivine love and unity of being characteristic of Yenus Emre. While ArmadYasawc was basically the founder of a great UarCqa and a legal scholar almostcompletely lacking in poetic ability, Yenus Emre, to the contrary, was an inspiredpoet and a simple dervish who embraced nefism out of his spiritual need. Thisexplains the dignified, rather dull and dry style of the one and the simple andunlettered sincerity of the other.If we compare the inherent value of their works, i.e. with respect to theiraesthetic nature, we can say that Yenus Emre was an artistic genius and that hiswork can be read with pleasure even today, whereas Armad Yasawc’s DCwAn-iLikmat can only be read by dervishes who believe in its sanctity. It is clear thatalthough Yenus Emre was directly or indirectly under the spiritual influence of"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE370this early Turkish saint from the steppes of Kirgizistan, he greatly surpassed himas a literary genius. But if we leave aside this measure of inherent value andcompare only the external influences of Armad Yasawc and Yenus Emre, it isimpossible not to be astounded by the greatness of both men. First of all, ArmadYasawc, who founded a vigorous UarCqa that spread to all the countries of the Turks,created a popular nefc literature, a style of religious poems {Rikmat}, within theliterature of Central Asia and thus set an example for the nefc poets of thatregion who have flourished up to the present. In other words, he created a tekkeliterature that bore the stamp of his own personality. The primary centers of thisliterature are the tekkes of the Naqshbandcs. As for Yenus Emre, unlike his masterhe did not found a new UarCqa, but like him he created an original literature, anefc popular literature called the Yenus style that we still read with pleasure andthat still affects us. This literature was a major factor in {the development of }all tekke poetry, in Bektashc poetry, and even in “Ashıq literature. In contrast to theRikmat style, which prevails mainly in the Naqshbandc dervish convents in CentralAsia, the preference for the Yenus style is most striking in Bektashc poetry.The artistic genius of Yenus Emre in particular created a special, and the mostnational and original, form of Turkish literature, the like of which never appearedin the other Islamic literatures. This form, which was able to represent theepitome of national taste for centuries, has an incomparable value for the historyof Turkish literature. Those who, faced with the contemporary progress of thepositive sciences, find no pleasure in nefc philosophy, or those who, for whateverreason, wish to cut the ties to the past, may claim that they are not affected bythe works of Armad Yasawc and Yenus Emre. After all, everyone is free to enjoywhatever literature he wishes. Still, it is impossible to deny that these two greatpersonalities exerted an unparalleled influence on the general development ofTurkish literature. These two names, Armad Yasawc and Yenus Emre, will liveforever as immortal chapters in the history of Turkish literature.NOTES1 Unfortunately, these phases of the religious history of the Anatolian Turks have hardlybeen studied. Among the sects mentioned here – Abdalism, Bektashism, lurefism,Qalandarism, and laidarism – only two, Bektashism and lurefism, have attractedthe attention of the Western scholarly world and have been studied to some degree.But even these studies, as I have shown in various connections in this book, are verydefective. In fact, with respect to Bektashism, they are completely erroneous. By notdoing serious studies on the Baba’cs, Akhcs, Yasawcs, and Abdals, indeed, by not evenseeing the need to acknowledge their existence, these researches on Bektashc history,undertaken with the few limited sources that are available, are doomed to failure. Inwhat milieu did Bektashism arise and what factors influenced it? To what changes wasit subject? How was it viewed? What status did it acquire across the centuries withrespect to the extent of its development and spread? With what UarCqas did it haveconnections and ties? In order to comprehend properly all such questions, one has tostudy the nefc systems and doctrines in Anatolia and Bauinism as a whole. In thisregard, we can say that the studies of Dr Jacob and others on Bektashism are very"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE’S INFLUENCE ON TURKISH LITERATURE371defective and erroneous, and that on lurefism no historical study has been done atall. I plan to publish gradually the studies that I am preparing on these unansweredquestions concerning Bektashism and lurefism as well as those on Akhism, Abdalism,Qalandarism, and laidarism. I hope that these studies, whatever shortcomings theymay have, will prepare a new foundation for the synthetic works that will be writtenin the future on the religious history of Anatolia, and, by correcting current errors,will also provide a sound and reliable course for such studies. For now, see “Mısır’dabektazîlik,” TM, 6 (1936 –9), 13 – 40, and YA, s.v., “Bektâz” {M. Fuad Köprülü}. {Asmentioned earlier, Köprülü’s work on the lurefcs was never published. See thestudies by Gölpınarlı listed in the bibliography of his Hurûfîlik metinleri kataloXu. Muchwork has recently been done on nefism and heterodoxy in Anatolia. On the Baba’csand Qalandarcs, see Ocak, Osmanlı YmparatorluXunda marjinal sûfîlik: Kalenderîler and AhmetKaramustafa, God’s Unruly Friends. On Akhism, see Çaxatay, Bir Türk kurumu olan ahilik.See also Ocak, Osmanlı topumunda zındıklar ve mülhidler (15.–17. yüzyıllar) (Istanbul, 1998).On Badr al-Dcn Ibn Qaqc Samawna, see Michel Balivet, Islam mystique et révolution arméedans les Balkans ottomans: vie du Cheikh Bedreddîn le “Hallâj des turcs” (1358/9 –1416)(Istanbul, 1995).}2 Because he was the child of a family that came from Khurasan, Rızâ Tevfik con-sidered this poet to be of Iranian origin. This claim is completely erroneous. ManyTurks, especially Oghuz Turks, lived scattered about, or in large groups, sometimes astribes, in several places in Khurasan. I have discussed this subject in various places inthe present work, so there is no need to repeat it here. It is in this respect that we mustconsider ‘fshıq Pasha to be an Oghuz Turk. There is considerable information on‘fshıq Pasha in the early Ottoman histories, in Laucfc’s Tadhkira, {Tashköprü-Zade’s}al-ShaqA”iq, the introduction to ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade’s TawArCkh-i Al-i “uthmAn, in MehmedTâhir’s article {“Azık Paza”} in the first issue of Türk DerneXi {1327/1911, pp. 12–19},and in E. J. W. Gibb’s {A History of Ottoman Poetry, vol. 1, pp. 176 –200}, but a detailedanalysis of the literary and linguistic nature of his work has not been done. The poemsthat Mehmed Tâhir attributes to ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade Elvan Chelebc in his Osmanlımüellifleri all belong to Shaikh Elvan Shcrazc, the {Turkish} translator of {MarmedShabistarc’s} Gulshan-i rAz. Thúry also confused these two Elvan Chelebcs. The onlysamples of the poetry of ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade Elvan Chelebc to come down to us are in{Hacı Kemal’s} JAmi“ al-naVA”ir {see EI2, s.v. “‘fshıs Pasha” (Fahir yz) and the intro-duction to Ocak and Erünsal (eds), Menâkıbu ”l-Kudsiyye}.3 In his JAmi“ al-naVA ”ir, Hacı Kemal of Exridir records a number of hymns of ‘fshıqPasha as imitations of the poetry of Yenus Emre. Even without this explicit reference,however, the influence is easy to see.4 In his Osmanlı müellifleri, Mehmed Tâhir also accepts this theory of the Bektashcs andconsiders both him and Abdal Mesa to be early Bektashcs. Because the Bektashc UarCqahad not been established at that time, this claim does not conform to reality. As canbe understood from their names, they belonged to the group of Abdals who wererather widespread in Anatolia at that time. Qayghusuz’s AbdAlnAme also shows this{better known as BudalAnAme, ed. Abdurrahman Güzel in Kaygusuz Abdal”ın mensureserleri (Ankara, 1983), pp. 49 –74}. There is no reference to the Bektashism of AbdalMesa in either ‘fshıq Pasha-Zade’s {TawArCkh-i Al-i “uthmAn} or {Tashköprü-Zade’s}al-ShaqA”iq. During the establishment of Bektashism in the ninth/fifteenth century,when it borrowed elements from Akhism, Baba’ism, and Qalandarism, it also appro-priated many features of the UarCqa of the Abdals, which was a branch of Baba’ism. Itis for this reason that Abdal Mesa and his khalCfa were considered to be Bektashcs.I have described in various places above how Bektashism appropriated to itself thoseindividuals whose legends and miracles were famous among the people, even thoughthey did not have a close relationship with it. I will provide extensive details in the"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE372study that I mentioned on Abdalism and its relationship to Bektashism. {See hisarticle “Abdal” in Türk halk edebiyatı ansiklopedisi.}5 There is detailed information in the legends of Qayghusuz Abdal about his relation-ship with Abdal Mesa and how he later went to Egypt (MS of ManAqib-i QayghusuzAbdAl in my private library). At the end of this collection of legends there is also a veryfamous poem that is a kind of satire in which Qayghusuz mimics Yenus Emre. As anexample of Qayghusuz’s work, we can give this famous passage that best describes hispersonality:Yücelerden yüce gördümErbâbsın Sen koca TanrıÂlem okur kelâm ileSen okursun hecâ TanrıÂsî kullar yaratmıZsınVarsın Zöyle dursun deyuAnları koymuZ oradaSen çıkmıZsın uca TanrıKıldan köprü yaratmıZsınGelsün kullar geçsün deyuHele biz Zöyle duralımYiXit isen geç a Tanrı{Highest of the high, I have seen: You are the Lord, mighty God.The world recites with speech:You recite letters, O God.You created rebellious servants,sending them on their way;You put them thereand went out to the edge, O God.You created the bridge, as thinand told Your servants to come across.as a hair,Well, let us stay hereand You cross if You’re so brave, O God!}This poem, the latter parts of which are too unrestrained to ever please the con-ventional upholders of religious law, is obviously somewhat livelier and bolder thanthe style of Yenus Emre, but it is still under his influence. Qayghusuz’s influence onlater Bektashc poets, or, more correctly, on establishing the special style that we callBektashc poetry, is very great {see EI2, s.v. “mayghusuz Abdal” (Fahir yz)}.6 There is a noteworthy point in this respect. Armad Sarban, whom I will discussbriefly below, also had the byname Qayghusuz. Like Yenus Emre, he had a broadview of unity of being. Although he did produce works along these lines, his style isvery different from that of the older Qayghusuz.7 See the following sources for the biography of this great nefc – who was the founderof the Bayramiyya UarCqa and died in 833/1429 –30 – and for the characteristics of hisUarCqa: {Tashköprü-Zade’s} al-ShaqA”iq, {Turkish} trans.; ysmâ‘îl Hakkı’s SilsilanAme-ijalwatC {lithograph edn, n.p., 1291/1874}; Jamc’s NafaRAt, {Turkish} trans.; La‘lczade‘Abd al-Baqc’s RisAla-i malAmiyya-i bayrAmiyya {Istanbul, n.d.}; {larcrc-Zade’s} TibyAn-i wasA”il al-RaqA”iq; Aq Shams al-Dcn’s RisAlat al-nEriyya {or Risâle-i AkZemseddin} andSharR-i AqwAl-i LAjjC BayrAm WalC; Ibrahcm Tennerc’s poem GulzAr-i ma“nawC {see AliKarabulut and Ramazan Yıldız, Gülzâr-i ma“nevi ve Ybrahim Tennuri (Kayseri?, 1978)};‘Abd al-Rarcm Bayramc’s treatises Munyat al-abrAr and WaRdatnAme; the tarCqatnAmes ofDu‘aci Oghlu and Himmat Dede; the second and third volumes of Evliya Chelebi’sSeyARatnAme; and Tâhir’s Osmanlı müellifleri and treatise entitled LAjjC BayrAm WalC{Istanbul, 1329/1911}. {See YA, s.v. “Bayramiye” (Abdülbâki Gölpınarlı), and EI2,s.v. “ladjdjc Bayram Walc” ( V.

In order to give an idea of itsform and style, I will cite it verbatim.Çalabım bir Zâr yaratmıZ iki cihân arasındaBakıcak dîdâr görünür ol Zârın kenâresindeNâgehân ol Zâr”a vardım ol Zâr”ı yapılır gördümBen dahi bile yapıldım taZ u toprak arasındaOl Zâr”dan oklar atılır gelir ciXere batılırÂrifler sözü satılır ol Zâr”in bâzâresinde{âkirdleri taZ yonarlar yonup üstâda sunarlarÇalab”ın ismin anarlar o taZın her pâresindeBu sözü ârifler anlar câhiller bilmeyib tanlarHacı Bayram kendi bânlar ol Zâr”in menâresinde{My Lord created a city between the two worlds.If you look you’ll see His face at the edge of that city.At once I went to that city and saw that it was built.I too was built together with it, in the midst of stone and mortar.Arrows are shot from that city and penetrate the heart.The words of mystics are sold in that city’s marketplace.Apprentice masons carve stones and present them to the master.On every piece of stone, they carve the Lord’s name.Mystics understand these words; fools are bewildered by them.lajjc Bayram himself gives the call to prayer in that city’s minaret.}It is obvious that this style is identical with that of Yenus Emre.8 The traveler Ibn Bauueua says that when he was a guest in the zAwiya of Saif al-DcnBakharzc in the suburb of Fatr fbad in Bukhara, the shaikh of the zAwiya Yaryaal-Bakharzc, a descendant of Saif al-Dcn, arranged a banquet for him and invited theleading men {of the city}. The Koran readers recited, the preachers gave sermons,and songs were sung melodiously in Turkish and Persian (SeyARatnAme, {Turkish trans.,}vol. 1, p. 416 {Gibb trans., vol. 3, p. 554}). Indeed, if we consider the Islamic worldat that time, we see that literature, music, and free thinking could only find refugein the tekkes in opposition to the dry and cold fanaticism of the ascetics. The tekkesand nefism provided a place of refuge and a source of intellectual and artistic activityfor the Islamic world for centuries. The Mawlid gatherings {to celebrate the birthdayof the Prophet}, in which religious poetry and music coalesced, were extremelypopular among the Turks in particular because of the people’s nostalgia for the oldZölens, i.e. for aesthetic assemblies. In contrast to the fanatical asceticism and pietyrepresented by the madrasas, the tekkes provided an outlet where one could breathean atmosphere of artistic and intellectual freedom. This is why the nefcs and poetsattacked the conventional religious scholars and the madrasas, which represented them,for centuries. {Mawlid gatherings do not appear to be attested among the Turks inthe eighth/fourteenth century. See N. Kaptein, MuRammad’s Birthday Festival: EarlyHistory in the Central Muslim Lands and Development in the Muslim West until the 10th/16thCentury (Leiden, 1993).}9 Sultan Murad III {1574 –95}, for example, who was disposed to nefism, wrote afamous hymn in the syllabic meter beginning Uyan ey gözlerim gafletten uyan {Awake, myeyes, from heedlessness, awake!} (MüstaqCm-ZAde mecmuası, MS 3397 in the Esad Efendi"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE374Library, now in the Süleymaniye Library in Istanbul). In addition, it is known thatMermed Giray IV, the khAn of Crimea who died in 1085/1674–5, wrote some hymnsand some poetry in the syllabic meter under the pen name ‘frif. I chanced upon anexample in an anthology in my library (Gülbün-i khAnAn – al-sab“ al-sayyAr {Istanbul,1287/1870 –1}). This poem, beginning Bu dehrin hâline eyledim nazar / Her biri bir derdegiriftâr ancak / Kemâle erince hâr ile gülzâr / Bülbülün âdeti âh-u zâr ancak {I considered thestate of the present age / Everyone is in bondage to some concern / When thorn androse reach perfection / The nightingale’s preoccupation is with sighs and moans}, isa fine work expressing mystical ecstasy. We should not forget, however, that suchexamples are relatively rare. [Köprülü later published the remainder of this poem {in“XVII. asır saz zairlerinden kâmil kırım hanı IV. Mehmet Giray”} in Hayat Mecmuası,1928, no. 134, an article in which he pointed out that the pen name of MermedGiray IV was not ‘frif but Kamil. This article was reprinted in Orhon F. Köprülü(ed.), Köprülü”den seçmeler, pp. 93 – 8.]10 Although the Mawlawc UarCqa was established by a Turk in a Turkish milieu, itacquired a clearly Iranian hue under the influence of Jalal al-Dcn Remc. Mawlawclitanies {wird}, orations, and most of the major works of the UarCqa are in Persian.Later, beginning with Jalal Arghen, poets who wrote in Turkish also flourished,but all of them strove to apply the Persian meters and forms. Thaqib Dede, in hisSafCna-i mawlawiyAn {or Sefine-i nefise-i mevleviyan (Cairo, 1283/1866)}, and Esrar Dede{d. 1211/1796 –7}, in his Tadhkirat-i shu“arA” (MS in my private library), both of whichdiscuss the leading Mawlawc personalities and poets, provide a clear view of this.Among the great Mawlawcs, the only one who held the national style in high regardwas the famous fdem Dede. nafa’c {d. 138/1725}, the author of the Tadhkira,mentions his hymn beginning Dert ehli libâsını aZk ile giyen gelsün / Zehrini Zeker gibi zevkile yiyen gelsün {Let him come who wears the cloak of the people of pain, with Love /Let him come who eats its poison like sugar, with pleasure} and reports thatAzîz-i mûmâileyhin terennümât-ı ney-pâre-i kalemi mutâbık-ı usûl-i sûfiyâne ve eZ“âr-i halet-Zi“ârıbî-tekellüf ve âZıkâne {the songs of the aforesaid saint were in conformity with the nefcstyle; and his poetry was characterized by a lack of formality and ecstatic love of God}(nafa’c, Tadhkira, MS. 2549 in the Esad Efendi Library). In Thaqib Dede’s book thereis also a hymn with the refrain Kurtar bizi nefs elinden {Save us from the clutches of thecarnal self } (SafCna-i mawlawiyAn, vol. 2, p. 50). Esrar Dede says of this nefc, who diedin Egypt while performing the pilgrimage to Mecca in 1063/1652–3: “Most of hispoetry consists of hymns and divinely inspired orations {ilhâmât}; his beste hymns inthe nefc style are now employed for dhikrs and nefc litanies” (Tadkhira, pp. 4 – 6). Healso mentions his fine poetry written in the “arEQ meter and even some noteworthypoems in Persian.11 In addition to his published MuzakkC ”l-nufEs {Istanbul, 1281/1865} and unpublishedOarCqAtnAme, Ezrefoxlu, who received instruction first from lajjc Bayram Veli andthen from lusain lamawc, a descendant of ‘Abd al-Qadir Jilanc, also has a dCwAnprinted in Istanbul in 1286 {see EI2, supplement, s.v. “Eshrefoghlu” (Fahir yz)}. Evena superficial examination of this DCwAn, which, on the basis of manuscript copies, israther defective, shows that he was under the influence of Yenus Emre. This DCwAn,despite the unreliability of the imprint, recalls Yenus Emre in several of its linguisticand stylistic features. It reveals Ezrefoxlu to us as a pantheist nefc completely underthe influence of Yenus Emre and ‘fshıq Pasha. The passages written in the “arEQmeter are very defective, exactly like those of ‘fshıq Pasha. As for those written in thesyllabic meter, while lacking Yenus’s sincerity and power they nevertheless show astriking resemblance to his work. As is the case with Yenus Emre’s DCwAn, this one tooincludes unrestrained dawriyyas, exhortations on the need for ecstatic love of God andspiritual knowledge, and counsels on the need to be attached to a shaikh. In Ezrefoxlu,"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE’S INFLUENCE ON TURKISH LITERATURE375however, there are passages indicating that he was the shaikh of a UarCqa and summon-ing the people to him.AZk sayrusu olanlara gelsinler tîmâr eyleyemYçürem aZk Zerbetini dosttan haberdâr eyleyemAçar bâtınî gözünü göre kendi kendözünüDosta döndürem yüzünü âlemden bîzâr eyleyemSöyündürem nefsi od”ın bozam tılısmının bendinGötürem benliXi seddin ol dosta yular eyleyemOl taZ olmuZ gönüllere vuram aZkın külünküniÂb-i hayât”ı akıtam gönlünde pınar eyleyemBen dostu görüp gelmiZem devrânım sürüp gelmiZemDost dostlara gelsün dedi geldim ki haber eyleyem{Let those come who are sick with Love: I will treat them.I’ll give them love potion to drink.

I’ve spent my time of fortuneand come back.The Beloved told the lovers to come: I’ve come to tell the others.}It is clear that this work is also completely in the style of Yenus Emre. Among thefactors that shaped the personality of Ezrefoxlu, the influence of Yenus Emre isstrikingly greater than that of ‘fshıq Pasha. Ezrefoxlu’s language is somewhat moretechnical than that of Yenus Emre because of the difference in time between them,but given his complete lack of consideration for art, his use of half rhyme for the mostpart instead of rhyme, and his subject matter, Ezrefoxlu is Yenus’s most faithfulimitator. With the exception of Qayghusuz, we can consider him to be the mostimportant imitator of Yenus Emre. In the following passage from one of his dawriyyas,the influence of Yenus Emre is immediately apparent:Gâh denizlere düZerem mevc urup taZra taZaramNâdân eline düZerem kem bahâya alınuramGâh çıkaram bu göklere dönerem çarh ile bileGâh ay ile bedr oluram gâh gün ile dolanuramGâh “Arafât”a çıkaram lebbeyk urub baZ açaramGâh kurbân yerine gelüp koç olub boXazlanuramGâh hânkâhta sûfîyem gâh meyhânede fâsıkamGâh raksa girüb dönerem gâh sâz olub çalınuramGâh onaram gâh azaram bu halk içinde gezeremGâh Zâh olub Zahbâz olub Zikâr edüb avlanuram"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE376Gâh deniz gâh göl oluram gâh sultân gâh kul oluramGâh bahâr gâh gül oluram elden ele yelinüremNe menzil vardır ne makâm ne vücud vardır ne “ademHak”tan gayrı yok ve”sselâm ya ben kande dolanuram{Now I plunge into the sea and emerge as a wave,Or I fall in the hands of a fool and am sold at a small price.Now I rise up to heaven and turn with the spheres;I am crescent moon or full moon, or I turn with the sun.Now I go out to Arafat as a pilgrim and bare my head,Or come to the place of sacrifice as a ram and am slaughtered.Now I’m a nefc in the dervish convent, or a reprobate in the tavern,Or I twirl in the dance, or become a saz and am strummed.Now I go aright, now astray: I wander amidst the people.Now I am king, or else the king’s falcon in the hunt.Now I’m the sea, or a lake; now sultan, or slave.Now spring, or a rose passed from hand to hand.Neither halting-place nor station, neither being nor non-being:Nothing but God, that is all: so where shall I turn now?}12 The following hymn of Ummc Sinan is completely reminiscent of Yenus Emre’s style:Erenlerin sohbeti ele giresi deXilIkrâr ile gelenler mahrûm kalası deXilÜmmî Sinan yol “ayân olubdur her Zey beyânDerviZlik yolu hemen tâc ve hırkası deXil{Conversing with the saints cannot be brought under control.Those who come confessing will not be left deprived.Ummc Sinan, the way is clear and everything is evident.The way of the dervish is not just tall cap and patched cloak.}13 Many of the hymns of this person, who sometimes used the pen name Armadcand sometimes Qayghusuz in his poetry, are recorded in Müstaqcm-Zade’s treatiseARwAl-i MalAmiyya-i BayrAmiyya and in La‘lczade’s {RisAla}, and a copy of his DCwAn isin the Selim Axa Library in Üsküdar. In order to give an idea of the hymns in the syllabicmeter of this nefc, who also wrote quite a few poems in the “arEQ meter, I will cite a verynoteworthy and personal work of his concerning his view of the {spiritual} pole {quUb}.Evliyâya eXri bakmaKevn ü mekân elindedirMülke hükmün süren oldurYki cihân elindedirSen anı Zöyle sanursunSencileyin bir âlemdirEvliyâ”nın sırrı vardırGizli “ayân elindedir{Do not look askance at the saints:the universe is in their hands.It is they who govern the kingdom:both the worlds are in their hands.You should consider each of themas a world equivalent to you (?).The saints have a secret:the concealed and the evident are intheir hands.}"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE’S INFLUENCE ON TURKISH LITERATURE377Rızâ Tevfik believed the original Qayghusuz Abdal and Armad Sarban were thesame person and deduced a number of things from this ({article in the literary sup-plement to the newspaper} Peyâm, no. 35, 8 May, 1330/1912); but this is clearlymistaken. The doctrine and mystical ideas of Armad Sarban and Qayghusuz are bothwell known and their writing styles are noticeably different.14 This person who is buried in the village of Eroxlu between the districts of Kula andEzme has a dCwAn and a work in Turkish concerning mysticism called Mir”At al-“AshiqCn.His hymn, beginning Nidâ ettim gelsin âZık olanlar / Hakk”a gidenlerin yoludur Tevhîd /AZkın dersin bundan aldı alanlar / Hem ledün ilmi”nin dilidir Tevhîd {I summoned those whoare lovers / TawRCd is the path of those going to divine Truth / Those who learnedthe lesson of Love learned it from this / TawRCd is the language of the science of divinenearness}, is only slightly reminiscent of Yenus Emre. This man is not, in fact, aparticularly important personality ({Mehmed Tâhir,} Osmanlı müellifleri, vol. 1, p. 26).15 Originally from Tırhala, he came to Istanbul and trained a number of great personal-ities, including Sarı ‘Abd Allah Efendi, the commentator on the MathnawC. His hymnsvaguely recall those of Yenus Emre. His famous oration beginning YZ bu dem’e erinceüç kez doXdum anadan {Until I reached this moment, I was born again three times} wasexpounded upon by several shaikhs ({Mehmed Tâhir,} Osmanlı müellifleri, vol. 1, p. 24).16 This person, whose DCwAn has been published, has many other works, most notably afamous treatise entitled MiftAR-i waRdat-i wujEd. He was a khalCfa of Ummc Sinan. Inaddition to a number of poems in the “arEQ meter, he wrote hymns in the style ofYenus Emre. The following passage from one of his hymns is reminiscent of YenusEmre:Kıyamazsan baZa cânaIrak dur girme meydânaBu meydânda nice baZlarKesilir hiç sorar olmazBak Zu Mansûr”un iZineHalkı üZürmüZ baZınaEne”l-Hakk”ın firâZınaDüZenlere tîmâr olmazSeyfu”llâh sözünde mesttir{eyhinden aldıXı dest”dirDîvânerâ kalem nîstdirNe söylese kanar olmaz{If you cannot sacrifice your life, do not enter the arena.In this arena many heads are cut off and no one questions it.Look what happened to Manter al-lallaj: the people gathered against him.There is no treatment for those who enter the sick bed of “I am the Truth.”Saif Allah is intoxicated in his speech: It is the permission he received from hisshaikh.Madmen have no pens: Whatever they say does not convince.}Some shaikhs have written commentaries on this hymn.17 He was from Divrixi and was a leading member of the Khalwatc UarCqa. Because hewent to Aq Kirman to provide mystical guidance and was buried there, he is knownas Aq Kirmanc. In addition to his published DCwAn, which was printed under themistaken title of DCwAn-i ShAh Naqshband, he has a number of nefc works in verse andprose. I will cite as an example a hymn in the syllabic meter, although much of hispoetry is in “arEQ.AZkın Zarâbın içmeyenMest olub hayrân olur muZincîr-i aZka düZmeyenSoyunub uryân olur muAkıt gözlerinden yaZıGör kimdir iZleyen iZiKul olur ise bir kiZiBu mülke sultân olur mu"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE378AZka ciXerin yakmayanMürZide doXru bakmayanBahr-i Muhît”e akmayanGöl iken ummân olur muGönül gel geçirme çaXınKo yansın yürekte yaXınGülleri bitmeyen baXınBülbülü nâlân olur muNakZî açıldı çün gözünHakk”ı görür oldu özünLâkin bilmem uZ bu sözünMünkire îmân olur mu{One who does not drink wine and become drunk: can he be amazed?One who does not suffer the chains of Love: can he strip and be naked?Let the tears flow from your eyes.

Hewas a khalCfa of laqcqc-Zade Osman Efendi, a khalCfa of Sayyid Saif Allah Efendi.In addition, he studied under Hüda’c, ‘Abd al-Arad Nerc and lusain Lamekanc.According to Ghaibc, who was a khalCfa of Ibrahcm Efendi and collected accounts ofhis legendary deeds and his sayings in a work entitled BC“atnAme or NuRbatnAme, he alsowas a khalCfa of oab oab Shah ‘Alc, a khalCfa of Armad Sarban. In addition to thepoems that he wrote in the “arEQ meter, he composed quite powerful works in the styleof Yenus Emre, but in slightly more artful and technical fashion.Yayan yerde ne gezersin gel âdeme ir bu demeHayvân gibi ne yelersin gel âdeme ir bu demeNüsha-i Vahdet âdemdir nefha-i kudret bu demdirÂdemden gayrı “ademdir gel âdeme ir bu demeÂyine-i Hak âdemdir gören görünen bu demdirHer nefes Ysm-i a“zam”dır gel âdeme ir bu deme***Bu ilmin beyânını bir kâmil insândan sorCânım cân haberini cân içinde cândan sorYarın ne olacaXın bugün bilmek istersenUykuya vardıXında gördüXün seyrândan sorYârin zülfü içinde ne baZlar oynadıXınErenler meydânında top ile çevgândan sorGeçen hod geçti gitti geleceXi neylersinHer nefesin neZ”esin bu demle bu ândan sorYbrâhim”in gönlünün gönkleXini bilmeXeCân ile tâlib isen gel “ArZ-ı Rahmân”dan sor"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE’S INFLUENCE ON TURKISH LITERATURE379{Walker, why do you walk on the ground?

We can conclude from this thatRızâ Tevfik confused Olanlar Shaikhi and the famous Oxlan Shaikh with each other.This poet Ibrahcm Efendi lived long after the reign of Süleyman, so he was not theone who was executed. Oxlan Shaikh Isma‘cl Ma‘sheqc, who was executed alongwith twelve of his murCds in front of the fountain at the Hippodrome on the authorityof Ibn Kemal’s fatwA, was the son of Pcr ‘Alc Efendi of Aksaray, a Bayramc shaikh. Hewas born in 914/1508 –9 and was killed in 935/1528 –9 (for details, see {Hâfiz HüseyinAyvansarayî,} LadCqat al-jawAmi“ {Istanbul, 1281/1864}, vol. 1, pp. 35, 253, vol. 2,p. 125 {English trans. Howard Crane as The Garden of the Mosques: Hafiz Hüseyinal-Ayvansarayî’s Guide to the Muslim Monuments of Ottoman Istanbul (Leiden, 2000)};La‘lczade, RisAla, pp. 27–9; the supplement to {Tashköprü-Zade’s} al-ShaqA”iq, vol. 1,p. 89; and Ghaibc, NuRbatnAme, the most important source on Olanlar Shaikhi).La‘lczade says that Oxlan Shaikh also composed a number of hymns.19 Ghaibc was the khalCfa of Olanlar Shaikhi. In addition to the NuRbatnAme and Kashfal-ghiUA ” {MS in Köprülü’s private library} he wrote a number of short treatises,poetry in the “arEQ meter, and many elegant and sincere hymns in the style of YenusEmre. Among the imitators of Yenus Emre, Ghaibc was a great poet superior evento his shaikh Ibrahcm Efendi. For some reason, Rızâ Tevfik, again in his work on thelurefcs, presents Ghaibc as a lurefc poet, but this claim is based on absolutely noevidence, only on hearsay. Ghaibc, who was absolutely faithful to the system of panthéismidéaliste {wujEdiyya-i khayAliyya}, was, exactly like Yenus Emre, a genuine nefc andespecially an esteemed poet. The following example can give us an idea of his art andhis personality:Tâc ma“rifet tâcıdır sanma gayri tâc olaTaklîd ile tok olan hakîkatte ac olaDüZe düZüp aldanma kendin hayrete salmaSenden özke ne vardır ta“bire muhtâc olaSana âlem görünen hakîkatte Allâh”tırAllâh birdir va”llâhi sanma ki birkaç olaBir aXaçtır bu âlem meyvesi olmuZ âdemMeyvedir maksûd olan sanma ki aXaç olaBu âdem meyvesinin çekirdeXi sözündürSözsüz bu âdem âlem bir ânda târâc olaBu sözlerin me”âli kiZi kendin bilmektirKendi kendin bilene hakîkat Mi“râc olaHak denilen özündür özündeki sözündürGaybî özin bilene rübûbiyyet tâc ola{The crown (or, dervish cap) is the crown of mystical knowledge: don’t thinkthere is any other.One who is replete with imitation is in truth hungry."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE’S INFLUENCE ON TURKISH LITERATURE381Don’t deceive yourself with dreams.

Indeed, even thelanguage of Ghaibc and Ibrahcm Efendi is more technical and their style is lesssincere. Yenus Emre’s mode of expression, both clear and allusive, can be seen onlyamong the Bektashc poets.21 See the various explanations that I have given of this matter in different places in thisbook. For more detailed information on these subjects, see my series of articlesentitled “Anadolu’da islâmiyet: {Türk istilâsından sonra Anadolu tarih-i dinîsine birnazar ve bu tarihin menbaları,” in Dârülfünûn Edebiyat Fakültesi Mecmuası, 2 (1922),281–311, 385 – 420, 457– 86; English trans. Gary Leiser as Islam in Anatolia after theTurkish Invasion (Salt Lake City, 1993).}22 A detailed account of this phenomenon and analysis of the various factors thatgave rise to it are outside our subject. The Abdals were also of this nature. This wasa major factor in both their influence and that of the Bektashcs on the popular masses.Because they flourished among the people, the Bektashc bAbAs knew their psychologybetter than anyone and, indeed, in many respects were no different from them,and thus had all the qualities necessary to spread Bektashc propaganda among thebroadest masses of the people. Detailed accounts of this subject will be found in my{forthcoming} work {never published. See his article “Bektaz” in YA.}23 The works of the Bektashc poets, which were long written in the “arEQ meter – begin-ning with {Muryc ‘l-Dcn’s} poem KhaQirnAme which I mentioned briefly above – arefor the most part faulty and defective, in short, they are very inept. That is the rule,with very rare exceptions. This fact is immediately obvious when looking throughanthologies {s. cönk} of poems belonging to Bektashcs. Also in these cönks are a numberof works by lurefc poets like Nescmc and Shc‘c poets like Fuqelc {d. 963/1556}, all ofwhich should not be included within the scope of Bektashc literature. It is beyond oursubject to go into detail here on Bektashc poets, the form and nature of Bektashcpoems,their ties to music, the musical value of such forms as dCwAn and qalandarC, and so forth.{For collections of Bektashc poetry, see Sadettin Nüzhet Ergun, BektaZi edebiyatı antolojisi(Istanbul, 1955 – 6) and Gölpınarlı, Türk tasavvuf Ziiri antolojisi (Istanbul, 1972).}24 According to the common tradition in all the biographies of the poets, Khaua’c wasthe pen name of the Safavid Shah Isma‘cl. One should not, however, conclude that all"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE382works attributed to Khaua’c belong to Shah Isma‘cl. Just as among our classical poetsseveral men may have the same pen name, so it is among these tekke poets. Because ofthe paucity of historical documents on the Bektashcs in particular, it is not possible toresolve such problems completely. I stated above that even the names Yasawc andYenus were used by all kinds of people – whose personalities are unknown – and Igave the reasons for this.25 There were a great many Qızılbash poets, beginning with Shah Isma‘cl, but it isvirtually impossible to do a thorough historical study of them. Nevertheless, becausewe have in our possession various works of several Qızılbash poets, we can definitelystate that this literature is no different from that of the Bektashcs.26 I mentioned that a large proportion of the Bektashc poets who wrote these kinds ofworks in the national meter and under the influence of Yenus Emre’s style werelurefcs. But the lurefcs had an important literature in the “arEQ meter even beforethis style was established. I hope to publish in the future a separate study on thisliterature which includes several important poets, beginning with Nescmc and Rafc‘c,the author of the BashAratnAme. For now suffice it to say that Bektashc literature adoptedthe “arEQ meter and that style of poetry from the lurefcs and Qalandarcs and thesyllabic meter and the style of Yenus Emre and Qayghusuz from the Abdals. Thelatter won much greater esteem and importance among the people and had greaterprestige in Bektashc poetry. Thus the products of Bektashc-lurefc literature that werein the “arEQ meter, while at first having greater esteem and importance, subsequentlylost pride of place. The fine poem of Qayghusuz Abdal given below is one thatbelongs wholly to the Abdals. It also passed to the Bektashcs, and, in fact, Bektashcpoetry was able to acquire its distinctive features via the influence of Abdals such asQayghusuz.Rûm Abdâllar(ı) gelür “AlC dost deyuHırka giyer abâ deyu post deyuHastalara gelür dermân isteyuSaXlar gelür Pîr”im Abdâl Mûsâ”yaHind”den bâzirgânlar gelür yayınurÂZık olan bu meydânda soyunurPiZer lokmaları aZlar toyunurToklar gelür Pîr”im Abdâl Mûsâ”yaIkrârıdır koç-yiXitin yularıFakîhleri çeksem gelmez ileriAk-pınar”ın yeZil güllü sularıÇaXlar gelür Pîr”im Abdâl Mûsâ”ya{The Abdals of Rem (Anatolia) come crying “‘Alc!

All of Bektashcliterature clearly shows the influence of Qayghusuz Abdal. Nothing resembling hisstyle, which is completely Turkish exactly like that of Yenus Emre, is found in Persianor Arabic literature.27 This feature derived directly from the influence of Qayghusuz. The resulting mixtureof beliefs of Bektashism, which were filtered through many different sources, naturallyperpetuated this influence among Bektashc poets. The poem given below is a lurefc-Bektashc composition that shows the unity of God, Murammad, ‘Alc, and Faql Allahlurefc. There are many like it.Gönlüme gözüme gelen surûruFazl Hak Muhammed “Alî”den bildimCemâline muZtâk gılmân ve hûrîFazl Hak Muhammed “Alî”den bildimTâlibine lutfet ey kerem kânıLebin kevseriyle gel kandır cânıAdâlet etmenin geldi zamânıFazl Hak Muhammed “Alî”den bildim{The joy that comes to my heart and my eyes I know is from Faql, God,Murammad, ‘Alc.The male and female denizens of paradise who long for Your beauty I knoware From Faql, God, Murammad, ‘Alc.Show favor to Your seeker, O mine of generosity. Come quench the soul withthe Kawthar (name of a river in Paradise) of your lips.The time has come to do justice. I know it from Faql, God, Murammad,‘Alc.}Likewise, the following passage taken from one of Khaua’c’s poems also has thismeaning and is clearly lurefc in nature:{erî“at yolunu Muhammed açtıTarîkat gülünü {âh “Alî seçdiBu dünyâdan yüzbin erenler geçtiAnlar ittifâkta Mehdî yoldadır{âh Hatâyı”m eydür sırrın duyurmaYde-gör niyâzı kazâya komaYalancı dünyâda hiç saXım demeMuhammed Fazlu”llâh Zimdi yoldadır{Murammad opened the path of the SharC“a. Shah ‘Alc selected the roseof the OarCqa.Myriads of saints have passed through this world: they are, by agreement, onthe path of the Mahdc.Shah Khaua’c says: Do not divulge your secret. Perform the supplication, donot postpone it.In this false world don’t say: “I am true.” Murammad and Faql Allah are nowon the way.}It is obvious that the notions of indwelling and union are continuously encountered inBektashc poetry.28 This nefes is an example of the most beautiful and sincere passages of Bektashcpoetry:Vardım kırklar meydânına gel beri hey cân dedilerYzzet ile selâm verdim geç otur hey cân dedilerKırklar yerinde durdular yerlerinden yer verdilerMeydâna sofra serdiler lokmaya sun cân dediler"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"YjNUS EMRE AND HIS INFLUENCE384Kırkların gönlü uludur mü”minler kalbin eridirGeliZin kanden beridir söyle be hey cân dedilerKalk semâ“da bile oyna silinsün pâk olsun aynaKırk yıl bir kazanda kayna dahi çeksin cân dedilerDüZme dünyâ kisvetine tâlib ol Hak Hazreti”neÂb-ı Kevser Zerbetine parmaXını ban dedilerGördüXünü gözün ile beyân etme sözün ileBir gececik bizim ile olasın mihmân dediler{âh Hatâyı”m nedir hâlin Hakk”a Zükret kaldır elinKese-gör gıybetten dilin olasın sultân dediler{I went to the field of the Forty.

Tell us, O soul!”“Get up and join us in the mystical dance (samA“). Let the mirror (of yourheart) be wiped clean.Boil in a cauldron for forty years and let your soul suffer,” they said.“Do not put on the garment of this world. Be one who seeks Divine Truth.Dip your finger in the sherbet of the stream of Kawthar,” they said.“What you see with your eyes do not utter with your lips.Be our guest for a single night,” they said.“Shah Khaua’c: what is your condition? Raise your hands and give thanks toGod.Keep your tongue from calumny and you will be the Sultan,” they said.}Poems of an ethical nature like this are also common among the Bektashcs. Theethical view of the Bektashcs is very important with respect to both its nature andsources.

Instead, selective works were incorporated in the index,sometimes by title and sometimes by author. In some cases this bibliographic informationwas incomplete, and in other cases it was combined with annotations. The bibliographygiven below includes all works cited in the text. We have retained those annotations thatmight still be of interest. All works cited by Orhon Köprülü or Fevziye Tansel in theirprefaces, or added to the text by Orhon Köprülü, are in brackets [ ]. All works added bythe translators are in braces {}. All Turkish works published before 1929 are in theArabic alphabet. English translations are given of the titles of all Turkish works publishedafter 1900, of all Russian works, and of one Qazaq work.

According to Köprülü, this abridgedwork, which is composed of 327 folios, on each page of which are twenty-three linesof about fourteen words each, is a general history of Islam. The author, who states thathe was a member of the “ulamA”, incurred the wrath of Selcm Giray b. Kaplan Giray,the Khan of Crimea, in 1157/1744 –5. He was banished first to the village of nafaQongrati, which was his farm, from there to his home in the small town of Qante, andfrom there to the fortress of Soghujaq. In the latter, he wrote his history during thereign of Sultan Marmed b. Mutuafa. This work, which includes bits of importantinformation on history and literature {in general}, is primarily a detailed account ofthe history of Crimea, and in this respect is without equal. Beginning on folio 294, theauthor describes Devlet Giray and in the course of this description mentions the warsin which he was engaged and the circumstances in which he was killed in battle(martyred).

He states that afterordering a copy of the original Dresden MS of Kitab-ı Dede Korkut, he had wanted topublish a corrected version of it together with one or two other sections of the OghuznAmethat he had obtained. Indeed, he had done the necessary preliminary work for this,writing a long introduction that included extensive historical information on the OghuzDestanı and a detailed bibliography.

He completed it on a Saturday in Rabc‘ al-awwal 1002/1593.It is a book composed of 324 large pages and is divided into two sections. One sectionof 221 pages is in Turkish. The other, some pages of which are missing, is in Persian.This work was written during the reign of Murad III {1574 –95} by a Yasawc Dervishnamed lazcnc. Both sections are on the same subject. This work describes the legen-dary deeds of Armad Yasawc, the rules of etiquette of his UarCqa, and then of his nefcpath {suluk}. The first part of the Persian section is written completely in verse. Accord-ing to what Köprülü gleaned from this work, lazcnc was in fact a Turkistanc Turk.He lived at a time when the nefc movement was at the height of its strength in CentralAsia and he was overcome with mystical ecstasy when only twelve years old. Shortlythereafter he met Sayyid Manter Qashıq-tırâsh and studied under him. He read thelegendary deeds of the nefc saints and learned the rules of the nefc path. Finally, whenhe was nineteen years old, he received permission from his shaikh to don the tAj{dervish headgear}, kemer {girdle}, and khirqa {dervish patched cloak} and to write thelegends of the saints. In the Persian section, there are many legends and stories aboutthis Sayyid Manter al-Balkhc, then {thumma} al-litarc and al-Bukharc {i.e. he hadresided in each of these places}, who, indirectly, had been a murCd of Shaikh SüleymanGhaznawc. lazcnc lived in various places in Transoxiana but then, for some reason,decided to leave. In the reign of Selim II, he went to Istanbul and settled there. Awareof the esteem and respect given to the nefcs during the reign of Murad III, lazcncwrote this book in order to present it to the sultan. Köprülü did not find himmentioned in any source from that period. According to Köprülü, lazcnc also statesthat the title of the book, JawAhir al-abrAr min amwAj al-biRAr, points to the date of writingit (i.e. constitutes a chronogram). In any case, this work is an extremely importantsource for our subject.
