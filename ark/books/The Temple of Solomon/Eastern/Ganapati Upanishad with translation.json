Yet if the images, the yantras and the original tËntrik texts,such as they are, remain, it is not too hard to tease from these the truthswhich lie beyond the popular.In present-day Hinduism GaÙeÚa has degenerated into a god stoppingobstacles, and his image can often be seen in shops. The shopkeepersworship him for the success of their trade.If we look at a contemporary image of GaÙeÚa, the iconography haspreserved much of the esoteric side, although the exoteric side hastriumphed. We see a strange composite of elephant and man, and at thebottom of the picture a mouse or rat.The image represents the three worlds ---- of heaven, earth and theunderworld, or sun, moon and fire. And in a very clever and wise waythe symbolism has been drawn from the animal or mammal kingdom. Inthis picture mankind is the mean between the large universe and the smalluniverse.Because of this triple symbolism GaÙeÚa is connected with the three guÙas.His association with obstacles comes from the great strength of theelephant, the intelligence of the human and the subtelty or ability topenetrate small spaces like a mouse or rat. GaÙeÚa is usually shown with four arms ---- these represent the fourdirections of space or the four elements ---- the god being the spirit orquintessence of these.The word GaÙeÚa means lord of hosts. As usual in the tËntrik symbolismthe name is really an adjective and this adjective is also applied to Éiva.The hosts are the hosts of spirits or denizens of the three worlds. Although GaÙeÚa is usually thought of as the son of Éiva and Parvati, the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"more cosmic view is that he is, simply, a specialised aspect or symbol ofthe primordial god. Because we follow nature, it is entirely natural thatprimordial godhead is represented by the penis, while the goddess is shownby the yoni. The ancients found it natural to conceive of the sexual unionof a woman and man as analogous to the creation of the cosmos.There formerly existed an esoteric group of GaÙeÚa worshippers whoworshipped the GaÙeÚa liÔga and his Éakti’s yoni as creators of ourcosmos. This cult was one of the five primary tËntrik traditions but appearsto have disappeared around the 14th century.Contemporary images of the elephant-headed god invariably show himclothed. But Formerly this was not the case. We can note the followingprescriptions for images drawn from a medieval tËntrik work:----GaÙeÚa is of vermilion colour, naked, and has three eyes with a largebelly. In his four hands he holds a tusk, a noose, a goad and grants boons.He holds in his trunk a pomegranate and a crescent moon is on hisforehead. He is adorned with huge serpents. His forehead is gleamingwith the ichor of rut while on his left thigh sits his Éakti. She embraceshim with one arm while with her other she holds his penis. The symbolism relating GaÙeÚa as being a child of Éiva and PËrvatÌ alsohas meaning. Their other son is Skanda or KËrtikeya. He rides a peacock.If we take Éiva as guru, his sons, one with him in spiritual lineage, arethe divine and the heroic dispositions of the tËntrik traditions. GaÙeÚa andSkanda are princes and Éiva is the king."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"GaÙapati UpanisadAuspiciousness to those who hear ---- thus the ÉËnti.1. OÑ GaÑ1 I bow to GaÙapati.2.
