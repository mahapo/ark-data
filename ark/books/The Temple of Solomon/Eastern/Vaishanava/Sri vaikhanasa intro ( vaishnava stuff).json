There are also university departments of Sanskrit and Eastern Religions in Europe (Norway, Austria, France and Germany) that have scholars doing research on these two Agmaams. Swamy NammAzhwAr has instructed us to serve the Lord through blemishless Kaimkaryams all our lives as His archakAs (Ozhivil kAlamellAm udanAi manni vazhuvilA adimai seyya vENDum).

Agamams speak with the same voice, when they say that the devout Archanam of VishNu is the easiest way for us to gain the Lord's anugraham.

Sage Vikhanasar stands out among the creators of gruhya sUtrams in that he has included AarAdhanam for ArchA Moorthys and the construction of Temples and the consecration of Archa Moorthys at these temples in his kalpa sUtrams. A famous VaikhAnasa scholar states it is for these reasons that the Thirunakshatram of Sage Vikhanasar is being celebrated by the VaikhAnasa community of archakAs. There is no celebration of other gruhya sUtra kartAs such as Sage Aapastambhar, who blessed Yajur Vedins with their kalpa sutras. VAIKHANASAM Amongst the Indian Communities of Priests, committed to the promotion of temple-culture, the Vaikhanasas occupy a significant position. The oldest of such priestly communities, they even to this day largely function as temple priests. They find mention in Vedic corpus, the epics (Mahabharatha and Ramayana), the puranas (like Bhagavatham) and the Smriti literature. They are described as ascetics, hermits, devoted to contemplation on Godhead, and engaged in Vedic sacrificial rituals. They were sages closely associated with the celebrated Valakhilyas of Rigvedam, and dear to Indra (Vishnu). So we read in Tandya-maha-brahmana (14.4.7) vaikhAnasA vA rushayA indrasya priyA Asan|| They had their scriptural lore, named after their own designation, rooted in the Vedic corpus, containing the essence of Vedic wisdom, and given entirely to the worship of Vishnu as the supreme spirit of the Vedic canon.

It may be noted that this scriptural lore aligned itself firmly and uncompromisingly to the Vedic wisdom (more specifically to the Aukheya-Taittiriya branch of Krishna-yajurveda) and was therefore described as 'vaidika' in contradistinction to the other approaches which incorporated the tantrika or folk practices. Even now, the Vaikhanasa priests, at home and in the temple, insist on first performing the fire-ritual prescribed in the Vedas, and then worshipping Vishnu, as the supreme spirit: tasmAdagnau nityahOmAnthE vishnurnithyArchA gruhe dEvAyatane bhaktyA bhagavantam nArAyanamarchayEditi vignAyate| This is prescribed by the Vaikhanasa-srauta-sutra. In fact, the Vaikhanasa is the only group among temple-priests to have a kalpa-sutra of their own. They translate in to practice the Vedic dictum that Agni is the lowest of the gods (in the sense being visible to the human eye) and Vishnu, the highest and that therefore the worship of these two effectively means the coverage of the worship of all the gods in whom the Lord is the indweller (Sarva dEva NamaskAram Kesavam pratigacchathy): agnirvai dEvAnAmave vishnu: paramastadantarEna sarvai anya dEvathA: iti brAhmanam| vishnO: nitya dEvArchA sarvadEvArchAbhavathi| The worship of the Godhead assumes two forms: aniconic (amurta) and iconic (samurta).

Agni and Vishnu thus constitute the two conceptual limits or"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 6 sadagopan.org polarities of the Godhead. The worship thus consists of: 1. fire ritual (homa), 2. iconic worship (archana), 3. recitation of sacred mantras (japa) and 4. contemplation on the abstract significance of the iconic form (dhyana).

Further, the worship of Agni (homa-puja) which is the focus of attention in the Vedic corpus has been faithfully translated into the worship of Vishnu in the iconic form (bera-puja). In the context of the three-fold sacrificial fire (trEtAgnipaksha): the primary immobile image (dhruva-bera) in the sanctum of a temple represents the gArhapatya-agni, Dhruva beram of SrI SrInivAsa PerumAL (Tirupathi) the image for routine worship (kautuka-bera) represents Ahavaniya-agni, and"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 8 sadagopan.org the processional image (autsava-bera) the dakshinagni.

Thus the Vedic sacrificial ritual (srautagni) corresponds in spirit to the Vaikhanasa worship of the image of Vishnu in the temple (bera-puja), three times during day (savana). In the Vaikhanasa shrine, the important concepts in a Vedic sacrifice (yagna) are to be found (dIksha, adhvaryU, ritvik, hautra-prasamsa, havis, pUrnAhuti, avabhrita, trishavana, prAyaschitta and so on). The"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 9 sadagopan.org worship sequences strictly follow the Vedic prescriptions and Veda mantras are recited in every sequence exclusively. Like a Vedic sacrifice, worship in a Vaikhanasa shrine is designed to secure the good of all living creatures and is based on Veda (vishnOrAradhanam sarvabhUthahitArdAya shAbdam pramAnamavalambya). Hence worship here is termed 'dEva-yajana' in Marichi's definitive treatise of Vimanarchana Kalpam and the worship is meant to secure the welfare of the state (rAshtra), the administrators (rAja) and the entire cadre of devout chieftains of administration (yajamAna). Marichi's words are: ata dEvayajanam vyAkhyAsyAma:| grihOtrEna labhatE svargamityAhu:| sangati dEvapujAnAm yagnA iti surayO vadanti| yagnEshvEtEshu dEvayAgO vishishyatE| yajamAna bhavepi bhuvi shashvatam tishtati| tasmAdragnO rAshtrasya yajamAnavamsasyAbhivruddi:|| This is in fact the special, and also essential, feature of the Vaikhanasa mode of worship.

'vaidika' (worship through fire-rituals like agnishtOmA prescribed in the Vedic corpus), 2. tAntrika (worship with flower offerings and folk practices) and 3. misra (a combination of the two kinds mentioned above), the first form of worship is clearly Vaikhanasa.

Viswanantha chakravarthi (parArtha-darsini) mentions specifically that Vaidika mode of worship employs only Veda mantras (like purusha-suktha) during worship. And this is precisely what is done in the Vaikhanasa-worship. Mahabharatha (Anu-gita, Asvamedhika-parvan 122,26) also refers to the Vaikhanasa mode of worship as prevalent in those times: vEdOtkEnaiva mArgEna sarvabhUthahridistitham mAmarchayanthi| yE viprA matsAyujyam vrajanti te|| An ancient smriti text Vridda-hArIta-samhitha (chapter 11) mentions not only three systems of worship: 1. srauta (based on veda), 2. smarta (based on smriti texts, secondary to the Vedas) and 3. agama (based on agama texts, later in date), but identifies the first with the Vaikhanasas. It was the Vaikhanasas who transformed the Vedic yajna ideology (amUrtarchana) into iconic worship in the temples (samUrtarchana). Worship thereafter became three-fold: mental (mAnasi, including japa, dhyana, nama-sankirtana), fire-ritual (homa) and worship of idols treated like a sovereign or honored guest (bera): mAnasI hOmapUjA cha bErapUjEti sA tridhA|| Marichi significantly states that the proper method of worship assumes four modes (charita kriya jnana yogEshu chaturshi pUjAmArgEshu): 1. correct conduct indicated by the smriti and Kalpa texts (charita),"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 11 sadagopan.org 2. performance of Vedic rituals and iconic worship (kriya), 3. development of transcendental wisdom (jnana) and 4. practice of yoga. The first of these modes (Sruti based/Srouta) provides justification for the presence and prevalence of an elaborate Vaikhanasa-Kalpasutra in four parts smarta (for grihya), dharma and srauta (including pravara-prasna). This augments the equally elaborate Vaikhanasa-bhagavachchastra, which deals with temple-culture exclusively and exhaustively. The VaikhAnasa literature comprises texts amounting to four lakhs of grantha in a total of 128 books, ascribed to four sages: 1. Bhrighu, 2. Atri, 3. Marichi and 4. Kasyapa, who were all inspired by the primeval sage Vikhanasa. This represents Vaishnava-agama in an avowedly Vedic context. It deals with the construction of temples, making of icons, installations, consecrations, daily worship in the temple, occasional festivities (utsavam), and necessary purifications and equations for the lapses (prAyaschittam). Worship in a Vaikhanasa shrine presupposes the adoption of the Vaikhanasa-Kalpasutra supplemented by the Agama texts (known collectively as Daivika-sutra). In a very large number of Vishnu temples in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, this mode of worship continues uninterrupted for great stretches of time.

The concept of co-operation between devotion and worship (upasana or yajna) is highlighted in the Vaikhanasa philosophy. This is also the Vedic outlook: yajna as a means for the fulfillment of human aspirations combines devotion with ritualistic activity. Worship-activities (kriya-yoga, upasana, yajana) are in fact superior to devotion which one feels immediately and as a passing mood; they gradually render one eligible to the highest of benefits, namely liberation from worldly ills. It is only gradually that one attending on the Supreme Spirit in the iconic form (saguna-brahma) reaches or knows the supreme spirit beyond names and forms (nirguna-brahma) and obtains emancipation. It is a ladder like path (sopana-mArga). Iconic worship is an important and indispensible ingredient in this path. This makes the movement of the devotees firm and progressive. The word 'Vaikhanasa' etymologically signifies digging deep in to the Godhead (by earnest contemplation assisted by worship) that is enshrined in one's ownself (vishEshEna khanati| khanitvA chAtmAnAtmAnam| khananashabdEna dhyAnamuktam bhavati| dhyana mAvishya yOgEna|). Iconic worship done according to the prescriptions laid down in the Vaikhanasa texts is itself an act of digging (khanana) into the Supreme Spirit in one's own being. Hence the significance of 'atma-suktha' in Vaikhanasa worship. It is true that the highest form of worship is mental (manasa). The supreme spirit really dwells in the heart of the devotee and must be reached by mental processes. Direct cognizance of the presence and power of Godhead is worship proper. But knowledge and devotion do not render iconic worship superfluous or unnecessary. For the formless Godhead in the heart needs to be visualized in an iconic form for being worshipped.

Albeit devoid of form, the Godhead assumes a form (becomes sakala) for facilitating worship. If HE is in the mind, HE is only thought of. And thoughts being what they are cannot be expected to result in proper worship. The activities involved in worship are in reality approaches to the Godhead; hence they are called kriya-yoga. The activities are accompanied by appropriate Vedic mantras recited, and by having an idol properly installed for offering worship. There is also contemplation and further a feeling of devotion. Thus the Vaikhanasa worship is a pentad (panchaka) of recitation of Vedic mantras, activities like in a yajna, utilization of proper and consecrated substances like the idol, contemplation and devotion. Marichi (Ananda-Samhitha) says that this is the proper approach to Godhead in the present age. In the first of the aeons, Krita-yuga, God was worshipped only in the mind; in the next age, Treta, sacrifices were the proper approach; in Dvapara age idol worship was commended and in the present Kali age, contemplation is the best approach.

(It may be noted in the passing that there is a mantra in Rigveda (10.155.1) which can be considered as a reference to this hill.

They had no clue. Sriman NarAyaNa through viSEsha khananam (digging) created a new sage, named him VikhAnasar and empowered him to perform ArAdhanams for Him in His Vibhava and archAvatArams thru upadEsams on Veda, VedAntams and initiation into Gayatri/Saavitri mantrams.

When Vishnu at the beginning of the Kalpa was absorbed in meditational slumber (yoga-nidra) upon the milky ocean, Brahma appeared, in the lotus, which sprang forth from Vishnu's navel. Brahma, four faced, contemplated upon Vishnu as soon as he appeared, whereupon Vishnu directed him to create all the worlds and all the creatures in them, and gave him the Veda mantrAs to help him in the creation. Brahma created all things, all beings and all the gods, and worshipped Vishnu with the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 23 sadagopan.org Vedic hymns. However, he became proud of his ability to create and became arrogant. Vishnu, in order to correct him, brought forth, two demons, Madhu and Kaitabha, who assaulted Brahma and snatched from him the VedAs, which they hid in the depths of the ocean. Brahma with his power (Vedic Corpus) gone, became grief-stricken, and wondered how he should worship Vishnu now that the Vedic hymns were no longer available to him. Vishnu advised him to worship him for five days with the repetition of the twelve-lettered and eight-lettered mantras - dvAdasAksharam and ashtAksharam. This became what is known as the Pancha-rathra method of worship. Then Vishnu decided to fight, and diving deep into the ocean killed the demons Madhu and Kaitabha. He brought the Vedas up and gave them to Brahma, who was overjoyed and began worshipping Vishnu again with the Vedic hymns (viz., in the Vaikhanasa way).

Distraught, Brahma again approached Vishnu and asked him how he should be worshipped, now the Vedas having again gone out of his possession. Vishnu advised him to worship without any mantras and in accordance with the Tantrik procedure. This is known as the Agneya mode of worship. Vishnu assumed the form of a great fish (Matsya), and killed the demon Somakasura with his great power. He brought back the Vedas and gave them to Brahma. Brahma was happy and he began again worshipping Vishnu with the Vedic hymns. Thus the Vaikhanasa mode of worship came to stay. Matsya Avatar The Vaikhanasas, tracing as they do their descent from Vishnu himself, regard themselves as Vishnu-devotees from their very birth (garbha-vaishnava-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 25 sadagopan.org janmanam), not needing any other initiatory rites or diksha during their lives to make them Vishnu-devotees. The sacramental rites that are prevalent in a Vaikhanasa household include a symbolic ceremony, unique to this community, known as Vishnu-Bali (or garbha-chakra-samskaram). Prescribed to be performed during the bright half of the eighth month of pregnancy (garbhadhadyashtame masyeva sukla pakshe) in order to protect the individual within the womb of the prospective mother (asyah garbha-samrakshanartham). Vishnu-bali Vishnu-bali is a sacrament which follows 'seemantha' (the ritual before child birth). The significance of this ritual is that an offering (Bali) is made to Vishnu (Vishnu-devatako balih upahriyate asmin); and even inside the mother's womb, the foetus acquires the status of a Vishnu-devotee (garbhastha sisoh garbha vaishnavatva siddhyartham). The ceremony involves a fire-ritual and offering to the pregnant lady, the sacrificial sweet rice-pudding (pAyasa) in which the emblems of Vishnu (Chakra and Sankha) has previously been dipped and a part offered to the fire.

Thus the person is a Vaishnava, even when he is born, and he is regarded as the offspring of Vishnu viz., Vaikhanasa. The practical import of this ceremony is that the child born as a Vaikhansa is already sanctified and initiated by Vishnu himself and does not need any other sacrament or initiatory rite to make him a Vishnu-devotee or a qualified priest. He acquires the right to be a priest by his very birth. This is in contradistinction to the priests of other communities (as for eg. The Pancharathrins), for whom during the boyhood a formal ceremony of branding the arms with heated metallic images of Vishnu's conch and discus (tapta-mudrankana or samAsrayanam) is conducted. A Vaikhanasa not only does not require this external imprint ceremony, but is prohibited from going through it at any cost. If he does this ritual, due to ignorance or out of greed, under duress or force, he ceases to be a priest and must undergo prayaschittam rites. Without the prayaschittam he is not eligible to touch the Dhruva-bera in the temple. VAIKHANASA IDEOLOGY The characteristic Vaikhanasa viewpoint is that the pathway to final emancipation is not devotion alone, but iconic worship (samUrtArchana) done with devotion (bhakti). It does not equate 'bhakti' with 'upasana', but points out that 'upasana', which is synonymous with 'yajana' (worship as a sacrifice), signifies a different, and in fact a superior approach. Worship (Bhagavat-samUrta-yajana) is held to be more effective than even the wisdom concerning Brahman (brahma-vidya) as shown by Srinivasa-makhin in his excellent work"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 27 sadagopan.org 'Uttama-Brahma-Vidya-saaram'. The Tamil songs of the Alvars indirectly suggest the superior merit of iconic worship in temples. The Vaikhanasas may thus be credited with having institutionalized the iconic worship (samUrtArchana) of Vishnu, who was essentially a Vedic god. It is not surprising, therefore, that in the Vishnu temples in ancient shrines like Tirumala, Tirupati, Mahabalipuram, Srikakulam, Amaravati, Vedadri, Dharmavaram, Chola-simhapuram, Vijayanagaram, Tirucchirapalli, Ramanathapuram, Pithapuram, Kakinada, Vinukonda, Khadri, Uttaramerur, Tanjavur, Tirukkurungudi, Madurai, Darbhasayanam, Kondavidu, Nellore, Tirumazhisai, Senji, Vellore, Venkatagiri and Karveti nagaram (Puttur,AP), the worship is done according to Vaikhanasa Bhagavat Sastram. The Vaikhanasas carry on their worship entirely with Vedic Mantras and are also strict with their adherence to the Vedic sacraments as ordained by the Taittiriya Brahmana texts (from Krishna Yajurveda). The belief that Vikhanasa Maharshi not only taught the Kalpa-sutra, which deals with householder's religious duties and responsibilities, but also taught the Daivika-sutram, which deals with iconic worship, and which was amplified by his four disciples Atri, Bhrigu, Marichi and Kasyapa refers to the equal importance that the Vaikhanasas give to the Vedic sacraments and rituals on the one hand, and worship of idols in home and temple on the other. In their view, the two are complimentary to each other. This was not the view of Saiva or of the Panacharatra sects. They recognized that the Agama approach was at variance with VedAs. The VaikhAnasa Agama was meant exclusively for temple-worship and addressed the need of the times when Vedic culture was fast becoming obsolete. The very expression 'Agama' seems to have been named to distinguish this approach from 'Nigama' (which was the term for the Veda). It is to be noted that the Vaikhanasa texts do not generally adapt the expression 'Agama', although in more recent years the term 'Vaikhanasagama' is being used to distinguish it from Saivagama, Pacharatragama and Sakteyagama. The Vaikhanasa know their scripture only as 'Bhavagachhastra'; their implicit acceptance of Vedic authority was well known even to the ancient smriti-karas"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 28 sadagopan.org like Baudhayana, idol worship was not for them a substitute for the Vedic ritual, but was itself in their view, a Vedic ritual.

Yajna purusha The distinction between the two groups of Vaikhanasas, the fire-ritualists and the idol-worshippers, made by Srinivasa-Deekshita probably refers to the evolution of the Vaikhanasa community from the Kalpa-sutra stage to the 'Bhagavachhastra' stage.

But superior to all these is worshipping an idol form (archanam), because it involves special devotion (bhakti) in addition to the offerings (as in huta), repetitions (as in japa) and meditation (as in dhyana). It is also better suited to the common folks. That's why the Vaikhanasa moved from the first stage (Veda) to the second (Vedanta) of Vedic culture. They continue to perform Vedic rituals (prescribed in the Smarta section rather than in the Srauta), but valued idol worship more. Their scene of activity shifted from sacrificial hall (yagasala) to the temple. SRI VAIKHANASA KALPASUTRAM The Kalpa sutrams consist of 32 chapters. Among them are 7 gruhya sutrams, 3 dharma sutrams, 21 Sroutha sutrams and 1 Pravara sutram. The worship of Vishnu was tantamount to the performance of a great Vedic sacrifice.

Pravara and 4. Dharma, with the Sulba-sutra prescriptions accommodated in the first two divisions. It is directly preached by Sri Vikhanasa Maharshi as Sri Vaikhanasa Kalpa sutram with 4 parts and 32 prasnas. Srouta Sutram The first division Srouta Sutra begins with the settling up of the ritual fire (agnyadhana) and goes on till the ritual known as Soma samstha. It includes rituals like daily (nitya) and occasional (naimittika) and also prayaschittas for these. In all it contains 21 rites and expiations for: Sapta Havir Yagnas, Sapta Soma Yagnas and Sapta Paka Yagnas. However they are not valued high as it is motivated by selfish desires.

The texts also deal with the installation and worship of the icons at home (Griharcha-bimba-pratishta, archana) and other details pertaining to religious observances (like seven-fold Paaka yagnas). These are regarded as the divine sacraments (daivika) in contradistinction to the eighteen samskaras which are meant only to provide the twice-born status to the individual (brahmana).

The books also admit that Narayana and Vasudeva are expressions which are synonyms with Vishnu, but prefer to retain the expression Vishnu, as it is the only expression recognized in the Vedic corpus. Consider this for instance, 'Agni' and 'Vahni' both mean the fire-god, but when the offering in fire is made, the proper announcement would be 'Agnaye Svaha' and not 'Vahnaye Svaha'. According to Vaikhanasas, worship of gods is of two kinds: iconic (sa-mUrta) and aniconic (amUrta). The latter consists of oblations in fire, while the former is the worship offered to Vishnu in an idol installed at home or temple. The two according to Atri Maharshi, have marked correspondences. The setting up of the fire (Agnyadhana) is like unto the installation/consecration of the idol (Pratishta); and the several sequences in the sacrifice are like the sequences in the idol worship.

(Vriddha-Haritha-Samhitha). Although the Vaikhansas texts align themselves against the Tantrik tradition, there is atleast one particular detail of worship which they share in common with the latter, and that is the assumed identification of the devotee with the deity during worship. The Tantrik position rejects as impossible the communion of the human with the divine, unless the worshipper identifies himself with the worshipped. The worshipper is said to pass through three phases: he regards himself as wholly belonging to the deity, without however a direct encounter with the deity ('tasyaivAham'); then, an encounter does occur and the devotee can confide with the deity: 'I am thine' ('tavevAham'); and finally the culmination of the encounter results in the feeling that the worshipper himself is the deity. And thus the deity does not exist apart from him ('tvamevAham'). In the Vaikhanasa texts, it is prescribed for purposes of invocation (AvAhana) that after the worship of the enclosure-deities (Avarana-pUja) and the worship of the door-guardians (dvAra-pAla-pUja), the priest should station himself in"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 37 sadagopan.org front of the idol (behind the screen), and reciting the 'Atma-sUktham', should enter into a state of meditative absorption, when he will become in fact Vishnu himself.

Derived from this facility with which the priest can identify himself with the Deity during a worship sequence is the notion that the priest has an enduring divine presence within him. We read, for instance, in Bhrigu's Kriyadhikara that Vishnu has two forms: the Idol and the Priest. The idol acquires divinity after invocation (AvAhana), while divinity abides always in the priest.

This is the second stride. And the third stride is represented when the 'autsava-beram' is taken out in procession (utsava) along the corridors of the temple-enclosures or on the streets of the township.

The individual soul (jIva), when it frees itself from phenomenal fetters, enters into the sphere of Vishnu (known as 'VaishnavAnDa') in four successive stages, each stage being designated a plane of Vishnu-experience (Vishnu-loka). 1. The lowest of the stages is 'AmOda', where the presiding aspect of Godhead is called Vishnu; and the individual soul experiences the pleasure of residing with Godhead in the same plane (sAlOkya). 2. The next stage is 'pramOda', where Maha-Vishnu presides; and the individual soul experiences the great delight of residing in close proximity with the Godhead (sAmIpya). 3. The stage higher than this is 'sammOda', where the presiding aspect is Sadaa-Vishnu, and where the individual soul experiences the joy of obtaining the same form (roopam) as that of the Godhead (sArUpya). 4. The highest stage is 'Vaikunta-lOka', where 'vyApi-nArAyaNa' presides, and where the individual soul experiences the union with the Godhead (sAyujya). The four aspects of Vishnu with reference to these four planes of 'Vishnu's sphere' are designated as Purusha, Satya, Achyuta and Aniruddha respectively. These are distinguished by their dominant and divine traits which these aspects reveal in each plane and which the individual soul shares: 1. virtue (dharma) in the first, 2. wisdom (jnana) in the second, 3. sovereignty (aiswarya) in the third, and 4. dispassion (vairagya) in the fourth.

In temple worship of the Vaikhanasa system, the four aspects of Vishnu are visualized as four forms located around Vishnu in the immediate enclosure ('prAgAdi chatur-dikshu'): 1.

He has goddess Sri on his right side and the goddess Bhu on his left. All the other aspects are four-armed and carry conch and discus. 2.

Aniruddha is to the north of Vishnu, and He faces the northern direction. His body-color is like that of coral, and He is seated upon the coils of a serpent with five, seven or nine hoods. His consorts are called Pramodayini and Mahi. The four forms correspond to the four iconic variants of the main images in the sanctum (dhruva-bimba) which represents Vishnu. Purusha is symbolized by the kautuka-idol, Satya by the autsava idol, Achyuta by the snapana idol and Aniruddha by the bali idol. During actual worship, however, Aniruddha is omitted, and the dhruva, kautuka, autsava, and snapana images are taken to represent Vishnu, Purusha, Satya and Achyuta respectively. The aspect of Aniruddha is imagined to be present in the bali-altar (maha bali peetham), in the sacrificial fire-pot (Nityagni-kunda), in the temple (vimana) and in the priest (Archaka). In spite of the conception of Vishnu as having aspects (murti) and idol forms (bera), as accompanied by consorts (devis) and as surrounded by a retinue of gods (parivara), the Vaikhanasa outlook is in the real sense idealistic.

To Vikhanas, Vishnu taught at the very beginning of creation the doctrine subsequently celebrated as 'Vaikhanasa Kalpa-Sutram', which comprehends all the Vedas and contains the secret teaching of the Vedic lore. And Vikhanasa Maharshi in his turn briefly communicated this doctrine to the four sages (Bhrigu and others). What Vikhanasa Maharshi taught was in extent of one and a half crores of granthas (a grantha being thirty-two letters of a verse in anushtubh metre). The four sages in their turn prepared their own treatises, known as: 1. 'Adhikaras' by Bhrigu, 2. 'Samhithas' by Marichi, 3. 'Tantras' by Atri and 4. 'Kaandaas' by Kasyapa, altogether extending to four lakh granthas. No doubt the Vaikhanasa Kapla Sutram is an ancient one, and what is more important, it is comprehensive, dealing as it does with all respects of 'Kalpa' (Srauta, Smarta or Grihya, Dharma and Sulba). By common consent, this text is held to be the source for all the later Vaikhanasa texts and manuals. The texts ascribed to the four sages who were disciples of Vikhanasa Maharshi have unfortunately not survived in their entirety. There are some prose and poetical works in the names of Marichi and Bhrigu, which are popularly studied and frequently printed (like Marichi's Vimanarchana Kalpam and Bhrigu's Kriyadhikara and Prakirnadhikara), while most of the other texts are known only through citations and extracts from them by later commentators and glossators like Nrisimha-Vajapeya-Yajin and Srinivasa-Dikshitulu."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 51 sadagopan.org There is truth in the traditional view that the Kalpa-sutras of Vikhanasa Maharshi provided not only inspiration but also material for the later Vaikhanasa writings. A distinction is thus drawn between the Sutra (by Vikhanas) and the Sastra (by his disciples). mUlamasyApi SAstrasya sArthakOtipramANata: | upAdiSatsa bhagavAn asmabhyam naimishE vane || iti samkshEpata: prOktam mahatvam sUtraSAstrayE: |    (Prakirnadhikara, 30, 93-34) A Kalpa Sutra is different in its orientation and approach from the Agama texts, and when the Vaikhanasa Bhagavachhastram was constituted, it had to contain the details which the Kalpa Sutra did not contain, or elaborate the details which were only suggested in the Kalpa Sutra. The requirements of Bhagavachhastram appear to have necessitated the composition of Sastra-texts by the four sages, Bhrigu and others, in addition to the Kalpa Sutra by their master, Vikhanasa Maharshi. For instance, the entire Vaikhanasa literature of the post-kalpa-sutra period may be said to have stemmed out of a statement in the Sutra-text of Vikhanasa Maharshi: tam yagnapurusham dhyAyan purushasUktEna samstUya praNAmam kuryasyagnEshu vihInam tatsampUrNam bhavatIti Sruti: | dvijAtiratindritO nityam gruhE dEvAyatanE vA bhaktyA bhagavantam nArAyaNam archayEttadvishNO: paramam padam gachhatIti vignAyatE ||   (Sri Vaikhanasa Grihya Sutram, 4, 12, 8-11) One who does not perform the great sacrifices would compensate for this omission, according to scriptural authority, by contemplating upon Vishnu, who is the very personification of the great sacrifices, eulogizing him with hymns like Purusha-Sukta, and by worshipping him.

Then the lowest and the highest limits of divinity are comprehended, and the commentator points out that this worship would serve as a ritual of expiation (sarva-prAyaschittArtham) and as conducive to the welfare here and hereafter (aIhikAmushmika-phala-siddhyartham). This would make the performance of great sacrifices (prescribed and elaborated in Srauta Sutras) unnecessary and redundant. This highlights the role of idol worship as a substitute for the performance of sacrifices, and justifies the emergence of Bhagavachhastram out of the main body of the Kalpa Sutram, which was fast becoming irrelevant and impracticable. The pressures that occasioned the rise of the Bhagavachhastram may now be broadly be indicated. The environment in which the Kalpa-Sutra complex was prepared was when sacrifices (mostly from Yajurveda) and rituals (mostly from the Brahmana texts) were prevalent. The dharma-sutra section which was an adjunct to the Srauta and Grihya sections of the Kalpa Sutra recognized the division of the society into 'twice-born' groups (dvi-jati) and groups which did not undergo the sacraments of the 'second birth'. Sacrifices and rituals were relevant only to the 'twice-born' groups and naturally the Srauta and Grihya sections of kalpa-sutra had meaning and applicability only to these groups. But the age of the great Vedic sacrifices was fast fading, and the relevance of the Srauta-section of the kalpa-sutra was becoming obsolete. The Vedic culture of sacrifices had to fight for its survival; and greater reliance came to be placed on the derived texts known as smritis than on the revealed Vedic corpus (sruti). Naturally, the Grihya section (which became known as 'Smarta', \"based on smriti books\") of the kalpa-sutra assumed greater importance. It is revealing that among the twenty or so kalpa-sutras that have come down to us (most of them, however, in an unsatisfactory condition), more than half do not contain the Srauta section at all; if they did contain once, the section has disappeared subsequently. And none of the extant kalpasutras, excepting two (Katyaayana and Bodhayana), bother about the Sulba-sutra section, which"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 54 sadagopan.org principally deals with sacrificial altars (vedi, chiti), their measurements, and the implements and vessels used in the sacrifices (yajnayudha). Barring five of the kalpa-sutras we are acquainted with, all others have the Grihya section, rather elaborately. The concept of sacrifice (yajna or yAga) was redefined as giving up ones wealth in the name of deity ('devatam uddisya dravya tyAgAh yAgAh'). And in the place of the great sacrifices of olden days (like agrayana, AsvamEdha, vAjapEya, sOma and so on), the Grihya sutras prescribed a group of \"five great sacrifices\" (pancha-mahA-yagnAs), which every twice-born householder was to undertake. The five 'great sacrifices' in the names of gods (dEva), ancestral spirits (pitru), animals and birds (bhUta), fellow human beings (manushya) and the Veda (brahma), were not all of them really sacrifices in the sense of Vedic sacrifices, but only some aspects of daily conduct where the idea of 'giving up ones possessions' figures prominently and which took ritualistic forms: 1. The 'dEva-yajna' is defined as offering faggots (samiths) to the fire-god. In the earlier great sacrifices, several articles and eatables (purOdasha etc) were poured into the fire in an elaborate ritual, and reciting hymns from the Vedic corpus. But the idea of 'dEva-yagna' is the offering of even a single faggot into the fire, with no other rituals accompanying this act ('yad agnau juhOty api samidham tad dEva-yajnah santishthatE'). 2. The 'Pitru-yajna' is likewise the mere offering of water to the ancestral spirits, with the utterance of 'svadhA' ('yat pitrubhyah svadhA-karOti aapas tat'). 3. The 'bhUta-yajna' is offering food to birds (like crows) and animals, after the midday ritual known as 'vaisva-dEva-bali' and before his own lunch ('yat bhUtEbhyO balim harati tat'). 4. The 'manushya-yajna' is partaking of ones food with other human beings (like learned folk, guests, visitors and the indigent people) ('yad brAhmanAdibhyOnnam dadati tat')."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 55 sadagopan.org 5. The 'brahma-yajna' is the study or recitation of ones own branch of the Vedic corpus (sva-sAKhA) ('yat svAdhyAyam adhiyitaikam api rcham yajus sAma vA tat'). svAdhyAya strictly means careful study of the entire Vedic corpus to which one belongs. But as a yajna included in this group, it would suffice even if a single hymn is studied or recited. It can be seen that these so-called 'great sacrifices' enjoined upon a householder have more of social significance than ritualistic involvements. The shift of emphasis from the Srauta section to the Grihya signifies not only that the sacrifices were receding to the background but that idol worship was becoming more important and popular. It was now but a short step for iconic worship to come out of the domestic confines into the public places of worship. The details of idol worship, complete with rituals and hymns, became the focus of attention in the books designated as Bhagavachhastra which were in effect successors of the Kalpa-sutra-texts. Gradually the focus moved more towards idol worship and particularly idol worship at temples along with homes. And as such the 'kriya-yoga' is suggested. Kriya-Yoga occurs in Bhagavata (11th skanda, 27th adhyaya). Uddhava requests Krishna to enlightenhim about Kriya-Yoga, which is another term for the worship of the God: kriyAyOga samAchaSva bhavadArAdhanam prabhO | yasmAt tvAm yathArchanti sAtvatA: sAttvatarshabha || vaidikastAntrikO miSra iti mE trividhO maKha: | trayANAmIpsitEnaiva vidhinA mAm samarchayEt || \"Worship is of three kinds.

And the Vaikhanasas are primarily"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 56 sadagopan.org Bhagavathas (Bhrigu's Kriyadhikaram, 30, 136-150), even as the Panchaaratras are. The Vedic kind of worship mentioned in the above work answers to the Vaikhanasa variety, while the 'tantrik' kind signifies the Pancharatra variety. \"Vaishnavam dvividham vaiKhAnasam pAncharAtram iti; vaiKhAnasam vaidikam ....... pAncharAtram tu avaidikam\" (Vimanarchana Kalpam). There has been a division among the bhagavatas from very early times into Vaikhanasa and PAncharatra. This division has been mentioned even in Mahabharata. While the bhagavathas extol intense loving devotion (bhakti) or total surrender (prapatti) to God as the principal means of reaching the Godhead, a difference in approach between the Vaikhanasas and Paancharatras has been noted. Srinivasa Dikshitulu, for instance, in his tAtparya chintAmaNi (dasa-vidha-hEtu-nirUpaNam) points out that total surrender for a Vaikhanasa means the uninterrupted invocation and worship of Purusha and other forms of Vishnu preceded by 'pranava' (viz., OmkAram) for the three ingredients of the sacred syllable signifies Vishnu ('a' kAra), Lakshmi ('u' kAra) and their devotee ('ma' kAra) in unison, while for a Paancharatra, it means an occasional invocation, and without Vedic mantras. The expression 'kriya-yOga' means the ritualistic actions that the worship of Vishnu involves; even as the title of a Vaikhanasa work, 'Kriyadhikaram' of Bhrigu does. The same expression occurs in Agni-Purana (a dialogue between Narada and Brahma) as distinguished from Jnana-Yoga, which is inward and internal; 'kriyA-yOga' is defined here as outward-oriented: gnAnayOgastu yOgasya yastu sAdhanamAtmanA | yastu bAhyArthastamdyOga: kriyAyOga: sa uchyatE || The same text explains that 'kriyA-yOga' consists of acts such as: 1. building a shrine to Vishnu ('kArayati mandiram'), 2. making an idol that is suitable and beautiful ('pratimAm lakshana-vatim cha"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 57 sadagopan.org kuryAt'), and 3. worshipping every day ('ahanyahani yogEna yajatO yan maha-phalam'). kriyA-yOga refers primarily to ordering ones life in accordance with the values of idol worship. It is an individual responsibility, and is done with a sense of duty and commitment. However, IT does not relate itself to the temple as an institution, or to idol worship as a domestic rite. It is not a detail of the Kalpa Sutra, but it brought idol worship out of the Grihya confines and paved the way for Bhagavachhastram. Bhrigu's Prakeernadhikaram (35, 1-13) speaks of the benefits of kriyA-yOga ('athA vakshyE visEshEna kriyA-yOgAsritam phalam'): by building a temple, it says, one obtains the rewards of performing a sacrifice every day; by even desiring to build one, he gets rid of sins of seven lives; by causing an idol to be installed, he achieves imperishable worlds; and so on. And the account ends by claiming that idol worship is the best form of worship, for its benefits are not confined to the donor or the priest but spread to all other devotees and survive for all time.

An individual born of brahmana parents is a brahmana, but he is so only by birth and not in spirit (jAta-mAtram). It is only when he undergoes the sacrament of upanayana that he becomes really a brahmana, but his status as brahmana depends upon the daily performance of sandhya (or savitryadhyayana). He is naturally superior to the brahmana who is only by birth, but inferior to the brahmana, who is 'srOtriya' (one who studies the Vedas, who has undergone the sacrament of marriage, and who performs the pAka-yagnas). But a 'srOtriya' is inferior to the 'AhitAgni', who studies the Vedic branch to which he belongs and tends the ritual fire at home. And he, in turn, is inferior to the 'anuchAna', who performs without fail the 'havir-yagnAs'. The 'bhrUna', who performs the elaborate sOma-yajna is superior to the 'anuchAna'. The 'bhrUna', who is the best among the ritualists, is inferior to the 'rishi-kalpa', who besides having the advantage of all the prescribed sacraments, is restrained and disciplined in body and mind ('samskArair upEto yama-niyamAbhyAm'). And the 'rishi', who not only has studied all the four Vedas along with their auxiliary texts, but also engages himself in austerities and penance (sAngachaturvEda-tapOyOga). And surpassing even him is the 'muni', who is devoted to Vishnu and is ever in"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 59 sadagopan.org perfect equipoise ('nArAyaNa parAyanO nirdvandvO muni:'). Thus, the Kalpa Sutra by formulating the hierarchy (pUrvAt pUrvAt paratO variyAn) highlighted the value of devotion (bhakti) in contradistinction to the need for ritualistic rigor in the spiritual practices at home. The ideal of the muni was also the goal of the Bhagavata (Vaikhanasa) career. The muni is not concerned with his own salvation, but works for the welfare of others (called 'lOka-sangraha' in Bhagavad Gita which is eminently the definitive text of the Bhagavata cult). Srinivasa Dikshitulu (or Srinivasa Makhi, an erstwhile Vaikhanasa Hereditary Pradhana Archaka of Tirumala Venkateswara Swamy temple (950 A.D.), we will get to know more about him and his works, later) in his dasa-vidha-hEtu-nirUpanam (10 proven reasons why Vaikhanasa way of worship is best) quotes at length from Atri's Pura Tantram (Ch.47) to the effect that the Vaikhanasas worship in temples for the good of all people, for timely rains, for abundant food, and for the glory of the ruler and the ruled; and that this is regarded as \"work\" (karma or kriya). The citation also distinguishes between 'worship at home' (GrihArcha), which is done for securing individual or familial welfare, and 'worship in the temple' (AlayArcha), which is done for the good of the public, and defends the superior merit of the latter. The priests who worship in temples are expected to do their work out of single-minded devotion and as a duty admitting of no diversion or interruption, all their life, and not for material benefits or monetary rewards. It is said in the Paushkara Samhita: viprA vaiKhAnasAKhyA yE tE bhaktAstatvamuchyatE | EkAntina: susutvasthA dEhAntam nAnyayAjina: || Kartavyamiti dEvEsam samyajantE phalam vinA | prApnuvanti cha dEhAntE vAsudEvatvamabjaja || And because of this disinterested devotion that idol worship involves, the texts proclaim that idol worship is the best religious practice and that it is the only"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 60 sadagopan.org avenue to final emancipation: bErapUjA tviyam prOktA pUjAnAmuttamOttamA | tasmAt sarvaprayatnEna bhaktyA paramayA yuta: | samUrtArAdhanam kuryAnnAnyathA muktimApnuyAt ||   (Bhrigu's Prakeernadhikaram) For idol worship which could be commonly resorted to, temple is the most suitable place. But the temple must be properly constructed, and the idol appropriately installed in it and effectively installed and consecrated in it.

And to guide the priests and help them in the worship rituals an Agama indispensable.

It has been pointed out that VaikhAnasa mode of worship would yield soubhAgyams in this world (Eihikam) and in the other world (VaikunTham/Aamushmikam). PancharAtram on the other hand will yield only the Phalan of Moksham (the boon of nitya kaimkaryam to the Lord in His supreme abode and enjoying ParipoorNa BrahmAnadham there). PaancharAtram in contrast to VaikhAnasam is known as AagnEyam, since one needs a dheekshA to worship the Lord through this aagamam. VaikhAnasas are blessed with the dheeksha even while they are in the womb of their mothers. VaikhAnasa ArchakAs have thus Garbha dheekshai and hence do not need any external dheekshai to engage in Bhagavad AarAdhanam. While VaikhAnasam is appropriate for ArAdhanam every where, PaancharAtra Aagamam (AgnEyam) is recommended for worship at areas, where there is not much of human sanchArams (Mountain tops, Forest areas et al). It is said that the change in worship at a temple consecrated with VaikhAnasa Aagamam to PaancharAtra Aagamam will cause sorrow to the nation. When the temple consecrated with Paancha rAtra Aagamam experiences of improper worship, then conversion to VaikhAnasa Aagamam mode of worship at that temple would reverse the inauspicious trends in the nation (PaancharAra-vidhAnEna pratishtApya vartamAnE archanE heenE sati, soumyasya pravESEnam kartavyam tath Raaja-rAshtra samruddhikaram bhavati)."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 67 sadagopan.org The daily VaikhAnasa AarAdhanam at the temples as well as at homes uses a lot of Veda Mantrams.

The temple is a public place of worship. It is the common belief among all religions in the world to worship their Lord through prayers. This is called Bhakti Marga. In this system Priest will be there in the temple to conduct pooja to the Lord on behalf of the Devotees. This pooja system is otherwise called as Archana or Aradhana to the Lord. Daily the Priest prays to the Lord to give peace and pleasure to all the people in the world. The mode of this worship is clearly and elaborately explained in Agama texts. These Agamas may be classified broadly into three groups on the basis of their sectarian affiliations: Saiva, Vaishnava and Sakta. We are dealing here with Vaikhanasa Agama books. Sage Vikhanas is the founder teacher of this system. He has written Vaikhanasa Kalpa Sutra and taught the Agama to his four disciples Sage Bhrugu, Sage mareechi, Sage Kasyapa and Sage Atri. This Vaikhanasa Agama adheres to the vedic tradition and it worships Vishnu. These four desciples have written the Vaikhanasa Agama texts as follows: a) Bhrugu - Thirteen Adhikaras b) Mareechi - Eight Samhitas c) Kasyapa - Three Kandas d) Atri - Four Tantras Total - Twenty eight texts. Out of these twenty eight vaikhanasa texts only ten texts are available now and T. T. Devasthanams has printed nine texts so far. In addition to these original"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 86 sadagopan.org texts there are some explanatory books written by scholars explaining the details according to the subject wise for practical purposes. They are also printed by T. T. Devastanams. All these books explain the system of worship of Sriman Narayana in Idol form. The Agama texts have four main divisions in their books. They are: a) Kriya Pada: dealing with construction of temples, the making and consecration of Icons. b) Charya Pada: dealing with the actual worship rituals daily and occasionally and prayaschittas. c) Yoga Pada: dealing with Astanga Yoga. d) Jnana Pada: dealing with the basic philosophical principles and knowledge concerning the ultimate reality and liberation (Moksha) Some of the Agama texts contain all the above four divisions and some may give more details on few divisions only. But all the texts give details of charya pada i.e, worship of the Lord. The above four Padas are complementary to each other. The main goal is liberations from the phenomenal fetters (Mukti) and prosperity in worldly life (Bhukti) through Bhakti and worship of Lord Vishnu and his other form (Avataras).
