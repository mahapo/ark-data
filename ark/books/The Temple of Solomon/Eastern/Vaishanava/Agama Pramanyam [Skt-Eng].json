Agamapramal).yam is one of the most important among his writings; and, strangely enough, there has been till now no critical edition of the text. In this context, my esteemed friend, Dr. van Buitenen has rendered invaluable service by bringing out a critical edition of this masterpiece with a scholarly introduction and English translation, eminently readable and faithful to the original. This timely publication has achieved a twofold purpose, that of giving the text, fast becoming scarce, further lease of life, and of making the thought imbedded in this treatise available even to tllOse unacquainted with Sanskrit. An orientalist of great repute, he has made the field of vedanta, especially visistadvaita vedanta, his own. Already he has earned the gratitude of all interested in our cultural heritage by his exceJIent publications, such as Ramanuja\"s Vedarl/zasamgraha and Ramanuja' on Bhagovat Gila.

Nathamuni set visistadvaita vedanta on a new and glorious phase of its career; Yamuna strengthened it considerably by his writings; and Ramanuja systematised and fortified it. Kuresa pays reverential homage to the illustrious hierarchy of acharyas commencing from Laksminatha (Supreme God, the Consort of Laksmi) and ending with his Own preceptor, Ramanuja, with Sage Natha and Yamuna at the centre: Laksminatha samarambham Niithay5muna madhyamam I asmad5.dirya paryantam vande guruparamparam a Th�g�a!1dson a!1sl_sp�rJtual.!.uccessor of �a·r\\ mUDi, Yamuna had the unique privilege----or-1nheriting) fll\"S-grandSIre's immeasurable spiritual wealth' and of passing on that legacy to Ramanuja, havjng enriched it by his own invaluable contributions.

When the awakening came, Yamuna realised the futility of the life he had been leading, became a sannyasin, settled down at the holy spot of Srirangam, the great centre of Vaisnava thought and devoted the rest of his life to disseminating the truths handed to him by Ramamisra and writing treatises and in unremitting and 00£­pointed devotion to the Lord. In his exposition of vi sistadvai tic thought, Yamuna follows the lead of the ancient masters like nodhayana, Tanka and D!1lJJlida and NathalQuni, whose master­pieCe, Nyayatattva greatly influenced his own writings. He follows in the foot.steps of Nathamuni so closely that Vedanta Desika describes Almasiddhi of Yamuna as a brief version of Nyayatattva. (Nyayalallva pralaranam M AtmaJiddhi.) Though steeped in tradition, he was no blind follower.

It is therefore necessary to consider if these are fair and factual descriptions. In his learned introduction Dr. van Buitenen refers to a numher of problems that challenge attention and call for further study. One of these is 'the reticence of the illustrious vai.�nava philosopher, Ramanuja, about the Pancaratra system.' U Ramanuja remains n he says, \"wholly silent about the element, both of doctrine and of religious practice of Pancaratra.\" In his earlier publication, Ramanuja's Vedarthasamgraha, Dr. van Buitenen says, that although the orthodoxy of the Panc.ratra had been established, \"it is not utilised as a source of knowledge in its own right to corroborate Ramanuja's system of vedanta.\" There is reference again to \"Ramanuja's evident indifference towards Pancaratra.\" He ha.s himself suggested a plausible reason for Ramanuja's not quoting even a single pad a from the veritable ocean of the Pancaratra. A master of dialectics, to win support for his interpretation of vedic teachings, form vedantins of all shades of opinion, he would take his stand only on sruti and universally accepted smrti ; he would not like co jeopardise a good case by quoting from what may be dubbed sectarian. For an indcntical reaSOIl, he studiously avoided all reference to the Divyaprabandha, though it has been one of the shaping forces of bis thought."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"viii As regards Ramanuja remaining .. wholly silent about the clements both of doctrine and ofreligious practice of the Pancaratra,\" it may be said that lIe presented n synthetic account of vedanta incorporating into it the vedic, agamic and prnhandha contributions. The genealogy of the specific items was not indicated because most of them are found in all the scriptures. Ramanuja looked upon the varied scriptures as setting forth identical doctrines, though their language and idiom vary. It is certainly not difficult to identify the agamic elements in Ramanuja's teaching. In the first place, the prapatti doctrine, though ancient and based on the Upani�ads and the Bhagavat Gita, gets special elabor­ation in the Pancaratra. The credit for having stressed its importance as a seJf..sufficient and inde­pendent means to mok�a and of explaining its angas (steps) goes to the Pancaratra. As tbis path is accessible to aU irrespective of caste 01' rank, it has a universal appeal. That everyone, whatever his station in life, is entitled to mok�a, and that it may be attained in this very birth is a characteristic Pancaratra teaching. Ramanuja utilised this doctrine and incorporated this in his exposition of the visi�tadvaita. Though he makes a passing mention of it in the Sri Bhasya and the Vedarthasamgraha, he emphasises it in the Gita Bhasya especially in commenting on the Carama sloka. More than all, in his Gatfyatraya which is a confession of his faith, he presents saranagati as hita par excellence. Another feature of the Pancaratra which Ramanuja has utilised is iti insistence on an austere life. In"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ix Nityagrantha it is prescribed as part of tbe daily routine throughout life. The day is divided into five periods, each to be devoted to an appropriate duty. The first is abhigamana, when one is to approach God as soon as daily ablutions and pujii are over. The second is called upadana, a period to be spent in earning a livelihood in legitimate and appropriate ways. Then follows ijya (literally, sacrifices), referring not to vedic sacrifices but to pancamahii yagna, which include among others, noonday prayer, offering unto God the food prepared and even partaking of meal, which is regarded as a religious act. What pleases the Lord is not the sacrifice which entails much material and effort, but sincere, unselfish and devout approach. True worship is something inward, involving mental purity, earnestness and steadfast faith. Next comes the path of ,uiidhyiiya or study. It is a duty cast on every householder to study our sacred lore and to teach the Same to others (pravacana) where possible. The concluding part of the day is devoted to quiet concentration (yoga). One is to retire to bed with thoughts of God uppermost in one's mind. Without bisecting life into the sacred and the secular and thereby making either valueless} the Pancaratra invests all our acts with sanctity. Everything that man does, eating and sleeping not excepted, are worship of the Divine. In a word, man's life is to be a God·centred life, all day long and all through life. Li,fe should be cha:tat.tui-s.eU by thh peIva'Soive note. Yet another fruitful idea which Ramanuja selects from the Pancaratra for elaboration is the concept of disinterested action. Action performed without II"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"x thought of personal gain and in the spirit of dedication to God leads progressively to self-knowledge, self­realisation and knowledge of God, which leads to meditation on God and flowers into live of, and surrender to God and final beatitude. \"Siitvikatyiiga piirvaka karma yogyena karrnana\" is a typical Pancaratra formula. In the Gila Bhasya Ramanuja explains the full implications of this concept wbile commenting on St. 15, Cb. IV of the Bbagavat Gita. \"Such a person sees non�action in action; and action in non-action. He is the man of wisdom, worthily engaged; and he is the performer of all actions.\" Yamuna composed eigh� works, and they are; Atma-siddhi, Isvara-siddhi, Samvit-siddhi, Gitartha­samgraha, Purusanirnaya, Stotraratna, Catussloki and Agamapramanya. The first three nre usually referred to by the collective name, Siddhitraya. A good part of each of these three siddhis has been lost due to neglect and the ravages of time; but even the little that remains gives us a clear idea of the author's views on important philosophical problems and orthe masterly way in which he expounds them. Ramanuja quotes profusely from these splendid manuals in his Sri Bhasya. Gitarthasamgraha is a marvel of epitomising effort. The inspiration for this undertaking came from Ramamisra who initiated Yamuna into the inmost secret of the Bhagavad Gita. In thirty.two stanzas, it SUms up the teaching of the Lord's Song as understood by the school which he represented llnd indicates how the teaching is developed logically and step by step and how the Gitasastra is a consistent"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xi exposition of the doctrine that it is only through bhakti (loving devotion) brought On by karma and jnana (svadharma jnana vairagyo. sadbya bbaktyaka gocarah) that the Lord could be reached. This work served as a ground-plan, as it were, for Rnmanujats luminous exposition of the Gita. Purusanirnaya is designed to show the supremacy of Lord Visnu. The book is not extant now. STOTRARATNA AND CATUSSLOKJ Stotra ... ratna and Catussloki are hymns in praise of Lord Visnu and Goddess Lakshmi respectively. They arc held in high esteem as portraying the author's fervent religious feelings and inmost longing for Divine communion and as expounding in an easily intelligible form the central philosophical doctrines ofVisi�tadvaita regarding tattva (God, man and nature), hila (the way) and purutar/ha (the nature of the supreme goal). This poem, as Vedanta Desika says, is the spontaneous overflow of the author's ecstatic religious experiences brought on by constant meditation on Divya Prabandha, especially the Tiruvoimozhi of Saint Satakopa. To him the Alwar was father, mother, consort, children, wealth, in a word, everything. Matapita yuvatayah tanaya vibhuti sarvam yadeva niyamena matanvayanam ) iidbyasya nah kulapateh vakulli-bhiramam srimad tadanghri yugalam pranamami mtlrdhna II Stotraratna, St. 6 One could see that the stotra is replete with the ideas culled from Tiruvoimozhi; and some of the stanzas seem to be Sanskrit renderings of the Tamil"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xii hymns. The key-note of the stotra is that prapatti is the only effective means of attaining transcendental felicity. Vedanta Desika has written a commentary bringing out the treasures imbedded in it; and he wrote a brochure On one of its stanzas under the head­ing Anjalivaibhava. Ramanuja felt moved as he heard Stotraratna recited; and he got there from the cue for his Vaikuntagadya. CATUSSLOKf Calussloki is an exceedingly brief poem singing the glories of Goddess Lakshmi. The four stanzas compd� sing it attribute to Sri the qualities of the Lord elaborately set forth in the four chapters of the Brahmasutras. The first stanza refers to the vibhutis of Goddess Lakshmi and shows that they are beyond praise; the second states that Her greatness is incomprehensible even to Her omniscient Consort, even as He cannot comprehend His own greatness; the third speaks of the saving power of Her grace; and the last describes how Her resplendent forms are inseparable from, and co-existent with, those of tbe Lord. AO.uIAPRAMA�AM Agama pramanya is devoted to vindicating the authority of the Pancaratra tantras. The extensive Pancaratra works calJed agamas or tnntras or s:l.mhitns and also Bhagavat Sastra, for the reason that Sriman Narayana is believed to have promufgated them Him­self, have always been considered canonical; but defractors have not been \"'anting, wJw chalJcnged their authority. Hence Yamuna felt the need for this"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiii defence of the Pancaratra. The main adversaries against whom he had to contend arc the }'1imamsakas of the Bhatta and the Prabhiikaraschool, theAdvaitins and the Naiyayikas. From their respective standpoints they directed their attacks on the Pancar.tra tantras. With the aid of reason and scripture, Yamuna meets this many-pronged attack and establishes that the tantras are authoritative. In Agamapramanya, more than in Siddhitraya, we see Yamuna at his best. A master dialectician, he exposes the fallacies in the argu ... ments of his rivals and demonstrates the correctness of his own views, with a wealth of incontrovertible evidence. In the course of the discussion, Yamuna indicates his views on a wide range of problems including those of linguistics, psychology, epistemology and exegesis. Yamuna discusses at Jength the proper interpreta ... don that is to be put on the Utpatyadhikatana of the Rrahmasutra, as this section has been taken by Sankara to be a refutation of the Pancaratra. With surprising unanimity all commentators have taken Brahmasutra I1-ii, 39- 22 as dealing with the Pancaratra although there is no word or expression directly or remotely specifying this theme. They differ however, in their interpretation of these aphorisms. Sankara interprets the four sutras as adducing four reasons for rejecting the Pancaratra; but Yamuna takes the first two as stating the prima facie case against it .. and the last two as establishing conclusively the validity of the Pancaratra after exposing the hollowness of the prima facie view. The location of this adhikarana in a pada devoted to the refutation of rival systems, namely, those"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xiv of KapiIa, Kanada, Sangaba, (Arhata) and Pasupata, which are either outside the pale of, or opposed to veda seems to lend support to Sankara's view that the Sutrakara meant to reject the Pancaratra along with the others. Against this view, it is mentioned that with the rejection of the Pasupata agama the impression may be created that the Pancaratra also is devoid of authority; to allay this apprehension the Sutrakara specifically raises the question of the Pancaratra to clinch the argument. Sankara's interpretation of the sutras :-(i) utpattyasambhauat: \"On account of the im­possibility of origination (the system tllat subscribes to the view that soul originates, i.e. the Pancaratra is unacceptable).\" \"There occurs in the Pancaratra the statement, \"From Vasudeva there originates the Jiva known as Sankaqmna; ... \" This is an instance where I the Pancaratra is opposed to the vedic. teaching that the soul is neither born, nor does it die. Hence it is to be rejected. (ii) na ca kartuh karanam: \"Besides, the instru­ment cannot originate from the agent (hence the Pancaratra which accepts such a doctrine is to be discarded)\". There is the Pancaratra statement ... from the individual sou] called Sankaq;ana manas, known as, Pradyumna originates; from Pradyumna originates Ahamkara known as Aniruddha.\" The Jiva who is an agent engages in his activity only with the aid of manas ; when that is so, how can the Jiva be said to give rise to manas? Moreover, the vedas declare that manas and the like proceed from Brahman alone. Hence the Pancaratra is to be rejected."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xv � (iii) vijniiniidibhiiv,.ii tadaprartdhah ; \"Should it be said that theY.re only Brahman, the objection, namely, impossibility or origination is not got over.n That is, even i r it be said that Sankar�ana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are not Jiva, manas and Ah.nkara respectively, but reaUy Brahman, since they are aU alike Brahman there cannot be the causal rela. tion among them; no one of them could give rise to the ne..

(iv) vipratittdhat: HAnd because of contradiction (the Panearatra lacks authority).\" As the Panearatra is self.discrepant and as it contradicts the vedic tcach­ings, it is liable to be rejected. For example, the Pancaratra maintains that jnana is at once guna and guni. Bhagavan is of the essence of jnana for His attribute. Further, the Panc..'1.ratra denounces the veda. It is well-known, Sandilya declares, that failing to find the highest felicity in the veda, he learnt the Pancaratra and attained thereby what he could not get from the veda. Hence the Pancaratra contradicts itself and speaks disparagingly of the veda, it is to be rejected. Tnmuna's interpretation: Yamuna, and, following his lead, Ramanuja, argue that this adhika-!:ana establishes precisely the OPFosite conclusion, namely,. the validity of the Pancaratra. \\Vhile there is substantial agreement between Sankara and Yamuna in their inter­pretation of the first two sutras, Yamuna takes the third and the fourth sutras as meeting the objections"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xvi that may be urged against the Pancaratra. The expression va occurring in the third sutra is indicative of a cbange in the direction of the argument, as in many an instance where this expression occurs. (iii) Vijlllinlibhlive va tadapratiredhall:-\"Or if they are of the nature of jnana and cause, i.e., Brahman, the authority of the Pancaratra is un assailed, i.e., there can be no valid objection to the Pancaratra.\" Either the Vyiihas (Vasudeva, San­kar�ana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha) are independent sovereigns 01 they are the four-fold forms, chosen out of His own free-will by the Supreme Lord out of compassion for purposes of protecting the world. The first alternative is ruled out, as the Pancaratra does not admit of a plurality of God, but is an uncompromising monotheism. On the other alter­native of a single Deity in fourfold forms, the question of origination does not arise. Sankar�ana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are reaIly the highest Brahman; they are not jivas, manas and ahamkara respectively. If they arc 50 called, it is because they control these factors from within. Thus, in truth the Pancaratra does not,' as it is alleged, countenance the view that the soul has an origin. 'Vhoever says it does advocate the non-vedic doctrine of the origination of the soul is really ignorant of the Pancaratra teaching.

Far from belittling the veda, it proclaims the greatness of Bhagavat Sastra and suggests that while the veda and the agamas contain nn identical teaching, the latter arc easier of comprehension. Yamuna presents quite a number of alternative interpretations of the third nnd fourth sutras, aU alike strengthening the conviction that the authority of the Pancaratra cannot be gainsaid. It passes one's understanding how Badarayana (Vyasa) foremost among those proficient in the veda who loudly proclaimed the glories of the Bhagavat Sastra in his Afahabharata could be taken as having denied it any authority in his Brahmarutra the most authentic exposition of vedantic teachings. Thus with unparalleled dialectical skill and with a wealth of convincing arguments Yamuna turns the table against bls opponents and establishes conclusively the orthodoxy orthe Pancaratra.

The translation of this relatively brief Prakaral].a proved to be difficult, for its language as well as its subject matter. No commentaries seemed to exist, nor has the text been translated before. I have used as my basis the edition of Rama .Misra Sastri, reprinted from the Pandit at Denares, 1937. I was unable to consult original manuscripts of the work, so that my dependence of the printed text was complete. The edition is good, with not too many misprints, though it is somewhat unreliable in its punctuation. There arc a number of obvious corruptions, whose restoration was easy and a few not so obvious ones, the emendation of which must remain doubtful.

I have tried to keep the English readable, as far as the concise and highly technical style of the author allowed. Although the reading of the work will remain difficult, I hope that thus this interesting treatise will be more accessible to scholars and laymen who lack the knowledge or the leisure to read the Sanskrit.

The extent to which Yamuna's works have been neglected is measured by the fact that his most important collec­tion, the Siddhitra)'a, has been permItted to be truncated and that at lean two of his treatises, the Pu,u�aniT1Joya and the Kiifmiriigam'Jpriimat}ya, now appear to be lost. �Iodern research has largely bypassed him, and only quitt recently English translations have become avail­able of his Siddhitraya' and Stolraralna 2 Tradition has it that Yamuna was the grandson of Nathamuni with whom the line of Alagiyas or Acaryas begins, At the conclusion of his AgamapramiiQ.ya Yamuna devotes a stanza to his predecessor, and follows it with a stanza, closing the treatise, which extols the greatness of those scriptures \"whose spirit has been increased by the glorious Nathamunindra.\"s The addition of these laudatory strophes would indeeu seem most appropriate at the end of a treatise which expounds the scriptural validity of PaficaratraAgama; A"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"AOAMA PRAMAl;VAM for in writing this exposition Yamuna was acting very closely in Nathamuni's spirit. Just as Yamuna was to claim authority for a class of texts which had not before been given official recognition as part of the Vedanta literature, so Nathamuni before him claimed authority for the co\\Iection of Tamil hymns known as the Prabandha. Within a few generations the canon of Vai-?l)ava Vedanta was thus increased enormously and it may be useful to enlarge on the impHcatjons. As so often, it would seem that the Vai-?l)ava hagiographers, for all the pious and at times mjracul� ous detail they were moved to add, translated into legend a core of historical fact, which remains recognizable. It is told that Nathamuni, after a pilgrimage to the ha\\Iowed places of the \"North-1VIathura, Vrndavana, Haridvara, Dvarak5 and Puri-, became aware of the ritual use that had been given to the Tamil hymns of the A.lvars. The Prapannamrta, written one gen('ration after Ramanuja, or five genera­tions after Nathamuni, notes that at Kumbhako1)am the study of these hymns was considered damaging to Vedic orthodoxy, and that the offending texts had even been thrown in the Tamrapan;li river. There arc several, and not always consistent, accounts of the manner in which the scriptures were saved. It is said that Madhura�kaviy alvar, a pupil of Namm-a:lvar's, WaS instrumental in transmitting his master's work the Tiruviiimoli to Nathamuni, or the latter received it directly from Namm-filviir's hands. Perhaps the most interesting fact is that when Nathamuni wanted a second hearing of the text for purposes of stUdy, he was referred to a local artisan who (\"by Namm-5Iviir's"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"lNTRODUCT10N inspiration\") revealed the work to him. If wc may regard the details of the miraculous recovery as edify. ing embroidery. the fact stands out that Nathamuni had to go to the common people in order to collect the hymns of the Alvars that had been rejected by the orthodox authorities. Although the Tamil scriptures had not received official sanction for use in high temple worship, they were current among the people, and certainly also in use at their devotional worship. \\Vbat Nathamuni in effect did was to incorporate these scriptures, henceforth known as the Dravic.Ia Veda, in the temple worship at Srirangam. P. N. SRlNIVAShCUARt remarks that \"this innova­'tion effected a silent revolution in temple worship, as it raised the status of the P,abandha to the level of the Veda, and liberalized the meaning of Revclation.4 It is important to recall that it waS the bhakti movement which produced the Alvars and made their perfervid exultation in the God live among the people. By incorporating the Tamil Prabandha among the sacred scriptures that served in temple worship orthodox tradition was enabled to ally itself to the popUlar movements which had a tendency to break away from Brahmat;tism, and to be itself revivified by them. For a long time to come Vl\"ti�t;tavism in the South looked for its spiritual leadership to Srrrangam, Nathamuni lived to the ripe old age of 96 and died in 920. He was succeeded at Sriral1garn by PUI,lc.Iarikak�a Uyyakkor;u)ar and then by R5mamisra Ma�3.kkal-nambi. Ramamisra was Yamuna's teacher.

As so frequently in the hagiographies of great saints, Yamuna showed early signs of great knowledge and at the age of twclve defeated in dehate the learned Akkiiilviin of the Cola court. He was rewarded with 'half the kingdom' and led a life of great luxury, until u new encounter with his old teacher Ramamisra, who handed over to him his grandf.'lther's legacy of the shrine of Srirungam, opened his eyes to his spiritu<ll obligations. Like hio;; distinguished successor Ramanllja, Yamuna too is supposed to have lived to the age of oue hundred and twenty yean. From this pontificate at Srirangam must date a comparative1r smaJi oeuvre of theological and philosophical treatises. Tltey com­prise several small devotional poems, the Stotraralna and the COlublloki (both commented upon by Vonka!a­natha in his Rahas)'arak!ii in which he seeks to define the theology ofLak�mi on the basis orthe CafurNoki), a very brief summary in stanzas of the Bhagavadgit5 Gitiirthasa1!lgraha (which became the programme for Ramanuja's Gifiiblziiv'as and was further enlarged upon in Vcnka�an.1it}la's GlliirlhaJtJ1!lgrnlJaro\"!o), and a series of expositions in mixed kiirikii and prose style, the Atmasiddhi, Isvarasiddhi and Sa�nvilsiddhi, usually bundled together under the title Siddhitra)a; a lost work Pllru�ani\"�la;'a \"Argumentation for a Personal God\"; and finally two disquisitions on the authority of Agama, the .Agamapriimii�)'1'l and the Kiiimrriigama­jlriihlii!l:fa.

In this treatise,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"1�'TRODt1CT10N 5 Yamuna sets out to prove by scripture and logic that the texts of Paflcar::itra Agama have an authority equal to that of the Vedas, because they ATC God's d.irect revelation.

Striking e\\'en more than in the AlmaJiddlzi is Yamuna's polenti. cat tone and argumentative manner. Throughout his works the impression which he creates is that of a high temple priest who is not cOntent routinely to continue the temple services as they had grown in Srirangam, but is apostolic in his fervour to persuade orthodox.y not only of the existence, but also of the truth, of a complete Val.!;1I).ava philosophy and theology. He may rightly be called the first apologist of a Vai.gmva theology. Like his predecessor Nathamuni, who had made room for the Tamil Veda in the temple worship, Yamuna too effected d. silent revolution.

After Sankara who con­tinued an orthodox tradition of monism, and Bhaskara who continued a not less orthodox tradition of dualism. monism. traditions both which based themselves princip.llly on the Upani!;1ads, Yamuna gave Vedanta a completely new scope.

The significance does not lie principally in the fact that he accepted as cano­nical a certain class of sectarian Vaj�l)ava texts, but that he argued it within the aupani�ada tradition. Several schools had arisen which, while paying lip service to the Vedic scriptures, in practice ignored them in Ihvour of morc accessible and more popular texts. The interest and the importance of the )Jgama­jJriimiiuya lie in the author's intention of bringing within the Vedanta tradition, and thus in a way subjecting to thi., tradition, a body of religious litera .. ture that often had been denied to be part of it. The motivation of this attempt was in part surely to restore to Vedanta thought the religious inspiration that, one cannot help but feel, was threatened by the philosophical acrobatics of the monistic schools. This religious inspiration was for Yamuna that of the reIi .. gion of worship and devotion that had swept Southern India. As a temple prit/I, he saw this reHgion guided and contained in the temple worship which itself was guided by Paficaratra tradition. From this poinl of view the AgamapriimiittYa was a plea for the emancipa­tion of popular religion. 2. EARLY PANCARATRA: TheoriginofPaficaratra is obscure, because it has not one origin. Investigation into the meaning of the word paiimriitra in so far as it might shed light on the origin of the tradition associated with that name has been hampered by tIle too great emphasis laid by recent authors on the 'pJlHosophica]'"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"I�\"TRODUCTIOS' content of the tradition. It is noteworthy that Yamuna himself does not accent this philosophical content at all in the Agamaprc'mii!IJ'a, and that he understands Pailcaratra principally as a tradition of ritual worship. What Pailcaratr. signifies for him is dilqii and the other sacrameuts; oriidnana and the various aspects of the ritual worship of the God; /lllj(l, devotion to the areii, fu nction and usc of nirmcil)'a and naived)'ll; and rites like the palicakiilikii. A similar significance does it have for Venkatanatha in his Srlpiilicariitraral.fii. As has been pointed out by other scholars, the cosmological and philosophical content of the Pancaratra Sarphita'i are far less con­siderable than their ritual contents. In these ritual contents we have the cumulative growth of many centuries, and at the prescnt sta.gc of our knowledge concerning the history of non:)'tlpia ritual it is vain to identify the origins and early development of the numerous rites and ritual specula­tions. Inevitably the name palicariitra has invited speculation' that the tradition is historically linked with Vedic ceremonials, like the Paiicaratram Sattram;8 it is, however, impossible to find convincing arguments for such a construction. The question thus rises whether it is permissible to separate the cosmological super-structure from the ritual content, and to seck to connect the name paticariitra with the former. This is tempting because in the �lahabharata we find several references to a Paiicaratra system just in connection with certain speculative tenets. I believe that although without a"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"8 doubt the system referred to in the epic as Paliear-:itra is basically the same as the cosmological system des­cribed, or taken for granted in the later Palicaratra Sarnhitiis, the original meaning of the name jJalicariilra cannot be elicited from the epic. All but one of the occurrences of the term are to be found in the Naraya!)iya book, chapters 334-351 of the Santiparvan. One of the most distinctive features of the doctrine there set forth is the fourfold nature of the Supreme Being, which immediately recalls the Vyuha doctrine of Paficaratra. There arc two series of names to describe the four aspects, one of very minor importance, and one of ID::UOTJ and rema.ining import. anee MBh. 12.334 relates that the eternal Naruya!)a was born the son of Dharma in the Krta age during the Svarambhuva manvantara, as Nara, Narayana, Hari and Knil)a Svayambhuva.!J The devotion to Narayal',la, the general concern of the Niirayat;liya, which is also called SatvatamatalO and proclaimed by the Sun, II' is associated particularly with the people of Svetadvipa north of the Milk Sea.\" Although thus there i, a very definite identification of both doctrine and devotion with the name of NarayaI).a, the most common descrip­tion of the: quaternity of God is in Kf?l).aite terms, as Vasudeva, Sarpkan;:a1):a (Baladeva), Pradyumna and Aniruddha. But in these terms is also captured a particular doctrine of the relationship between God, soul and body, in terms which strongly recall the essentially theistic Sarpkhya of the epic. The Puru�p, the Supreme Being, who is the soul of all beings, h Vasudeva. This Purusa enters the body which is constituted of the five el�ments.ls The Context conveys"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"tNTItOPUCTtON 9 that from this contact between puru.a and body the jiva appears, which is the embodied soul, or the pllru�a as embodied.

This doctrine must have enjoyed considCTable currency and in many places of the epic, outside Ihe 1Iok!?adharma, there are references to it.

A critical survey, then, of the cpical evidence for the term Paficaratra docs not produce a solution for the problem of the original meaning of the word. Therefore, there is perhaps some merit in approaching the question from an entirely different direction. Could the case be made that in Paiicariitra we have a specialized usc of a term that originally had a wider and more general use? The juxtaposition of Paficaratra with traditions like Saf!lkhya, Yoga and Pasupata,25 the references to the esoteric nature of the doctrine, and the intimations of the ascetic lift; of its followers suggest that the Paiicaratra way oflifc was typically that of seekers of wisdom and enlightenment whose beliefs and practices were not necessarily part of Vedic ritualist sacerdotal­ism, but who were wandering sages, and rec1uses, and pilgrims. Like so many of those mumuk!us who fwm the sixth century B.C. (and doubtJess before) went about teaching or settled down in semi.retirement from active life in a life of contemplation, the Pafica .. ratrikas too, whose doctrine later on remains linked with the innovators rather than with conservative rittlalists, may have been part of the same movement that in the first millenium B.C. largely reformed the ancient aryan tradition.

Among the commonest of these vows were self-chosen home­lessness and its corollary, religious mendicancy. On the practice of these vows, however, nature imposed certain limitations. Surely the rainy months always forced the homeless wanderer to seek a temporary retreat in a village, and the normalization of this in early Buddhism, which ltd to the Vihara system, must reflect a generally ob'\\crved practice. These observations may provide an approach to the explanation of the name paiicariilra. Non­doctrinaire literature knows of Pancaratrikas without any apparent creedal affiliation. Thus for example, the oldest extant Sanskrit version of the Brhatkathii, contained in Budhasvamin's Brhatkathaf/ukasalpgraha, describes a certain grhastha as a Pancaratrika who leda n 'ascetic' life.26 This graastha, which in this text generally means va iva, in the present case, specially a prosperous farmer, gives up his old life in quest of sa1vation. His complete lack of allegiance to any school is brought out with humorous emphasis. The farmer reviews the practice of pilgrimage to Avimukta and Benares, the philosophy of Vedanta and the doctrine of the Buddha, and finally decides himself in favDur of the last \"for the doctr.ine of the Buddha has a reputation for efficiency.u27 It is clear from the context that the Paficnrfitrika is not distinguished by any particular fa ith or creed,"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"r�-rRODucno� 15 but by n more or less ascetic nfe-rule.

PANCARATRA IN THE BRAHMASU1'RAS: Accord­ing to the commentatorial tradition the concluding siitras of the Tarkapada 2.2 of the Brahmasiitras deal with the doctrine of Paficaratra. The siitras con· cerned are extraordinarily cryptic, and without a firm tradition to that effect one could hardly make out that its orthodoxy is at stake in sfitras 42-45. The four siitras read: utpalt)'asa1Jlbhaviil; na ca kartutz karorzam ; vijliiiniidibhiive vii tadapr\"li�edlza!l; viprali�edhiic ca. According to Sankara, who interprets the lines as a condemnation of the system, the point at issue is the relationship in the Pancaratra doctrine between purufa -Supreme Brahman, thejfva (Smp.(ar:rotm)-soul, and the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"n''TRQDUCT10N' 17 manas (Pradyumna). This view is accepted alike by Bhaskara, Yamuna (who also adds alternative interpre­tations) :md Ramanuja. In Sankllra's and Bhaskara's view the four sijtras enumerate arguments against Paficaratral according to the others the first two contain the pl7rvapak!a, the latter two the siddhiinla. However unsatisfactory in most cases a prima.facie­translation of single Brahmasutras must be, it may be useful to make some attempt to discover how the Author (or as some maintain the interpolators of the Tarkapiida) viewed the Paficaratra. If indeed the Pai'icaratra is at issue in 2.2.42-45 (and this we must take on fa ith), some primary observations can be made. In all previous cases the traditions discussed are condemned. Secondly, the Brahmasutrns are not con­cerned with saving any particular tradition, e.g., Pallen­ratra from outside attack; their concern is to defend the aupaniFada tradition against rival traditions whose views are in conflict with it and which can be shown to be unscriptura1. Therefore, if we find, after the refutation of several heretic traditions, an adhikarallo devoted to Paficaralra, our first assumption is that ;he Author has something to refute in it. But against this, it may be argued that the Author was himself in favour of Paficaratra and wished to conclude his argumentations of the Tarkapiida on a positive note, asserting by way of siddhiinta the orthodoxy of this tradition.

But as to the contention that Sa'l1kar�aI)a originates from Vasudeva and Pradyumna from Sa'l1kar�aI)a, and Aniruddha from Pradyumna, we maintain that this origination of the individual soul, called Sa'l1kar�m!a, from the Supreme Soul, called Vasudeva, is impossible, because it entails the defect of non.eternality. For if the individual soul has an origin, such defects as its non-eternality fo llow.

Even so, there is no refutation or it, that is to say, non-refutation of the impossibility of origina­tion still obtains; that means that the same defect, sc. impossibiHty of origination, obtains in a different manner. How ? First, if the meaning is this that these four, Vasudeva, etc., are mutually distinct and are aU four co-equal Gods, and that they are not Identical in essence, then the assumption of a plurality of Gods is senseless, because the functions of God can be accounted for by one single God. Also this violates their own doctrine, because they hold that only the venerable Lord Vasudeva, is the supreme reality. Secondly, if the meaning is this that these fo ur are the co-equal divisions of this one venerable Lord, still the impossibility of origination obtains under this condi_ tion. For Saf!1kar�al)a, cannot originate from Vasudeva, nor Pradyumna from Sarpka�ar:la, nor Aniruddha from Pradyumna, because no one exceeds any other one.

The ritual acts, characterised as worship, meditation and contemplation of the God, as well as the knowledge concerning such acts,36 arc considered valid. However, if some part37 is found among acceptable elements that is in conflict, that part must be rejected.

RAMANuJA ON PANCARATRA In view of his predecessor Yamuna's concern with Paficaratra, the reticence of the illustrious Vaiglavu philosopher Ramanuja about the same system is some­what pUZZling.

Elsewhere, I have suggestedH that Ramanuja was motivated by a desire to reac1l all Vedantins and did not wish to limit his appeal, which he based on sruti and universally recognized smrtis, by emphasizing his allegiance to any particular school and by quoting as decisive authority, sactarian texts that others would"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 29 refuse to accept. Also the cosmogonical doctrine in which most of the philosophic superstructure of Pancaratra. consists was of no immediate concern to Ramanuja's ontological preoccupations. Still it remains curious 'hat even in his introduction to the GiJahhaY'Q, where Ramanuja enlarges upon the m�nifestations of God in their different gradations, no room whatever is given to even a passing mention of, for example, the Vy iihaJ. Rarely, moreover, will one find him use the appellation Vasudeva. \\Vhen it occurs in the texts, he comments upon, it is translated into Nflrayal)a, which is his fa vourite name for God. Therefore it may be useful to include here the fu ll translation of Rarnanuja's commentary on the ulpatIJa. sat.nhhaviidhikara1)a, both for its own sake and fo r its relationship to Yamuna's discourse.

Another doubt that may arise, viz., that the Paficaratra system-which being promulgated by the Venerable Lord Himself actually sets forth the means of attaining the summum bonum-has also no authority because it would be in the same class with Siitp.khya and other systems, is presently disposed of. 'Vith regard to this system the objectiou is raised: The individual soul, Sal'flkar�al].a by name, originates from Vasudeva, who stands for the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate cause.

In other words: that the origination of the soul is promulgated in contradiction with the sruti is an objection raised by people who do not really know the doctrine of the Bhagava/ol. Actually this doctrine is that the Supreme Brahman-called Vasudeva-, moved by affection for those who take refuge in Him, exists Himself and by His own will in a quadruple form in order to serve as a refuge for His votaries.

This is their view. Vibhava is defined as the sum-total of the manifestations Rama, Kn-I).a, etc. ; the Vyuha has the fo ur forms ofVasudeva, Sarp.kar�aI].a, Pradyumna and Aniruddha; the Suhtle is the Supreme Brahman called Vasudeva whose person­ality is constituted by the six qualities alone. So in Pa�karasarphita: \"That fiistra by means of which one attains the Supreme Brahman called Vasudeva completely through acts fo llowing on knowledge,\" etc. Therefore, Sarpkar�aIJa, etc. also constitute the voluntarily assumed personality of the Supreme Brahman who, according to the sruti, H is horn in many wa)'s without b�ing horn: \"i8 so, since it is declared that Brahman has births in the form of voluntary assump_ tions of individuality occasioned by His affection for"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"32 His votaries, the siistra that declared the same cannot therefore be denied authority.

It will be said later on, in the sutra nalma frute!,/9 why in Vedic and profane usage the soul is said to be born, to die, etc. To 'conclude: the very doctrine denies the origin� ation of the soul, so that the objection tItat it is not authoritative, since it holds that the soul or;g;nates js absolutely rejected. Then there is the outcry of some who think that since Sal)c;lilya studied the Paficaratra doctrine because he could not find a proper basis in Vedas and auxiliary sciences, and that this signifies that no proper basis for man's ends in life is found in Vedas and auxiliary sciences, it follows that the tantra is incompatible with"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTroN' 33 the Vedas.

Paiicaratra is invalid, because it opposes the Veda and is therefore heretical. FIRST MINOR COUNTER-OPPOSITION: THE NAlYAYIKA V,EW 18-23 18. Paficaratra is independent of Veda, both corporal of verbal statements being aCCOunts of the uni­versal Perception of the same Personal God. 19. For the Veda too must have been composed by a Personal Creator. 20. This Persona] Creator has complete knowledge of Dharma and Adharma. 21. For these are the means of world creation and must therefore be completely known by the worJd creator. 22. Proof for the existence of such a Creator is furnished by the proved produced ness of the worJd. 23. The ritual acts of individual performers cannot be ultimate causes of world creation and destruc­tion. The existence of a divine Creator is abundantly evidenced by Scripture and Tradi. tion."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"CONTENTS 45 REFUTATION 24-32 24. There is no authority fo r such a creator of the Veda either in Perception or ;n Inference, since such an author would be motivated by bodily existence and since, if Dharma were provable by other means of knowledge, there would be no purpose fo r the authority of the Veda. 25. The argument that someone must know Dharma because someone has created the world is fa llaci­ous, since there is no scope for a world creator. 26. Nor does a creator need to know the means fo r his creations. 27. Nor can it be proved that the world as a whole is produced. 28. If it were produced, the producer could not be God. 29. The God of reason is a person with personal defects. 30. He could not operate independently of his personal karman, which renders him superfluous. 31. No author oftbe Veda is remembered. 32. The preterpersonal virtue of the Veda. 33. CuncIusion. Since there can be no divine author of the Pancaratra, it must have been composed by someone in order to deceive. 34. Oldtction. God need not he proved by Inference. He is proved by Scripture. 35. Scriptural testimony is informative of fact as well as 0 f karya, and Vedic statements on God therefore have full authority."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"46 SECOND MINOR COUNTER OPPOSITION: THE PUBHAKARA VIEW 36-41 36. Only injunctive Vedic statements are denotative. 37. Factual statements are denotative only if con­nected with injunctions. 38. Generally denotation belongs to words in so fa r as they are connected in an injunctive sentence. 39. Otherwise indicative statements with injunctive sense are impossible. 40. Thus the Upani�ads are informative only in so far as they are construed as subordinate to an injunction, which even then does not prove the existence of its content. 41. Consequently Scripture cannot prove the exist .. ence of God. 42. Continuation of the Bhatta opposition. Even if God existed, he could not be omniscient, since all knowledge derives fr om sense perception. 43. The omniscient Gods claimed by different sects cancel one another. 44. Objfction. Vasudeva, the omniscient promuJgator of Paficaratra, is proved by Scripture and must therefore not be compared with the Gods of other systems. 45. Scriptural statements concerning the omniscience ofPa�upati are figurative. 46. Refutation. If Viisudeva is indeed proved by Scripture, the promulgator must either be a deceiver or Vasudeva in his role of illusionist. Consequently Paiicaratra has no validity. 47. Pai'icaratra Tradition cannot be compared with Manu's Tradition, since that would make the promulgator dependent."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"CONTEl-07S 47 48. Pailcaratra is traditionally known as a heresy. 49. And it is also heretical because of its unscriptural doctrine that the soul has a beginning. 50. Pancaratra cannot be eternal. 51. Arguments against the Piisupata and other such Traditions apply equally to Pailearatra. 52. Final ConclUJion: Paficaratra is not a valid means of knowledge. PART Two : MAJOR ARGUMENTATION 53-139. 53.

It cannot be shown that Pancaratta as language statement is defective because it derives from a person. 61-62. Nor can the Prabhakara view be admitted that all non�injunctive statements are non-denotative. 63. The Prabhakara view should be restated as \"denotation of connected meanings generally .. ' 64.

There arc many others, who have an excellent judgment of what is essential and what is not-honest students who do not cavil; and they wiII praise my work. 3. Even erudite scholars may erf when their critical a�umen is dominated by partisan views; yet, let the sagacious without envy study the Bhagavata doctrine as I shall present it here. 4. There arc certain people whose minds are confused by the noise of multitudes of sophisms and falsehoods which are borrowed from anyone that comes: and claiming superiority for their own studies and learning, and pretending to protect the Way of the Veda,2 they refuse to accept the authority of Pai\\caratra Tantra which, being composed by the Supreme Per­son Himself, leads to unparalleled beatitude� And they contend: It has been decided that Verbal Testimony3 is J a 'means of knowledge in two ways: dependent testimony which depends on other authority, , and independent testimony. These two kinds are thus distinguished: No verbal assertion can be a means of valid knowledge if it has been formulated by a person; J"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"for a verbal assertion to be authoritative, it must by definition be independent. ,.' That is to say: verbal evidence which originates from a person carries authority only then when it i, used to corroborate a fact which has already been truly established by other means of knowledge,' and which enables the speaker to take this fact for granted. Now, Perception and the other means of knowledge which involve Perception, cannot produce the. knowledge that the Paficaratra Tantra does indeed set forth that the desired heaven, release and other supernatural ends can be attained by meanS of such ritual acts as Con­secration and such d.evotional acts as worship of the Bhagavan etc., for this relation of means and ends is not of the order of Perception. For if we consider Consecration, worship etc. merely with the aid of Ferception, we cannot say that they are meaDS to realize the summum bonum. ' Not only, therefore, is Perception of an ordinary kind unavailing, but there is also nO way to know that there have been recently(:ertain persons of superhuman sensibility who would have had perceptual evidence that such acts really are means of attaining the desired ends; for the sense-organs of such persons, too, cannot surpass the boundaries of sensitiveness as we know it commonly . . 5. An objection may be raised here: However, perception of a superior kind h possible. depending on its percipient. Perception, therefore, may become perfect if the percipient is perfect. That is to :say: it. finit<c thing may be found to become infinite; for instance,lcxtent become! infinite"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"in space, which is infinitely extended. Similarly, we find that finite Perception is considerably widened in air .. borne creatures, like crows, owls, vultures erc., so that Perception might conceivably become infinite in some being. This indeed is lhe uppermost limit of knowledge where it encompasses every knowable thing; for we know from experience' that knowledges exceed one another as their contents exceed one another. That is why the wise can say· that there is Someone in \\Vhom such finite qualities as supremacy, dispassionateness, power etc. subsist in an infinite and unequalled condition. Consequently, tbis Person whose immediate perception encompas.ses the entire range of things that are present in the world is hereby explained to be the Bhagaviin who has immediate perceptual knowledge that Consecration, worship and so forth are dharma. So what remains unproved? (is improper). 6. This objection is thus refuted: The supreme perceptual knowledge which you assume is just a fancy. Perceptual knowledge can never go beyond its own spbere and trespass on another. For instance: A superior kind of visual perception, as well as a superior perceptible object, must necessarily occur in loci where inherent relations of one kind� as between colour and coloured, obtain in one object. No knowledge: that is received through one of the senses can encompass all that is knowable through all senses. So how can perceptual"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"knowledge hy itself make all things known, i.e. \" : also things known only through other means of knowledge? - 7. The objector resumes: . However, the sensitivity which we attribute to Perception is directed toward the perceiving of what exists al pre\"nl. . . Of course, if Perception did not have this function of perceiving what exists at present as its natural function, it would cease to be Perception at' all. Therefore, it is not reasonable to say that a superior kind of Perception, defined as encompassing all 'objects, is a priori impossible because it is limited to being Perception! 8. The objection is refuted: . If from finite Perception you conclude to 'infinite Perc�ption, then 1 ask you to explain: can a finite quantity ever attain to such t:xp'ansion that it cannot be further expanded? You insist, as it were, on full maturity in a little boy81 'even as a boy, after attaining the fu ll growth, cannot grow physically further?' There are two possibilities: either the infinite exists in the finite, or the finite gradually becomes infinite. The former cann�t stand, for there is no Perception to support it: we have never seen a bowl or a,}jrnjlar �nlte object which had the same expansion as spa<:e. . And suppO!�e ,3 finite qun.ntity could asSume inconceivable infinitude! why, tben any single jar or pitcllcr could fiJI up tlJC entire ,spacc with;o tllc Egg of"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Brahm;;, so that all other Ihings would be pushed oul and perish accordingly! . If you take space itself as the subject,' you merely prove the proved.' In the alternative you cannot avoid the illogicality we have pointed out: as a matter of fact) never before has anybody 'se�n a finite pillar which was pervaded by an infinite pillar l' Consequently, there Iemains the defect of mutual exdusi<>n. Let us also consider your illustration, namely that in space we have an example of a finite extent becoming infinite. Extent is· by definition a limited extension of space, a relative quantity, something tbat can be entirely circumscribed. Extent in this definition does not subsist in space as Buch, so how can you adduce it as an example?

As long as we do not assume that a state­ment is denotative only when it bears on a !liT)'a, we cannot assume that a verb in the present indicative contains an injunction. 40.

REFUTATION, Why, if that were so, that would mean that if its authority is disproved by Scripture it is proved by Inference, and if it is proved by inference it is disproved by Scripture ;\"9 which is n vicious circle. 57.

If then, my slow-witted opponent, in order to remove this defect fr om your ground you claim that being outside the Veda means \"not deriving from the Veda,\" then what do you, logician, think of it ? \"'veU, by this definition of the ground we get the meaning, \"something, namely in case there is question oflanguage-staternents, is non-Vedic, because it does not derive from the Veda.\" But then there is an occasional application to the Veda itself, which does not derive from the Veda! When the ground is re� defm ed as \" because it does not derive from the Veda, in case of a language-statement but not a Vedic state­ment:' then again there would inevitably be an occa­sional application to statements of reliable persons which do not derive fr om the Veda and yet are valid, like U Thereare trees on the rivCI\"·bank.·· If the reason is further conected into: \"because it does not derive fr om the Veda, namely J in case of a language-statement -but not a Vedic slatement-and this statement con ... cerns an action to be taken,\" then still we have a vicious applicability to such precepts as HOne must eat little when one has indigestion.\" Again, if the ground is"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"then reformulated as .\" becau,e it does not derive from the Veda, in ca,e of a ,tatement specified by all the ahove specifications and al,o concerned with dharma and adharma,\" then this ground is partly impertinent, becau,e Paficariitra Siistra doe' not deal with dharma and adharma exclusively, since the great majority of its statements concern Brahman.

Thirdly, there is no contradiction through utterance of substance, since in the given substance a connection with the given property is not contradictory � Paficaratra is not contradicted by its property autllOrita­tiveness, as motherhood is contradicted by the property sterility. For upon the assertion of the authoritative� ness of the substance in question, it is not contradicted by any particular substance named in Revelation, since the imputation of questionableness is secondary, as in the case of the assertion that certain acts of violence which are enjoined are against the dharmn.m There is, therefore, no contradiction by Janguage­statement; so that we conclude that the proposition is presentable. 59. Nor is the ground affected by logical defects, like occasional application etc. The ground is not occasionally applicable to other terms. This fa llacy of occasional ness is of two kinds, general occasional ness and special occasionalness.

Neither does the ground have a specially­occasional application, because the illustration \"like statements on Vedic sacrifices such as jyoti�toma etc.\" shows its connection with other instances on the same side of the argument. Nor is the ground precluded, since there is no con­comitance of its opposite; being a cause of faultless knowledge is not invariably accompanied by non­authoritativeness. Nor is the ground cancelled by lapse of time, since there is no conflict with Percep. tion and in this it is analogous with Scripture. Nor is the ground itself unproved or unestablished. If a ground is unestablished, this is because either its locus or its essence is unestablished. The first does not apply, fo r its locus is Paficaratra Siistra, which is proved to exist.

But how can we discard the supposition that the Pailcaratra texts are fa ulty?'\" This supposition arises instantly since the texts are of personal origin. REfUTATION. How do you avoid the same supposi­tion in the case of the Vedas? There too it arises instantly, since die Vedas are language-statements. \\Vhen you reply, it is avoided because the Vedas have no personal auth�r. then you may realize that in our case, too, it is avoided, since the Tantras. have been composed by the Supreme Person, who is omniscient and eternaIIy satisfied, and you may keep quiet ! 'Vhat I mean to say is this. Our position is that in language as such there arC no defects that invalidate its authoritylt9; ac; language, language is authoritatlve. Its authority is in certain cases invalidated by defects in the character of the speaker, for instance in a language statement, \"There is a herd of elephants on my finger-tip.\" The statements in the upani�ad portion of the Veda remove whatever suspicion we may have about any defects in the character of the speaker in the text collection here under discussion. For the Vedanta texts Set fo rth that the omniscient Lord of the world is supremely compassionate; then how can we:: suppose Him to be deceitful etc.? 61. OBJECTION. However, I have said that language statements have no authority when they concern established facts) on the ground that when terms are applied to such facts they do not have proper denotative power. 7"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"50 REFUTATION. This vjew is not correct. Profane language, eliciting a fa ct by direct application,; even though this fa ct is established, really operates -its denoting power as fu lly as it does by applications which concern karyas. Consider the illustration that has been given aboveuo. When certain manifestations (of joy) in a man's face, which fa How on his hearing the statement \"A son has been born to you,\" make it appear that the man spoken-to is happy, one instantly understands that his happiness is the result of his receiving from this statement a knowledge of an agreeable meaning, and one then infers that, fo r a medium-aged person too, this happiness derives from the statement. Thus one concludes that, since this happiness came to exist upon the existence of the statement, the statement itself has the power to convey an agreeable meaning. If there arises a doubt as to which particular ground of happiness among the maI}Y different grounds that may occur according to past, present and future, then consider this. A young boy, who wants to understand the meaning of speech, immediately upon hearing the same statement receives knowledge that a birth ceremony is being held.

However, the relation of cause and effect is not just known from the fact that one comes into existence upon the existence of the other, for that would mean over·e.,<lension. Nor does the realization that a birth ceremony is to be held fo llow invariably upon the knowledge of an agreeable mean· ing ; for we find also that the same realization fo llows upon a fe eling of distress, namely when the informed father is vexed by the trouble of maintaining his fa mily.1n REFUTATION. Don't we find that the realization of a karya is caused by a verbal statement, so that we can agree that, for example, the realization that a cow is to be fetched following a statement \" Fetch thecow\" is indeed caused by that statement? When you say that, since this: realization cannot occur without a cause therefore the proximate statement must in that case be the Cause of the realizationl then I maintain that the same holds also in the case of \"A son is born.\" It has been decided by our opponent that the verbal denotation of a meaning which causes an action to be taken is a result of the inclusion in the statement of a litiiidi suffix. us He who maintains that all words only bear meaningfully on kiirya, maintains in effect that padiirthasm exist only in kiirya statements and that e.g. in th.e case of cows, horses and the like, which are related to bodies, their being a padiirtha is ascertained by the inclusion or exclusion of the words denoting them in a statement concerning karya.

It is necessary to accept the position that words are (denotative of connected meanings, fo r otherwise it would be impossible to explain that they afe denotative of meanings connected with kiiryas. Tbe definition, 'tbe thing meant by a word is always connected with a karya' fails to cover the defined topic completely; for it does not apply in the case of injunctive suffixes, since these suffixes denote their own meanings as connected, not with karya, but with consequences of already established facts, such as proper qualification on the part of the person enjoined etC.1'5 Or if it is said that in their case there is denotation of connected meanings and in the other case denotation of meanings connected with karya, we reply that this is a neither old nor young, nrgument ;1$6 it is more appropriate simply to accept the view that there is denotation of connected meanings in general. 64. Therefore, the adherents of all schools should accept that words have proper -denotation for the meanings they denote because these meanings are connected with other meanings that are required to complete the sense of the statement, are closely collocated and are appropriate. Even if the denoting power of language were to be understood only through its proper signification in karya statements alone, m even so it is correct when we decide the denotation or language to take the standpoint that koo'a is jwt onc of the inessential fa ctors of denotation. like the ide-ndW"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"53 of the speaker, the extent or space in which a statement can be he,,,d etc. The logicians hold the view Ihat the meaning of a language statement cannot be known except by language statement.'\" Consequently, there exists no inherent relationship with kiir;'(J as cause of denotation in uses of words that have their proper signification, just as is the case with floating precious stones on water. Just as this floating, however helpful it may be to determine the identity of certain diamonds, e.g. the brahmin diamond, serves no purpose when a stone is being' transacted which has already been properly identified, similarly the karyn, however helpful to understand the proper signification of a word, serves no purpose once its proper signification has been identified. 65. Moreover, if words denote their meanings only as connected with karya, then how can we know fr om them that, fo r example, there is a relation between a fruit and a river-bank, is in a statement: \" There is a fr uit on the river-bank ?\" If you say that a statement of such a substantive relation does not denote the relation it states through its primary sense, but through secondary sense, then, we may ask, where do statements then have their primary sense? If you answer: in a );iio'a which is not previously known through other means of knowledge, we reply: no, for then no use of words would be possible, since their meaning would not yet have been identified. Naturally there can be no knowledge of the meaning of a word when that word denotes a meaning not previously known through other means of knowledge, and no cognition can arise from words with unknown meanings for that would entail over-extension. '"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"66. OBJEOTION. My position is this. In ordinary language a statement is understood to have its proper signification when it bears on a kiirya that is to be accomplished with a certain action. In Vedic language a statement enjoys a special power of denota­tion which'transcends the transitory root-sense of the word\" sacrificing\": and it has this power of denotation because it is the means of realizing a certain fr uit and acquires this power on account of the collocation of words describing this fruit ; whereas in ordinary language, since there verbal exchange is possible also to the unsophisticated, this determination of the nature of word and meaning is not attendell to. RF.FUTATlON. This position is just wishful think .. ing; for a 1anguage statement, even if understood in your way as bearing meaningfully only on a kiirya to be accomplished with an action,IS9 does not by that token set forth a permanent kiirya,140 since that would mean over-extension. If we cannot know the true connection of words even when the usage of our elders, through which the denotations of these words is under­stood, takes place in accordance with these words, then we can never know their connection! If a language statement has lost its postulated true denoting power because it is impossible, it does not thereby acquire another denoting power. J n such cases we surely must assume laksanu.

The only relation proved of it is that with injunction, not with instrumentality.

And Iherefore there is a vicious interdependence tllat cannot be refuted. If there is nO fa ctor which activates the person who, according to the injunction, is specified by the heaven that is to be achieved, the injunction itself cannot be the means of achieving the desired he-'wen. The eoot·sense of the words being transitory, the statement itself cannot function as this means.l4% Therefore the assertion that a language statement communicates as its proper meaning a karya which exceeds this transitory root-sense, cannot be correct. A person is not specified hy heaven as the object to be achieved,14s but it is the person who desires heaven who is enjoined upon to accomplish the act. Heaven can­not be the specification of the person's qualification, because heaven is yet to be achieved. Only something that has already been achieved, that actually exists, can specify the person upon whom an act is enjoined, fo r instance, the real fa ct of his being alive etc. Conse­quently only his desire can specify his qualification fo r the act. 68. Furthermore, precisely how is heaven, which in your opinion fu nctions as the specification of the person enjoined, an object to be realized, a sadhya?"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"55 If its beiIlg a sadhya means that it is fit fo r a relation with a sadhana, it is impossible (o r heaven to be siddha, as t long as its relatabiHty obtains, since it cannot become .idiha in the meantime.'\" The only authority that exists fo r heaven becoming siddha in the. end is the injunction itself, while the only authority for the injunction is just this that heaven does become siddha. This is plainly a vicious circle. If heaven is the siidl!yaJ the injunction is not the sadhya. It is not possible to combine two siidhyas in one sentence. 69. OBJECTION. Indeed, the unity of a sentence is broken upU!i when it contains two siidhyas that are independent, but not when the two are interdependent. And here the two siidh)'QS are interdependent since the realization of heaven is contained in the realization of the injunction. That is what the Author says: \" When the niyoga is realized, everything else in accordance with it is also realized;\" and: \"Why should tile realization of the fr uit not be held to be subservient to the realization of the injunction ?\"146 Therefore there is no conflict here. REFUTATION. No ; unless heaven is realized, how can the injunction be realized? Without the realiza .. tion of heaven neither the qualification, nor the object, nor anything else required by the injunction is realized. 70. OBJECTION. In the case of the qualifications for periodical rites the injunction does not require the I realization orany fr uit.H7 Nor does an injunction to one act fa il to apply to a person who reaJly desires another fruit.

Besides, a person who is desirous of heaven also opens and shuts his eyes ; for you these actions do not subserve his realization of heaven. Why not consider the sacrificing an action of the same kind? There are some who do not accept that it is a means of realizing heaven. . 71. REFUTATION. If that is the view, we ask: Are the sacrifice etc., \\vhich are to be grasped by the cognition that they are such means, eliminated from the injunction? On this point : When the injunction does not mean to convey a relation between the object to be realized and the means of realizing it, then all acts are fruitless. Therefore, it is sound to maintain that from the injunctive suffixes therc results first the cognition that they are indeed the means to realize the desired object, and that subsequently the desire for this object prompts a person to undertake the act of realization. But it is improper to maintain that the primary denotation occurs in the expressing of a meaning that was previously unknown, and that the denotation in the expressing of any other meaning is secondary. We conclude that ordinary, non-Vedic statements give rise to cognitions concerning meanings that :lre just so established by these statements."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"5B 72. OBJECTION. But these cognitions do not arise from the denoting power of language, but result from Inference. For these statements, though their denota­tions in conveying certain meanings are consciously known once their proper meanings have been learnt, do not furnish complete certainty about their meanings merely upon being-heard by a listener, when they are accompanied by doubt which is created by the listener's observation that in one case or other statements have deviated from their proper meanings. And, unless there be complete certainty, the meaning will remain unknown; for no knowledge can arise jn one's mind from uncertainty. If the meaning of a statement is not known, the listener wants to discover it: U The speaker uses words whose meanings apparently admit of being connected; and reliable persons do not usc words whose connections are unkno\\\\'n i\" and the listener realizes that therefore the speaker has knowledge of such a connection.

Therefore, a .s tatement does indeed instantly convey a certain meaning to the listener if he knows the rdation between the '\\\\'ords and their me.. \"lnings. It docs not require knowledge of the basis. Defo·re there is complete knowledge on the part of the listener about the basic knowledge of the speaker, and, fu rther, when the meaning bas been expressed, the question rises: HHow does he know tlJis ?\" and Inference proceeds to resolve that question. You want to infer : \"Didthe speaker know somtthing ?\" or wish to infer his knowledge of the connection of the different meanings. But the mere knowledge that the speaker knew something is not enough fo r utterance and action concerning a state­ment-meaning to proceed. Inference of a cognition concerning the connection of different meanings is im­possible without a prior cognition of such a connection. This being so, the meaning of the statement must be known first. For cognitions whose particular objects are not connected, are not connected themselves. Nor is a particular meaning established by cognitions that ate inferred to be such.

To conclude, the cognition of an established fa ct in statements . like \" there is a fruit on ' the river. bank'l is strictly of verbal origin and does not arise from Inference .. Therefore the position that statements produce valid knowledge only if they deal with a previously unknown Icarya is taken only by people whose judgments are 'stultified by their continuous preoccupa­tion with their own theories. In the manner set forth abo\\ e it is true that statements may bear meaningfully and informatively on other meanings as well. Consequently, all the statements of the Upani�ad, which set fo rth the existence of a categorically different Person (e.g. H He is the overlord of the Universe, sovereign of all. He commands aU the world\". H9 \"All this is manifest to HimlSIl etc.\") are authoritative etc..\") are authoritative as to what they state. since they produce indubitable and unreversed knowledge of their contents. 15. Nor do statements concerning established facts lose their authority simply because of tIle con­sideration that repetition or reversion might be antici­pated on the strength of our assumption that either a corroborating or an invalidating cognition about the same facts could conceivably occur ; for the same thing would also apply to statements concerning liif)'a. Be­sides, a karya can also be known through other meanS of knowledge, e.g. the kiirya that firClvood is to be fetched ; for it has been admitted that that kiirya can also be known through �lDotl!er me:tns of knowledge as"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"61 in the case of the cooking of the adana.'\" Or if a statement which sets fo rth a klirya about a categori­cally different act like the agnihotra is held to be authoritative because no other authority fo r it can be conceived to e.'Cist,-why, since there is not a ghost of other authority for the exic;tence of the Bh<1gnvan whose personality consists in unsurpassed knowledge, Sove­reignty and beatitude, it is all the same, depending on what partisan view one takes! Moreover, if a cognition concerning a content that is also known through another means of knowledge does not recognize its own content as authoritative, since it has already been taken care of by another authority, this non-authoritativenes of its content is beyond experience for it is a mere matter of as sump_ tion. Therefore it must be1l1aintained that all indubi_ table and unreversed knowledge is authoritative, regardless of whether its content is established, or yet to be perfonned, or anything else. Hence we reject our opponent's position. 76. The objectionl!i2 that omniscience is acquired by means of the regu1ar senses is incorrect,I5S because iruti contradicts it : \"He sees without eyes, hears with ears ; he who does not see with the eye, who sees the eyes, has neither effect nor instrument ; \"13-t H know­ledge, strength and action are natural to Him,\"\"'!; etc. These �rutis do not speak metaphorically, for there is no authority fo r this assumption. !\\fetaphorical usage is assumed when the primary meanings of the srutis make no sense. Since the primary meaning here makes sense, the assumption of metaphorical use is baseless."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"62 77. OBJECTION.

If you retort that non�existence is decided by the non-, apprehension of what should be there, we reply that this does not hold in our case since the object, that is the said Person, is actually apprehended through Scripture itself, which is the highest-ranking a.mong the 3.sserubJ}' of the means of knowledge. Nor does it militate against Inference; for how could an Inference which disproves that Person arise at all, slow-moving as it is) when its obj ect is instantly refuted by the rapidly arising scriptural cognition?

True, the identity of sacrificial pole and SUD, which is asserted by Scripture, is cancelled by another means of knowledge, namely Perception alone, because the difference between a piece of wood and the disc of the sun is indeed obvious. Besides, in this case it is legitimate to assume metaphorical usage, for the statement of this idcntitr is an arlhaviida, since it forms onc single statement with the proximate injunction a.bout the unction of the sacrificial pole. m Tllcre is no other injunction to ,,,'hieh it could be accessory as an ar/harada.

It is impossible that Perception"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"69 or another means of knowledge fo rms the basis for the other Tantras, and they themselves do also not claim that Scripture is the basis. Besides, because they communicate a meaning that is incompatible with the conclusions of the npan�ads the view that Ihese Tantras are based on Perception or Scripture is ,ubl.ted. For there are fo ur kinds of followers of the way of Hre set fo rth in those Tantras, the Kfipalikas, Kala. mukhas, pasup.tas and Saivas. The Kiipalik. doctrine is described as fo llows: the reward of releme is attained by knowing what the six mudrikiis'78 are and by wearing them, not by knowing Brahman. As they say, \"He who knows the identities of the six mwJ,ikiiJ and is expert in the supreme Mudra, and meditates upon the self in the vulva posture, attains nirviU;ta.\" The six mudrilc& of the Kapalikas are stated to be the earring, necklace, pendent, head ornament, ashes and the sacri· ficial theread: there are two more subsidiary mudras described, namely skull and skull-staff. One whose body is marked by these mudriis will not be reborn in the world.\" Now, the srutis do not bear out their view that the knowledge of such paraphernalia, the wearing of them and the concentration on the body in the immoral vulva posture are means to attain release, for the �rutis expound that release is attainable only by one who has renounced all sensual desires of this world and the other world and who concentrates on the soul Vasudeva as the cause of the entire Universe: \"knowing Him one goes beyond death; there is no other path to tread ctC.\"I79 The same is. true of the Kalamukhas who teach that certain practices, which are condemned by all the"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"70 sastra\" like eating fr om a skull, bathing in and tasting of �shes of cremated corpses, carrying a lngu4a sraff, putung up wine-cups and worshipping the dtity in them, wB) secure aU material and immaterial desires: these teachings arc outside the Veda. 84. Also some of the teachings of the P�upatas and the Saivas in which compatible and incompatible dements 3rc indiscriminately mixed are likewise out­side the Veda. The Pii�upata system is 'as fo llows: there are individual soul, which are called pa�us. cattle, and their overlord is Siva, the Lord of Cattle. To assist the souls Siva has composed the Paficadhyayi.'BO There the five Categories are ex ... plained, nn.mc:;,ly, Cause, Effect, Injunction, Yoga and the Cessation of Misery. The Cause is of two kinds, material and instrumental. Rudra is the instrumental cause and a sixteenth part of him is the material cause, The Effect comprises the elements fr om Manal'8l to earth. The Injunction is stated to comprehend principally a number of rites, secret practices, bathing and lying in ashes etc.'82 The Yoga is said to be con� centration and the muttering of formula, OM etc.m. The Cessation of Misery is held to be release; thus-the five Categori�s afe enumerated.-The term neessation' armisery\" means total and final cessation of misery. The system holds that this cessation or release is de�ned by the annihilation of all the qualities of the differential soul. This conception of dod is held by the Saivas 3! well as the othen. And this view of God is entirdYJ incompatible with Scripture, for it is .. revealed in sruti tha:t the Supreme Brahman is both the material and the"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"71 instrumental cause of the Universe. Also, it is repeatedly revealed in the scriptures that release con­sists in perfect bliss. As the authoritativeness of these Tantras is already vitiated by' their mutual contradic� tions, it is not really necessary for them to be rejected with the stick of the Veda. . 85. Moreover, the Saivas etc. accept stages of life etc. that are outside the vaTTJafram. system that is proved by the Veda and are 'consequently outside the Veda. As they say,\" merely by entering Consecration one becomes instantly a Brahmin. A man becomes an ascetic by acceptir:g the Kapalika vow.\" 86. Let it not be said, How could Rudra, who is very trustworthy, promulgate such a vast collection of texts which are not authoritative? Nor is it right to hold that these texts are based upon the recollection of an author of the same name as Sivn, because the ground is overextensive. For the theory that the author Was in error and could be in error., because he was not Siva but some other person with the same name, can only follow if the Veda sublates the system; this latter ground is sufficient to prove the lack of authority of these texts and entails no overextension to other texts. And error is not entirely impossible in the case of such persons as Rudra etc. Or else one may reason that since Rudra may have composed such a system for the purpose of deceiving the world because he is known as a promulgptor of deceitful doctrines, it is not even necessary to assume error on his part. For thus it reads in the Varaha PuriiI}a, \"For Thou, strong.armed Rudra, must cause deluding doctrines to be expounded, the deceptions of"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"72 jugglers and the like as well as eoallieting practices.

Ular Likewise he shows that the worShip concerning himself a$ it is propounded in the Pasupata Tantras and other such Tantras is different and does not form part of the: worship of the Bhagavan: \" The said act of worship concerning me which is being observed is really outside the Veda.

The large numbers of statements like the preceding ones will not be written out here, because they are too numerous. It is clear enough that those who follow these scriptures are outside the Veda, as is stated in the same PurJiQ.a: uHe cursed those who kept the observances ofhairtuft, ashes and skull� Be you outside the Veda and disquali· fled for Vedic rites.

Consequently. since it cannot properly be said of the other Tantras that they are based either on Veda or on Perception, another cause must be assumed for them. 87. ODJECTION.

The reply to this is as fa lloW's : The Bhagavan, who has an immediate presentation of the entire collection of the Veda by virtue of the perfect knowledge that is natural to Him, observed that his devotees were not firm enough in their minds to retain and transmit the lessons of all the various sakh5s which consist of widely scattered injunctions. arthavddas and mantras of many different kinds; and having observed this he was moved by his compassion to condense the meaning of the Veda in an easily comprehensible way and to teach it so.

TIlis is the objection of someone who does not know the distinct meaning of the state­ment.

It is as in the Manavadharma­Mstra: \"The I.{gvcda is of gods and deities, the Yajurvcdaorman, and the Samavcda of the deceased ; therefore its sound is impure ;\"tn here the censure of the Samaveda serves to praise the other Vedas.

In this same way the above statement must be taken as praise of the Paficaratra..

The further objection20D that Pancaratra is non-Vedic because of the injunction that those who are qualified for Vedic sacraments etc. must undergo such sacraments described as Consecration because they are propitiations of the Lord, does not hold good. For such statements as iig niivai!1,lavam .. ,201 which enjoin the sacrament of consecration' upon those qualified for Initiatioll etc. as accessory to the ritual of the jyoti�toma etc. do not therefore become non-Vedic.

Moreover, the ground is either that the Pai'icariitra sacraments :lrC different from all Vedic sacraments, or that they are different from some Vedic sacraments. Not the latter alternative, fo r this would mean that the sacrament of Initiation ctc. is non-Vedic because it is different from the sacrament of Tonsure; nor the first alternative, because it does not escape the said defect? fo r the sacrament of Initiation is not different from all Vedic sacraments; and we have said that the difference (of Paficaratra sacraments) from Vedic sacraments is disproved on the ground that Paiicaratra Sastra is Vedic. 93.

As to the other explanation that has been given of these two sutras/!10 since it is v(j17iiniidz', i.e. \"a ground fo r validity\",221 the denial of the validity of Paiicaratra is not justified, because it entails over­extension. The invalidity, which is defined by the non-origination of knowledge through repetition or dubiety in the Tantras, is rejected, because knowledge is actually had from them. In order to remove the sllspicion of untruth occasioned by the speaker's character, the word lidi is used to convey the intended meaning that the Tantras are in fact spoken by a trust-worthy person. . Consequently the meaning is this: He always has direct knowledge of the entire world by virtue of the omniscience-which is part of His nature i He bestows man's wishes upon him, when He is satisfied-and he is satisfied by meditation alone j Him the experts in the Veda. describe as eternally satisfied in all His desires: how then can there be defects in Him like error, deceit etc. ? 104.

This question is thereupon ans\\\\'crcd : \"It is invalid, because of the impossibility of the origination of valid knowledge concerning a conflicting sense; and this impossibility itself i\" proved on the ground thilt there is independence of something that is dependent.\" Thus the siitra. utpattyas01.nbhaviit means : \"because it is impossible that a valid knowledge originates, since, as long as the dependent Pancaratra Tradition does not start proving thc validity of its own sense by establishing the validity of its basis) the cognition which originates fr om the independent preterpersonal scripture determines the Tradition's sense as being different, and consequently conflicting with itself.

If the priest were not to receive fees, the piija itself would remain fruitless; they take fe es in order to realize completely the excellence of the piija. At the conclusion of the worship one must give gold to the priest according to capacity; otherwise the fruit will go to the pUja priest himself, as is shown by the smrti: UA sacrifice fo r which a small fee is given kills (the sacrificer).\"'\" It is however prohibited that a covetous Vedic priest officiate as a priest after he' himself has put up his demands for a fect c.g. in the statement : (\"There is an error called 'garbage\"').

This starts the discussion Qf the Prabhak�ra theory on the limitations of the validity of verbal statements. Fitst general Mimarpsa views on the subject are discussed. 64.

A scriptural statement of the kind \"grass is green\" is not strictly valid in the sense that. in order to know that gran is green. we need a scriptural statement to that effect. Another proving factor, e.g., themeam of knowledge Perception, may turn up conceivably and thus mah: the scriptural statement superfluous; or we may find that grass is not invariably green, but changes its colour, which would reverse the scriptural statc:ment. Scriptural validity, i.e., Scripture', bdng a meam of knowledge, is to the Prabhakara Mimarpsaka. its being Ihe solt means of knowing a parti­cular thing. To the Prabhakara thi! validity is ideal in the case of injunctions concerning actions which, supra. sensibly, lead to a certain desired end. 65. The injunction concerning the (Jriana oblation includes I'ln injunction concerning the preparation of the oriana and the fetchingof firewood for the cooking. Since experience shows tbat for a cooking fire onc needs firewood I this kiirya is not strictly known on scriptural authority. 66. This objection ignores the priorities among pramiQ3s, or means of knowledge; for the Pribhakara, Perception, etc. are prior to, take prettdence of, Scripture in case of perceptible, etc. contents. Generally Perception is prior to Inference. To Yamuna, therefore, no priority of Perception to Scripture is given. which is expected since in his view Scripture may abo be an account of (God's) Perception. as in the case of Paftcaratra . • 67. This sums up the conclusion of the refutations of both the Nniyayika's and Mimarpllaka's views: the defects consequent upon the Nyaya proofs of God are avoided on the basis of scriptural examination, since Scripture can indeed validly pronounce on God. 68.

If Denotation, denotjng power, denotatJvenes3\" jn the fo nowing Prabhlikara discussiollS' have to be understood as the power of verbal statements to provide unprece­dented and non-superfluous knowledge concerning their contents. In the Pr.5bhakara view, a verbal statement by itsclf is denotative only in injunctive fo rms, while substantive statements ha'Vc denotation either through contextual connection with injunctive statements, or (but this is not strictly \"true\" denotation) through Tepef. ition of otherwise knowable fa cts. This view, which has obviously been developed fo r scriptural statements in the first place, i:s thereupon extended to ordinary languagt: as well. and ;s thus expressed jn the (oHowing 'heDry about learning language which is here understood. A child learns what certain sentences \"mean' by observing the action which his elders t<lke upon hearing these sentences. When he knows no language mr.aning (vyu.tjJatli). he may acquire knowledge by first hearing one adult teU another to \"get the cow,\" and SUbsequently observing that the other is getting the cow: by associating the two events he knows that an order to get the cow was the content of the first adult's statement Uget the cow.\" A remark without consequent action (e.g., \"It is hot today.\") can· not convey any such knowledge to one who does not know language. The process of the child knowing the sentence meaning is here described as artnapalh\" ureasoning by circumstantial implication;\" since there js no other ground for the $e�ond man's ge tting the caw, it must have been the tirst man's statement, 70.

This is an example like \"it is hot today j\" the young father', happy countenance is not considered an action. 75. E.g., the sentence It he who desires to go to heaven offers the soma sacrifice,\" is an injunctive statement in indicat­ive fo rm. 76.

He uses the Prabhakara's example of the factual statement : II A child is horn to you.\" A child who does not know language has no way of understanding the meaning or this statement hecause the young father'oS happine,s conveys nothing specific But, asks Yamuna, suppose the same child has witnessed his father reception of the cheering news and the �ubsequent preparations fo r a birth ceremony. Since one follows immediately upon the other, the child associates one with the other and can thus unuerslaOll the meaning of tbe statement, though the statement itself was no injunction. but a communication of an established fact. 132.
