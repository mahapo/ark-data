They are Val \\lf.lava, Salva an(! Siikta. The first is divided into two groups namely Piincariitra and Vaikhiinasa. As regards the general contents of Agama literature the subject-matter is generally dealt with under tour heads that is Jiiina, Yoga, Kriyii and Caryii. 1. Jiian : 2. Yoga: 3. Krly ii : Knowledge which leads to release or mukti. Concentration or meditation on any subject. Action - including ali actions from laying the foundation of th!l temple to the completion of the sacred Installation of the images therein. 4.

To Sum Up 391"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE AGAMAS INDIAN philosophy is nothing but a versatile compendium of Dhatma m all tts ramifications and possible proliferations. To an Indian, whatever be the assumptions about the ultimate reality, whoever be the preceptor and whatsoever be the ultimate source ol inspiration and knowledge, Dharma is essenttally a way of Iile, a logical way of thinking, a genial way of feeling and a congenial way of willing not only for one's ow,n individual well­being, but also for the summum bonum of his family, clan and society, for the weal and welfme of the whole of mankind at large, nay for the general well-being of the Universe as a whole wiU1 all its living and non-living beings. This well-known tenn Dharma is derived from the dhatu 'DHR' - which has three connotations. a) DHA RAJ:< A b) PO� AN A c) A V AS THAN A DHARMA is that whtch holds together the entire creation (the whole Universe), nurtures and sustains -it and helps it to continue to be and perpetuate itself. Whatever be the system of thought, whether in conformity to the Vedas or in non­confom1ity, whether Vaidiki or Avaidiki, every Indian sehool·of philosophy has emphasised Dharma one way or the other. It is Lbis principle of Dharma that is the rendezvous of all the different schools of Indian thought. Philosophers may differ in their conclusions and convictions about the ullimate reality, they may say It is one or more than one or none at all, some may say the ultimate reality is a. person, others may say it is. an impersonal pnnciple, they may haye different ontologies and divergent epistemologies, they may employ or underline . ."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2 Philosophy of Penceretres di/Ierent means of approach for the ultimate realisation whether Joana, Bhakti or Kam1a, they make talk through their hats whatever they like, but none of them have ever ignorrd Dha1ma. Dhanna is the running cord in and through every philosophical system, on which all the beads of the different schools me stmng and by which the entire necklace of Indian philosophy is held together and presented to the world as an invaluable jewel, immemorial, incormptiblc, unfading, undying and rare . It is this Dharma that has given every school of Indiim thought an undying fame and an authentic note. Philosophy in India whatever be its tinge or tone or tune, has never been a pure academic pursuit, an item of am1-chair thinking or intellectual pursuit for its own sake. Philosophies arc born in India by the <:_onfrontation of dedicated men with evil, with the ills of life, philosophies ate made to relieve mankind of their sorrows und sufferings, to show them a path of self-realisation, to lead them to permanent happiness unsullied even by temporary relupscs. With this salutary end in view every one of the founders of the varying schools has in his repertoire a scheme of practice, a ptesc1ibcd way of living, a dharma to put it in one word. Precept and practice have never been divorced. Each illustrious preceptor was m himself an illustration of his philosophical concepts and intellectual convictions. He was himself the exemplar of his teachings and the rest would follow suit. When once the destination was dctenuined, the road of Dharma was immediately paveq to reach the destination. It was smooth going for the followers as they were confident of their destinations and had absolute trust in the path-layers. Hence the watch word of Indian Culture and Philosophy is DHARMA which it has not been possible for any westeme1· to translate it into a single word of his language. This is exactly the distinction and cynosur0 of Indian thought. ' Dharmat p1aram nil>ti ' - says the Blfiadlrapyaka Upanishad ( I • 4 -14) . There is nothing beyond Dham1a. 'Dharma visvasya jagata� pratishthll'-The entire Universe is. sustained on the foundation of Dham1a.

' Dharma eva hato hanti - Dharmo rakshati rakshitah (Manu -8 -15 ) Dharma is killed by the transgressor - Th� transgressor is ruined by himself in the process. He who protects Dluuma, preserves himself therein. The orthodox Hindu sincere to his heritage is of the conviction that the Vedas are the ultimate source and the true ueasurc-house of all Dharmas. ' Vedokhilo Dharmamii lam '- (Manu -2-6 ). ' Vcdo DhannamUlam ' - (Gautama Dharma Siira-I) . ' Upadishto Dharma\\! prativedam'- (Bodhllyana Dharma Sutra-1).

Just as the pulses reveal a binary fission when broken, so also tlJe S mtis when probed into and understood rc�eal the two pans of the Vedas and the Tantras, -it is presumed. Sometimes the Vedas and the Tantras, the Nigamas and the Agamas are compared to that legendaty bird, Gan(labhem(lc;la which has two necks with faces contained in one and the same body. Often in ancient Indian lore we meet with the tenns, Smti, Veda, Agama and Amnaya almost as synonyms with an interchangeable impon (As paryiiyavacakas). In the context o/' explaining Vedic tcnns we find references made as-' Ity[Jgmniit '. Similarly in the course of explaining Tantric doctrines, we come across wfctences made as-' Iti Smtel,l'. It is unfortunate to find that sometimes some people look down on the very word 'Tantra' as though it means something crooked, something undesirable, as though it is unbecoming of honest beings and something of a subterfuge and resorting to cheap if not reprehensible means of gaining one's end. This kind of view is uncalled for. Before delving into the meaning and significance of the Tantra Sastras, it is necessary to know the exact meaning of the very tem1 'Tantra' itself.

It may mean any of the following: Family-protection, an established system, the best medicine, the most important or the outstanding, a spider, the corollaric� of any system of thought, a branch. of vedic knowledge, a thing that may serve double purposes, or that which prescribes a particular way of doing a thing. In popular"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Agamas 5 parlance Tantra may mean a know-how; Often Tantra Sastra is characterised as a 'Prayoga Sastra' - a spiritual technique, a religious technology, a ' Do-it-yourself' Sastra for the aspirants. Often Tnatriki Sruti is called a Siddhanta Agama, a Sadhana Sastra. Amarasimha says ' Tantriko jf'fatasiddhantal) ' -He means thereby that Tantra is Siddhanta - an established system of knowledge and practices. He who· is well-vCised in the Siddhanta is called a Tantrika. The different established systems of thought such as the Mimamsa, Nyaya, Vaiscshika usually delineated as Darsanas are also often referred to as Tantras. For instance Sankara in his Brahm a Sutra Bhashya (3. 3. 53 ), while commenting on Purvamimamsa Darsana refers to it in the style­Prathama-tantre -thereby implying that Darsana and Tantra are interchangeable terms. Often great scholars arc conferred with the title 'Sarvatantra Svatantra' extolling their erudition and mastery of the Sastras. If Manu could call the Vedas 'Veda Sastra, - Veda Sastram sanatanam ( 12-99 ), the Tantras can be called 'Siddhanta Sastra' with equal force. For instance Sankara calls Samkhya, a Tantra. Why , the Samkhya Karika does so itself, by calling its own Darsana a Tantra in Kmika -70. There is of course the long-standing controversy whether the Vedas are really ' Apaurusheya - Authorless' -While the orthodox Hindus believe so, indologists both eastern and western are of the opinion that the authors of the Vedas may be assigned various dates upto 1500 B.C. Recent excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro and also Tilak's researches have pushed back the origin of the Vedas by many thousands of years. I do not wish to enter into the controversy whether the Vedas are Apaurusheya or Paurushcya. The point relevant here is that the Srutis lose their claim as revealed literatme. If the Vedas· have their authors, then the Tantras will have to have their authors. These very same indologists arc of the opinion that the Agamas and Tantras are of later origin than the Vedas and that they are definitely later than the Purlil:ms. They are of the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"6 Philosophy of Penceretres further opinion that the Purfu,las themselves arc newly created Post-Buddhistic literature specially fOJmulatcd in such a way as to offset Buddhistic' influences and boost Hinduism If that is so Tantric literature is to be considered as of vc1 y late origin and cannot be deemed as pari passu with the Vedas as claimed earlier in tenns of the accredited convictions of I he orthodox schools. The above argument of the lndologists that the Tantras :uc of recent origin later to the Pulii!)as, can be easily refuted by pointing out that in the various Purfu)as themselves we find mention made both of the Vaidiki and Tantriki f01ms of worship. So also the allegation that the Tantras arc of Post-Buddistic origin can be easily refuted. Lord Buddha himself condemned the Tantric worships of Brahma, Indra, Vi�J.lU, Klity:iyini, Ou)apati and others. Lalitavistiira, a g1eat Buddhistic work, m akcs mention of Buddha's denouncement of Tantnc culls in its 17th chapter. After Buddha, we find Buddhists themselves began to have their own innumerable Tamms. They veritably began to worship innumerable deities such as Adibuddha, Prajnupiiramita, Manjusri', Tar<�, Arya-Tluii and so on . In other words Buddhists could not resist the temptations of having their own Tantras on the lines similar to those of the !lind us. Thus if Buddha could denigrate Tam ric worship, the Tnntras should have existed earlier to Buddhism. Quite in contrast with the considered opinion of the lndologists, one of the Tantras themselves, namely the Narli)ii(liya Tantra points out that the Vedas themselves have originated from the Y AMALAS, a class of Tantras of considerable importance and also magnitude.

The Y\"amala tradition believes in a huge pantheon or' gods and goddesses. Tantric Sadhana is open to all castes. It is believed that the Rigveda has originated from Rudra Yamala, Sarna Veda from the Brahma Ylimala, Yajur V,eda from Vishnu Yamala and Ahtarva Veda from the Sakti Yam ala. Siddha Sarvananda in his compendium called Sarvoll asa Tantra means to convey the idea that the Y\"amalas arc so ancient that they precede even the Tantras. All these of course are highly controversial issues. According to Brahma Yamala it is believed Isvara communicated the secret knowledge to Sfikantha. This Srikantha reincarnated himself near Prayag and communicated the Tantra in 1,25,000 anushtubh slokas to various disciples and that one of those disciples was a Bhairava and that that \\ •as how many Bhairavas came to know of it."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"8 Philosophy of Penceretres According to Maha-Siddhasiira Tantra, Bharatavarsha is divided into three KRANT AS or sub-divisions and each Kr 5nta is said to possess 64 Tantras.

Saktimangala Tantra defines the Krantas. i) The land east of the Vindhya hills extending up to JAVA comprises Vishnu Kr5nta. ii) The country north of Vindhya hills including mainland CHINA forms Ratha Krlnta. iii) Rest of India westwards is Asva Kr5nta. Hindu temples could be found ill Indo China, Indonesia, Bali and many other islands. Images of Kiili, Tara, Rudra could be found all over the far east and south -east Asia. Even Egypt came under Asva Krdllta and worship of the Indian phallus was very popular there. In the B{ihannila Tantra it is said worship of Paramananda was in vogue in Persia. In Rpodesia phallic emblems made of gold have been discovered. The worship of ASHTAROTH, ASTARTE, ISHTAR referred to in.the Old Testament of the Bible is interpreted to be none other than the B fj iiksara - 'STRiM' - the tija of T ARA. Thus it is evident that Tantric worship was widely prevalent in ancient times in many parts of the world other than India even and that Indian influence was aU ,over Asia, Africa and the middle east too.

There is then another insinuation against the Tantras namely that the Agamas and Tantras represent a revolt against the Vedas. The objectioners quote the Bhagavadgita sometimes, stanzas 45 and 46 in Canto 11. In the same Bhagavadgita Canto X, stanza 22 Krishna says · \" Of the Four Vedas, I am the Sima veda \" • Again in Canto XV Stanza No. 15 Krishna says · \" I am the Truth which all the Vedas seek to know.

Not only docs Tantra promulgate profound knowledge concerning Tattva (Cosmic principles) and Mantra (the science of mystic sounds), it breathes life into them so to say and makes them practicable. It helps in true practical realisation the greatness of the Tamras and Mantras. It helps in self-realisation through self-elevation so to say. One of the oldest Tanttas, the Nisvasa tantra Samhita is of the view that Tantra is just a culmination of the csoteiic aspects of Vedanta and Samkhya for the reason that it upholds the ultimacy of Siva with the validity of the world as an expiCssion of His Sakti. Siva, the supreme Lord is said to have taught his consort first the Vedanta, then the twentyfive Samkhya tattvas and finally Siva tantra. Pingalamata, another tantric text says that Tantra was fir,t communicated by Siva to Parvati. It is Agama with the characteristics of Chandas (Vedas). Kulamava Tantra (!1140-41) says that kuladham1a is based on and inspired by the truth of the Vedas. This Tantra says that there is· no knowledge (vidya) higher than that of the Vedas and no doctrine (Darsana) equal to Kaula · 'Na hi Vcdadhika vidya' -III-113.

Khanda II, Chapt. 2; Pranatoshini - 108). Gandharva Tantra (Chap!. 2; Pranatoshini -6) says that the Tantric sadhaka must be an astika, a believer in the Vedas, ever attached to Brahman, ever speaking of Brahman, living in Brahman and taking shelter in Brahman. That Hinduism is revealed in the six darshanas is a well-known fact. The six darshanas are the six stages through which the mind progresscss in its quest for Brahman. The six darshanas arc the six limbs. These six systems are not to be treated separately. They must be taken together as darsana is not a philosophy as such, but only a view point. Tantra is precisely a darsana and a sadhana sastra. In general it lays down different forms of practice for the attainment of the highest aim of human existence by one living the ordinary life of a house-holder. In this respect Tantra corresponds to the Upasana Khanda of-the Sruti. The Tantras arc classified under five heads namely: Saiva Sakta Vaishnava Saura and G1napatya.

Although il emphasises will and effort on the part of !he individual sadhaka, il glorifies self-surrender to !IJe Almighty and seeking His mercy and grace. It demands Bhakti and Prapatti, yearning love of the votury, the upasaka. The Tantric sadhana employs both the exoteric rituals of the Vedic type and the esoteric rituals of !he Yogic type. The 'Tantras just simplify the Vedic rituals and make greater use of esoteric symbols. We know the esoteric symbolism was evident even in the Brahmanas and Upanishads , Ex: Satapatha Brahmarya I. 3. 2-3. The same account is repeated in the opening verses of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad also. The Tantras place greater emphasis on the esoteric sacrifice. So we need not hesitate to say that the Tanlras have emerged from the Vedic religion and sacrifices. In the vast reservoir of ancie.nt 'Hindu learning and Knowledge there are the Vedas, the Smritis, the ltihasas and the Puranas. Each by itself is very extensive in its literature. In addition to these we have a vast store of Tantric literature in the well-known five forms namely Bouddha, Jaina, Sakta, Saiva and Pancaratra. These are also known as ' Agamas' literally meaning 'additions' - as distinguished from Vedic literature.

No instruction of any ordinary person can be valid by itself. The special ritualistic processes associated with the Pancaratra cannot be known by perception or by inference.

Even if it be conceived that there is a person whose perception is limitless, there is nothing to suggest that he should be able to instruct infalliably about the rituals such as those enjoined in the Pancaratras.

The word ' Sattvata' indicates a lower caste and the terms 'Bhagavata' and 'Sattvata ' are interchangeable. It is said that a 'Sattvata' of the Pancama caste who worships in temples by the king's orders is called a ' Bhagavata'. It is further argued that the PancarJtrins may have all the external marks and appearance of Brahmins but yet they are not so regarded in society, that at social gatherings and in dinners the Vaidic brahmins do not sit in the same line with the Bhagavatas or the followers of the Pancaratra. Worshippers of images are to be looked down. To eke out their livelihood the Sattvatas worship images and live upon the offerings for initiation and those made to temple Gods. These Pancaratrins do not perform the vedic duties and so have no relationship or common ground with the brahmins and so they cannot be regarded as brahmins.

It is said vehemently that even if we are to look at a man who bas taken to worship as a means of livelihood, by chance, we become polluted and we are consequently to be purified by properly prescribed vedic purificatory rites. ll is thus concluded in many of the Smritis that the Pancaratra texts are adopted by the retrograde sattvatas or the bhagavatas and that therefore the pancaratras must be condemned as non-vedic and put down as invalid. As an annexe to this vituperative argument it is fu rther pointed out that if in fact this pancaratra literature were founded on the Vedas there would be no sense in their recommendations of special kinds of rituals not already mentioned in the vedas. Yamuna coolly points out - May be some of the injunctions of the pancaratras do not tally with the injunctions of the brahminic smriti literature. But such contradictions are not important as both are based on vedic texts."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"32 Philosophy of Pancaretras ' Vedokhilo dharmamulam smritisile ca tadvidam' . \" Sruti smriti vihito dharmah . Sa sarvo abhihito vede sarvajnanamayo hi sah\" -Since the validity of the brahminic smrutis is said to be based on the vedas, there is no necessity fo r the pancaratra to acquiesce to the injunctions of these smrutis. About the Paurusheyatva or Apaurusheyatva of the Vedas -Even if it is acclaimed that the vedas arc the literary compositions of a person, then that Divine person who directly perceives t11e sources of merit or demerit enjoins the same through his grace by composing the vedas for the benefit of human bj:ings. Even the Mimamsikas admit that all worldly affairs are the effects of merit and de-merit. The Divine being who has created the world knows directly the sources of merit and demerit that have been responsible for the pattern and shaping of the world and its human affairs. It is well known that thq world cannot be produced directly through the effects of our deeds. There has to be an agent who utilises the effects of our deeds and then produces the world in terms of Karma or Adrishta. All the scriptures acclaim that such an agent is none other than God Himself, the Omniscient and the Omnipotent. Yamuna then concludes, it is this very God who on the one hand created the Vedas prescribing Iiluals and sacrifices for mankind for the attainment of pleasures and happiness both in this world and in the heavens hereafter, and who on the other hand created the Pancaratras also for the benefit of mankind not for the mundane well-being and the pleasures of Heaven perhaps, but for the highest bliss of adoring God, worshipping f!im and finally attaining His immediate presence in God's permanent abode and thus avoiding the cycle of births and deaths once for all. Thus what applies to the Vedas as the compositions of God, the same refers to the Pancaratras also as equaUy the compositions of God, why as even better compositions of God as · t11ey advise men on everlasting happiness."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Pancaratra To quote from Agama pramanya again:-\" Yadanubhava nibandhanam Vedapramanyam Tadanubhava-nibandhanam pancaratrapramanyam iti \" -33 \" Nanu ca kimidamapaurusheyatvam Vedanam , yadi nitya­varnarabdhatvam samanamidam pancaratratantranam \". , \" Srutimurdhni prasiddhena sarvajncnaiva nirmitam \" \" Tantram mithyeti vaktum nah \" Katham jihva pravarttatc \". There are some who deny a legitimate infmencc of a creator from. the creation and consider the Vedas an eternally existent composition uncreated by any divine being whatsoever (Apaurusheyatva). Even in such cases the reasons and proofs advanced for the validity of the Vedas and smrutis are equally tenable for the validity of the Pancaratra literature also. Further as a matter of fact from the very vcdas themselves we can easily know that their composer is God Himself the Supreme Being. This Supreme Being refen-cd to in the Upanishads is none other than Vasudeva. It is Vasudeva that is the Composer of the Pancaratra. Also it is pointed out that the Vedas apart from discoursing on Vidhis and Nishcdhas, also describe the nature of the ultimate reality as the Divine person. The Pancaratras also discourse on Narayana or Vasudeva as the ultimate reality and therefore as authentic as the Vedas themselves. It is interesting and also distressing to note that while a few exclusive followers of the vcdas decry the pancaratra and denounce the pancaratrins in an unbecoming way, the champions of the Pancaratra invmiably point out that tl1e philosophy and the practices of the pancaratra do not in any way contradict the vedic teachings and even at the worst they don't clash with the mandates of the vedas but only run parallel to the vedic injunctions. The Pancaratrins do not want to be labelled as avaidic.

They rather go gallantly to the rescue of the vedas and demurely state that the desired end as recommended in the pancaratras is not diffe rent from that prescribed in the vectas. Sometimes it is pungently pointed out that if the pancaratra doctrines were in consonance with the vedic injunctions then one would have had certainly discovered the relevant vedic texts from which they were derived. Though this remark smacks a little of arrogance on the part of the vedic fanatics, Yamuna coolly replies that the pancaratra texts were produced by God Narayana Himself fo r the benefit of devotees who were. impatient of following the elaborate details of rituals as prescribed and described in the Vedic literature. In the interests of preserving the sanctity of the vedas and protecting their impressive statclines of aspect it may not be desirable to disclose the relevant vedic texts supporting the pancaratra texts as otherwise it would definitely mean exposing the loopholes and voids in vedic literature. It really looks obtuse and crass sometimes when it is pointed out that the pancaratra recommends special ritual ceremonies in addition to the vedic ceremonies and that therefore they arc non-vedic. An intelligent reply can be given to this broad-side by just stating that it implies argument in a circle. The Pancaratras are themselves not non-vaidic and the additional ceremonies can no more be so. It is often disgustingly repeated that Badarayana has refuted the Pancaratra doctrines.

Yamuna in his Agama pramanya, though not truculently, at least succinctly has pointed out that the Pancaratra doctrines are not avaidic. It is often taken as conclusively proved and as a closed issue that the vedic Jleople were not image worshippers. It is often contended that image worship and temple worship were of later origin and hoisted on the vedic people subsequently. The conflict between the vedic people and the image worshippers seems to have been a long one. Of late we have ample evidence to show that even in the second century B.C. the Bhagavata cult was a living religion, not only in the south of India but also in Upper India. Ample evidences arc dug out to prove that image worship was in vogue in India in the sixth cemury B.C. The testimony of the Besnagar (BHILSA) column and other inscriptions shows that even the Greeks were converted into the Bhagavata cult .. The Mahabharata speaks of the Sattvata rites according to which Vishnu was worshipped. It also refers to the Vyuha doctrine of the Pancaratras. The Narayaniya section refers to Svetadvipa as the anginal home of the pancaratrins. Nobody can gainsay the great antiquity of the pancaratras and their authenticity and authority. But there is always the undercurrent of resentment against the pancaratras (particularly in the minds of the avowed custodians of the vedas) for the simple reason that the pancaratras easily displace many of the elaborate vedic sacrifices and rituals by idol worship, that they promote universality and a common approach and help in making God more easily accessible to the worshipper. Of course reluctantly they give the pancaratras a status and standing although all the while the pancaratrins never accuse the vcdas, never belittle their votaries and even go to the extremist limit of calling the vcdas as their source, guardian and friend.

Later sages such as Au i, Angirasa, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Vasista and Svayambhuva also learnt this Ekayana veda from Narayana.

The vedic fury is unleashed against the Pancaratrins for the simple reason that they made no distinction between women and men, Pancama and Sudra or a Sudra and Brahmin, so far as religion was concerned. They the pancaratrins acclaimed that even the so called pancamas, sudras and women were entitled to worship and were deseiVing of God's grace, that sinners also could repent, appeal for God's mercy and app10ach him if God willed so.

Therefore some of the more sophisticated thinkers have. yielded to the viewpoint that God could be the author of the vedas or atleast its editor for mankind. The simple argument of U1e pancaratrins is, just as God gave the world the vcdas, the same God gave the world the Agamas also for the benefit of mankind. Might be the Agamas strike a different note of worship not described in the vcdas, but yet definitely suggested and referred to in the vcdas. Idolatry, temple worship, mother worship (worship of La kshmi, Sarasvati and Parvali in her various forms such as Sakti, Kali, Durga, Tara, Tarini and other Goddesses), the concepts of Bhakti and Prapatti, might not have been advocated largely in th<; vcdas and dealt with in dct�ul. These arc the special subjects ol the Agamas and Tantras. Anyway the point at issue is that pancaratra agama cannot be openly inveighed against, merely because some of its precepts and practices arc not brought to a focus in the vedas, amplifJCd and expatiated upon by the vcdas. Yet they arc not ignored in the vcdas let alone being repudiated. They arc rcfctrcd to and that is why it is invatiably pointed out with justif1cation by all the Acharyas, that the Pancaratra cults arc touched upon and endorsed by the vcdas.

That the tenets and practices of the Pancaratra are approved by t11e vcdas and admitted by the smritis and puranas is now well established, thanks primarily to the logic and logistics of argument as primarily employed by Yamunacharya in his Agamapramanya and subsequently followed by Ramanujacharya and Desika. By the testimony of the srutis, puranas and the Pancaratra samhitas themselves we can safely conclude without any hesitation that the tenets of pancaratra were first pronounced by Narayana Himself to the beseeching saints. However much we may scruumsc the philosophy and the practices of the pancaratra we cannot find even a streak of self-contradiction in its philosophy nor can we detect any detestable, unwanted or displeasing practices in its religion. Rather we can observe very pleasing and enlightened methods of approach to Ood­rcalisation as also salient and courteous features of self­realisation in society, in the comity and fr aternity of mankind. It is the philosophy of having fai th and trust in one All N\\erciful Almighty in seeing God in man and in all His creations, in worshipping God, adoring Him, loving Him by first knowing all His great gunas, in suJTendcring to Him absolutely and thereby elevating oneself to Divinity and finally in endeavouring to reach His Fternal Abode once for all by passing the ever I'Cvolving cydc of births and deaths."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE LANDMARKS OF PANCARATRA ·. ITS LITERATURE VARIED ARE the interpretations and meanings given to the term Pancaratra. Each interpretation emphasises a particular aspect and therefore all the interp1·etations taken together help us in getting a synoptic and a synergetic view of it. One of the Samhitas says that it is called pancaratra because it consists of five lectures delivered by God Narayana to five deities, Ananta, Garuda, Visvaksena, Brahma and Rudra respectively during five nights (Pancaratra). Another Samhita indicates that it is called pancaratra because by it five other systems of thought namely Samkhya, Yoga, Pasupata, Bouddha and Arhata (Jaina) are obscured, that is, made nights (darkened- Ratriyante). ' Pancetarani sastrani ratriyante mahantyapi ' 'Tatsannidhau samakhyasau tena Joke pravartate' In Padma samhita it is specifically stated as follows : ' Slunkhya yoga - vaiseshika -nyaya -mimamsakhyani ' ' 'Panca itarani sastrani yatra ratriyante ( adrisyani bhavanti ) iti ya vyutpattih pancaratra sabdasya ' -By the inculcation of the doctrines and practices of the pancaratra cult the other systems and disciplines as those of Samkhya, �oga, vaiseshika, nyaya and purvamimamsa are darkened, dulled, and screened out. A third derivation for the meaning of the term pancaratra is given, giving the connotation of' knowledge' to the term 'Ratra'.

The very forms of Vishnu as conceived and detailed in the Pancaratra Agamas may not have been actually worshipped in the temples of India. Aniruddha and Pradyumna as such arc not actually worshipped. Vasudeva may not be the actual name of the deity worshipped. As Ktishna, an incarnation He is mostly worshipped. Similarly Samkarshana is not veritably worshipped by that name. Samkarshana as Balarama the brother of Krishna incarnation is worshipped only in Purl and a few other temples such as near Udipi. (Of course Balarama docs not actually represent the second Vyuha ). The Vyuha worship as such might not have been in vogue In temples. Even now we don't come across them normally in any temple worship.

The Alwars in particular extol idolatry and temple worship fo r the simple reason that God's presence is brought into the idol consecrated and the temple is made the abode of God, the heaven on earth as it contains within itself the living presence of the Holy as conceived in terms of His avatara or descent or in terms of His choice revelation to the seers and sages. This fecilitates Prapatti, absolute surrender to the will of God. It helps face-to-face surrender to the Almighty in the form and person of the idol installed. God can no Jnngcr keep Himself out of sight from man, can no longer hide lfimself in His ivory tower of a Paramapada. He is brought to the public forum and is made easily accessible to any petitioner. But for this concept of 'Arcavatara ', the presence of the Holy in the image consecrated, the SJivaishnava concept of Prapatti, Sharanagati, as the surest means to Salvation could not have had an extensive circulation , nor could it have the most popular appeal, absolute validity or universal leverage.

It is with the blessings and grace of the mother so to say he has to seck the father. That is the meaningful convention adopted by every Srivaishnava . We observe that the Pancaratra and the Bhagavata school have successfully substituted genuine mental worship for the elaborate sacrificial worship enunciated in the Karma khanda of the Vedas. Without outright decrying actually the efficiency of sacrifices, the Pancaratra has acclaimed the superior efficiency of Dhyana, contemplation of God's fonns and name, and God's attributes. This attitude was mooted even by the Upanishads and the Gita. For instance the Chandogya Upanishad- III -16-17. After explaining how long life may be attained by construing the period of man's life as the morning, the mid-day and 'the third Savana or sacrifices, and meditating on the identity of the Vusus, Rudras and Aditya, the deities of the sacrifices with the pranns or life principles in the various stages, the Upanishad proceeds'to �tate : ' Sa yadasisishati yat pipasati, Yan na ramatc, ta asya dikshah' 'Atha yad asnati, yat pi bali, yad ramate tad upasadair eti ' 'Atha yadd hasati yaj jakshati, yau maithunam carat!, stutasastrair eva tad eti ' ' Atha yat tapo danam atjavam ahlmsa satya­vacanam iti' ta asya dakshinah '.

The Pancayajna, MahayaJna as it i� called by the Pancaratrins has completely displaced the vedic yajnas and their all-absorbing activities. In the concept of Pancayajna we have the worship of live so to say, of Gods, Pitris, beings in general, men in our midst and lastly the Rishis.

Prof. T.Rajagopalachari wtites -\" There is no foundation it seems to me for the suggestion of scholars that the Bhagavadgita is especially a Pancaratra text book or that the writer was a Pancaratrin bent on extolling Sri Krishna as identical with Vasudeva of the Pancaratra. At the sume time it would be rash to suppose that the Bhagavata doctrines were unknown to the author of the Bhagavadgita or that they originated later than the date of the composition of this work. There seems to be a studied attempt in the Bhagavadgita to represent no sharp contrast of views in the matter of worship of deities other than Sri Krishna himself. There is only a general condemnation of the worship of inferior deities as being futile. The Samkhya and yoga doctrines are presented as each commendable 'by itself though the attempt to bring them into line"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"64 Philosophy of Pancaratras with the teaching of the Gita is successfully made in the earlier chapters. The only conclusion we can safely draw l� that the Pancaratra system is of earlier date than the Mahabharata and the Bhagavadgila whether the works arc regarded as contemporaneous or as of different dates\". Pancaratra has done the greatest service to Hinduism. It has strongly reacted against the 'polytheism and speculative Pantheism of the vedas. It has emphasised monotheism in the fonn and person of a supreme deity namely Narayana as the ultimate Reality. More than being the Creator of the Universe He has bee\"n characterised as a father with abundant mercy and grace. Pancaratra has not only divested the Vedas of innumerable Gods, it has provided an effective check against the enormous proliferations of the vedic rituals. It has given a mcnningful symbolic significance to the vedic rituals and has actually made them not only elegant but also charming arid easy with a soul-stirring appeal. It is because of the impact of the Pancaratras on the vedas, that the Bhakti sutras of Narada and Sandilya have been made possible. The Pancaratra agama picked up the concepts of Bhakti in the Vedas, enlarged them and made them the universal means of worshipping a monotheistic God. The Pancaratra tantra gave its votaries a God who could be loved and adored. While Buddhism decried the vedic Gods and impeached the vedic sacrifices, It went the way of atheism. Even after dethroning the vedic Gods and levelling up the castes Buddhism could not continue to hold the masses in leash. The average Hindu could be without the vedas and its ritualistic and sacrificial lore. But he could not be without a Gdd to be worshipped and adored. That was the weakest point in Buddhism. That was why later on Shaktaism coloured Buddhism and there ensued Mahayanism which substituted Buddha himself an object of worship and made the very denier of God, a God himself. Where Buddhism failed to achieve its objectives of doing away with innumerable Gods and yedic sacrifices and rituals in an outright fashion to the satisfaction of all its followers, the Pancaratra scored an enduring victory by not"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Landmarks of Pancaratra 65 adopting an outright scorched earth policy in so far as the vedic lore was concerned, but by winning over popular appeal in lhe ways of moulding vedic rituals on a sanguine and salutary basis, in maintaining similarity of form but change of content and in transforming the entire attitude of the worshipper from compelling the God to meet his demands to a reverential and loving approach. Even the nature of the petitions was completely changed. It was not for mundane pleasures that God would be appealed to. It was for His loving grace and for Salvation. Thus the Panearatra was able to bring about an outnght reformation in the thoughts, attitudes and deeds of its followers unlike Buddhism, which aimed at a rebellion and a revolt. In fact much of the ideas of the Visishtadvaita philosophy of the Srivaishnavas is directly or indirectly innucnccd by the Pancaratra tenets. Vasudeva is conceived as the only one ultimate God to be worshipped. Everyone of one's daily routine duties is taken to be an act of worship of Vasudeva. One's living existence is itself taken to be a saga of dedication and devotion to God. In encouraging the worship of a personal God as the embodiment of all the moral and spiritual values, Pancaratra has been a corrective to Sankara's Mayavada also . The Pancaratra samhitas are in fact numerous and said to number over 200. Several samhitas have been printed, such as Jsvara, Kapinjala, Parasara, Padma, Bharadwaja, Lakshmi, Vishnutilaka, Sattvata , Ahirbudhnya, Brihad Brahma samhita etc. Reference to many samhitas are made in Pancaratra Raksha of Desika and also in the agama pramanya of Yamuna of the lOth century. Reference to Pancaratra adhikarana is made in the Brahmasutras of Badarayana II. 2/39 to 42. Ramanuja and Sankara have both commented on the Sutras. The great scholar Desika seems to have had access to more than 50 samhitas and he quotes from all of them freely. (Desika was the contemporary of Vidyaranya).

They give beautiful discourses on town planning, architecture and many other allied tcclmical subjects that need detailed study and research. Even the details of worship as delineated in the Pancaratras have many spiritual and psychological significance if only we probe into them with our knowledge of science and psychology.

The otthodox Vaishnavile as already pointed out believes that they were revealed by Bhagavan Narayana Himself. One can with difficulty fix the later limits of the Agamas. But to fix the earlier limits it is almost impossible as in the case of the Vedas and we have to bear in mind that the agamas like the Pancaratra presuppose the Vedas and the Upanishads.

It is the institution of temples that has been the greatest socialising force. The temple has not only been the abode of God on earth and the place of worship, it has also made possible great concourses of Hindus during festival occasions. They have been responsible for pilgrimages. Incidentally they have been the long standing nurseries of Indian art and architecture.

At the dawn of the cosmic day, the day of the Brahman there starts the jubilant and juggling process of Creation. The vast panorama of the entire Universe is majestically evolved. The jostling original Tattvas, such as matter, force and energy are fo1med. The stage is set for life's drama to be enacted in the Cosmos. The actors, the individual souls arc also proliferated in . unaccountable numbers from Brahman Himself- The cmtain is lifted and the Cosmic drama goes on and on in a weary way. It is only when Brahma's day ceases to persist any more, when the curtain is wrung down and when the Cosmic night begins, there begins the involution of all the manifestations, the great llissolution, PRALA Y A what the Hindus call. Everything is retracted back,' reabsorbed in Brahman. All over there are waters, water, water everywhere and darkness all around. That is eternal darkness, the long night so to say of Brahman, Dirgha Tamas. In the Nasadiya hymn of Rigveda it is said that at the beginning there was an utter darkness, an impenetrable void, neither being nor non-being, a chaotic cataclysm.

Everything was in a sub-merged or suspended state. The manifold world of Creation was asleep as it wc1e. The1c was ahsolute calm and poise all over similarto an ocean when there arc no waves tossing about and ruffling its breast. In this weird calm and uncanny equilibrium even the undissociable atLiibutcs of God and H1s energy were absolutely suspended. Nulhiy and Fullness together existed. ' Purnamadah Pumamidam pumat-puranam uducyatc' ' Purnasya Pummnadaya Pumameva avasishyate'. In the Nasadiya hymn it is stated that by the fervour and passion of austerity, by Desire, KAMA, the ' That One' began to evolve. This desire to become many again, was purely due to the Will of the ' That One'. It is stated in the hymn, that it was 'Mana so- Retah'- the Will bom out of itself- Why that' Will to Evolve' even the vedic seers arc unable to explain and simply exclaim- ' Ko-Vcda? who knows. The same idea is expressed in the Agamas also, but in a more sophisticated and pragmatic way. From out of this threatening calmness of Brahman, there darts forth a Samkalpa, a Will to Create. As though by His own command, by His own Samkalpa, there emerges from the calmness of Brahman, like the nash of a lightning in the sky, the Sakti of Vishnu. This Shakti of Vishnu which has emitted out of the darkness or streamed out of the emptiness of Brahman Himself so to say is called LAKSHMI. With this Emission of Lakshmi, the energy of Eternal Brahman, a hang is given for the piDccss of creation to start. In other words Lakshmi which was in Brahman all the while nnd thus far indistinguishable from Brahman, all of a sudden by her own . freedom (Kasmaccit svatantryat) da1ts out so to say like a streak of lightning· with an infinitesimal part of herself and in a dual role of' Acting'-KRIYA and· ' Becoming'- BHUTI. -i.e. in her double aspects of Force and Matter."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Lest P118se of the cosm1c Nlghl 'Ya sa saktinnahasutta Vishnostudharma dhannini' 'Ta-syah Kotyarbudamsena shakti dvc kathite tava' A.S.l4-7 ' Bhutisceti Kiiyasccti bhavya-bhavaka samJnite' 71 'Bhutih sa kriyaya jvala maluteva pranmyate'A.S.l4-8 or these two aspects of Lakshmi who is herself an aspect of Brahman, as !lashed out of Vishnu, as an emission from Brahman, this Bhuti Shakti is seen to include SOUL also.

In the entire Pancaratra philosophy the transcendent aspect of Vishnu, Vishnu as Para-Vasudevan or Para-Brahman is always in the background-in its own IVORY tower so to say. The entire world is brought about by the Shakti of Brahman ( Of course the Samkalpa or the Will of Brahman is in the background) and all the affairs of the world arc manoeuvered and practically controlled once again by this One Force that has shot out of this Paravasudevan namely Lakshmi in her two aspects of Kriya and Bhuti. . It is this Lakshmi as Bhuti that becomes the entire material Universe. It is this Lakshmi again as Kriya that vitaliscs and governs this Lakshmi as Bhuti. Kriyashakti is typed as Sudarshana, the Elan Vital of Vishnu, the energising force, the power and instrument of Vishnu - It is the ever pulsating vital force that is to be found in everything of this Universe. It is the Bhavaka Shakti.. Bhutishakti is the manifest Universe as such inclusive of all the animate and inanimate beings. It is the Bhavyashakti. Thus we can easily observe that the total Universe and the whole Truth about this Saga of existence is constituted of three ultimate realities namely Vishnu, Kriyashakti and Bhutishakti and all these three varieties can even be finally reduced to the One and the Only Ultimate Reality namely BRAHMAN called Vishnu by the Pancaratras. Although Lakshmi was in Brahman Himself and has just emitted herself out of Brahman, the two arc considered as distinct from each other though inseparable fl·om one another. The relation between Vishnu (Brahman) and Lakshmi is mostly of Aprithaksiddhi character, one of inherence or inseparable connection, Avinobhava or Samanv�ya as emphasised by Lakshmi Tantra. II. 17.

Though there is thus the apparent dualism between Vishnu and Lakshmi, the Lord and his consort Shakti, there is the happy compromise of identity at the source, at the level of Vishnu as the transcendent ultimate One and Only Reality. His aspect of Shakti, namely Lakshmi alone acts and brings about the manifestation of the Universe of course at the behest of her Lord as whatever she docs is just the expression of Vishnu's wishes.

There is a time limit, 'Kalaniyama' fo r every Vibhava­vatara. For instance 'Ramavatara' is said to have lasted for ll 000 ycurs whereas 'Krishnavatara' sthitikala is enumerated as only of the duration of 120 years. Areavatara has no such time limit. It can for ever provide 'Bhagavat sannidhya'. As long as the devotee wants Him in the IDOL, He stays in it. 2. For Ramavatara Ayodhyanagara was required; fo r Krlshnavatara Madhura was required. There was a specific 'Desaniyama' for each avatara. There is no such for 'area'. It can be in every home-if required and God provides Sannidhya in area. 3. In Ramavatara God had to have Dasaratha as His father and had to receive obeisance from the 'Sakcta nivasis'. In Krishnavutara He had to have Vasudeva for His fa ther and receive 'Scva' from the denizens of GOKUL, Madhura and Dvaraka. There is no such stipulation for area. Only the desire for God should be there. God is easily acces-sible for all the adhikaris. 4. In arcavatara-the image of God can be made of any material. There is absolutely no 'VASTU' niyama.

Arcavatara has the essential trait of 'Saulabhya­simabhumitvam' -God the Sriyahpati is 'Sahanasccla' -,He patiently puts up with all the foibles and drawbacks of His devotees, He leaves all His activities like 'Sayanasana, Snana, Bhojana, Gamana' etc., His 'Sakala Vyaparas' to His devotees and worshippers. He, sleeps when asked to, dines when served wilh: every moment everyone of His activities He loaves It to His devotees. Thus God the Sarva Svatantra targets �II His 'Svutuntrya' and becomes absolutely 'Puratantra'. He then helps His devotees to realise all their cherished desires. Hence 'Area' is considered to be the most favourable ground for easy access and quick realisation. As God Himself resides as a guest in His devotees' home or temple, He has made himself extremely amiable and amenable (Suulabhya). Incidentally He is so loving, He completely ignores all the lapses (Sarvajlaradhas) on the part of His devotees. 6. God in Arcavatnra reveals the best beauty in the image. (Rupa-lavanya). He thereby arrests the attention of even the errant and erratic souls who have wandered away from God an'd disobeyed the injunctions of all the Sastras. Even the capricious and wayward souls get drawn towards the beauty in the image and begin to cullivate a taste for divinity and goodness. 'En amuthanai kkanda kangal manonrivui kkanave',­'My eyes have feasted on my Lord's heavenly beauty'. They henceforth will not look at any other sight.

It is always trained for a purpose, the purpose being: liberation from the cycle of rebirths and redcaths. It is either ro r God-realisation or at least for self-realisation. The very crit�non of Truth in Indian epistemology lies in its capacity to lead to fruitful activity, in Samvadi Pravritti. Truth does not lie in the bareness of bare light and heat. To be true is to be fructiferous of permanent happiness, the joy of the soul in its infinite consciousness and bliss.

He is both in Upadana karana and Nimitta karana. It is by His samkalpa, He has evolved Himself into the Universe of matter and souls. The entire universe is His Leela vibhuti. He is more than His Leelavibhuti. He dwells in His Nitya vibhuti as the transcendental being. He is the embodiment of the six original gunas, Shadgunya paripuma. Both the Jivas and the material Universe have their source in Brahman Himself. The Jivas are described as eternal and infinite and as pure consciousness and bliss and as being largely. of the nature of God Himself -Bhagavanmaya (says the Ahirb�dhnya samhita). These Jivatmas are said to owe their existence entirely to the Spiritual energy of God - Bhagavad bhavitah sada (Ahirb. sam.). In describing the emanation of Acyuta, Satya and Purusha from Vasudeva, the J ayakhya samhita is of the opinion that such an emanation occurs only naturally and not by His Samkalpa. These three Acyuta, Satya and Purusha that evolve out of Vasudeva are sald to behave as one through mutual reflection and thus in their subtle form they are said to exist in the heart of men as the dynamic energy of God, that not only helps the souls to have the enjoyment of their expe!iences, but also ultimately helps in the gradual awarene�s of their source and thus leads them finally to their ultimate destination. In other words, according to the Jayakhya it is from God Himself His tripartive energy emanates and constitutes Atman, the inner Microcosm of man. By this divine dynamic energy the pure consciousness in man comes into•contact with his root Instincts (the vasanas, products of prakriti, matter).

The Ahirbudhnya samhita posits to begin with that God as the Shadgunyaparipuma cannot and actually does not have any unfulfilled desires in Him. He veritably possesses absolute independence in Himself. At the same time He often resorts to a sportive activity called His Lccla vibhuti playing like a king and sporting as He wishes. ' 'Sarvair an-anuyojyam tat svatantragam divyam fsituh, Avapta- Visva- K1mopi krldate Rajavat va8[ ' - (Ahirb. sam. XIV.l3). It is all the KRIDA, the Leela, the sport of God.

In that playful activity of His, in that merry sport, the Jivatman (with all its original innate infinity of consciousness and bliss) gets contaminated with Prakriti and gets veiled so to say (The infinite consciousness gets shrouded and blurred; the ananda becomes belittled, and restricted) with the three impurities of Avidya (ignorance), Ah<\\ffikara (egoism) and Raga-Dvesha (attachment and antipathy).

At the same time, apart from God's great powers of Creation, Sustenance and Destruction, He has two other remarkable powers in Him namely: i. Anugraha - Favour. ii. Nigraha - Disfavour. If the tr;msgressing Jiva looks to God for His Anugraha, grace, God does take pity on the sorrowing and suffering soul that has entered into bondage. If the grace of God lands on the Jiva, it retracts from all selfish activities, turns to teachers and Scriptures, conducts itself in a becoming and dignified way loving and adoring God and finally attains Liberation from the bondage. On the other hand an erring soul in bondage unconcerned with God will receive its just dividents from God's sense of justice and Nigraha and goes deep into damnation and deeper into bondage. God of course feels sorry for such an errant soul and waits for his return and request. God's role is there both inforging the fetters for the soul as also in snapping those fetters. The soul when launched into Leela vibhuti gets inevitably bound. Again God is there to reclaim it back into His Nitya vibhuti fold. But that requires unfortunately the willing co-operation of the individual soul. Many Baddha souls, strangely enough develop the will to non-co-operate. III. PURUSHARTHA SVARUPA: Those ends that are desired by Purusha, the individual soul are called the Purusharthas. Here again five Purusharthas are enumerated: I. Dhanna 2. Artha 3. Kama 4. Atmanubhava 5.

ARTHA: One has to acquire Dhana and Dhiinya and use them well with discretion and Dharma. · KAMA: This means the love for worldly things that sati sfy one's senses including the Manas (The Ekadasendriyas). Kama also includes the love of pleasures in SV ARGA after one's demise on this earth. Most of the vedic sacrifices promise pleasures both here and the hereafter. Kama with its pleasures cannot be equated with happiness. Happiness is unsullied joy without any tinges of pain. There are certain items of penn anent happiness too. But the pleasures of the senses are _all ephemeral and associated with pain. ATMANUBHAVA: This refers to enjoying the genuine pleasures of the soul. It is the joy of self-realisation. A true ·yogin whenever he gets into samadhi realises the joy of the soul, its inner identity with Brahman. He may replace from Samadhi, tenninate ·temporarily the joy of Atmanubhava and return to Jagritavastha or he may end up in Samadhi, become a kevalin and be completely dissociated from all the vasanas of Prakriti. Even rebirth is impossible for him again. Some say it ls liberation or Nirvana. Of course it is self-realisation. For instance in Jayakhya samhita 3 kinds of yoga are discussed: 1. Sakala 2.

In Vishnu yoga he is said to meditate on the mantras thereby getting the ultimate reality revealed. By these processes of yoga, the yogin ultimately passes out by the channel of Brahma randhra leaves his body and is said to obtain unity with the ultimate Reality.

The indirect Dharma is the course leading to· self­abrogation, self-realisation through self-sacrifice. Emancipation is a 'Sadhya' through self-effort (Sadhana). The Jayakhya samhitas also makes a distinction in Jnana as Sattiikhya and Kriyiikhya. It says the Kriyakhya jnana involves the moral disciplines of Yama and Niyama and it is through this Kriyakhya that Sattakhya Jnana is realised. Under the Yama and Niyama virtues such as purity, study of the scriptures, penance, absence of cruelty to others, fo rgiveness, respect for others' properties, disinclination towards the pleasures of the senses, honesty, sincerity and thoughtfulness', speaking not only the truth but also truth - tinged with kindness (satyam bruyat - p�:iyam bruyat), giving gifts to the deserving persons (Dana), etc. etc. are all enumerated. In a reported dialogue between Brahma and Parama, as mentioned in Parama samhita, it is pointed out that the knowledge obtained by means of yoga is far superior to any other kind of knowledge. Yoga is simply described in an impersonal way in the Samhita - as the calm application of One's mind to any particular object of thought or problem.

Yoga of course includes Pranayama and samadhi. The yogin putting himself into deep meditation of God should detach himself from all worldly bonds. Katmayoga and Jnanayoga with the moral disciplines of Yama and Niyama and also of Vairagya and samadhi should be ultimately supported in Brahman. By means of these two yogas, the individual is said to attain Brahman. By the practice of Yam a and Niyama involving vrata, upasana, dana and vairagya, the vasanas, the root-instincts are said to gradually wither away. The individual achieves self-control. By Jnanayoga the individual is led to Isvara pranidhana • He is convinced that he is absolutely dependent on God in every way. He will be able to get tid of the root of attachment to worldly things · by Karma and Jnana, Bhakli is sure to be awakened in his mind. He begins to love God and finally seeks union with God. The Vishnu samhita while describing Bhagavata yoga points out that true yoga q:msists in perfect body and mind control. Yoga consists in the control of passions such as lust, greed, anger, etc. The mind by yoga develops vivcka. With viveka it cannot only assess tl1ings properly, it also develops the capacity for self-analysis, and self-criticism. A purified and disciplined mind gets a nausea for the worldly things and a love for God. He feels always dependent on God. He develops Bhakti and finally achieves union with God by Bhagavatha yoga.

Tmc Kanna yoga lies in the practice of Nishkama kanna und it is a means to Mukti. In this transformation from Kiimyaktuma to Nishkama karmu, kanna is actually illumined by Jnana. By the practice of Ashtangayoga, the mumukshu gets the benefit of 'Atmavalokana'-the Mumukshu desiring to know Atmun is callcdARURUSHU.

The yogi selects a sequestered spot and practises the Astangayoga of Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pmnayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadni. By Astangayoga the yogin becomes really enlightened. He sees the same self in all the Jivas owing to the similarity of their spiritual intelligence (Dharmabhuta Jnana). He gains the correct Atma drishti, - develops sweet reasonableness and Vinaya. He intuits the same Atman in man or dog. He achieves inner sakshatkara, self-realisation-'Bahiranga antaranga akhyayam adyanga kalapavan, Cittavrittinirodhatmli yoga y�ganuslisane, Sai.vadabhylisa vairagya parcla pranidhanatah, Sakshatkar\"dVabhlislikhya siddhasuddhapa vargada�·­(Ahrib.

Yatindramata dipika referring to the Kevalins, the exclusive Jnana yogins say& that though liberated they live like 'the wife who has lost her husband'-in some comer outside both the highest heaven and the cosmic egg. Of course one school of Slivaishnavism (the southem school) say that Kaivalya attained by Jnanayoga is Mukti itself. The emancipated Jnani has peace and re lease from rebhth and samsara but not the bliss of divine life. He just stays on the outskirts of the Paramapada, of course not in communion with God. The northern school, the vadagalais are of the opinion that the Kevalin is on the road to Moksha all right - He has to traverse a little more. There is every probability that from the realisation of the.Atman he seeks to realise Paramatman also. The leap from Purusha to Purushottama is any time expected.

Yet just as karmayoga is a sahakari for Jnana, Jnanayoga is definitely a sahakari for Bhakti. Having acquired Jnana by means of karmayoga, in his dhyana the yogi establishes the image of Vishnu with Laksluni in the lotus of his heart and concentrates. The knowledge of God nmmally leads to Love of God. That is Bhakti Yoga. Caught.up in the snares of Avidya-karma, the blinding and limiting fo rces of Prakriti, the Mumukshu, the aspirant for Moksha first of all sheds the beguiling factors of Ahamkara and Mamakara through the practice of Nishkama karma. He does everyone of his duties in the name of God without the least expectation of rewards for whatever he does. In a way it is Brahmarpana. By the disciplines of yam a and niyama and also by the practice of Yogabhyasa he gets enlightened. He understands the essential nature of his own self as absolutely dependent on God. He may try to achieve the union of his individual self, the lower self with the Higher self· namely Paramatman lodged in himself as the Antaryamin. The Higher self, God is described in the Ahirbudhnya samhita as the subtle (Sukshma), all pctvading (smvaga) all sustaining (sa!'Va bhrit), of the n aturc of pure consciousness (Jnanarupa), eternal (anadi­<manta) changeless (avikarin), knowing all the pervading all, although seemingly without the cognitive or conative appertunanccs and protecting all.

Jnanayoga helps to make it possible fo r the Jivatman to seck union with the PARAMATMAN-'Tatpr<pli sklhanam yogah kanna ca Sruticodilam'-But no one wishes to stop at the realisation of the Inner Alman. Equipped with Vairagya and Viveka through Karma and Jnana Yogas, the Mumukshu wants to return home, the abode of God and meet the Father there, God with SRI, Bhumi and Nilu. That is the prime objective. Hence the shedding of Ahamkara and Mamakara immediately leads to Upasana or Bhakti. Tnre Jnana transfonns itself into Bhakti. It is the Bhakti-rupapanna Jnana, Jnana turned Bhakti. Brahman as the saririn of the Jiva, is the 'prapaka' as well as the 'Prapya', the endeavour us well :�s the end.

It is all God's concern. It is for Him either to accept or reject this soul which is His bhogya vastu. The soul is absolutely helpless, helpless even for any activity of approach - It is Paragata Svikara if God Himself approaches the helpless but ardent soul and takes it with Him. It is Svagata Svikara if the soul seeks Him by its own efforts. A critical of these two will be made in the next chapter. The Ahirb. samhita asks how can a helpless soul make efforts? Convinced firmly of his own absolute helplessness and feeling absolutely dependent �m God in every way, the soul at best can persist in a prayerful mood only and do nothing else. The rest is all left to God. Prapatti is therefore explained as only an 'Upaya Jnana' and not as an UPAYA to be pursued- It is primarily a mental attitude of helpless within one self and also the feeling of absolute faith, trust and hope in God the -Almighty. A Prapanna is like a passenger in a boat. The passenger simply. sits helpless at the mercy of the boatman. It Is for the boatman tb do the rest and the needful.

'Lakshminatlia Samarambham Nathayamunamadhyamam, Asmadacnarya paryantam Vande Guruparamparam'. Mantras are of three classifications, Tamasic, Rajasic and Sattvic. Of all the Sattvic Mantras, the Tirumantra is proclaimed �he best.

This Mantra is therefore considered to be the Divine Inheritance of Man, a heritage and not a self-acquired possession. Hence it is said in the Pcriyatiruvaymuli, that the knowledge of this Mantra elevates one into the Noble Family (!.1.9). It showers all the desirable boons. It can give wealth, Kaivalya prapti and also the attainment of God for those who seck Him in patticular. It destroys all Ule obstacles in the way of Karma, Jnana and Bhakti. It has in a nut-shell all the Tat tv as to be known (says the Pcriyat iruvaymuli VIII.10.8). Tirumangai Alvar says 'Having known YOUR eight letters, I can speak of other things' -This Mantra gives live great meanings: I. The true nature of the individual souls. 2. The object of attainment in accordance wilh the true nature of the individual souls - namely Kainkarya of the Lord, Service to the Lord. 3. The true nature of subservience unto the Lord, 4. The means of seeking refuge in the Lord, 5. The re sults derived therefrom (MOKSHA). This Tirumantra consists of eight holy letters compounded into three words. It is compared to the mangala sutra of eight strands held in Ulree sheaves. The three words in the mantra arc said to reveal 3 meanings: i. ,S ubservience urito Ule Lord; ii. Dependence on the Lord; iii. Service unto the Lord. The first of the three words in the mantra is the Pranava, AUM -consisting of the three holy lcller; A, U, and MA. These letlcrs are said to be symbolic of the essence of the three Vedas C\\cn as butter is obtained by chuming cream stored in three vessels. The Pranava AUM contains within itself the quintessence of the Ulree Vedas, Rig, Yajur and Sarna."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"The EIJxlr of Srlvaishnav1sm 323 Of the three letters in AUM, the first letter 'A' is obviously the origin of all letters and sounds. It is the diminutive form of the word 'NARAYANA' denoting the great Lord who is both the cause of the world as also its protector. So Akara in the Pranava connotes Paramatman- 'Aksharanam 'A' Karo asmi'­Bhaga.Gita.X.33. The third letter in the Pranava namely 'MA' is patently the 25th letter in the alphabet and is Jnanavaci- It therefore signifies the Atman, the individual soul- souls of all classes, the Baddhas, the Muktas and the Nityas. The second letter 'U'thatcomes in between 'A' and 'MA' is definitely detenminative on account of its position in the syllable 'AUM'. 'Sthanapramanattllle U k1nna avadharafiutham'­(Mumukshuppadi.) The lcllcr U therefore points to the inherent and the inevitable relation, yoga between 'A' the Lord (Paramatman) and 'MA' the individual soul (Jivatma), \" 'A' kar&tho V islmu� J agadudayarakshaPralaya krit\" \" 'MA' kar.rrtho Jivah tadupakaranam Vaishnavamidam\". \" 'U' k1ro ananyarham niyamati sambandham anayoh\" 'Trayfsarastray1tml!Pranava imam artham samadisat' - (Parasara Bhatta). So there is an integral inherent relation between this 'A' and 'MA' as there is. bctween the rays of light and the source from which the rays emanate or as between a flower and the fragrance that originates from it. Thus the Pranava AUM vindicates the integral relation between the individual soul and the Lord, between the Protected and the Protector. It comes to this that the soul is absolutely dependent on the Lord who is absolutely"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"324 Phflosophy of Pencaratras Independent. It is this 'DEPENDENCE' that constitutes the esselltial nature of the Jivatman, the individual soul. The moment any sense of independence creeps into the soul, that marks its nemesis. As Nammalvar says: (Tiruvaizmozi. IV.8.10) if at all there is any respect and cognisance given to the individual soul it is because of this dependence on God. It is presumed that if at all the Lord is to be the protector, He is to be with Lakshmi. Venerable Senapati Misra has said 'When Lakshmi leaves His breast, she leaves this Jetter 'A' also (as quoted in Mumukshuppadi). Lakshmi can neither leave her consort the Lord as in 'A' nor can she desert her child, the Jivatma as in 'MA'. She therefore occupies the position of 'U' in the Pranava 'AUM'. The next word in the Tirumantra is 'NAMAH' - It consists of two words 'NA' and 'MAH'. 'MAH' means that which belongs to oneself 'NA' means 'not that'. 'NAMAH' therefore implies 'One does not belong to onesclr with the clear implication that the soul does not belong to itscl f, (but to the Lord). - To realise the full import of this tenn 'NAMAH -three obstacles arc to be overcome: 1. The obstacle standing in the way of knowing the essential nature of the individual (i.e .. of oneself). 2. The obstacle that stands in the way of practising the means for Salvation. ' 3. The obstacle that stands in the way of attaining t)lc goal of salvation. The first obstacle can be removed by realising the fu ll import of 'Namah' on the pan of the individual soul (Tlruvaimoz!. 11.9.�)-'.I (the Jivatman) am your inseparable mode; Everything of mme IS yours; then; is nothing of my own, not even ME'-"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"The Elixir of Srlv61shn6vlsm 325 , . The second obstacle can be taken off by sincerely feeling Without you I am lost; If you don't d�stroy my anguish, there is no protector for me - (Tiruvaimozi, V. 8.8.) The third obstacle can be obviated by having the one and the only desire of serving God and nothing else (Tiruppavai-29) It then dawn's on the individual 1. That the essential nature of the soul is that it is God's own - His absolute dependant and servant (Tiruvaimozi. IV .6.1.) , 2. That the means to salvation is seeking refuge in GOD, (Tiruvaimozi. III 3.6) 3. That the goal of salvation is service to the Master (Tiruvaimozi X.8.7.). In Periya Tiruvaimuli it is pointed out that 'Narnah' not only means 'Dependence' on the Lord, it also implies 'Dependence on the devotees of the Lord' - 'I have acquired service to your devotees after learning the Ashtakshari' says Tirumangai Alvar (VIII. I .3.) The last word in the Tirumantra is 'NARAYANA YA' - this term is actually compounded of three words, Nara, Ayana and , Aya. 'Nara' stands for the collection of all the eternal substances, everything of Nitya vibhuti and Leela vibhuti including the Primeval six gunas of the Lord. 'AYANA' means the 'Support'. 'NARAYANA' therefore simply means 'the abode of all that is', the support of everything in the Universe - the basis for all and the Master of all. 'A YA' is the dative case termination, implying that there must be the desire in men to do Kainkarya to the Lord (as in the case of Sesha who becomes an umbrella when He moves -Tiruvundadi). T�us we must do service to the Lord always at all places and in all circumstances without any obstacles, remaining with Him at all times.

The middling, the letter 'U' indicates 'Ananya Seshatva' meaning that the 'Ma' the Jivatman is not dependant on any other than the Lord Himself. 'Namah' clearly points out that there is no question of self­protection forthc individual soul, as all its weal and welfare is in the hands of the Lord Himself. 'Narayanaya' relevantly points out that one should always be at the setvice of the Lord and His devotees too-The second Mantra is the OVA YA- This mantra has in itself 2 Mantras: The Dvaya Mantra states that Lakshmi is the means for the attainment of the highest object of human pursuit, for the L01 d docs not act unless there is the mediation of Lakshmi.

That there is no refuge for him other than the Lord. Of the two sentences in the Dvaya Mantra, the first sentence stales categorically that the lotus-feet of the Lord must be sought alter as the only means through the mediation of Lakshmi. The second sentence demands that absolute surrender should be made to Narayana as associated with Lakshmi. SRI is the name of Lakshmi. The term SRI has two meanings: I.

As the Supreme Master of the Unh:·erse He is naturally inclined to be just and mete out punishment to the erring souls. Lakshmi always established in the heart of the Lord and His Nityanupayini has the quality of transforming of Lord's indignation and sense of justice into mercy and the sense of forgiveness. This pardon she secures for the individual soul from the Lord because of her innate affection for Jivatman as she happens to be its mother. It is this dual role she plays as between the fa ther and the son that entitles her to be the Purushakara. It is only Lakshmi by her intervention that tones down the absolute independence of the Lord and make possible the manifestation in Him of the benevolent qualities congenial to the sinning souls: qualities such as: Parental indulgence (Vatsalya) sweetness of disposition (Madhurya), easiness of approach (Saulabhya fo rgiveness) (Kshama), as also the final favour of conferring moksha also on the individual soul.

The Jivatma belongs to the Lord and His cherished possession. It is for the Lord to guard Jl is possession. It will be a travesty of ownership if the individu.11 soul puts forth attempts to protect itself in the eyes of the master. No worse insult could be cast on the Lord and no better example for the sclrs arrogance and haughty demeanour can be cited.

A knowledge of its own svarupa, an awareness of the truth of its own personality which obviously lies in Dasyu -Servility- The Primary attributes of the Soul arc clearly demonstrated to be three namely, Jnana, Ananda and Dasya. The first two are mostly found blurred and besmirched because the soul has a perverse tendency to forget oft and on, its last but most primary trait (according to the vcdas) of Dasya. Avidya-ahamkara invariably Inclines the soul to fo rget its kinship with the Divine in the relation of Dasa to Svamin, servant to Master, the owned to the owner.

This Paragata Svikara is opposed to Svagata Svikara and this Nirhetuka Kataksha is the dire opposite of 'Sahetuka Kataksha'· He�ein lies the controversy between the two sects of Srivaishnavas, the Tcnkalais and the Vadakalais. The Tenkalais believe in the voluntary unconditional free flow of God's grace unto the individual soul in distress and suffering. They say God needs no pretext for His grace to man. His bountiful grace is ever uncaused - (Nirhetuka) and is a natural streamline directed towards the yearning soul where the least resistance is expected in the fo nn of any Ahamkara • Avidya (arrogance of self-effort). It is ultimately Paragata Svikara because it is God Himself that seeks the soul to bestow His grace. Hence it comes to this that God Himself is both the means and end, in this divine act of saving the soul. That is why Prapatti is considered to be both the Upaya and the Upeya in itself. This concept of the free flow of God's grace uncaused and unconditioned is well explained iii. the Pancaratra samhitas as also in Bhagavad vishaya. Nammalvar refers to it \"Velide arul saivar'-(Tiruvaimozi.V·3·8). He describes it as the Lords' abundant Love streaming into the soul and enamouring it· 'Ederi alai bukku'-(Tiruvaimozi.II.7.6). He says just as one cannot resist the influx of Kanna so also one cannot resist the inflow of God's grace, in spite of one's ignorance and egoism­(avidya-ahamkara).

He is delivered from sin and , admitted into His ptesence and into His service. The Vadakalais on the other hand do not believe in Nirhetuka Kataksha and Paragata Svikara.

In other words they believe in Sahetuka kataksha. Without a 'hetu', a reason or request, God's grace need not be in evidence, they say. Similarly they also point out that without an effort even on the part of the individual, grace need not manifest. God helps only those who want His help. Before they desire His help they must deserve His help. They should seck Him in all earnestness. Therefore it is only 'Svagata svik�ra' that is pcnnissible and that is actually the case. God is neither so chivalrous nor so cheap they mean to imply in their arguments. According to Vedanta Desika, the Protagonist of this school, every individual has his own freedom of choice and freedom of will. Man errs by his freedom. He is equally free to feel sorry for his sins. He can improve himself by Kanna:jn�na yogas. By Kanna yoga he can improve his conduct and by Jnana yoga he becomes truly enlightened on the Tattva Traya. He can know his essential nature, the nature of the material Universe and also God the father and protector of the entire Universe of Cit and Acit. When once his mind is disciplined by Kanna-jnana, there arises. in him Bhakti. He can then take on to either Bhakti-yoga or Prapatti yoga as the surest means (Upaya) to salvation. Desika recognises the superiority of Bhakti and Prapalli over Kanna and Jnana and says that both Bhakti and Prapatti equally lead to Mukti. Of the latter two, he once again prefers Prapatti to Bhakti. He admits Prapatti is easier of pcrfonnance, more akin to the innate propensities of the soul and also quick in delivering the results as it has the directness and immediacy of approach to God, the Heavenly father. It is the best Upaya to realise the Bpeya. But Prapatti is to be performed by the individual soul. Before surrendering to God the individual should have a sense of Akineanya, a sense of unworthiness of himself because of all his sins and must have been overwhelmed by remorse, contrition or penitence for all his transgressions of the nature of omissions and commissions. In doing Prapatti he must seek God in all earnestness and in all humility. Of course God will be moved to save him by the mediation of Lakshmi, the Purushakara and He does save him, sure and ce1tain.

God is to be sought after by the yeaming soul just as the baby-monkey seeks the under-belly of its mother and clings to her with effort. Only U1en is its safety the mother's responsibility.

If the kitten launch into self effort and wander away hither and thither they are lost. So long as they lie helpless and await the mother, she surely comes and fetches them to safety. It is universally admitted that God's grace in Prapatti is impossible without the significant role of Lakshmi and her mediation on behalf of the Prapanna. Only Lakshmi is capable of converting Lord's meticulous sense of strict justice into unlimited mercy for the soul. She is therefore called the Divine Mediatrix, Purushakara as between God and the individual soul. It is said that during the period of her union with the Lord she corrects the Jsvara and His law of retribution. During the period of her separation from the Lord she corrects the Jivatman and leads him to the Lord. That both Isvara and Jivatman are corrected by her, is admitted by all. She is said to tone down the Lord by her beauty and convert the cetana by her mercy. She is said to possess the three essential characteristics of : 1. Kripa ·kindness to the souls, 2. Paratantrya - dependence on God, 3. Ananyarhatva- servility to none other than the Lord."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"The Eilxw of Snvetslmavtsm 335 Illustrations for these innate tendencies and essential traits of Lakshmi arc profusely quoted from Ramayana which is taken by the Purvacharyas as the Saranagati veda. In fact there is a chapter in Ramayana on Abhaya Pradana and it is considered to be the Upanishad of Vibhishana Saranagati. Lakshmi's kindness (Kripa) is well-defined as Paradukkha asahishnutva. She cannot bear the pangs of other's sorrows. She feels terribly unhappy in others' miseries. 'Parah dukkhe dukk11itvam'- That is why she is said to have entered the prison of Ravana (though she co.uld have easily avoided it) just to be one with the other thousands of women suffering imprisonment at Lanka and provide consolation to them. When Hanuman demanded her pc1mission to take vengeance on the Rakshasas in retribution, she is said to have pointed out to him that if the law of retribution were to prevail, let alone herself even Ram a, Bharatha and Lakshmana would have to be brought under its pervicw one way or the other and that none was above board. She always believed in mercy and forgiveness quite consistent with her dominant attribute of Klipii. Piiratamrya, absolute submission to the will of the Lord is illustrated in her �ccond separation from the Lord. After the washerman's story, Sita could have ended her life. But she obeyed the command of her Lprd and went to the forest. Ananyarhatva, the sense of belonging exclusively to the Lord as His possession is again well explained in her third and last separation from the Lord, when she called upon Mother Earth to take her back. She proved her absolu tc loyalty to her Lord by giving proof for her chastity. That she lived for him and followed His will arc well manifested both in the presence of the Lord and also in her separation from the Lord. Ramayana also illustrates how Sila (the embodiment of Lakshmi) exhibited acts of Purushakara towards Lakshmana during her association with the Lord and towards Ravana and his hordes during her separation from the Lord.

Normally the Purushakara is required for the salvation of man, to bring down on him the Mercy of God for all his sins and to secure for him God's bountiful grace for final redemption. Of course there are rare occasions when God Himself even without the mediation of Lakshmi has bestowed His grace and saved the soul, 'as He is absolutely independent and knows things better than even Lakshmi. For instance the best illustration of Prapatti as an example for Divine Voluntary grace, is provided in the Bhagavadgita when God out of His utmost consideration for Arjuna Himself played all the roles of Acharya, Purushakara and Rakshaka, (the teacher, the mediator and the saviour all in one, God Himself undertook to be). As an Acharya he enlightened him on the Jivatma and Paramatma Svarupas as also on Karma, Jnana and Bhakti yogas. He gave him the carama sloka as a lever to Prapatti and He assured him of His grace. But normally Prapatti requires the mediation of Lakshmi not only to lead the soul to God but also to make the Lord forgive the soul and show compassion to the erring soul led by her. In His uttnost mercy the Lord may even reveal at the sinner and because of his sins He may volunteer to save him making sins of the sinner themselves a springboard for His saving grace (Also a soul saved is a gain to the master). That is why it is admitted that there is absolutely no stipulation of place, time, species, caste or sex for Prapatti. Vibhishana, a Rakshasa has done it. Even animals have done it let alone men and women. So also there is no stipu\\ation of purushartha for prapatti. Draupadi performed Prapatti when she was unclean. Arjuna did it on the battlefield. The crow· and the snake (Kaka and Kaliya) did Prapatti. Dharmaraja made Prapatti for his kingdom; Draupadi for clothes; Kakasura for life; Gajendra for Kainkarya etc. etc. Whatever be the ends desired (Provided they are not bad or harmful to others) they are absolutely fulfilled in Prapatti.

Of course for men on earth, the Pancaratras have provided the best place for performing Prapatti, in the form of idols and consecrated images in temples where Lord's presence is brought about along with Lakshmi's also. In the Area vigraha the Lord has disdained His glory, forgets the insults of man, forgives all his failings and provides His holy feet for the Prapanna to prostrate and recline his head upon.

So far as the Prapanna is concerned it is impossible to conceive of Narayana as without Lakshint. 'Srimunnurayana' and 'Srimate Narayanaya' arc significant in themselves. The Pancaratras are clear on the Personality of Lakshmi or SRI. She is described as 'Vislmu Sakti' (chap. IV -and Purus11i Ratri - in this thesis). She is the Matrix of all that is CIT and ACIT and therefore she is the Mcdiatrix. In the chain of emanations portrayed in the pancarairas she is the first emanation so to say and therefore she may be considered the Matrix. As having come out of the Lord, she is separate from the Lord. At the same time her links with the Lord arc deeply rooted or we may say more deeply rooted.

At the same time the most mootable point for discussion is this: Can Lakshmi be conceived as on a par with the Lord in certain ways as having the capacities for Jagatkaranatva, Vibhutva and Mokshapradatva? It is uue that by some free will 'Kasmaccit svatantryat' (of course consisLent with the will of the Lord) she has darted out of Para Brahman and that by her Kriya Sakti and Bhuti Sakti the entire universe·of matter and souls are evolved, according to the Pancaratras, At the same time bow can the Pancaratras say that she is on a par with Brahman? They don't. She is not. Lakshmi Tantra says there is only Avinobhava or Samanvaya as between the sunshine and the sun, Lakshmi is only al! aspect of Brahman, Brabma's sakti-' Pranarupo Vishnoh sankalpah' -She is an emissary of the Lord as she is only an emission from the Lord according to the Pancaratras, But the Lord is more than Lakshmi and Lakshmi is only an infenitesimal part of the Lord, 'Jagattaya lakshyamana sa Lakshmi r iti g[yate'-We may even say she is the Vicereine bearing of royal authority of Vishnu, But she is essentially a Sesha of the Lord. Merely because certain powers are delegated to her, it does not mean she has Antharbhlzva in 'Isvara koti' in the same way she has Antharbhiiva in 'Jiv koti'. The first to display Seshatva, Paratantrya and Ananyarhatva is Lakshmi herself as she leads the entire Jiva koti and so to say she is the first citizen of the Lord's Realm. That she is separate from the Lord is clear in the Pancaratra's. Lakshmi herself perhaps resents any undue prerogatives and privileges thrust on her by her admirers, the fe llow-jivas.

It is impossible- It will be chicanery of thought. So also because of her bhiivyabhavaka sakti, she may be secondarily responsible for the entire manifest Universe, the Jagat (according to some Pqncaratra samhitas). But she cannot be called Jagatkarana vastu in the last resort. It will be a patent insult to the Lord and incongruous in the context of Himself being the Upadana karana and Nimittakarana of the entire manifold of Cit and Acit in the context of the triumvirate ultimate concepts of Cit, Acit and Isvara. Because the Leela-Vibhuti is brought about for her sake and by her agency too by the Lord, because she is the mother and the matrix in a way, she is in the role of the mediatrix on behalf of the souls and more so on behalf of the erring souls. Because the Lord loves her so much He condescends to forget His strict sense of Justice and inclines to be kind and considerate to the souls. Her portfolio is correctly defined as that of Purushakara and how can the Purushakara possess the power of Moksha pradatva? It is impossible. The supreme powers all rest in the Lord as Lakshmi herself rests in the Lord. The status of Lakshmi as next to the Lord Himself is incontrovertible. But she is separate from the Lord although she is in communion with Him always (Anapayini). She permeates the Universe with the Lord (Yatha sarvagato Vishnuh tathaiveyam, Dvijottama!). But she cannot penneate Isvara although she can be in communion with Him. In Prapatti, there is no doubt, manifestaiion of grace is Lord's own sweet will. It- cannot be compelled by the individual's austerities, piety and self-efforts. Otherwise why should there be the need for purushakara by Lakshmi? Even there, Lakshmi can only recommend, appeal, coax but not compel. Grace 'cannot be bargained for by offer of BhakLI. Voluntary free grace of the Lord is God's o'wn free gift to man.

Now the differences between a Prapanna and any other ordinary soul or a non-prapanna is just this, that the prapanna has removed in himself all the 'Virodhis' for the easy flow of God's grace. How the way is cleared for the inflow of God's grace in the case of the prapanna, is the question. Obviously by removing all obstructions in the way. The next question is : What are the obstructions? The sense of Ahamkara and Mamakara, ignprance about the innate Svampa of one's own self that it is essentially Paratantra, absolutely dependent on God and God alone, that it is ananyarhasesha and that it exists for the Seshin only, ignorance about the Paramapumshadl1a which lies in absolute service, Kainkarya to God alone and none else, ignorance about the true nature of Saranagati that it lies in the special sacrifice or endowment or dedication to God Himself of the three namely Phala samarpana, Bhara samarpan'a and Svampa samarpana too etc. The act of self-surrender, Prapalli is Sadhyopaya -and the Lord to whoJl! lt is made is Siddhop aya.

It is said that at Vishnu's command Vikhanas came down to earth to originate worship of Vishnu in His Area form (in the form of idols in temples). Brahma incarnated Himself as VIKHANAS in the Naimisharanya and then VISHNU Himself taught Brahm a the mysteries of worship in the form of thirty two questions. Since God, the Bhagavan Himself taught this agama to Brahma first, Vishnu Himself is the originator of the Agama also as in the case of Pancaratra Agama. /).s it was Vikhanasa who gave this agama to the world direclly through his four disciples or Maharshis, namely Atri, Marie!, Ka�yapa and Bhrighu, he is said to be the Pravartaka of this Agama and hence the agama is called after him.

The Vaikhanusas arc also called AUKl-lEYAS. The Smartha Sutras that preceded the Srouta Sutras consist of both Grihya and Dhanna Sutras which once again include an elaborate Mantru­samhita. Therefore the Smartha-Sutru section is also called 'Aukhcyu-sutnl' because the Vuikhanasas (Aukhcyas) constituted a sakhii (branch) with the complement of Samhita, Brahm ana and Sutras. Manu is also said to endorse these ideas. Barth is of the opinion that at the time ofBAUDHAYANA there existed known 'pre-scripts' relating to the Vaikhanasa hermits and that these were later oh edited as Valkhanasa sutras.

Haradatta while commenting on Gautama (Sutras.lll.2) explains that Vaikhanasa addressed himself primarily to the order of the anchorites (vanaprasthas). As a matter of fact the Vaikhanasa Agama equally regulated the conduct of all individuals in those days. Kalidasa perhaps referred to the mode of life prescribed in the Vaikhanasa system in the well-known verse beginning: 'Vaikhanasam Kimanayii Vratamiiprndlilit' (Act I. Shakuntala).

There are in fact innumerable references to the Vaikhanasas in the Cola inscriptions from the time of Raja Raja I. These Vaikhanasas used to be hereditary trustees ofVaishnava temples, managing the temple properties and administering the divine se1vices. In fact Caland on philological and linguistic grounds refers to the Vaikhanasa sutras as belonging to the period of the latter half of the 3rd century A.D. Even to this day there arc many temples in the south that follow the Vaikhanasa Agama tradition and the most notable examples is the Tirupati shrine. Although all around Tirupati the Pancaratra fo rm of worship is there (even in Tiruehanur), Lord Venkateswara in His sanctum sanctorum is worshipped according to the Vaikhanasa rites and Slistra, purely in the sanskrit medium. Sometimes it is claimed that there arc more temples under the Vaikhanasa agamic order in the South of India than there arc under the Pancaratra! There is absolutely no differences between the Vaikhanasa and the Pancaratra agamas, in so far as the PARA, the ultimate being is concerned. Like the Pancaratra samhitas, the Vaikhanasa agama samhitas also emphasise the five forms of the supreme namely: PARA, VYUHA, V!BHAVA, ANTARYAMI and ARCA. The Vaikh{lnasas lay the greatest emphasis on His ARCA from which He has assumed for the sake of the devotees in particular and for mankind at large. Even the Alwars of the Pancaratra tradition may sometimes ·say - 'Why visit different shrines when the )..ord who is worshipped in them dwells within the heart?

The Supreme person in Saivism is called RUDRA or SIVA, Rudra referring to His terrific aspect and Siva refening to His benign aspect. In the Sata Rudriya both aspects are emphasised and praised. The Kenopanishad points out how Siva is the Supreme Godhead and describes how His glory was revealed by Goddess Uma and Indra. The. most important of the Salva upanishads is of course the Svetasvatara upanishad. The Mahabharata refers to the worship of Siva. Just as the Vaishnava Agamas expose a blend of the spiritual ideas of the vedic seers along with the intuitions of the South Indian Alwars and Acharyas, so also the Saivagamas reveal a similar admixture of the insight of the Vedic seers along with the intuitions of the Nayanars of the South. The excavations dt Harappa and Mohenjodaro have proved that the worship of Siva and Sakti have been in existence from the hoary past. There is no doubt that the Vedic concepts have been, amalgamated into the Salva cult iii the same way as they have been incorporated into the Vaishnava religion.

In beatitude though the soul is said to be one with God, yet it is separate fi·om God, just as in daytime the light of the stars is included in the light of the sun · and is indistinguishable from it, but yet separate from it. We can realise God only when Pasu jnana is transfigured by the divine light, Patijnana.

Though the great outpourings of Appar, Sundarar, Sambhandar and Manikya vacagar contain the truths of Saiva philosophy in a popular and beautiful form, it is the 'Siva jnana bodham' of MEY AKANDAR that states clearly and precisely in twelve sutra stanzas the entire philosophy of Saivagama.

Srikanta in his Bhashya on the Vedanta sutras says: 'Vayantu Veda Sivagamayoh bhedam na pasyamah' The three cardinal fe atures of Saiva siddhanta are: I.

The 63 Nayanars consist of men and women, of kings and peasants, of Brahmins and the so-called untouchable (similar 10 the Alwars and Acharyas of Srivaishnavism). 2. Emphasis is laid on the worship of LING A and the images in temples. Linga should never be mistaken for the phallus (This is a perversion of western interpretation). The Lingu actually represents a Pillar of Fire. It is to make men understand that God has no form and yet has form for the worship, enlightenment and upliftment of the adorerS of God. Similarly every image or idol is highly symbolic of the Tattvas as in Pancaratra. For instance the image of Nataraj ll represents the highest symbolism possible. He has in hand a miniature drum whose vibration symbolises creation. He shows by His Abhaya mudra that the souls need have no fear. In an other hand he holcls the fire of destruction. His fourth hand plints downwards indicating that the souls should worship His feet (perform Saranagati - the Prapatti of the Vaishnavas) and obtain the eternal Bliss.

Just as the Pam::aratras give the utmost importance to the Ashtakshari - 'Om Namo Narayanaya'-the Saivagamas give supreme impmtance to the five syllabled sacred Mantra 'Om N �UUah Sivaya'-It is by meditating on the Pancakshari that the souls can achieve the grace of God and attain Hi� supreme Bliss and Beatitude. In fact the twelve verses of the Raurava Agama form the foundation on which the majestic citadel of Saiva siddhanta system of philosophy has been raised. It is said they were taught by God Siva to Manikya vacakar and that Meikandar's Sivajnana bodham is just the tamil translation of the same. Accordingly the manifold universe with its variations of name and fo rm of sex has emanated from Siva Himself. His Sakti creates the Universe out of Maya. Creation consists ofTanu (body), Karana (sense and motor organs), Bhuvana (worlds) and Bhoga (pleasures and Jlains). According to Saiva siddhanta, · • Maya is the material cause of the universe, Siva is the efficient cause, Sakti is the instrumental cause- (sahakari karana). Creation of the universe is again His sport (as in the Pancaratras). It is to provide the souls an opportunity to taste the fruits of Karma and also to help them get rid of their Anavamala. Dissolution of the universe is to give the souls rest from Karma. God Siva is of course in the least affected by the unceasing changes and transformations of the universe (as in the Nityavibhuti of the Pancaratras).

The souls arc dependent on God. His grace (Am! sakti) pervades the entire realm of Being. God pervades everything and is yet beyond and above everything. He is both imminent and transcendent. Though the double aspects of Nitya Vibhuti and Leelavibhuti arc hot so clearly expressed, as in the Pancaratras, the ideas arc the same. VEERASAIVISM: One other dominant aspect of South Indian saivism is Viraso.ivism, founded by Basava in the 12th century A.D. It reveals remarkable features that distinguish it from the Saiva Siddhanta of Tamilnad on the one hand and the Kashmir Saivism ofNorthem India on the other hand. Vccrasaivism is patently an 'Agamanta cult' founded on the Agamas obviously an amplification of the Vedic Saiva cult. Lingayat and Aradhya in popular parlance refer manifestly to the Vecrasaiva cult. The Aradhyas arc brahmins who combine the Hindu Vamasrama dharma with the creed of Veera Saivism. They wear on their bodies the Linga along with the brahminical sacred thread. They repeat the Gayathri in addition to the Pancakshari and fo llow the brahminical Samskaras too. ' Vecrasaivism similar fO other Saiva cults, believes in Siva as the ultimate reality from whom this entire universe is evolved and into whom the entire universe is retracted once again at the lime of Dissolution. This Siva is both Imminent and Transcendent. Great importance is attached to Vibhuti, Rudraksha and Mantra. Sakti is the obedient hand maiden of Siva-Siva as before is the efficient cause, Sakti is the instrumental cause and Maya is the material cause of the Universe. This Sakti-Visishta advaita calls itself Nirviscsha Advaita to distinguish itself from Visistha Advaita on the one hand and 'Kcvala Advaita' (as the Veerasaivas call it) of Samkaracharya on the other hand. It is sometimes said that the Veerasaiva concept of Maya is different from that of and even superior to the Maya concept of Kashmir Saivism.

The Maya referred to by the Kashmir school is identified by the Vcerasaivas with their Adho Maya. We find a similar distinction in Saiva Siddlianta made between Suddha maya, Asuddha maya and Prakriti comparable to Sakti, Maya and Prakriti in Kashmir Saivism. The Vcerasaiva school emphasises Bhakti and Saranagati (as in Pancaratras) as the ultimate means of Liberation. A Lingayat or Veerasaiva is said to be one who practises: 1. Pancakshara, 2.

Tantric sadhana always depends on the personality of the Sadhaka. All cannot pursue the same Tantric discipline, just as all cannot take up to the Tantric cult itself. It all depends on the capacity and innate dispositions of the individuals concerned. For instance a person endowed with Sattvic qualities cannot be initiated into the same sadhana as is meant for a man steeped in Tamas. So also a person noted for his Rajasic qualities cannot be initiated into a sadhana meant for a person of the Satvic or Tamasic disposition. Therefore the Tantras classify men under three heads: i. DIVY A : of divine disposition (Sattvic). ii. VIRA : of heroic disposition (Rajasic). iii. PASU : of animal disposition (Tamasic). These are called the three Bhavas. Padmapadacharya, a favourite disciple of Sankaracharya in his commentary on the Prapancasara commends 5 different ways of viewing the teachings of Tantra sastra. I. Sthula or gross, 2. Sukslun a or subtle, 3. Karana or causal, 4. Samanya or cosmic, 5. Sakshi or witness-like. Everyone is not competent to pursue in all the five ways.

So an average individual adopts a fonn for worship. The Prapancasara of Sankarabhagavatpada and the Sarada Tilaka of Lakshmana Desikendra give a graphic description of the mo des of worship: -. i. The ordinary ritualist offers oblations into the fire which is his deity of worship. ii. The Jnani, the meditator has the object of worship within his heart itself. iii.

The alphabets are of primary significance in the Sak.tagamas. They are call ed the Mother, 'Matrika'. IfDevi is the 'Saririn', her Sarira, body is the'Sabdarthas'. The letters of the alphabet are collectively the source from which every word and every Mantra is evolved. It is out of the MANTRA that the deity is produced. Sankaracharya invokes Goddess Sarada in hiS opening verse in \"Prapanca sara', with the words 'May Sarada purify your mind'. The body of Sarada is composed of the Seven Groups (Varga) into which the sanskrit alphabet is reduced. So the Mantras obtained from the 'Matrikas' are none other than the representatives of the Devi Herself. Hence the Mantra itself is the Devata. The famous 'Pancadasakshari' mantra is born of the 15 Matrikas. It has the 3 parts of 'Vagbhava kuta', 'Kamaraja kuta' and 'Saktikuta'. With its most esoteric 4th part added the same Mantra becomes the 'Sodashakshari'. Thus every letter in the alphabet is vibrant with 'Sakti'. The Sakta Tantras enunciate the most fundamental basic prin ciple that Siva and Sakti are one in essence. There is absolutely no difference between them. While explaining the Emanation of the Universe out of this Primeval Siva-Sak.ti, the Agamas accept the 36 Tattvas. Of these the 5 Suddha Tattvas -SIVA, SAKTI, NADA, BINDHU, and SIJDDHA VIDY A are the most important.

Her other aspects are Sri, Bhuvanesvari, Durga and Kali. According to the Saktagamas the individual Jiva is potentially Siva. Unfortunately it is veiled, bound, limited and restrained by the factors of Mala and Pasa. On a more comprehensive scale the limitations are numbered five and called the Kancukas. (As in Saivagama, there is close affinity between the two agamas). It is these Kancukas that actually outline the descent of the Universe from its ultimate perfect source namely Siva-Sakti. The 5 Kancukas have therefore their place, significance and role in the process of descent and fonnation of this universe, through the 36 principles or forms, Tattvas as they have been called. As the individual soul is subject to these five restric�ng factors it is apuma, imperfect. So if ascent back is required the 5 Kancukas have slowly to be neutralised and completely resolved. The limitations are to-be overcome if the purity, perfection of freedom of the ultimate source is to be realised. Obviously the ascent of the individual soul, the mighty 'little' atom will have to be made in the order of creative de.scent only but with its sign reversed, on the reverse gear. The Tantras speak of the 6 paths or steps 'Shadhadva'. As already suggested the cosmic descent is traced on the following lines: Sakti is Nada and Sakti is Bindu. One is the soil and the other is the seed for purposes of all cosmic generations. From Bindu the next order of polarity is found in Kala and V ama. Kala is the aspect of power both for evolution and involution. It is the starting point for all differentiations from the integrated whole o� Nada-Bindu. Varna .is just the 'Measure or index'.

In th is creative descent, the five-fold perfection .of the Supreme is actually veiled or limited by the five Kancukas, the co�tracting factors : Absoluteness (svatantra), Eternity (Nityat li.) , Eternal self-contentment (Nity a-triptat a), Omnipotence (Sarvakarttrita) and Omniscience \\Sarvajnata) -these five :;.:;r�;::c:ic:-:s at the source are veritably constrained by the five Kancukas respectively, namely: the binding factor (Niyati), the Tense factor (Kala), Appetite (Raga), the factor of apportionment (K.iila) and the blinding factor (A vidyii) . These stabilise in the individual as in the tiniest thing or atom of the Universe. It is CIT o r Cit-Sakti pervading the entire universe of matter and souls. So the soul to realise its own inherent perfecmess or divinity, it has to go up by the reverse gear. The so-called creation is just evolution, manifestation, the outgoing current from Siva-Sakti leading to differentiation and diversification. The Suddha Sattva gradually passes into Asuddha sattva by a graduated series of descent. Finally in the individual, it is the coiled curve, the Kundalini equated with Kanna -the coiled serpent in a supine form with its head downwards. Though in a supine condition, it is the magazine of a latent power. Sublimation therefore consists in rousing the kundalini, the awakening the serpent-power, in uncoiling the coil.-Only by raising the Kundalini can the Asuddha sattva be corrected into Suddha sattva.

The esoteric practice of rousing the Kundalini and making it pierce through the Cakras is not the only means of rousing the Kundalini. In every type of Sadhana whether of worship, Jnana or Bhakti it is roused as all these are regarded the expressions of Cit-Satta, Cit-Sakti and Cit-Vilasa. Apart from the Laya-yoga the Saktagamas emphasise the other aspects of Yoga also such as Hata-yoga, Mantra-yoga and Raja­yoga. But the special feature of the Saktagama consists in instructing how to rouse the Kundalini Sakti coiled in the Muladhara (Sacral plexus) and taking it through the Sushumna nadi in and beyond the various Cakras (Svadhishtana, Manipur a, Anahata, Visudhi and Ajna) into Sahasrara or the thousand petalled lo tus in the brain where the individual can attain union with Sakti and Siva and thus realise the Supreme, Eternal, Infinite Perfect Bliss. The Panca Makaras, the five 'M' s, namely Madya, Mamsa, Matsya, Mudra and Maithuna, the very five forbidden things o.f the common herd of men and women are actually made the Panca Tattvas of the Tantric cult for the Sadhakas of the Vira-bhava type, in particular. Of course the 'Vira' employs the five 'M' s for self-realisation. They are not at all considered as marks of libertinism and depravity. The Panca Tattva are meant for sublimation and not license. It is not at all for the degradation of the individual. In truth it is to sublimate the Eros and not to intensify the Eros. In the words of Sir John Woodroffe-\"The Sadhaka (the Tantric student) is taught not to think that we are one with the Divine in liberation only, but here and now, in every act we do. For in truth all such is Sakti. It is Siva who as Sakti is acting in and through the Sadhaka .....

When the Vira eats, drinks or has sexual intercourse, he does so not with the thought of himself as a separate individual satisfying his own peculiar lim ited wants, an animal filching as it were from nature the enjoyment he has, but thinking of himself in such enjoyment as Siva, saying 'Sivoham', 'Bhairavoham' ' I am Siva', 'I am Bhairava'. The Pancatattvas are of course used in Vamacara Saktaism. In fact there are the two ways of worshipping the Devi -Dakshinacara or Dakshina marga and Vamacara or Varna marga. The Lalita Sahasranama refers to them by stating one of the names of the Devi to be -'Savyapasavya margastha' -The word V am a is derived from the root Varna (left) and not from Varna m eaning woman. All the Saktas adore women as Devi herself. 'Strina padatalan drishtva guruvadbhavayet sada' -The difference between the two Acaras is one of Bhava and rituals. Even among the Vamacarins there are persons who do not use meat, sex and wine. There are vamacarins who worship only Kumaris (girls) upto the age of nine or their own wives. The Pancatattvas need not always be actual. They may be substituted in the same way as meat and wine are substituted in Vedic rituals of late. For instance ginger is placed instead of meat and tender coconut water in a bell-metal vessel is placed instead of wine. It is only in Vamacara saktaism that these five articles are factually insisted upon. But these five very same articles have different meanings for different classes of worshippers. In fact the Kularnava Tantra says : ·· The wine is actually the nectar which flows from the union of Kundalini Sakti with Siva at the Sahasrara. It is the ambrosia flowing from the Cit-Candra-mandala in Yoga. He is said to eat the flesh who kills by the sword of Jnana the animals of Punya and Papa and thinks of the Supreme Siva alone.

Often the question is raised, why this world, why all this manifestation or emanation or even creation. it is clearly pointed out in the Pancaratras that the enti re Universe with all its living and non-living beings is the Leela-Vibhuti of God. God gave out the World and the Souls and then gave the So uls freedom of will, liberty of thought and freedom of action. Since then He has been closeiy watching the Universe. When the Jivas and the material factors have come into contact with each other and are in play so to say it has been revealed that the trend of the Jiva is to get itself more and more involved in the game, get more and more unclean from birth to birth and completely forget its source and sanctity. It looks as though it would never like to come out of the game, think of its home let alone the parents at home. Again God is watching the players closely let alone from a distance, ev en by being in them. He is not only watching, He has also the greatest sympathies; He is very merciful indeed. Not only is He anxiously \\vatching, He is also patiently wait ing for everyone of the Jivas to return to Him. He is not alone in this. Along with Him there is His consort for whose sake indeed the '.¥hole Leelavibhuti is in progress. The Pancaratras give a beauiful description of a chain of Ema­nations and of the Cosmic evolution too. The imminence of God is such He resides in every one of the Images Consecrated and installed. The Jivas can tum to God anytime. If they do not do so they wm be reminded to do so. Finally it is God Himself who comes down in search of His errant sons. Apart from Karma, Jnana and Bhakti, the means of Prapatti is beautifully extolled in .."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"To Sum Up 395 the Pancaratra Agamas. Arta prapatti, Saranagati is sure to work and work quickly too. If one really fe els truly humble before his Heavenly Parents like a helpless child and craves fo r the Parent's help, it is there ever ready. There may be the hauteur of thinking of the lines of seeking self-realisation, 'Atm ananda'. But it is not by that very fact 'Brahmananda'. The soul is ever dependent on God, unfortunately it may fo rget that simple fact by the infection of Avidya or Ahamkara. The Soul is cashiered by its association with Prak.riti which is a symbol of its fall from its high status of knowledge and love of God. To get rid of these Karmic taints so many Sadhanas have been prescribed from times immemorial by various systems and schools. The thirty-two vari eties of Brahma­Vidya prescribed in the'Vedanta are difficult of practice. Hatayoga,,Mantra yoga, Raja yoga and Laya yoga are also not · easy of practice by one and all. Even Karma, Jnana and Bhakti have their own limitations in the case of all. But the greatness of the Pancaratra and a few other Agam as lies in this that they have underlined the Prapatti Marga. Let man cultivate a love for God by knowing His Greatness. Not o nly is He Omniscient, Omnipotent and Omnipresent, His full of Mercy and Grace. Let m�n have absolute fa ith and trust in God. Let man depend on God and none else. God is sure to come to his doors. God is sure to provide succour to the humble seekers of His Gr'!-ce. He never lets down those who depend on Him absolutely an<l always. Trust is God is One's surest strength and fa ith in God is ever unfailing. An innocent appeal to God with the honest feeling of helplessness in oneself is the surest means of obtaining dod's Grace and achieving ultimately Salvation too. The Pancaratra Agam as have done the greatest service of mankind by and large. They have emphasised the One God as the Supreme Father beaming with Mercy and Grace. Father implies a Mother and the role of 'SRI' in the Pancaratras is also great in making a just and stem disciplinarian a fo rgiving father too for the· soul. The intercession of the Heavenly Mother on behalf of Her �rring children, the repe_ntent souls is really moving."},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"396 Philosophy of Pancaratras The Agamas have replaced almost all the Vedic rituals by the innocuous forms of worship and adoration. They have bypassed the strenuous paths of Yoga beset with innumerable hazards even for those who can take up to them. They have displaced the B rahma Vidyas mostly steeped in arduous ascetic practices and highly intelligent technicalities by the simple approach of the heart namely Bhakti and Saranagati. They have provided an easy platfom1 for performing Prapatti in the presence of the Area fonn of the Lord. They have underlined simple living and advanced a community of art-less Souls and honest believers. Above all they have advocated trust in a GURU as a prelude to trust and. faith in God. They have struck at the root of the distinctions of' caste or sex among the lovers of God. He is the true servant of God who serves His devotees first and fo remost. The worship of the Bhagavatas is in itself the worship of the Bhagavat. They have thrown open a public thoroughfare to Moksha. It is the shortest as al.so the straight and the safest route. Gone fo r ever are the old conservative ideas of viewing God meant only-for a privileged few, the VIP's of Vedantic aristocracy. God is in everyone, everywhere and for all. To know that with feeling and conviction is to elevate oneself to HIS Grace. There are no barriers to GOD except by one's own making through the arrogance of Self-love and the consequent apathy towards the rest of His Creation. · It is the AGAMAS that have made possible the innumerable temples and convenient objects of worship with the living presence of GOD therein. There is no viilage without a Temple and there is no home without an IDOL or an IMAGE for adoration. The individual's conscience is ever kept awake, always tuned to a divine hormony whether at home or outside it. ,·\\ \\o / \\,0/ '! ,. I ../\"\\ / t I i .;./'\\ /. I .· _.-\"\") . .i I /' '"}]
