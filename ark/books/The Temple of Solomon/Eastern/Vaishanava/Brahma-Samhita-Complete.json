According to Vedic tradition, these “Hymns of Brahma” were recited or sung countless millennia ago by the first created being in the universe, just prior to the act of creation. The text surfaced and entered calculable history early in the sixteenth century when it was discovered by a pilgrim exploring the manuscript library of an ancient temple in what is now Kerala state in South India. Prior to the introduction of the printing press, texts like Brahma-samhita existed only in manuscript form, painstakingly handwritten by scribes and kept under brahminical custodianship in temples, where often they were worshiped as sastra-Deity, or God incarnate in holy scripture. The pilgrim who rescued Brahma-samhita from obscurity was no ordinary pilgrim, and His pilgrimage was not meant, as is the custom, for self-purification but for world-purification. He was Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu—saint, mystic, religious reformer, and full incarnation of the Supreme Lord, Sri Krsna, descending into the present epoch for the salvation of all souls. At the time of His discovery of the text, Sri Caitanya was touring South India, preaching His message of love of Krsna and promulgating the practice of sankirtana, congregational singing of the holy names of God . Sri Caitanya commenced this tour shortly after becoming a monk (sannyasi), at age twenty four, and the tour lasted approximately two years. After a southward journey from Puri (in Orissa State) that carried Him to holy places such as Sri Ranga-ksetra, Setubandha Ramesvara, and finally Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin), he turned northward and, traveling along the bank of the Payasvini River in Travancore state, reaches the temple of Adi-kesava, in Trivandrum district. Sri Caitanya’s principal biographer, Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, writes in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya-lila, Ch. 9) that upon beholding the holy image of Adi-kesava (Krsna) in the temple, Caitanya was overwhelmed with spiritual ecstasy, offered fervent prayers, and chanted and danced in rapture, a wondrous sight that was received with astonished appreciation by the devotees there. After discussing esoteric spiritual matters among some highly advanced devotees present, Sri Caitanya found “one chapter of the Brahma-samhita” (what we now have as Brahma-samhita is, according to tradition, only one of a hundred chapters composing an epic work lost to humanity). Upon discovering the manuscript, Sri Caitanya felt great ecstasy and fell into an intense mystic rapture that overflowed onto the physical realm, producing a profusion of tears, trembling and perspiration. (We would search the literature of the world in vain to find a case in which the discovery of a lost book inspired such unearthly exhilaration!) Intuiting the Brahma-samhita to be a “most valuable jewel,” He employed a scribe in hand-copying the manuscript and departed with the copy for His return journey to the north. Upon His return to Puri (Madhya-lila, Ch. 11), Sri Caitanya presented Brahma-samhita to appreciative followers like Ramananda Raya and Vasudeva Datta, for whom Caitanya arranged copies to be made. As word of the discovery of the text spread within the Vaisnava community, “each and every Vaisnava” copied it. Gradually, Brahma-samhita"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" was “broadcast everywhere” and became one of the major texts of the Gaudiya-Vaisnava canon. “There is no scripture equal to the Brahma-samhita as far as the final spiritual conclusion is concerned,” exults Krsnadasa Kaviraja. “Indeed, that scripture is the supreme revelation of the glories of Lord Govinda, for it reveals the topmost knowledge about Him. Since all conclusions are briefly presented in Brahma-samhita, it is essential among all the Vaisnava literatures.” (Madhya-lila 9.239-240) Now, what of the text itself? What are its contents? A synopsis of the Brahma-samhiti is provided by Srila Prabhupada, founder-acarya of the Krsna consciousness movement, in his commentary to the Caytanya-caritamrta. It is quoted here in full: In [Brahma-samhita], the philosophical conclusion of acintya-bhedabheda-tattva (simultaneous oneness and difference) is presented. [It] also presents methods of devotional service, the eighteen-syllable Vedic hymn, discourses on the soul, the Supersoul and fruitive activity, an explanation of kama-gayatri, kama-bija and the original Maha-Visnu, and a specific description of the spiritual world, specifically Goloka Vrndavana. Brahma-samhita also explains the demigod Ganesa, the Garbhodakasayi Visnu, the origin of the Gayatri mantra, the form of Govinda and His transcendental position and abode, the living entities, the highest goal, the goddess Durga, the meaning of austerity, the five gross elements, love at Godhead, impersonal Brahman, the initiation of Lord Brahma, and the vision of transcendental love enabling one to see the Lord. The steps of devotional service are also explained. The mind, yoga-nidra, the goddess of fortune, devotional service in spontaneous ecstasy, incarnations beginning with Lord Ramacandra. Deities, the conditioned soul and its duties, the truth about Lord Visnu, prayers, Vedic hymns, Lord Siva, Vedic literature. personalism and impersonalism, good behavior and many other subjects are also discussed. There is also a description of the sun and the universal forms of the Lord. All these subjects are conclusively explained in a nutshell in this Brahma-samhita. (Madhya-lila, Vol. 4, p. 37) In spite of the seeming topical complexity of the text, the essential core of the Brahma-samhita consists of a brief description of the enlightenment of Lord Brahma by Lord Sri Krsna, followed by Brahma’s extraordinarily beautiful prayers elucidating the content of his revelation: an earthly,beatific vision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna, and His eternal, transcendental abode, Goloka Vrndavana, beyond the material cosmos. This core of the text stretches through verse twenty-nine to fifty-six, and a brief, subsequent exposition by Lord Krsna on the path of krsna-bhakti, love of God, brings the text to a close. The Brahma-samhita’s account of Brahma’s enlightenment is quite interesting and can be summarized here. When Lord Vishnu (Garbhodakasayi Vishnu) desires to recreate the universe, a divine golden lotus flower grows from His navel, and Brahma is born from this lotus. As he is not born from parents, Brahma is known as “Svayambhu” (“self-existent” or “unoriginated”). Upon his emergence from the lotus, Brahms begins—in preparation for his role as secondary creator—to contemplate the act of cosmic creation but, seeing only darkness about, is bewildered in the performance of his duty. Sarasvati, the goddess of learning, appears before him and instructs him to meditate upon the kama-bija mantru"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" (Klim krsnaya govindaya gopijana-vallabhaya svaha), promising that this mantra “will assuredly fulfill your heart’s desire.” Lord Brahms thus meditates upon Lord Krsna in His spiritual realm and hears the divine sound of Krsna`s flute. The kama-gayatri mantra (Klim kamadevaya vidmahe puspa-banaya dhimahi tan no nangah pracodayat), the “mother of the Vedas,” is made manifest from the sound of Krsna’s flute, and Brahma, thus initiated by the supreme primal preceptor Himself, begins to chant the Gayatri. (As Srila Prabhupada puts it, “When the sound vibration of Krsna’s flute is expressed through the mouth of Brahma, it becomes gayatri” [teachings of Lord Caytanya, p. 322]). Enlightened by meditation upon the sacred Gayatri, Brahma “became acquainted with the expanse of the ocean of truth.” Inspired by his profound and sublime realizations, his heart overflowing with devotion and transcendental insight, Lord Brahma spontaneously begins to offer a series of poem-prayers to the source of his enlightenment and the object of his devotion, Lord Sri Krsna. These exquisite verses form the heart of the Brahma-samhita. There is nothing vague about Brahms’s description of the Lord and His abode. No dim, nihilistic nothingness, no blinding bright lights, no wispy, dreamy visions of harps and clouds; rather, a vibrant, luminescent world in transcendental color, form, and sound—a sublimely variegated spiritual landscape populated by innumerable blissful, eternally liberated souls reveling in spiritual cognition, sensation, and emotion, all in relationship with the all-blissful, all-attractive Personality of Godhead. Here is a sample: I worship Govinda [Krsna, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor who is tending the cows, yielding all desire, in abodes built with spiritual gems. surrounded by millions or purpose trees, always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of Laksmis or gopis. I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is adept in playing on His flute, with blooming eyes like lotus petals, with head decked with peacock’s feather, with the figure of beauty tinged with the hue of blue clouds, and His unique loveliness charming millions of Cupid. ... I worship [Goloka Vrndavana] ... where every tree is a transcendental purpose tree; where the soil is the purpose gem, all water is nectar, every word is a song, every gait is a dance, the flute is the favorite atten-dant.... where numberless milk cows always emit transcendental oceans of milk. The commentator reminds us (p. 104) that in the transcendental region of Goloka are found the same elements as are found in the mundane worlds, but in their highest purity and beauty: “... trees and creepers, mountains, rivers and forests, water, speech, movement, music of the flute, the sun and the moon, tasted and taste ...” Krsna’s divine abode, Goloka Vrndavana, is a world in the fullest and realist sense. There are those who will have difficulty with Brahma’s highly graphic and personalistic depiction of the spiritual world and of the liberated state. Some, for instance, whose conception of transcendence is determined by a certain logical fallacy based on the arbitrary assumption that spirit is the literal opposite of matter (and thus that because matter has form and variety spirit must necessarily be formless and unvariegated),"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" conceive of ultimate reality as some sort of divine emptiness. However, any conception of transcendence that projects or analogizes from our limited sensory and cognitive experience within the material world is, by its very nature, limited and speculative and thus unreliable. No accumulated quantity of sense data within this world can bring us to knowledge of what lies beyond it. Residents of the material world cannot get even a clue of transcendence, argues our Brahma-samhita commentator, “by moving heaven and earth through their organic senses” (p. xix). The Brahma-samhita teaches what transcendence, truth, ultimate reality can be apprehended only by the mercy of the supreme transcendent entity the Absolute Truth Himself, and that perception of ultimate reality is a function not of speculative reason but of direct spiritual cognition through divine revelation. This revelation is evolved through bhakti, pure, selfless love of God. Only by such spiritual devotion can Krsna be seen: “I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord ... whom the pure devotees see in their heart of hearts with the eye of devotion tinged with the salve of love” (verse 38). Further, as our commentator explains, “the form of Krsna is visible (to the eye of the pure spiritual self] in proportion to its purification by the practice of devotion” (p. 75). Bhakti as a state of consciousness, then, is attained through bhakti as a practice, a discipline. For this reason, Lord Krsna in His response to Brahma at the end of the text, summarizes the path or bhakti in five aphorisms. This devotional discipline goes far beyond conventional piety. It necessitates “constant endeavor for self-realization” (verse 59) involving both a turning from worldly, sense-gratificatory activities as well as sincere absorption in spiritual practices and behavior, under the guidance of authorized scripture. Through such practice, then, the materialist is purified of his tendency toward philosophical negation and comes to understand the nature of positive transcendence. Others will find Lord Brahma’s vision of the spiritual realm problematic for a related, but perhaps more subjective, emotional reason that goes to the heart of the human condition. There is a kind of ontological anxiety, a conscious or subconscious apprehension about beingness or existence itself, that goes along with embodied life-in-the-world—that accompanies the soul’s descent into the temporal, endlessly changing world of matter. Material bodies and minds are subjected to a huge variety of objective and subjective discomfitures, unpleasantries, and abject sufferings within the material world. Viewed philosophically, embodied person hood, false-self (ahnkara), is, to a greater or lesser degree, innately a condition of suffering. Because personal existence has been experienced by materialists as essentially painful, writes Prabhupada in his Bhagavad-gita commentary, “the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void” (4.10, purport). Entering the path of bhakti, however, such persons can gradually begin to experience their real, spiritual selves and a release from egoistic anxiety. In that purified state, they become able to relish Brahma’s vision of blissful, personal spiritual existence in Goloka. Still others. however, might criticize Brahma-samhita on the grounds that the text, being quite specific and concrete in its depiction, merely offers another limited, sectarian view of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" God and His abode—a view in conflict with other, similarly limited views. Such persons prefer a kind of genericized Deity who doesn’t offend variant theological views with definable, personal attributes. Brahma-samhita, however, is not a polemic against “competing” conceptions of the Deity (except those, of courses, which would deny His transcendental person hood). Vaisnava tradition does not dismiss images of the Divine derived from authoritative scripture from beyond its own cultural and conceptual borders. It respects any sincere effort at serving the Supreme Person, although naturally it holds its own texts as most comprehensive and authoritative. It promotes neither an arrogant sectarianism that would constrain transcendence to exclusive cultural, ideational, or linguistic forms (and burn a few heretics), nor a syncretistic ecumenism that would try to pacify all claimants on the truth by departicularizing it into bland vagary. Let the syncretists and the sectarians come together to appreciate, at least, the aesthetic magnificence of Brahma’s theistic epiphany. What we are experiencing through Lord Brahma in his samhita is not mystic hallucination nor quaint mythologizing nor an exercise in pious wishful thinking. We are getting a glimpse, however dimmed by our own insensitivities, into the spiritual world as seen by one whose eyes are “tinged with the salve of love.” We are seeing, through Brahma, an eternal, transcendental world of which the present world is a mere reflection. Goloka is infinitely more real than the shadowy world we perceive daily through our narrow senses. Brahma’s vision of the spiritual realm is not his alone. It is shared by all those who give themselves fully unto the loving service of Lord Krsna—though Brahma admits that Goloka is known “only to a very few self-realized souls in this world” (verse 56). We are not asked to accept Brahma’s account of transcendence uncritically and dogmatically but to avail ourselves of the spiritual disci-pline, bhakti-yoga, that will gradually lead us to our own experiential understanding of this highest truth. The publishers of this small volume hope that a careful perusal of the text will inspire bhakti in the heart of the reader. It should be noted that Brahma-samhita is an advanced spiritual text and is more easily understood once one already has some familiarity with texts such as Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam, Caitanya-cariramrta, and Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu. This volume is a new and expanded edition of an English language Brahma-samhita edition published in India in 1932 by the Gaudiya Math (a Caitanya-Vaisnava religious institution), with subsequent reprints in 1958 and 1973. These editions featured the English translation and commentary of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami (1874-1937), a great Vaisnava saint and scholar of wide repute and the founder of the Gaudiya Math. It was Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati who inspired the founder and spiritual master of the Hare Krsna movement, his dearmost disciple Srila A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, to journey to and teach Krsna consciousness in the West, beginning in 1965. As per Srila Prabhupada’s instructions regarding the publication of this volume, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati’s somewhat technical and sometimes difficult prose has been left intact and virtually untouched. Fearing that any editorial (grammatical and stylistic) tampering with Bhaktisiddhanta’s text might result in inadvertent changes in meaning, Prahhupada asked that it be left as is, and the editors of this volume have complied with"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" his wishes. Only typographical errors have been corrected, capitalization has been standardized, Sanskrit terms in devanagari script appearing within the English text have been transliterated, and already transliterated terms have been adjusted to international standards. In this edition, the original devanagari text is shown for each verse of the Brahma-samhita-, followed by roman transliteration, then by a word-for-word translation into English. (The original Indian edition lacked the latter two features.) These, in turn, are followed by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati’s full English translation and commentary. His commentary closely follows that of his father, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura ( 1838-1914), the great Vaisnava saint, reformer, and prolific scholar who initiated a revival of pure Caitanya-Vaisnavism during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Finally an index and glossary have been added for the convenience of the reader, as well as several color plates. The Indian edition of Brahma-samhita included the complete text, in Sanskrit, of the commentary of Jiva Gosvami, the great Caitanyite philosopher, but that has been excluded from this edition because, in light of the relative few in the West who would benefit from its inclusion, it was decided that the neces-sary doubling of the volume’s size and price would be disadvantageous. In his commentary to the twenty-eighth verse of the text, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati writes that Lord Caitanya “taught this hymn to His favorite disciples in as much as it fully contains all the transcendental truths regarding Vaisnava philosophy,” and he asks his readers to “study and try to enter into the spirit of his hymn with great care and attention, as a regular daily function.” His disciple Srila Prabhupada was very fond of Brahma’s prayers to Lord Krsna (... govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami), and there are several recordings of Prabhupada singing these prayers with obvious, intense devotion. The publishers join with the commentator in inviting readers to dive deeply into the sweet, transcendental ocean of Brahma’s hymns as a daily meditation. C Subhananda Dasa "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Çré Brahma-saàhitä Foreword The materialistic demeanor cannot possibly stretch to the transcendental autocrat who is ever inviting the fallen conditioned souls to associate with Him through devotion or eternal serving mood. The phenomenal attractions are often found to tempt sentient beings to enjoy the variegated position which is opposed to undifferenced monism. People are so much apt to indulge in transitory speculations even when they are to educate themselves on a situation beyond their empiric area or experiencing jurisdiction. The esoteric aspect often knocks them to trace out immanence in their outward inspection of transitory and transformable things. This impulse moves them to fix the position of the immanent to an indeterminate impersonal entity, no clue of which could be discerned by moving earth and heaven through their organic senses. The lines of this booklet will surely help such puzzled souls in their march towards the personality of the immanent lying beyond their sensuous gaze of inspection. The very first stanza of this publication will revolutionize their reserved ideas when the nomenclature of the Absolute is put before them as “Kåñëa.” The speculative mind would show a tendency of offering some other attributive name to designate the unknown object. They will prefer to brand Him by their experience as the “creator of this universe,”“the entity beyond phenomena”—far off the reference of any object of nature and void of all transformation. So they will urge that the very fountainhead should have no conceivable designation except to show a direction of the invisible, and inaudible untouchable, nonfragrant and unperceivable object. But they will not desist from contemplating on the object with their poor fund of experience. The interested enquirer will be found to hanker after the records left by erudite savants to incompatible hallucinative views of savage demonstration. In comparing the different names offered by different thoughts of mankind, a particular judge would decide in favor of some nomenclature which will suit best his limited and specific whims. The slave mentality of an individual will no doubt offer invective assertions to the rest who will be appealing to him for a revelation of his decision. To remedy this evil, the hymns of the accepted progenitor of the phenomena would do great help in taking up the question of nomenclature which is possessed of adequate power to dispel all imaginations drawn out of their experiencing the phenomena by their tentative exploitations."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" The first hymn will establish the supremacy of the Absolute Truth, if His substratum is not shot by the bullets of limited time, ignorance and uncomfortable feeling, as well as by recognizing the same as an effect instead of accepting Him as the prime cause. He will be satisfied to mark that the object of their determination is the par“excellent Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa who has eternally embodied Himself in His ever-presence, all-blissful, all-pervasive perfected knowledge as the very fountainhead of all prime causes of unending nonbeginning time, the supplying fosterer of all entities, viz., mundane and transcendental. The subsequent lines will go to determine the different aspects of the Absolute, who are but emanations of the supreme fountainhead Kåñëa, the attractive entity of all entities. Moreover, the derivative proclamation of the nomenclature will indicate the plane of uninterrupted, unending, transcendental felicity and the nomenclature Himself is the source of the two components which go by the names of efficient and material causes. The very transcendental name “Kåñëa” is known as the embodiment of all the transcendental eternal rasas as well as the origin of all eclipsed conceptions of interrupted rasas found in the mentality of animated beings which are successfully depicted by litterateurs and rhetoricians for our mundane speculation. The verses of Brahma-saàhitä are a full elucidation of the origination of phenomenal and noumenic conceptions. The hymns of the incarnated prime potency has dealt fully with the monotheistic speculations of different schools which are busy to give an outer cover of an esoteric concoction without any reference to the true eternal aspect of transcendental nontransformable and imperishable manifestation of the immanent. The hymns have also dealt with different partial aspects of the personality of the Absolute who is quite isolated from the conception of the enjoyers of this phenomenal world. A very close attention and a comparative study of all prevailing thoughts and conceptions will relieve and enlighten all—be he a materialist, a downright atheist, an agnostic, a sceptic, a naturalist, a pantheist or a panantheist—busy with their knowledge of three dimensions only by their speculative exertions. This booklet is only the fifth chapter of the Hymns of Brahmä which were recorded in a hundred chapters. The Supreme Lord Çré Caitanya picked up this chapter from the temple of Ädi-keçava at Tiruvattar, a village lying under the government of Travancore, for the assurance of all God-loving, and especially Kåñëa-loving, people in this conditioned jurisdiction. This booklet can easily be compared with another book which passes by the name of Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Though it has got a reference in the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" pantheon of Puräëas, the Bhägavatam corroborates the same idea of this Païcarätra. The devotees should consider that these two books tend to the identical Kåñëa who is the fountainhead of all transcendental and mundane entities and has a manifestive exhibition of the plenary variegatedness. Aspersions of calumniation are restricted in the limited world, whereas transcendence cannot admit such angularities being an angle of 180 degrees or void of any angular discrepancies. The publisher is carried away to the realm of gratitude when his stores of publication are scrutinized. Öhäkura Bhaktivinoda has given an elucidatory purport of the conception of the most sublime fountainhead of all entities in Bengali, and one of his devout followers has rendered that into English for propagatory purpose. The purports and the translations are traced to the backgrounds of the writings of Çréla Jéva Gosvämé, a contemporary follower of the Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa Caitanya. The emotional aspirations will find fair play in perusing the texts of this brochure by one and all who have any interest in pure theistic achievements. The materialistic inspection often goes on to say that the provincial conception of theism has made the depicting of transcendental unity into diverse face quite opposed to the ethical consideration of the limited region. But we differ from such erroneous considerations when we get a prospective view of the manifested transcendentality eliminating all historicities and allegorical enterprises. All our enjoying mood should have a different direction when we take into account the transcendental entity who has obsessed all frailties and limitations of nature. So we solicit the happier mood of the scrutinizers to pay special attention to the importance of manifestive transcendence in Kåñëa. It was found necessary to publish this small book for the use of English-knowing people who are interested in the acme of transcendental truths in their manifestive phases. The theme delineated in the texts of this book is quite different from the ordinary heaps of poetical mundane literature, as they are confined to our limited aspiration of senses. The book was found in the South some four centuries ago and it is again brought into light in the very same country after a long time, just like the worshiping of the Goddess Ganges by the offering of her own water.

Hence it is evident that Kåñëa is sole Supreme Godhead. His unrivaled or unique spiritual body of superexcellent charm is eternally unveiled with innumerable spiritual instrumentals (senses) and unreckonable attributes keeping their signifying location properly, adjusting at the same time by His inconceivable conciliative powers. This beautiful spiritual figure is identical with Kåñëa and the spiritual entity of Kåñëa is identical with His own figure. The very intensely blended entity of eternal presence of felicitous cognition is the charming targeted holding or transcendental icon. It follows that the conception of the indistinguishable formless magnitude (Brahman) which is an indolent, lax, presentment of cognitive bliss, is merely a penumbra of intensely blended glow of the three concomitants, viz., the blissful, the substantive and the cognitive. This transcendental manifestive icon Kåñëa in His original face is primordial background of magnitudinal infinite Brahman and of the all-pervasive oversoul. Kåñëa as truly visioned in His variegated pastimes, such as owner of transcendental cows, chief of cowherds, consort of milk-maids, ruler of the terrestrial abode Gokula and object of worship by transcendental residents of Goloka beauties, is Govinda. He is the root cause of all causes who are the predominating and predominated agents of the universe. The glance of His projected fractional portion in the sacred originating water viz., the personal oversoul or Paramätmä, gives rise to a secondary potency—nature who creates this mundane universe. This oversoul’s intermediate energy brings forth the individual souls analogously to the emanated rays of the sun.

TRANSLATION [The spiritual place of transcendental pastimes of Kåñëa is portrayed in the second verse.] The superexcellent station of Kåñëa, which is known as Gokula, has thousands of petals and a corolla like that of a lotus sprouted from a part of His infinitary aspect, the whorl of the leaves being the actual abode of Kåñëa. PURPORT Gokula, like Goloka, is not a created mundane plane—unbounded character forms the display of His unlimited potency and His propagating manifestation. Baladeva is the mainstay of that energy. The transcendental entity of Baladeva has two aspects viz., infinite spiritual manifestation and infinite accommodating space for insentient gross things. The uniquadrantal delineation of material universe will be dealt with in the proper place. The triquadrantal extensions of the transcendental infinitary field of the almighty, unlamenting, nonperishing and nonapprehending unlimited situations of halo which are fully spiritual majestic foliation. This very majestical extension portrays the manifested lofty rich feature of the vaster unlimited region or greater atmosphere which has its resplendent location wholly beyond the realm of mundane nature, on the further shore of Virajä surrounded by the halo of Brahman or indistinguishable entity. This majestical power of unlimited spirit emanates on the upper portion of the luminous sphere into the most charming Gokula or eternally existing Goloka, exceedingly beautified by the assorted display of effulgence. Some designate this region as the abode of the Supreme Näräyaëa, or the original fountainhead. Hence Gokula, which is identical with Goloka, is the supreme plane. The same sphere shines as Goloka and Gokula respectively by its upper or transcendental and lower or mundane situation. Çré Sanätana Gosvämé has told us as follows in his Båhad-bhägavatämåta which embodies the final essence of all the books of instructions: “He displays His pastimes here in this land as He is used to do in Goloka. The difference between the two planes"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ lies only in their locations as high and low; that is, in other words, Kåñëa plays exactly the same part in Goloka as He exhibits on the mundane plane of Gokula. There is practically no difference between Gokula and Goloka save that this what exists in the shape of Goloka in the upper region is the same as Gokula on the mundane plane when Kåñëa showed His various activity there. Çré Jéva Gosvämé has also inculcated the same in the Bhagavat-sandarbha of his ‘Six Treatises.’ ” To ascertain the plane of Goloka—Våndävana is the eternal abode of Kåñëa and Goloka and Våndävana are identically one, and though both are identical, yet Kåñëa’s inconceivable energy has made Goloka the acme of this spiritual kingdom and Gokula of Mathurä province forming a part of the mundane plane which is also a manifestation of triquadrantal vibhüti (conducting majesty). Poor human understanding cannot possibly make out how the extensive triquadrantal, which is beyond human comprehension, can be accommodated in the limited nether material universe of a uniquadrantal disclosure. Gokula is a spiritual plane, hence his condescended position in the region of material space, time, etc., is in no way restricted but unlimitedly manifested with his full boundless propriety. But conditioned souls are apt to assert a material conception in regard to Gokula by their miserable senses so as to bring him below the level of their intellect. Though the eye of an observer is impeded by a cloud when gazing at the sun and though the tiny cloud can never really cover the sun, still the clouded vision apparently observes the sun as covered by the cloud. In just the same way the conditioned souls with their obscured intelligence, senses and decisions, accept Gokula as a piece of measurable land. We can see Gokula from Goloka which is eternal. This is also a mystery. The attainment of final beatitude is the success in attaining one’s eternal self. The success in identifying the true self is finally achieved when the screen of gross and subtle coils of conditioned souls is removed by the sweet will of Kåñëa. However, the idea of Goloka is seen to differ from Gokula till the success in unalloyed devotion is achieved. The transcendental plane of infinite spiritual manifestation having thousands of petals and corolla like those of the lotus, is Gokula, the eternal abode of Kåñëa.

In his Kåñëa-sandarbha Çré Jéva Gosvämé Prabhu says,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ “Nonmanifestive pastimes are expressed in manifestive kåñëa-lélä. and goloka-lélä is the nonmanifestive pastimes of Kåñëa visualized from the mundane plane.” This is also corroborated by Çré Rüpa in his Bhägavatämåta. The progressive transcendental manifestation of Gokula is Goloka. So Goloka is the selfsame majestic manifestation of Gokula. The eternal pastimes of Çré Kåñëa, although not visible in Gokula, are eternally manifested in Goloka. Goloka is the transcendental majestic manifestation of Gokula. The manifestations of the nonmanifestive pastimes of Kåñëa with regard to the conditioned souls, are twofold, viz., (1) worship through the channel of the mantras (inaudibly recited, liberating, self-dedicatory. transcendental sounds), (2) spontaneous outflow of heart’s spiritual love for Kåñëa. Çré Jéva Gosvämé has said that worship through the mantra is possible permanently in the proper place, when confined to one pastime. This meditative manifestation of Goloka is the pastime attended with the worship of Kåñëa through the mantra. Again, the pastimes that are performed in different planes and in different moods, are autocratic in diverse ways; hence svä-rasiké, i.e., spontaneous, outflow of heart’s spiritual love for Kåñëa. This çloka conveys a twofold meaning. One meaning is that in the pastime attended with worship through the mantra consisting of eighteen transcendental letters, transcendental words contained in the said mantra being differently placed make a manifestation of only one lélä of Çré Kåñëa. As for example kléà kåñëäya govindäya gopéjana-vallabhäya svähä—this is a hexagonal mantra consisting of six transcendental words, viz., (1) kåñëäya, (2) govindäya, (3) gopéjana, (4) vallabhäya, (5) svä, (6) hä. These six transcendental words, when placed juxtapositionally. indicate the mantra. The hexagonal great transcendental machinery is in this wise. The principal seed, i.e. kléà, is situated in the instrument as the central pivot. Anybody with an impression of such an instrument in his mind and concentrating his thought on such spiritual entities, can attain, like Candradhvaja, to the knowledge of the cognitive principle. The word svä indicates kñetrajïa i.e., one who is conversant with one’s inner self, and the word hä indicates the transcendental nature. This meaning of the mantra has also been corroborated by Çré Hari-bhakti-viläsa. The general meaning is this that one who is desirous of entering into the esoteric pastimes of Kåñëa will have to practice His transcendental service along with the culture of the devotional knowledge relative to Him. (1) kåñëa-svarüpa—the proper Self of Kåñëa; (2) kåñëasya cin-maya-vraja-lélä-viläsa-svarüpa—the true nature of Kåñëa’s transcendental pastimes in Vraja; (3) tat-parikara-gopéjana-svarüpa—the true nature of His spiritual associates in Vraja, viz., the spiritual milkmen and the milkmaids; (4) tad-vallabha—the true nature of self-surrender to Kåñëa in the footsteps of the spiritual milkmaids of Vraja; (5) çuddha-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ jévasya cid-(jïäna)-svarüpa—the true nature of the spiritual knowledge of the unalloyed individual soul; (6) cit-prakåtir arthät kåñëa-sevä-svabhäva—the true nature of transcendental service to Kåñëa is this that the esoteric relation is established on the awakening of one’s pure cognition. The meaning is that rasa is only the transcendental service of the central refuge Çré Kåñëa, as predominating aspect of the Absolute, by one’s ego as the spiritual maid of the predominated moiety of the absolute integer, attended with pure devotion in the shape of one’s entire self-surrender. The pastime in Goloka or in Gokula during the stage of devotional progress, is the meditative worship through the mantra, and during the stage of perfection the pastimes manifest themselves as the unrestrained transcendental jubilations. This is the real aspect of Goloka or Gokula, which will be made more explicit in due course. The meaning of the words jyoté-rüpeëa manunä [Bs 5.3] is that the transcendental meaning is expressed in the mantra by means of which, on transcendental desire of love for Kåñëa and the service of Kåñëa being added, one is established in the eternal love of Kåñëa. Such eternal pastimes are eternally manifested in Goloka.

TRANSLATION [The surrounding external plane of Gokula is described in this verse.] There is a mysterious quadrangular place named Çvetadvépa surrounding the outskirts of Gokula. Çvetadvépa is divided into four parts on all sides. The abode of Väsudeva, Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are separately located in each of these four parts. These four divided abodes are enveloped by the fourfold human requirements such as piety, wealth, passion and liberation, as also by the four Vedas, viz., Åg, Säma, Yajur and Atharva, which deal with the mantra and which are the bases of achievements of the fourfold mundane requirements. Ten tridents are fixed in the ten directions, including the zenith and nadir. The eight directions are decorated with the eight jewels of Mahäpadma, Padma, Çaìkha, Makara, Kacchapa, Mukunda, Kunda, and Néla. There are ten protectors [dik-pälas] of the ten directions in the form of mantra. The associates of the hues of blue, yellow, red and white and the extraordinary potencies bearing the names of Vimala, etc., shine on all sides. PURPORT Primarily Gokula is the seat of transcendental love and devotion. Hence Yamunä, Çré Govardhana, Çré Rädhä-kuëòa, etc., of the terrestrial Vraja-maëòala lie within Gokula. Again, all the majesties of Vaikuëöha are manifested there extending in all directions. The pastimes of the four propagating manifestations are all there in their"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ proper places. The paravyoma Vaikuëöha has got its extension from the display of the four propagating manifestations. Salvation as of Vaikuëöha, and piety. wealth and passion pertaining to worldly people, are in the proper places in Gokula as their original seed, i.e., primary cause. The Vedas also are engaged in singing the song of the Lord of Gokula. There are ten tridents in ten directions to prevent and disappoint those who are aspirants for having an entrance into Goloka through meditations without the grace of Kåñëa. Self-conceited people who try to reach this region through the paths of yoga (meditation) and jïäna (empiric knowledge) are baffled in their attempts, being pierced by the ten tridents. Self-annihilation has its excellence in Brahma-dhäma which represents the outside covering of Goloka in the shape of tridents. Çüla means a trident; the mundane threefold attributes and the threefold divisions of time represent the trident. Añöäìga-yogis i.e. ascetics who practice the eightfold yoga, are the nondifferentiative liberationists who, trying to approach in the direction of Goloka, fall headlong into the pits of disappointment by being pierced and cut asunder by these tridents placed in ten directions. Those who proceed towards the direction of Goloka through the channel of devotion alloyed with majestic ideas, are fascinated with the charms of Vaikuëöha which is the outer covering plane of Çré Goloka, at the sight of the eight perfections, viz., aëimä, etc., and majesties like mahäpadma, etc. Those who are less forward in their intelligence relapse to the sevenfold world falling under the control of the ten protectors (of the ten directions) in the guise of mantras. In this wise, Goloka has become unknowable and inaccessible. It is only the divine selves of Godhead, the propounders of the divine dispensations for the different ages, who are always forward there to favor the approaching devotees who seek entry into the realm of Goloka through the channel of pure devotional love. These divine forms of Godhead are surrounded there with attendants of their respective natures. Çvetadvépa in Goloka is their place of abode. Hence Çréla Öhäkura Våndävana the manifest Vyäsa of caitanya-lélä, has described the village of Navadvépa as bearing the name of Çvetadvépa. In this Çvetadvépa the concluding portions of the pastimes of Gokula exist eternally as the pastimes of Navadvépa. Hence the region of Navadvépa, Vraja and the realm of Goloka are one and the same indivisible entity; the difference only lies in the manifestations of the infinite variety of sentiments, corresponding to the diverse nature of their devotional love. There is in this a most hidden principle which only the greatest souls who are possessed of the highest transcendental love, are enabled to realize by the direct grace of Kåñëa. The truth is as follows: In this mundane world there are fourteen spheres disposed in the graded order of high and low. Persons living with wives and children hankering for the pleasure-giving effect of their fruitive actions, move up and down within the limits of the three worlds of Bhüù, Bhuvaù and Svaù. Brahmacärés of great austerities, ascetics and"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ persons addicted to hypothetical truth, persons of a neutral disposition adopting nonfruitive works by an aptitude which seeks to be free from all mundane desires, move up and down within the limits of the worlds of Mahaù, Janaù, Tapaù and Satya. Above these worlds lies the abode of four-headed Brahmä, above which lies the unlimited realm of Vaikuëöha of Viñëu, Kñérodakaçäyé, lying in the ocean of milk. paramahaàsa-sannyäsés and the demons killed by Çré Hari, by crossing the Virajä, i.e., by passing beyond the fourteen worlds, enter into the luminous realm of Brahman and attain to nirväëa in the form of temporary abeyance of the temporal ego. But the devotee actuated by knowledge (jïäna-bhakta), the devotee actuated by the pure devotional aptitude (çuddha-bhakta), the devotee imbued with loving devotion (prema-bhakta), the devotee actuated by pure love (premapara-bhakta), and the devotee impelled by overwhelming love (premätura-bhakta), who serve the majesty of Godhead, have their locations in Vaikuëöha, i.e., the transcendental realm of Çré Näräyaëa. The devotees who are imbued with all-love and who walk in the footsteps of the spiritual maids of Vraja, alone attain to the realm of Goloka. The different locations of the devotees in Goloka according to the respective differences in the nature of their rasa, i.e., mellow quality. are settled by the inconceivable power of Kåñëa. The pure devotees following the devotees of Vraja and those following the pure devotees of Navadvépa are located in the realm of Kåñëa and Gaura respectively. The identical devotees of Vraja and Navadvépa simultaneously attain to the pleasures of service in the realm of Kåñëa and Gaura. Çré Jéva Gosvämé writes in his work Gopäla-campü that “the supreme transcendental realm is called Goloka being the abode of go, transcendental cows, and gopa, transcendental cowherds. This is the seat of the rasa pastimes of the absolute Çré Kåñëa. Again the realm is called Çvetadvépa owing to the realization of some of the rasas which are the inconceivable manifestation derived from the untouched purity of that supreme realm. The twofold entities of the supreme Goloka and the supreme Çvetadvépa are indivisibly the realm of Goloka.” The gist of the whole matter is this—Goloka as Çvetadvépa is eternally manifest because the pleasures of enjoyment of the rasa could not be had in its entirety in the pastimes of Kåñëa in Vraja. He accepts the emotion and effulgence of His predominated moiety. Çré Rädhikä, and makes an eternal pastime for the enjoyment of kåñëa-rasa there. Çré Kåñëacandra coveting to taste the following pleasures, viz., to realize (1) the nature of the greatness of love of Çré Rädhä; (2) the nature of the wonderful sweetness of His love of which Çré Rädhikä has got the taste; (3) the nature of the exquisite joy that accrues to Çré Rädhä by Her realization of the sweetness of His love, took His birth, like the moon, in the ocean of the womb of Çré Çacé-devé. The esoteric desire of Çré Jéva"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ Gosvämé Prabhu is herein made manifest. In the Veda it is also said, “Let me tell you the mystery.

He is sole Godhead. He is the source of all forms, the Supreme Soul and is Godhead manifesting Himself in yellow, red, blue and white colors. He is the direct entity of pure cognition full of the spiritual (cit) potency. He is the figure of the devotee. He is the bestower of devotion and cognizable by devotion alone. The selfsame Gauracandra, who is no other than Kåñëa Himself, in order to taste the rasa of the pastimes of Rädhä-Kåñëa in Goloka, is manifest in the eternal realm of Navadvépa identical with Goloka.” This is also clear from the Vedic declarations, viz., äsan varëäs trayaù, kåñëa-varëaà tviñäkåñëam, yathä paçyaù paçyati rukma-varëam, mahän prabhur vai and various other statements of the theistic scriptures.

This masculine symbol is the subjective portion of divinity who functions as progenitor of the mundane world, subject to the supreme regulatrix [niyati].

Indecorum is merely an entity pertaining to the external custom of society. But science, and specially the highest science, cannot destroy the true entity by deference to social custom. Wherefore, in order to demonstrate the seed of mundane sex desire, the basic principle of this phenomenal world, the use of those identical words is indispensable. By the use of all these words only the masculine energy or the predominating active potency. and female energy or the predominated active potency. are to be understood.

Mahä-Saìkarñaëa, subjective plenary facsimile of the extended personality of Çré Näräyaëa, is also the divine plenary portion of the propagatory embodiment of Çré Kåñëa. By the power of His spiritual energy a plenary subjective portion of Him, eternally reposing in the neutral stream of Virajä forming the boundary between the spiritual and mundane realms, casts His glance, at creation, unto the limited shadow potency. Mäyä, who is located far away from Himself. Thereupon Çambhu, lord of pradhäna embodying the substantive principle of all material entities, who is the same as Rudra, the dim reflection of the Supreme Lord’s own divine glance, consummates his intercourse with Mäyä, the efficient mundane causal principle. But he can do nothing independently of the energy of Mahä-Viñëu representing the direct spiritual power of Kåñëa.

Agreeably to the initiative of Mahä-Viñëu the consort of Çiva creates successively the mundane ego (ahaìkära), the five mundane elements (bhütas) viz., space etc., their attributes (tan-mätras) and the limited senses of the conditioned soul (jéva).

In accordance with the will of Kåñëa this world is manifested as the resultant of the union of the efficient and the material causal principles of Mäyä.

The word yoganidrä or yogamäyä indicates as follows: The nature of cit potency is manifestive of the Absolute Truth, while the nature of her perverted reflection, Mäyä, is envelopment in the gloom of ignorance. When Kåñëa desires to manifest something in the mundane ignorance-wrapt affairs, He does this by the conjunction of His spiritual potency with His inactive nonspiritual potency. This is known as Yogamäyä. It carries a twofold notion, namely. transcendental notion and mundane inert notion.

The jévas are the infinitesimal particles of His spiritual effulgence and are, therefore, not perishable like mundane things. Jévas, being particles of Godhead’s effulgent rays, exhibit on a minute scale the qualities of the Divinity. Hence jévas are identical with the principles of knowledge, knower, egoism, enjoyer, meditator and doer. Kåñëa is the all-pervading, all-extending Supreme Lord; while jévas have a different nature from His, being His atomic particles. That eternal relationship consists in this that the Supreme Lord is the eternal master and jévas are His eternal servants. Jévas have also sufficient eligibility in respect of the mellow quality of the Divinity. Apareyam itas tv anyäà prakåtià viddhi me paräm. By this verse of the Gétä it is made known that jévas are His transcendental potency. All the qualities of the unalloyed soul are above the eightfold qualities such as egotism, etc., pertaining to His acit potency. Hence the jéva potency. though very small in magnitude, is still superior to acit potency or Mäyä. This potency has another name, viz., taöasthä or marginal potency. being located on the line demarcating the spheres of the spiritual and mundane potencies. He is susceptible to the influence of the material energy owing to his small magnitude. But so long as he remains submissive to Kåñëa, the Lord of Mäyä, he is not liable to the influence of Mäyä.

On its whorl, there exists a great divine throne on which is seated Çré Kåñëa, the form of eternal effulgence of transcendental bliss, playing on His divine flute resonant with the divine sound, with His lotus mouth. He is worshiped by His amorous milkmaids with their respective subjective portions and extensions and also by His external energy [who stays outside] embodying all mundane qualities.” PURPORT Although the object of meditation is fully transcendental, yet owing to her nature which is permeated with the quality of active mundane hankering, Mäyä, the nonspiritual potency of Kåñëa, embodying the principles of mixed sattva, rajas, and tamas, in the forms of Durgä, and other nonspiritual powers, meditated on the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ Supreme Lord Kåñëa as the object of their worship. So long as there is any trace of mundane desire in one’s heart, it is the object of worship of Mäyädevé (Durgä) who has to be worshiped by such a person; nevertheless the fulfillment of one’s heart’s desire results from the worship of the object of worship of Mäyädevé, and not from the worship of Mäyädevé herself. This is in accordance with the çloka, akämaù sarva-kämo vä mokña-käma udära-dhiù/ tévreëa bhakti-yogena yajeta puruñaà param [SB 2.3.10]. The meaning of this çloka of the Bhägavatam is that though other gods, as distinct manifestations of the Supreme Lord, are bestowers of sundry specific boons, yet a sensible person should worship the all powerful Supreme Lord, giver of all good, with unalloyed devotion, without worshiping those mundane gift-giving deities. Accordingly. Brahmä meditated upon Kåñëa in Goloka, the object of the worship, from a distance, of Mäyädevé. True devotion is unalloyed devotional activity free from all mundane desire. The devotion of Brahmä, etc., is not unmixed devotion. But there is a stage of unmixed predilection even in devotion for the attainment of one’s selfish desire. This has been fully described in the concluding five çlokas of this work. That is the easiest method of divine service, prior to the attainment of self-realization, by fallen souls.

In this Gäyatré, the realization of the transcendental pastimes of Çré Gopéjana-vallabha after perfect meditation and the prayer for the attainment of the transcendental god of love are indicated. In the spiritual world there is no better mode of endeavor for securing the superexcellent rasa-bedewed love. As soon as that Gäyatré entered into the ear-holes of Brahmä, he became the twice-born and began to chant the Gäyatré.

Each of the limbs of that transcendental figure possesses in Himself, the full-fledged functions of all the organs, and eternally sees, maintains and manifests the infinite universes, both spiritual and mundane. PURPORT For want of a taste of things spiritual, a grave doubt arises in the minds of those who are enchained by worldly knowledge. On hearing a narration of the pastimes of Kåñëa they think that the truth (tattva) regarding Kåñëa is the mental concoction of certain learned scholars, created by their imaginative brains out of material drawn from the mundane principles. With the object of removing this harmful doubt, Brahmä in this and the three following çlokas, after distinguishing between the two things, viz., spirit and matter, in a rational manner, has tried to make one understand the pure lélä of Kåñëa, obtained by his unmixed ecstatic trance. Brahmä wants to say that the form of Kåñëa is all “existence, all-knowledge and all-bliss, whereas all mundane experiences are full of palpable ignorance. Although there is specific difference between the two, the fundamental truth is that spiritual affairs constitute the absolute source. Specification and variegatedness are ever present in it. By them are established the transcendental abode, form, name, quality and sports of Kåñëa. It is only by a person, possessed of pure spiritual knowledge and freedom from any relationship with Mäyä, that those amorous pastimes of Kåñëa can at all be appreciated. The spiritual abode, the seat of pastimes, emanated from the cit potency and formed of cintämaëi (transcendental philosopher’s stone), and the figure of Kåñëa, are all spiritual. Just as Mäyä is the perverted reflection of the spiritual potency. the variegatedness created by Mäyä (ignorance) is also a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness. So a mere semblance of the spiritual variegatedness is only noticed in this mundane world. Notwithstanding such semblance the two are wholly different from one another. The unwholesomeness of matter is its defect; but in the spirit there is variegatedness which is free from any fault or contamination. The soul and the body of Kåñëa are identical, whereas the body and soul of fallen creatures are not so. In the spiritual sphere there is no such difference as that between the body and soul, between the limbs and their proprietor, between the attributes and the object possessing them, of this world. But such difference really exists in the case of conditioned souls. Limbed though Kåñëa is, His every limb is the whole entity. He performs all varieties of divine spiritual"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ functions with every one of His limbs. Hence He is an indivisible whole and a perfect transcendental entity. Both jéva-soul and Kåñëa are transcendental. So they belong to the same category. But they differ in this that the transcendental attributes exist in the jéva-soul in infinitesimally small degrees, whereas in Kåñëa they are found in their fullest perfection. Those attributes manifest themselves in their proper infinitesimality only when the jéva-soul attains his unadulterated spiritual status. The jéva-soul attains the nearest approach to the absolute identity only when the spiritual force of ecstatic energy appears in him by the grace of Kåñëa. Still Kåñëa remains the object of universal homage by reason of His possession of certain unique attributes. These fourfold unrivaled attributes do not manifest themselves in Näräyaëa, the Lord of Vaikuëöha or in primeval puruña-avatäras, or in the highest deities such as Çiva, not to speak of jévas.

PURPORT Advaita means “indivisible truth who is knowledge absolute.” Brahman, the infinite, emanates from Him as His effulgence and God-immanent (Paramätmä) as His constituent; but nevertheless He remains one and indivisible. Acyuta means that though myriads of avatäras emanate from Him as subjective portions and millions of jévas as separated spiritual particles, still He remains intact as the undivided whole of fullest perfection. Though He indulges in exhibiting the pastimes of births, etc., still He is without a beginning. Though He disappears after the pastimes of His appearance, still He is eternal. Though without origin, yet He is with an origin in His pastime of appearance; and although eternal in essence, He is still a person in the full bloom of youth. The sum and substance of it is that though He possesses diverse and apparently mutually contradictory qualities, still they are in universal harmonious concordance by dint of His unthinkable potency. This is what is meant by cid-dharma (transcendental nature) as distinguished from the material. His graceful threefold-bending form with flute in hand, possesses eternal blooming youth and is above all unwholesomeness that is to be found in limited time and space. In the transcendental realm there is no past and future but only the unalloyed and immutable present time. In the transcendental sphere there is no distinction between the object and its qualities and no such identity as is found in the limited mundane region. Hence those qualities that seem to be apparently contradictory in the light of mundane conception limited by time and space, exist in agreeable and dainty concordance in the spiritual realm. How can the jéva realize such unprecedented existence? The limited intellectual function of the jéva is always contaminated by the influence of time and space and is, therefore, not in a position to shake off this limitedness. If the potency of cognitive function does not extend to the realization of the transcendental, what else can? In reply. Brahmä says that the transcendental Absolute is beyond the reach of the Vedas. The Vedas originate in sound and sound originates in the mundane ether. So the Vedas cannot present before us a direct view of the transcendental world (Goloka). It is only when the Vedas are imbued with the cit potency that they are enabled to deal with the transcendental.

The kaivalya (realized nonalternative state) which is attained by the añöäìga-yogis by practicing trance for thousands of millions of years and the state of merging into the nondifferentiated impersonality of Godhead beyond the range of limitation attained by nondualists after a similar period passed in distinguishing between the spiritual and nonspiritual and eliminating things of the limited sphere one after another by the formula “not this, not that,” are simply the outskirts of the lotus feet of Kåñëa and not the lotus feet themselves. The long and short of the matter is this, kaivalya or merging into the Brahman constitutes the line of demarcation between the world of limitation and the transcendental world. For, unless we step beyond them, we can have no taste of the variegatedness of the transcendental sphere. These conditions are the simple absence of misery arising from mundane affinity but are not real happiness or felicity. If the absence of misery be called a bit of pleasure then also that bit is very small and of no consequence. It is not sufficient to destroy the condition of materiality; but the real gain to the jéva is his eternal existence in his self-realized state.

Though He is all-pervasive yet in His existence everywhere in a medium shape consists His spiritual Lordship beyond human conception. This argument favors the doctrine of simultaneous inconceivable distinction and nondistinction, and knocks down the contaminating Mäyäväda and other allied doctrines.

TRANSLATION I adore the same Govinda, the primeval Lord, in whose praise men, who are imbued with devotion, sing the mantra-süktas told by the Vedas, by gaining their appropriate beauty, greatness, thrones, conveyances and ornaments. PURPORT In discussing rasa we meet with five kinds of devotion or service. Çänta or unattached, däsya or pertaining to reverential willing service, sakhya or friendship, vätsalya or parental love and çåìgära or juvenile love. The devotees surcharged with the ideas of their respective service, serve Kåñëa eternally and ultimately reach the goal of their respective ideals. They attain the real nature of their self befitting their respective rasas, their glories, conveyances, seats befitting their sacred service, and transcendental qualities of ornaments enhancing the beauty of their real nature. Those who are advocates of çänta-rasa attain the region of Brahma-Paramätmä, the seat of eternal peace; those of däsya-rasa get to Vaikuëöha, the spiritual majestic abode of Çré Näräyaëa; those of sakhya, vätsalya and madhura-rasa (juvenile love) attain Goloka-dhäma, Kåñëa’s abode, above Vaikuëöha. They worship Kåñëa by the süktas depicted in the Vedas with the ingredients and objects befitting their respective rasas, in those regions. The Vedas, under the influence of the spiritual potency in certain passages speak of the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. The liberated souls chant the name, qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Lord, under the guidance of the same spiritual potency.

All these arts manifesting their own eternal forms are ever visible in the region of Goloka as the ingredients of rasa; and, in the mundane sphere, they have been unstintedly exhibited in the pastimes of Vraja by the spiritual (cit) potency. Yogamäyä. So Çré Rüpa says, sadänantaiù... santi täù, i.e., Kåñëa is ever manifest in His beauty with His infinite pastimes in Goloka. Sometimes the variant manifestation of those pastimes becomes visible on the mundane plane. Çré Hari, the Supreme Lord, also manifests His pastimes of birth, etc., accompanied by all His paraphernalia. The divine sportive potency fills the hearts of His paraphernalia with appropriate spiritual sentiments in conformity with the will of Kåñëa. Those pastimes that manifest themselves on the mundane plane, are His visible pastimes. All those very pastimes exist in their nonvisible form in Goloka beyond the ken of mundane knowledge. In His visible pastimes Kåñëa sojourns in Gokula, Mathurä and Dvärakä. Those pastimes that are nonvisible in those three places, are visible in their spiritual sites of Våndävana. From the conclusions just stated it is clear that there is no distinction between the visible and nonvisible pastimes. The apostle Jéva Gosvämé in his commentary on this çloka as well as in the gloss of Ujjvala-nélamaëi and in Kåñëa-sandarbha remarks that “the visible pastimes of Kåñëa are the creation of His cit (spiritual) potency. Being in conjunction with the reference to mundane function they exhibit certain features which seem to be true by the influence of the limiting potency (Mäyä); but these cannot exist in the transcendental reality. The destruction of demons, illicit"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ paramourship, birth, etc., are examples of this peculiarity. The gopés are the extensions of the ecstatic energy of Kåñëa, and so are exceptionally His own. How can there be illicit connection in their case? The illicit mistress-ship of the gopés found in His visible pastime, is but the mundane reflection of the transcendental reality.” The hidden meaning underlying the words of Çré Jéva Gosvämé, when it is made explicit, will leave no doubt in the minds of the readers. Çré Jéva Gosvämé is our preacher of transcendental truth. So he is always under the influence of Çré Rüpa and Sanätana. Moreover in the pastimes of Kåñëa Çré Jéva is one of the maïjarés. So he is conversant with all transcendental realities. There are some who, being unable to understand the drift of his statements, give meanings of their own invention and indulge in useless controversies. Çré Rüpa and Sanätana say that there is no real and essential distinction between the léläs visible and nonvisible, the only distinction lies in this that one is manifest in the mundane sphere whereas the other is not so. In the supermundane manifestation there is absolute purity in the seer and the seen. A particularly fortunate person when he is favored by Kåñëa, can shake off worldly shackles and connections, enter the transcendental region after attaining the realized taste of the varieties of rasa that is available during the period of novitiate. Only such a person can have a view and taste of the perfect and absolutely pure lélä of Goloka. Such receptive natures are rarely to be found. He, who exists in the mundane sphere, can also realize the taste of cid-rasa by the grace of Kåñëa by being enabled to attain the realized state of service. Such a person can have a view of the pastimes of Goloka manifested in the mundane lélä of Gokula. There is certainly a difference between these two classes of eligible seekers of the truth. Until one attains the perfectly transcendental stage he must be hampered by his lingering limitations, in his vision of the pastimes of Goloka. Again, the vision of the transcendental reality varies according to the degree of self-realization. The vision of Goloka must also vary accordingly. It is only those fettered souls who are excessively addicted to worldliness that are devoid of the devotional eye. Of them some are enmeshed by the variegatedness of the deluding energy while others aspire after self-annihilation under the influence of centrifugal knowledge. Though they might have a view of the mundanely manifested pastimes of the Supreme Lord, they can have only a material conception of those visible pastimes, this conception being devoid of transcendental reality. Hence the realization of Goloka appears in proportion to eligibility due to the degree of one’s self-realization. The underlying principle is this, that, though Gokula is as holy and free from dross as Goloka, still it is manifested on the mundane plane by the influence of the cit potency. Yogamäyä. In visible and nonvisible matters of transcendental regions"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ there is no impurity. contamination and imperfection inherent in the world of limitation; only there is some difference in the matter of realization in proportion to the self-realization of the seekers after the Absolute. Impurity. unwholesomeness, foreign elements, illusion, nescience, unholiness, utter inadequacy. insignificance, grossness—these appertain to the eye, intellect, mind and ego stultified by the material nature of conditioned souls; they have nothing to do with the essential nature of transcendence. The more one is free from these blots the more is one capable of realizing the unqualified Absolute. The truth who has been revealed by the scriptures, is free from dross. But the realizations of the seekers of the knowledge of these realities, are with or without flaw in accordance with the degree of their individual realization. Those sixty-four arts that have been enumerated above, do in reality exist unstintedly only in Goloka. Unwholesomeness, insignificance, grossness are found in those arts in accordance with the degree of self-realization on the part of aspirants after the knowledge of the Absolute. According to Çréla Rüpa and Çréla Sanätana all those pastimes, that have been visible in Gokula, exist in all purity and free from all tinge of limitation in Goloka. So transcendental autocratic paramourship also exists in Goloka in inconceivable purity, judged by the same standard and reasoning. All manifestation by the cit potency. Yogamäyä, are pure. So, as the above paramourship is the creation of Yogamäyä, it is necessarily free from all contamination, and appertains to the absolute reality. Let us pause to consider what the absolute reality is in Himself. Çré Rüpa Gosvämé says, pürvokta-... särataù. In regard to these çlokas Çrépäda Jéva Gosvämé after mature deliberation has established the transcendental paramourship as vibhrama-viläsa, something seemingly different from what it appears to be; such are the pastimes of birth, etc., accomplished by Yogamäyä. By the explanation tathäpi... vraja-vanitänäm, Çréla Jéva Gosvämé has expressed his profound implication. Joyous pastimes by the medium of seeming error, vibhrama-viläsa, as the contrivance of Yogamäyä, has also been admitted in the concluding statements of Rüpa and Sanätana. Still, since Çrépäda Jéva Gosvämé has established the identity of Goloka with Gokula, it must be admitted that there is transcendental reality underlying all the pastimes of Gokula. A husband is one who binds oneself in wedlock with a girl, while a paramour is one who, in order to win another’s wife’s love by means of love, crosses the conventions of morality. by the impulse of the sentiment that regards her love as the be-all and end-all of existence. In Goloka there is no such function at all as that of the nuptial relationship. Hence there is no husbandhood"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ characterized by such connection. On the other hand since the gopés, who are self-supported real entities are not tied to anybody else in wedlock, they cannot also have the state of concubinage. There can also be no separate entities in the forms of svakéya (conjugal) and parakéya (adulterous) states. In the visible pastimes on the mundane plane the function in the form of the nuptial relationship is found to exist. Kåñëa is beyond the scope of that function. Hence the said function of the circle of all-love is contrived by Yogamäyä. Kåñëa tastes the transcendental rasa akin to paramourship by overstepping that function. This pastime of going beyond the pale of the apparent moral function manifested by Yogamäyä, is, however, also observable only on the mundane plane by the eye that is enwrapped by the mundane covering; but there is really no such levity in the pastimes of Kåñëa. The rasa of paramourship is certainly the extracted essence of all the rasas. If it be said that it does not exist in Goloka, it would be highly deprecatory to Goloka. It is not the fact that there is no supremely wholesome tasting of rasa in the supremely excellent realm of Goloka. Kåñëa, the fountainhead of all avatäras. tastes the same in a distinct form in Goloka and in another distinct form in Gokula. Therefore, in spite of the seeming appearance, to the mundane eye, of outstepping the bounds of the legitimate function by the form of paramourship, there must be present the truth of it in some form even in Goloka. Ätmärämo ’py aréramat, ätmany avaruddha-saurataù, reme vraja-sundarébhir yathärbhakaù pratibimba-vibhramaù and other texts of the scriptures go to show that self-delightedness is the essential distinctive quality of Kåñëa Himself. Kåñëa in His majestic cit realm causes the manifestation of His own cit potency as Lakñmé and enjoys her as His own wedded consort. As this feeling of wedded consorthood preponderates there, rasa expands in a wholesome form only up to the state of servanthood (däsya-rasa). But in Goloka He divides up His cit potency into thousands of gopés and eternally engages in amorous pastimes with them by forgetting the sentiments of ownership. By the sentiments of ownership there cannot be the extreme inaccessibility of the rasa. So the gopés have naturally. from eternity. the innate sentiment of being others’ wedded wives. Kåñëa too in response to that sentiment, by assuming the reciprocal sentiment of paramourship, performs the räsa and the other amorous pastimes with the aid of the flute, His favorite cher ami. Goloka is the transcendental seat of eternally self-realized rasa, beyond limited conception. Hence in Goloka there is realization of the sentimental assumption of the rasa of paramourship. Again such is the nature of the principle of the majesty that in the realm of Vaikuëöha there is no rasa of parental affection towards the source of all avatäras. But in Goloka, the seat of all superexcellent deliciousness, there is no more than the original sentimental egoistic assumption of the same rasa. There Nanda and Yaçodä are visibly"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ present, but there is no occurrence of birth. For want of the occurrence of birth the assumed egoistic sentiment of parental affection of Nanda and Yaçodä has no foundation in the actual existence of such entities as father and mother, but it is of the nature of sentimental assumption on their parts, cf. jayati jana-niväso devaké-janma-vädaù, etc. For the purpose of the realization of the rasa the assumed egoistic sentiment is, however, eternal. In the rasa of amorous love if the corresponding egoistic sentiments of concubinage and paramourship be mere eternal assumptions there is nothing to blame in them and it also does not go against the scriptures. When those transcendental entities of Goloka becomes manifest in Vraja then those two egoistic sentiments become somewhat more palpable to the mundane view in the phenomenal world and there comes to be this much difference only. In the rasa of parental affection the sentiments of Nanda and Yaçodä that they are parents becomes manifest in the more tangible form in the pastimes of birth etc., and in the amorous rasa the corresponding sentiments of concubinage in the respective gopés become manifest in the forms of their marriages with Abhimanyu, Govardhana, etc. In reality there is no such separate entity as husbandhood of the gopés either in Goloka or in Gokula. Hence the çästras declare that there is no sexual union of the gopés with their husbands. It is also for the same reason that the authorized teacher of the principle of rasa, Çré Rüpa, writes that in the transcendental amorous rasa the hero is of two different types, viz., the wedded husband and the paramour—patiç copapatiç ceti prabhedäv iha viçrutäv iti. Çré Jéva, in his commentary by his words patiù pura-vanitänäà dvitéyo vraja-vanitänäm, acknowledges the eternal paramourship of Kåñëa in Goloka and Gokula and the husbandhood of Kåñëa in Vaikuëöha and Dvärakä etc. In the Lord of Goloka and the Lord of Gokula the character of paramourship is found in its complete form. Kåñëa’s deliberate overstepping of His own quality of self-delightedness is caused by the desire of union with another’s wedded wife. The state of being another’s wedded wife is nothing but the corresponding assumed sentiment on the part of the gopés. In reality they have no husbands with independent and separate existence; still their very egoistic sentiment makes them have the nature of the wedded wives of others. So all the characteristics, viz., that “desire makes the paramour overstep the bounds of duty.” etc., are eternally present in the seat of all “deliciousness.” In Vraja that very thing reveals itself, to an extent, in a form more tangible to persons with mundane eyes. So in Goloka there is inconceivable distinction and nondistinction between the rasas analogous to mundane concubineship and wifehood. It may be said with equal truth that there is no distinction in Goloka between the two as also that there is such distinction. The essence of paramourship is the cessation of ownership and the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ abeyance of ownership is the enjoyment of His own cit potency in the shape of abeyance of paramourship or enjoyment without the sanction of wedlock. The conjunction of the two exists there as one rasa accommodating both varieties. In Gokula it is really the same with the difference that it produces a different impression on observers belonging to the mundane plane. In Govinda, the hero of Goloka, there exist both husbandhood and paramourship above all piety and impiety and free from all grossness. Such is also the case with the hero of Gokula although there is a distinction in realization caused by Yogamäyä. If it be urged that what is manifested by Yogamäyä is the highest truth being the creation of the cit potency and that, therefore, the impression of paramourship is also really true, the reply is that there may exist an impression of analogous sentimental egoism in the tasting of rasa free from any offense because it is not without a basis in truth. But the unwholesome impression that is produced in the mundane judgment is offensive and as such cannot exist in the pure cit realm. In fact Çrépäda Jéva Gosvämé has come to the true conclusion, and at the same time the finding of the opposing party is also inconceivably true. It is the vain empirical wranglings about wedded wifehood and concubinage which is false and full of specious verbosity. He who goes through the commentaries of Çrépäda Jéva Gosvämé and those of the opposing party with an impartial judgment cannot maintain his attitude of protest engendered by any real doubt. What the unalloyed devotee of the Supreme Lord says is all true and is independent of any consideration of unwholesome pros and cons. There is, however, the element of mystery in their verbal controversies. Those, whose judgment is made of mundane stuff, being unable to enter into the spirit of the all-loving controversies among pure devotees, due to their own want of unalloyed devotion, are apt to impute to the devotees their own defects of partisanship and opposing views. Commenting on the çloka of Räsa-païcädhyäyé, gopénäà tat-paténäà ca, etc., what Çrépäda Sanätana Gosvämé has stated conclusively in his Vaiñëava-toñaëé has been accepted with reverence by the true devotee Çrépäda Viçvanätha Cakravarté without any protest. Whenever any dispute arises regarding the pure cognitive pastimes, such as Goloka, etc., we would do well to remember the precious advice from the holy lips of Çrémän Mahäprabhu and His associates, the Gosvämés, viz., that the Truth Absolute is ever characterized by spiritual variegatedness that transcends the variegatedness of mundane phenomena; but He is never featureless. The divine rasa is lovely with the variegatedness of the fourfold distinction of vibhäva, anubhäva, sättvika and vyabhicäri and the rasa is ever present in Goloka and Vaikuëöha. The rasa of Goloka manifests as vraja-rasa on the mundane plane for the benefit of the devotees by the power of Yogamäyä. Whatever is observable in gokula-rasa should be visible in goloka-"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ rasa, in a clearly explicit form. Hence the distinction of paramourship and concubinage, the variegatedness of the respective rasas of all different persons, the soil, water, river, hill, portico, bower, cows, etc., all the features of Gokula exist in Goloka, disposed in an appropriate manner. There is only this peculiarity that the mundane conceptions of human beings possessed of material judgment, regarding those transcendental entities, do not exist there. The conception of Goloka manifests itself differently in proportion to the degree of realization of the various pastimes of Vraja and it is very difficult to lay down any definite criterion as to which portions are mundane and which are uncontaminated. The more the eye of devotion is tinged with the salve of love, the more will the transcendental concept gradually manifest itself. So there is no need of further hypothetical speculation which does not improve one’s spiritual appreciation, as the substantive knowledge of Goloka is an inconceivable entity. To try to pursue the inconceivable by the conceptual process is like pounding the empty husk of grain, which is sure to have a fruitless ending. It is, therefore, one’s bounden duty. by refraining from the endeavor to know, to try to gain the experience of the transcendental by the practice of pure devotion. Any course, the adoption of which tends to produce the impression of featurelessness, must be shunned by all means. Unalloyed parakéya-rasa free from all mundane conception is a most rare attainment. It is this which has been described in the narrative of the pastimes of Gokula. Those devotees, who follow the dictate of their pure spontaneous love, should base their devotional endeavors on that narrative. They will attain to the more wholesome fundamental principle on reaching the stage of realization. The devotional activities characterized by illicit amour, as practiced by worldly-minded conditioned souls, are forbidden mundane impiety. The heart of our apostle Çrépäda Jéva Gosvämé was very much moved by such practices and induced him to give us his conclusive statements on the subject. It is the duty of a pure Vaiñëava to accept the real spirit of his statements. It is a great offense to disrespect the äcärya and to seek to establish a different doctrine in opposition to him.

PURPORT The Çyämasundara form of Kåñëa is His inconceivable simultaneous personal and impersonal self-contradictory form. True devotees see that form in their purified hearts under the influence of devotional trance. The form Çyäma is not the blue color visible in the mundane world but is the transcendental variegated color affording eternal bliss, and is not visible to the mortal eye. On a consideration of the trance of Vyäsadeva as in the çloka, bhakti-yogena manasi etc., it will be clear that the form of Çré Kåñëa is the full Personality of Godhead and can only be visible in the heart of a true devotee, which is the only true seat in the state of trance under the influence of devotion.

The world, in which Brahmä takes his stand and hymns the Lord of Goloka, is Devé-dhäma consisting of the fourteen worlds and Durgä is its presiding deity. She is ten-armed, representing the tenfold fruitive activities. She rides on the lion, representing her heroic prowess. She tramples down Mahéñäsura, representing the subduer of vices. She is the mother of two sons, Kärttikeya and Gaëeça, representing beauty and success. She is placed between Lakñmé and Sarasvaté, representing mundane opulence and mundane knowledge. She is armed with the twenty weapons, representing the various pious activities enjoined by the Vedas for suppression of vices. She holds the snake, representing the beauty of destructive time. Such is Durgä possessing all these manifold forms. Durgä is possessed of durga, which means a prison house. When jévas begotten of the marginal potency (taöasthä çakti) forget the service of Kåñëa they are confined in the mundane prison house, the citadel of Durgä. The wheel of karma is the instrument of punishment at this place. The work of purifying these penalized jévas is the duty devolved upon Durgä. She is incessantly engaged in discharging the same by the will of Govinda. When, luckily. the forgetfulness of Govinda on the part of imprisoned jévas is remarked by them by coming in contact with self-realized souls and their natural aptitude for the loving service of Kåñëa is aroused, Durgä herself then becomes the agency of their deliverance by the will of Govinda. So it behooves everybody to obtain the guileless grace of Durgä, the mistress of this prison house, by propitiating her with"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ the selfless service of Kåñëa.

The mundane psychical jubilations of daça-mahä-vidyä, the ten goddesses or forms of Durgä, are elaborated for the delusion of the fettered souls of this world. Jéva is a spiritual atomic part of Kåñëa. When he forgets his service of Kåñëa he is at once deflected by the attracting power of Mäyä in this world, who throws him into the whirlpool of mundane fruitive activity (karma) by confining him in a gross body constituted by the five material elements, their five attributes and eleven senses, resembling the garb of a prisoner. In this whirlpool jéva has experience of happiness and miseries, heaven and hell. Besides this, there is a subtle body. consisting of the mind, intelligence and ego, inside the gross body. By means of the subtle body. the jéva forsakes one gross body and takes recourse to another. The jéva cannot get rid of the subtle body. full of nescience and evil desires, unless and until he is liberated. On getting rid of the subtle body he bathes in the Virajä and goes up to Hari-dhäma. Such are the duties performed by Durgä in accordance with the will of Govinda.

Those, who entertain such discriminating sentiment, commit a great offense against the Supreme Lord. The supremacy of Çambhu is subservient to that of Govinda; hence they are not really different from each other. The nondistinction is established by the fact that just as milk treated with acid turns into curd so Godhead becomes a subservient when He Himself attains a distinct personality by the addition of a particular element of adulteration. This personality has no independent initiative. The said adulterating principle is constituted of a combination of the stupefying quality of the deluding energy, the quality of nonplenitude of the marginal potency and a slight degree of the ecstatic-cum-cognitive principle of the plenary spiritual potency. This specifically adulterated reflection of the principle of the subjective portion of the Divinity is Sadäçiva, in the form of the effulgent masculine-symbol-god Çambhu from whom Rudradeva is manifested. In the work of mundane creation as the material cause, in the work of preservation by the destruction of sundry asuras and in the work of destruction to conduct the whole operation, Govinda manifests Himself as guëa-avatära in the form of Çambhu who is the separated portion of Govinda imbued with the principle of His subjective plenary portion.

Kñérodakaçäyé is again the subjective portion of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu. The word “Viñëu” indicates all-pervading, omnipresent and omniscient personality. In this çloka the activities of the subjective portions of the Divinity are enunciated by the specification of the nature of Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. The personality of Viñëu, the embodied form of the manifestive quality (sattva-guëa) is quite distinct from that of Çambhu who is adulterated with mundane qualities. Viñëu’s subjective personality is on a level with that of Govinda. Both consist of the unadulterated substantive principle. Viñëu in the form of the manifest causal principle is identical with Govinda as regards quality. The manifestive quality (sattva-guëa) that is found to exist in the triple mundane quality, is an adulterated entity. being alloyed with the qualities of mundane activity and inertia. Brahmä is the dislocated portion of the Divinity. manifested in the principle of mundane action, endowed with the functional nature of His subjective portion; and Çambhu is the dislocated portion of the Divinity manifested in the principle of mundane inertia possessing similarly the functional nature of His subjective portion. The reason for their being dislocated portions is that the two principles of mundane action and inertia being altogether wanting in the spiritual essence any entities, that are manifested in them, are located at a great distance from the Divinity Himself or His facsimiles. Although the mundane manifestive quality is of the adulterated kind, Viñëu, the manifestation of the Divinity in the mundane manifestive quality. makes His appearance in the unadulterated manifestive principle which is a constituent of the mundane manifestive quality. Hence Viñëu is the full subjective portion and belongs to the category of the superior éçvaras. He is the Lord of the deluding potency and not alloyed with her. Viñëu is the agent of Govinda’s own subjective nature in the form of the prime cause.

Of these two divisions varëa-dharma is that function which is the outcome of the distinctive natures of the four varëas, viz., brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra and äçrama-dharma is that function which is appropriate to the respective äçramas or stations of those who belong to the four stages, viz., brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa. All customary activities of mankind have been targeted in these twofold divisions. Sins mean nescience, the root of all sins and sinful desire, also the greatest iniquities and sins flowing from them and the ordinary sins, i.e., all sorts of unprincipled conduct. The category of the çrutis means Åg, Säma, Yajur and Atharva and the Upaniñads which form the crest jewels of the Veda. The tapas mean all regular practices that are learnt with the view of the attainment of the proper function of the self.

Its various aspects are described in this çloka. Çänta-bhäva, full of reverence to superior, däsya-bhäva, full of service for carrying out the commands of the object of worship, sakhya-bhäva or natural friendly love, vätsalya-bhäva or parental affection and madhura-bhäva or amorous love, are all included in the category of devotion of the nature of instinctive attachment. But anger, fear and delusion, though they are of the nature of instinctive impulse, are not devotion in the strict sense of the term, because they are not friendly but hostile to the object. Anger is found in asuras like Çiçupäla, fear in Kaàsa, and delusion in the paëòitas of the pantheistic school. They have the feelings of anger, fear and instinctive impulse marked by complete self-forgetful identification with the nondifferentiated Brahman. But as there is no friendly feeling towards the object of devotion there is no bhakti. Again among the feelings of çänta, däsya, sakhya, vätsalya and madhura—çänta, though indifferent and dormant in räga, is still reckoned as bhakti on account of its being a little friendly.

The däsya and sakhya classes of worshipers attain bodily forms characterized by masculine or feminine disposition according to their respective grades of eligibility.

TRANSLATION Abandoning all meritorious performances serve Me with faith. The realization will correspond to the nature of one’s faith. The people of the world act ceaselessly in pursuance of some ideal. By meditating on Me by means of those deeds one will obtain devotion characterized by love in the shape of the supreme service. PURPORT The function characterized by unalloyed devotion is the real function of all individual souls (jévas). All other varieties of function are activities of the external cases. These exoteric and esoteric dharmas (functions) are manifold, e.g., nondifferential knowledge of the Brahman aiming at extinction of individuality. the añöäìga-yoga-dharma having as its goal attainment of the state of exclusive existence (kaivalya), atheistical fruitive ritualism aiming at material enjoyment, jïäna-yoga-dharma seeking to combine knowledge with fruitive activity and the practice of the function of barren asceticism. Getting rid of all these, serve Me by pure devotion rooted in faith. Exclusive faith in Me is trust. Faith in the form of trust by the process of gradual purification tends to become a constant engagement (niñöhä), an object of liking (ruci), of attachment (äsakti) and a real sentiment (bhäva). The more transparent the faith, the greater the degree of realization. If you ask—How will the preservation and conduct of worldly affairs be feasible if one is continuously engaged in the endeavor for the realization of bhakti? What also will be the nature of the endeavor for the realization of bhakti when the body will perish consequent on the cessation of the function of the body and of society? In order to strike at the root of this misgiving the Supreme Lord says, “This world subsists by the constant performance of certain activities. Fill all these activities with meditation of Me. This will destroy the quality that makes those activities appear as acts done by you. They will then be of the nature of My service (bhakti). “Mankind live by the threefold activities of body. mind and society. Eating, seating, walking, resting, sleeping, cleansing the body. covering the body. etc., are the various bodily activities; thinking, recollecting, retaining an impression, becoming aware of an"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ entity. feeling pleasure and pain, etc., are the mental feats; marrying, practicing reciprocal relationship between the king and subject, practicing brotherhood, attending at sacrificial meetings, offering oblations, digging wells, tanks, etc., for the benefit of the people, maintaining one’s relations, practicing hospitality. observing proper civic conduct, showing due respect to others are the various social activities. When these acts are performed for one’s selfish enjoyment, they are called karma-käëòa; when the desire for attainment of freedom from activity by knowledge underlies these actions, they are termed jïäna-yoga or karma-yoga. And when these activities are managed to be performed in this way that is conducive to our endeavor for attainment of bhakti they are called jïäna-bhakta-yoga, i.e., the subsidiary devotional practices. But only those activities that are characterized by the principle of pure worship are called bhakti proper. My meditation is practiced in every act when bhakti proper is practiced in due time while performing the subsidiary devotional activities in one’s intercourse with the ungodly people of this world. In such position, a jéva does not become apathetic to Godhead even by performing those worldly activities. This constitutes the practice of looking inwards, i.e., turning towards one’s real self, vide Éçopaniñad— éçäväsyam idaà sarvaà yat kiïca jagatyäà jagat tena tyaktena bhuïjéthä mä gådhaù kasya svid dhanam The commentator says in regards to this, tena éça-tyaktena visåñöena. The real significance being that if whatever is accepted be received as favor vouchsafed by the Supreme Lord, the worldly activity will cease to be such and will turn into service of Godhead (bhakti). So Éçäväsya says kurvann eveha karmäëi... karma lipyate nare. If the worldly acts are performed in the above manner one does not get entangled in karma even in hundreds of years of worldly life. The meaning of these two mantras from the jïäna point of view is renouncement of the fruits of one’s worldly actions; but from the bhakti point of view they mean the attainment of Kåñëa’s favor (prasädam) by their transfer to His account. In this method, which is the path of arcana, you should do your duties of the world by the meditation of worshiping Godhead thereby. Brahmä cherishes the desire for creation in his heart. If that creative desire is practiced by conjoining the same with the meditation of obeying therein the command of the Supreme Lord, then it will be a subsidiary spiritual function (gauëa-dharma) being helpful for the growth of the disposition for the"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"ÇRÉ BRAHMA-SAÀHITÄ service of the Divinity by reason of its characteristic of seeking the protection of Godhead. It was certainly proper to instruct Brahmä in this manner. There is no occasion for such instruction in the case of a jéva in whom the spontaneous aversion for entities other than Kåñëa manifests itself on his attainment of the substantive entity of spiritual devotion (bhäva).

Some think that Godhead is evidently a separate entity. Jéva is another different entity. and the phenomenal world, although it is a singular principle, exists separately as an eternally independent entity; or, Godhead, is the substantive entity and all other entities, as cit and a-cit attributes, are one in principle. Some suppose that by the force of inconceivable potency sometimes the monistic and sometimes the dualistic principle is realized as the truth. Some again arrive at the conclusion that the theory of the nondual minus all potency is meaningless; whence the Brahman is the one eternally unalloyed entity vested with the pure potency. These speculations have originated from Veda relying on the support of the Vedänta-sutra. In these speculations although there is no truth that holds good in all positions, there is yet a certain measure of truth. Not to speak of the anti-Vedic speculations Säìkhya, Pataïjala, Nyäya and Vaiçeñika, nor even of Pürva-mémäàsä which is fond of exclusive fruitive activity in conformity with the teaching of one portion of the Veda, the bodies of opinions detailed above have also come into existence by relying outwardly on the Vedänta itself. By discarding all these speculations, you and your bona fide community should adopt the ultimate principle identical with the doctrine of acintya-bhedäbheda (inconceivable simultaneous distinction and nondifference). This will make you eligible for being a true devotee. The basic principle is that this animate world is made up of jévas and the inanimate world is constituted of matter. Of these all the jévas have been manifested by My supreme (parä) potency and this phenomenal world has been manifested by My secondary (aparä) potency. I am the cause of all causes. In other words, I regulate all of them by the power of My will although I am not a different entity from the marginal and material (taöasthä and acit) potencies. By the transformation of those distinct potencies pradhäna (substantive material principle), prakåti (material cause) and puruña (efficient cause) have been produced. Hence although as regards the subjective nature of all potency I am pradhäna, prakåti and puruña, yet as the possessor of power I am eternally distinct from all those potencies. This simultaneous distinction and nondifference has also sprung from My inconceivable power.

Although employed as a government magistrate, Srila Bhaktivinoda worked tirelessly to establish the teachings of Lord Chaitanya in India. He envisioned a worldwide spiritual movement and prayed for a son to help him achieve his dream. On February 6, 1874, in the sacred pilgrimage town of Jagannath Puri, where Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura served as superintendent of the famous Jagannatha temple, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta appeared in this world. He was given the name Bimala Prasada. At the age of seven, Bimala Prasada had memorized the more than seven hundred Sanskrit verses of the Bhagavad-gita and could speak illuminating commentaries upon them. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura, the author of many important books and other writings on Gaudiya Vaisnava philosophy, trained his son in printing and proofreading. By the time he was twenty-five years old, Bimala Prasada had acquired an impressive reputation as a scholar of Sanskrit, mathematics, and astronomy. His astronomical treatise, Surya-siddhanta, won him the title Siddhanta Sarasvati in recognition of his immense learning. In 1905, following the advice of his father, Siddhanta Sarasvati accepted spiritual initiation from Srila Gaurakishora dasa Babaji. Although Srila Gaurakishora dasa Babaji was illiterate, he was renowned throughout the continent as a great saint and Vaisnava acarya. Siddhanta Sarasvati, although a great scholar, exhibited humility and dedication in the presence of Srila Gaurakishora. Satisfied with such humility and dedication of his highly educated disciple, Srila Gaurakishora gave Siddhanta Sarasvati his full blessings and requested him to \"preach the Absolute Truth and keep aside all other work.\" Upon the disappearance of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura in 1914, Siddhanta Sarasvati became editor of his father's journal, Sajjana-tosani, and founded the Bhagawat Press for the publication of Gaudiya Vaisnava literature.

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta adjusted ancient traditions to conform with technological and social conditions of the twentieth century. He considered the printing press a most effective means of spreading this message throughout the world and was himself the author of many important translations, commentaries, and philosophical essays. He was the first spiritual teacher in this line to allow his renounced preachers (sannyasis) to wear Western clothes and travel in modern conveyances rather that on foot. Throughout the 1930s, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta expanded and increased his missionary work and succeeded in reestablishing Gaudiya Vaisnavism as the leading force in Indian spiritual life. On January 1, 1937, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura passed from this world. "}]
