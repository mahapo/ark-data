[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Sn Krsna-samhitaSrila Bhaktivinoda ThakuraIntroductioncaitanyatmane bhagavate namahThere are two types of literatures t h o s e w h i c h b estow art ha, or material results,and those which bestow paramartha, or spiritual results. Geography, history,astrology, physics, psychology, ayurveda, microbiology, mathematics, language,poetry, music, logic, yoga, religion, law, architecture, and weaponry are allincluded in the first category. Every book aims at revealing a particular subjectthat is its artha, or result. When all results complime nt each other and ulti m a telyyield the supreme result, in the form of the soul s ultim ate destination, that iscalled paramartha The .literatures that discuss the attainment of this supremeresult are called paramarthic sastra, or spiritual literatures.Many spiritual literatures have been compiled in In dia and abroad. In India manysages from time immemorial have compiled various spiritual literatures after dulyconsidering the spiritual topics. Among them, Srimad Bhagavatam is the topmost.This book consists of 18,000 verses. In this book, the ten principal subject mattersof this worldl h ave been discussed in some places as direct instructions andelsewhere as history. Among these ten subjects, the last, asraya, is the paramarthatattva, or spiritual subject. The asraya tattva-, or summum bonu m, is veryconfidential and unli m i t ed. Al t h o ugh asraya tattva is -sponteneously manifested tothe living entities, in people s present conditional state that transcendental subjectis very difficult to compr ehend. That is why the compiler of Srimad Bhagavatamwas compelled to compassionately and clearly discuss the other nine truth s2.Such a matchless book has not been properly explained till n ow . The people ofIndia and other countries can be divided into two categories t h e a s s l ike and theswanlike. Among these two, the asslike are in the majority. The swanlike are in theminority. Swanlike people abstract the purport of the scriptures for their ownadvancement and thus benefit themselves. That is why the real purport of SrimadBhagavatam has not yet been clearly revealed. I had a great desire to translateSrimad Bhagavatam in this proper swanlike way, but I have no time to translatethis huge work. For this reason I am now extracting the main pu r p ort of t his greatliterature and presenting it in the form of t his Sri Krsna samhita -As I wa.s notsatisfied after writing the verses of this book, I translated them into Bengali. I hopelearned people will always scrutinizingly discuss this book in or der to ascertain thespiritual subj ect matters.E veryone has the right to discuss spiritual topics. Yet people are divided into thr eecategories according to their qualifications3. Those who do not possessindependent power of discrimination are in the first category and are calledneophytes, or those with soft faith. They have no alternative to faith. If they do notaccept whatever the compilers of the scriptures write as the order of the Lord, then"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"they fall down. They are qualified only for un d erstanding the gross meanings ofthe science of Krsna; they have no qualification for und erstanding the subtlemeanings. Until they gradually advance by good association and instruction, theyshould try to advance under the shelter of faith. Those who have not yet succeededin connecting faith with argum ent are second grade, or madhyama a-dhikari A.ndthose who are expert in connecting these two are perfect in all respects. They areable to attain perfection by util i z ing material resources in their independentendeavors. They are called topmost, or uttama ad-hikari. Among these three, it isnecessary to ascertain who is the proper candidate for studying this book. Th eneophytes are not qualified, but they can gradually become qualified by attaining ahigher stage through good fortune. The expert topmost persons have no directneed for this book other than to strengthen their own con clusions. Still, theyshould discuss this book with due respect in order to benefit the madhyamaadhikaris Th.erefore it is the madhyama adh-ikaris who are the proper candidatesfor studying this book. All the above-mentioned three categories of people arequalified to study Srimad Bhagavatam, yet most of the commentaries on thismatchless book are composed for the benefit of the neophytes. The commentatorswere all swanlike persons, and they have exhibited more compassion towards theneophytes than towards the madhyamas. Whenever they discuss j nana, they arereferring to brahma jnana, o r the impersonal understanding of the Absolute Truth.Therefore modern speculators are not benefited. Nowadays many people of ourcountry discuss foreign literature and science with a desire to scrutinize itssignificance. They quickly become faithless after observing the indirectpresentationsW by the writers of the scripture and the scriptural commentaries thatare appropriate for the above-mentioned neophytes. They then either adopt adifferent religion or become famous by intro du cing a new one. The danger withthis is that such people uselessly waste their time inventing a new level ofunderstanding while leaving aside the previous mahaj anas perfect path, whichautomatically uplifts one from a lower qualification to a higher one. If there weresome literatures appropriate for the madhyama adhik-aris to discuss, then noanarthas, or unwanted things, in the form of sub-religion, cheating religion, ori rreligion would have entered India. The principal purp ose of this book is to ful f i l lthe above-mentioned requirement. Actually this book wil l d i r e c tly and in d i r e ctlybenefit all three types of persons t h e u t t a ma, madhyama, and kanistha. Thereforethey should all respect this book.Sectarianism is a natural byproduct of the Absolute Tru th. W hen ac aryas firstascertain and instruct the Tru th, it is not po l l u ted w it h sectarianism. But the rulesand regulations received through disciplic succession regarding the goal and themethod of achieving it are changed in due course of time according to thementality and locale of the people5. A rule that is followed by one society is notnecessarily accepted in another society. That is why one commu n ity is di f f erentfrom another. As a community gradually develops more respect for its ownstandards, it develops hatred towards other commu n i t ies and considers theirstandards inferior. These sectarian symptoms are seen in all countries since timeimmemorial. This is promin ent amongst neophytes and found to some extentamongst madhyama adhikaris -Amongs.t uttama adhikaris-, however, there is notrace of sectarianism. Adherence to a particular standard is the promin entsymptom of a society. There are three types of standards al o c a k a g ata,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"a2ocanagata, and a2ocyagata A.2ocakagata is when sectarianists accept someexternal signs. Examples of a2ocakagata are ti2aka, neckbeads, saffron robes, as wellas the baptism practiced abroad. The different activities practiced in the process ofworship are called a2ocanagata E.xamples of a2ocanagata are sacrifices, austerities,fire sacrifices, vows, studying scriptures, deity worship, constructing temples,respecting the purity of various trees and rivers, dressing like sannyasis, acting likeacaryas, dressing like brahmacaris or grhasthas, closing one s eyes, respectingparticular types of books, rules and regulations in eating, and respecting the purityof particular times and places. The examples of a2ocyagata are attributingpersonalism or impersonalism on the Supreme Lord, installing deities, exhibitingthe mood of an incarnation of the Lord, speculating on heaven and hell, anddescribing the future destination of the soul. The different forms of these spiritualactivities create divisions of sectarianism. Differences that arise from places, times,languages, behaviors, foods, dresses, and natures of various communi t ies arei ncorporated within th eir spiri t ual practices and gradually make one commun i t yso completely different from another comm u n it y t hat even the consideration thateveryone is a human being may cease to exist. Due to these differences there isdisagreement, cessation of social intercourse, and fighting, even up to the point ofk illing one another. When an asslike mentality becomes prominent wi t hi n t h ekanistha adhi-karis, then they certainly indul ge in these things. But if they developa swanlike mentality, then they do not take part in quarrels, rather, they endeavorto attain a higher level. Madhyama adhi-karis do not quarrel so much aboutexternal standards, but they are always attacked by philosophical disagreements.Sometimes they condemn the standards of neophytes and establish their ownstandards as superior. They condemn the neophytes' deity worship in or der toestablish the worshipable Lord as formless6. In such cases, they are alsoconsidered asslike people. Otherwise, if they had a swanlike mentality and a desireto attain a higher level, they would respect others practices and inquire abouthigher topics. Contradictions actually arise only due to asslike mentality. Swanlikepersons consider the necessity for different practices according to one'squalification, so they naturally become detached from sectarian quarrels7. In thisregard, it should be known that both asslike and swanlike people are foundamongst the kanistha adhikar-is and madhyama adhika-ris Ido n .ot expect thatasslike people will accept this book with respect. If neophytes and madhyamaadhikaris become completely indifferent in regard to the contradictions found invarious practices and try to advance further, then they become swanlike persons.Then they are our respectable and dear friends. Although swanlike personalitiesm ay accept a particular practice from birth or ch i l d h oo d according to instru c ti o n sthey have received, they nevertheless remain indifferent and nonsectarian.The religious principles that will be explained and established in this book are verydifficult to name. If these principles are given a particular sectarian name, thenother sects will oppose them. Srimad Bhagavatam has therefore establishedsanatana dharma -as satvata dharma, -or religious principles related with theAbsolute Truth8. Another name for these religious principles is Vaisnava-dharma.Asslike Vaisnavas fall into the categories of Saktas (followers of Durga), Sauras(followers of the sun-god), Ganapatyas (followers of Ganesa), Saivites (followers ofSiva), and Vaisnavas (followers of Visnu). But swanlike Vaisnavas are nonsectarianand, therefore, rare. These five types of above- mentioned spiritualists, as found in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"India, are named according to their respective qualifications. Human beings havetwo types of tendencies a r t h i c , or m a t e ri al, and paramarthic, or spiritu al .Material tendencies include maintaining the body, constructing a house, marrying,begetting children, studying, earning wealth, material science, factory work,acquiring and maintaining assets, and accumulating piety. Alth ough th ere aresome similarities between the activities of humans and animals, the materialendeavors of humans are nevertheless superior to the natural tendencies ofanimals. If after executing their material activities human beings do not takeshelter of their constitutional activities, then they are called two-legged animals.The constitutional activities of a pure soul are called one s sva-dharma, orprescribed activities. The sva-dharma of a living entity is prom i n en tly m a n i f estedin his pure state of existence. In the pure state of existence this sva-dharma ispresent in the form of spiritual activities. All the above-mentioned materialtendencies become successful when dovetailed with spiri t ual activities, otherwisethey cannot independently help one attain the highest goa19. From engagement inmaterial activities up to the awakening of spiritual activities is called thepreliminary stage of God consciousness. From this preliminary stage up to theuttama-adhikarI stage there are innumerable levels10. Inquiring about the truth ofthe material world is called Sakta-dharma, because the predominating deity of thematerial world is goddess Durga. All behavior and practice instructed in Sakta-dharma is helpful only in the pr eli m i n ary stage. Such behavior and practice ismeant to bring one closer to spiritual life, and materialistic people may be attractedby this only until they begin to in q u ire about the Supreme Absolute Truth. Sakta-dharma is the living entities in i t ial spiri t ual endeavor, and it is extremely essentialfor people of that level. When the prelim i n ary stage is further strengthened, oneattains the next level. One then considers the energy of work and the superiority ofheat over dull matter, and he therefore accepts the sun-god, who is the source ofheat, as his worshipable deity. At that time, Saura-dharma is awakened. Later,when one considers even heat as dull matter and animal consciousness as superior,then the third stage, Ganapatya-dharma, is attained. In the fourth gross stage, LordSiva is worshiped as the pure consciousness of the living entities, and Saiva-dharma manifests. In the fifth stage, the consciousness of the living entityworships the supreme consciousness, and thus Vaisnava-dharma is manifest.Generally there are five types of paramarthic dharmas, or spiritual duties, that havebeen known by different names in different countries at different times. If oneconsiders all the different dharmas that are current in In dia and abroad, one cansee that they certainly fall wit hin t h ese five categories. The religious principlestaught by Mohammed and Jesus Christ are similar to the religious principl estaught by Vaisnava sects. Buddhism and Jainism are similar to Saiva-dharma. Thisis a scientific consideration of tru ths regarding religious principles. Those whoconsider their own religious princi ples as real dharma and others' religiousprinciples as irreligion or subreligion are unable to ascertain the truth due to beinginfluenced by prejudice. Actually, religious principles followed by people ingeneral are different only due to the different qualifications of the practitioners,but the constitutional religious principles of all living enti ties are one. It is notproper for swanlike persons to reject the religious principles that people in generalfollow according to their situation. Therefore, with due respect to the religiousprinciples followed by people in general, we will now d i s cuss the living entiti es"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"constitutional religious principles.Satvata d-harma, or nonsectarian Vaisnava-dharma, is the living entitiesconstitutional, or eternal, religious principles l l . Bu t th e V aisnava-dharma that isf ound in the Mayavada-sampradaya is only an indirect imi t a tion of th o seprinciples. When such sectarian Vaisnava-dharma becomes transcendental, that is,when it is freed from impersonalism, then it becomes Satvata dh-arma, or religiousprinciples related with the Supreme Truth. The different sampradayas, namelydvaita (dualism), dvaitadvaita (simultaneous oneness and difference), suddhadvaita(purified oneness), and visistadvaita (specific monism) that are found in satvatadharma are nothing but wond e rful varieties of sentiments within t he Vaisnavascience. Actually the various sampradayas are not the result of differences in thebasic truth. Impersonalism is diametrically opposite to the science of bhakti. ThoseVaisnavas who have accepted impersonalism are not pure Vaisnavas.It is our duty to consider when and how Vaisnava-dharma has manifest in thiscountry [Indi a]. Before we consider this subject, however, there are many othersubjects that have to be resolved. Therefore we will first resolve the dates,according to modern considerations, of the main events of India. Later we willascertain the dates of the esteemed scriptures. As soon as the dates of thes criptures are ascertained, then I will expl ain, according to modern opi n i on , th ehistory of Vaisnava-dharma that is explained in those scriptures. Although weourselves consider the dates of the scriptures according to ancient methods, I willnow follow contemporary methods for the benefit of modern people.The very ancient history of India is covered by the dense darkness of forgetfulness,because there is no proper sequence in its ancient history. I will establish with a bitof conjecture whatever I can on the inform ation I have acquired through the fourVedas, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Puranas In th.e beginning, theAryans lived in a small country named Brahmavarta, which was situated betweenthe two rivers S a r a svati and Drsadvati. The present name of Drsadvati isKagara12. By discussing the meaning of the name \"Brahmavarta\" it is assumed thatthe Aryans came from another country to reside therein. We cannot ascertainexactly where they came from, but it is believed that they came from somenorthwest country13. When they came, they were relatively civilized according tothe time. There is no doubt about this. Being proud of their own ci v i l i z a ti on, theyused to disregard the local natives. It is said that when the Aryans disregarded thelocal natives, the natives' king, Rudradeva, showed the Aryans his prowess byaccepting in marriage the hand of Sati, the daughter of Prajapati Daksa, thusmaking an alliance with Daksa. Nevertheless the Aryans were so proud that afterthe marriage of Sati, they did not respect her or her husband. That is why Satihated herself and gave up her body in Daksa's sacrificial arena and thereafter Sivawith his followers began to heavily torture the Aryans. The brahmanas were laterforced to make an alliance with Siva by allowing him a share in the sacrifice. Still,in order to maintain their superiority, the Aryans placed Siva s seat in thenortheastern corner of the sacrificial arena. There is no doubt that Daksa s firesacrifice took place soon after the Aryans established Brahmavarta, because the tenpersonalities headed by Daksa are described as the original Prajapatis. The wife ofPrajapati Daksa was named Prasuti. She was the daughter of Svayambhuva Manu,the son of Brahma. Svayambhuva Manu and the Prajapatis were the originalinhabitants of Brahmavarta. Another son of Brahma was Marici, whose son was"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Kasyapa. The son of Kasyapa was Vivasvan, whose son was Vaivasvata Manu. Theson of Vaivasvata Manu was Iksvaku. From this we must conclude that the Suryadynasty began with the sixth generation from Brahma. At the time of MaharajaIksvaku, the Aryans were living in a place called Brahmarsi. According to modernc alculation the above-mentioned six generations enjoyed their kin g dom for t w oh undred years. Because Brahmavarta was too small it was expanded within t h i stwo hundred years and called Brahmarsi. The Aryans were very eager to expandtheir dynasty, and they had so many children that Brahmavarta became toocongested to suit their needs. Modern scholars say that some civilized personalitieslike Candra were inducted into the Aryan race at that time. According to theircalculation, in those two hun d red years there were eight Manus, beginning fromSvayambhuva Manu up to Vaivasvata Manu. Just after Svayambhuva Manu, the sonof Agni named Svarocisa Manu appeared. The grandson of Svayambhuva Manuwas Uttama Manu. He had one brother named Tamasa Manu and another brothernamed Raivata Manu. In the seventh generation from Svayambhuva Manu wasCaksusa Manu. Vaivasvata Manu was the fifth generation from Brahma. SavarniM anu was the stepbrother of Vaivasvata. Therefore all the Manus wound up t h e i ractivities before the time of Iksvaku; there is no doubt about this. Daksa-savarni,Brahma-savarni, Dharma-savarni, Rudra-savarni, Deva-savarni, and Indra-savarniexisted only in the imagination of mod ern people. If they were historical, then it isto be understood that they lived in di f f erent parts of India wi t hi n t h ose twohundred years. It is also stated that the churning of the ocean took place duringthe time of Caksusa Manu. Vamana appeared during the time of Vaivasvata Manu.After Bali Maharaja s sacrifice, all the demons were driven away by trickery. Thekings of the Manu dynasty had their capitals outside Brahmavarta, but in thebeginning they were not expert in managing their ki n g d om, education, or familylife. Dhanvantari appeared during the churn ing of the ocean. The Asvim-k u m arasa lso appeared at that time. The poison which emanated during the chur n ing of th eocean was eliminated by Siva of the Rudra dynasty. By discussing all these topicswe can understand that in those days the culture of medicine in progress. It is alsoseen that at this time the demon Rahu was cut in two, and thus Rahu and Ketuwere formed. We can understand from this that the science of astrology was beingdiscussed at that time. It is not believed, however, that there was a writtenlanguage during this time. And since there is no written in f o r m a t ion about th atperiod, it appears that it lasted for a vast duration of time. In fact, much later,when calculation of time began, it was said that each Manu enjoyed a rule ofseventy maha-yugas. Among the kings, whoever laid down laws was called a Manuand was respected by all. There were two reasons why so many Manus appeared insuch a short span of time. The first reason is that there was no written language orbooks, so knowledge was transmitted by sruti, or hearing. The other necessarysrutis that were added to the original sruti were then ascribed to the reigns of themany different Manus. The second reason is that due to an increase of population,the dwelling areas of the Aryans spread and divided into various areas withdifferent kings ruling. Thus there were many lawmakers, or Manus. This is theway modern scholars have described the different durations of Manus. Swanlikepeople respect whatever substance may be derived from these topics, buttranscendental explantions are often helpful for asslike people19.These explanations of transcendental characteristics and divisions of time were"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"accepted in order to generate firm faith in such peoples mi n ds. The great sagesaccept the existence of different Manus in order to benefit neophytes and checkthe fantasies created at various times and places. We will never say that history andthe process of calculating time according to the scriptures is false or imaginary.Modern scholars have stated that the names of the kings from Ik svaku's time areavailable. The names of the kings in the Surya dynasty can be accepted with a greatdeal of certainty. From Iksvaku to Ramacandra there were 63 generations. If weconsider that each king ruled the kin gdom for 25 years, then the time fromIksvaku to Ramacandra comes to 1,575 years. In the ninety-fourth generation ofthat dynasty, King Brhadbala was killed by Abhim anyu in th e Battle of Kur u k setra.The Battle of Kuruksetra took place 2,350 years after the rule of Iksvaku. Theduration of all Manvantaras together comes to 200 years. Therefore we will have toaccept that the establishment of Brahmavarta took place 2,550 years prior to theBattle of Kuruksetra.The duration of the Candra dynasty king's rule is not very clear. From Ila, whowas a contemporary of Iksvaku, through Purur ava and up to Yudh i sthi ra, 50generations are described. It is therefore difficult to accept that Sri Ramacandraappeared in the sixty-third generation from Ik svaku, yet long before Yudhisthira, ifthere were only 50 generations from Ila to Yudhi sthira. Valmiki was a very ancientrsi The.refore his calculations must be more accurate than the calculations of themodern rsis The .kings of the Surya dynasty were very powerful, so their familypriests wrote down the duration of th eir various kings r u l es. There is no doubtabout this. Rather, there is a mistake on the origin of the Candra dynasty. Perhapsa fter the kings of the Surya dynasty ruled their kin g dom for a long period, Kin gYayati became very powerful. Being unable to enter the Surya dynasty, Yayatidecided to link his dynasty with the dynasty of Pururava Nahusa. Yet even afterdoing this, he and many others from his dynasty were unable to establish arelationship with the Surya dynasty. King Romapada15, the friend of Dasaratha,a ppeared in the fourteenth generation from Pur u r ava, in the dynasty of Anu, th eson of Yayati. Kartaviryarjuna was born in the sixteenth generation from Pur u r ava,in the dynasty of Yadu. He was the enemy of Parasurama. From this it isunderstood that King Yayati ruled his kin gdom about th i r t een or fou r teengenerations before Ramacandra. That was the beginning of the Candra dynasty.That is why they calculate their time in relationship with th e Surya dynasty.In the beginning, the kings of the Surya dynasty lived on the bank of the Yamunaat the place known as Brahmarsi. The tenth king of the Surya dynasty, namedSravanta, created Sravantipuri. It is stated in the Ramayana that the city ofAyodhya was established by Manu. Nevertheless many people feel that VaivasvataManu lived near the Yamuna and his son, Iksvaku, established Ayodhya and thenresided therein. It is written that Iksvaku s sons lived in Aryavarta. Vaisalipuri wascreated by King Visala, who was in the twenty-fifth generation from Vaivasvata.The city of Sravanti is situated about 60 miles north of Ay o d h ya, the capital ofKosala. The present name of this place is Sahet Mahet. The city of Vaisali issituated about 28 miles north of Patna. From this it is understood that the kings ofthe Surya dynasty powerfully ru led their ki n g dom f rom th e Yamuna to the KausikiRiver, on the western side of the Ganges. Gradually, when the kings of the Candradynasty became powerful, the kings of the Surya dynasty became weakened. It isalso said that up to the time of Mandhata the Aryans of the Surya dynasty used to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"call Mithila and the nearby area around the Ganges as Aryavarta. But at the time ofBhagiratha, who came just after King Sagara, the districts adjoining the Ganges upto the ocean were considered Aryavarta. Previous to this it was concluded in th es criptures that if an Aryan died outside of Aryavarta he would go to hell. At th attime Aryavarta extended only between the Himalayas and the Vindhyas16. Thedescendents of King Sagara gave up their bodies at the place called Mleccha-desa17, Bengal [presently called Ganga-sagara], and until that place was includedin Aryavarta, the descendants of the Surya dynasty were condemned. For thisreason many kings of the Surya dynasty s u c h a s D i h pa, Am sum an, andBhagiratha w o r s h i p e d Brahma, the head of the rsis, and established the land upto Ganga-sagara as part of Aryavarta. According to modern opi n i on , th ose kingsspread the glories of the Ganges up to the ocean. Modern opinion is that it was notthe waters of the Ganges that were taken to the ocean, rather it was the glories ofthe Ganges that were taken to the ocean. That is why the Manu-samhita (2.22)describes Aryavarta as the area between the Himalaya and Vindhya Mou n t a ins andstretching from the eastern ocean to the western ocean18. The divisions ofAryavarta and Daksinatya are thus accepted since the time of Bhagiratha.N ow I will explain the calculations of the four yugas according to modern opi n i o n .Satya-yuga extends up to the time of King Ma n d h ata. Treta-yuga begins afterMandhata and continues through the rule of Lava and Kusa. Dvapara-yuga thenlasts through the Battle of Kuruksetra. Satya-yuga consists of 650 years, Treta-yugaconsists of 1,125 years, and Dvapara-yuga consists of 775 years. In this way thetotal comes to 2,550 years19. Vedic scholars, however, do not accept theseconclusions.In the descriptions of the principle tir thas of the different yugas, it is mentionedthat Kuruksetra was the tirtha for Satya-yuga. Kuruksetra is situated nearBrahmavarta. Puskara, situated near Ajmera, was the tirtha for Treta-yuga. InDvapara-yuga, Naimisaranya was the tirtha. The present name of Naimisaranya isN imkhara or Nimsara. It is located about 00 miles northwest of Lucknow on t h ebank of the Gomati River. In the age of Kali, Ganges is the tirtha Just as.Brahmavarta, Brahmarsi-desa, Madhya-desa, and ancient and modern Aryavartawere gradually established from time to ti me, similarly the ti r t has were all spreadfrom Kuruksetra to Ganga-sagara during the expansion of the country. Accordingto the advancement of the intelligence of people in a particular time, differentincarnations appear in different ages. As people advanced in religiosity, themantras for their deliverance gradually blossomed.According to modern opini on, some of the major in cidents that took place in the2,550 years prior to and inclu d ing the Battle of Kuru k setra are the sacrifice ofDaksa, the fight between the demigods and the demons, the churning of the ocean,the banishment of the demons to Patalaloka, the killing of King Vena, the bringingof the Ganges to the ocean, the killing of the ksatriyas by Parasurama, the victoryof Sri Ramacandra over Lanka, the journey of King Devapi and Maru to the vi l l ageof Kalapa, and the Battle of Kuruksetra. Apart from these, the scriptures relatemany other incidents that took place.Modern scholars think that Daksa's fire sacrifice took place immediately after theAryans established Brahmavarta. This strange incident happened due to theA ryan's pride of their caste and their unw i l l i n g n ess to maintain a relationship wi t hthe local natives. At that time Bhutanatha Rudra was the leader of the local natives."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Most of the hill areas were under his jurisdiction. Bhutan, or Bhuta-sthana, Koca-vihara, or Kucm-vihara, and Trivarta, where Kailasa Mountain is seen, were allunder Rudra's rule. Even though he was a local native, he was expert in the scienceof medicine, fighting, and singing. Seeing his ability, the eleven Rudra kings, whowere his representatives, even claimed that he was the supreme controller. Such apersonality as the King of the Rudras could not tolerate the brahmana's false ego,so he forcefully and tactfully married the daughter of Prajapati Daksa, who lived atKankhala, near Haridvara. After Satidevi left her body, a fierce battle took placebetween him and the brahmanas A.fter the battle, he was given a share of thesacrifice and a seat in the northeast corner of the sacrificial arena. After that theAryans made friendship with the pow erful local mou n t ain people. Since then, wedo not find any further quarrel between the local mountain people and thebrahmarsis, because the mountain people respected the brahmanas and the King ofthe Rudras was counted among the lords of the Aryans20.Although the Aryans no longer quarreled with the mo u n t ain people, many personsfrom their own dynasty put forw ard obstacles on the path of prosperity. Thedescendants of Kasyapa, who accepted the features of snakes and birds, startedresiding here and there under the subordination of the demigods. At that time th edescendants of Kasyapa who accepted the features ofbirds developed intenseanimosity towards the snakes. But later the snakes became more powerful, andt hey ruled many kingdoms. Gradually the birds became almost extinct. From th ewomb of Diti, the wife of Kasyapa, a few formidable men were born. They werec ondemned as demons. They became enemies of all good people by will f u lly actin gagainst the brahmarsis Even.tually they quarreled with King I n d ra and establisheda separate kingdom. This quarrel became known as the battle between thed emigods and the demons. Almost all the demons lived in the country k n ow n asPanca-nada [the place of five rivers]. Sakala, Asarara, Narasimha, and Multan, orKasyapapura, were under their juri sdicti on. It is possible that Prajapati Kasyapa, inwhose family the demigods and demons were born, lived in the count r ies ofPanca-nada and Brahmavarta. The Prajapatis lived around Brahmavarta. At thattime Brahmavarta was the center of the demigods' kingdom. Both the Sarasvati andDrsadvati Rivers flowed in the demigods k i n g d om . Brahmavarta is the place thatwas founded by the demigods between these two rivers21. From the word deva inthis verse [see footnote below], it is understood that the demigods were residingthere. The demigods were also sons of Prajapati Kasyapa, therefore they are alsoaccepted as Aryans. It is felt that during the foun d ing of Brahmavarta, just after thereign of Svayambhuva Manu, Indra, the son of Kasyapa and an expertadministrator, was awarded the title of King of the demigods. Those great soulswho were engaged in the administrative work received different posts like Vayu,Varuna, Agni, Yama, and Pusa. Later, when others attained those posts, they werealso known as Indra, Candra, Vayu, and Varuna. After the reign of Vaivasvata, thedemigods became very weak. Their ruling of the ki n g dom co n t i n ued simply inname. Wherever there were sacrifices, they were invited and shown respect. In thisway, after some time the great personalities of Brahmavarta were no more and theybecame counted amongst the heavenly demigods. Their seats and shares insacrifices of this planet were given to other invited brahmanas The dem.igods thenbecame known as yantras and were invoked by mantras. This is also seen inJaimini s mImamsa philosophy. In the beginning the demigods were the rulers,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"later they became the enjoyers of shares of sacrifices, and finally they wereestablished in the scriptures in the form of man t r as. At the time when th edemigods were ruling, the demons, born from Kasyapa's other wife, became greedyfor the demigods' kingdom and created many disturbances. The first battlebetween the demigods and demons took place at the time of Hiranyakasipu. Thechurning of the ocean took place a short time after this battle. During the battlebetween the demigods and the demons, Brhaspati was Indra's minister andSukracarya was the demons mi n i s t er. Being unable to kill H i r a n y akasipu, thebrahmanas brought his son to the demigods' side with the help of Sanda andAmarka. Hiranyakasipu was then killed by the strength of providence. Thegrandson of Hiranyakasipu was Virocana. During his reign an alliance was madebetween the demigods and the demons. By combining the intelligence of thed emigods with the strength and industrial kn o w l e dge of the demons the churni n gof the ocean of knowledge took place, and various excellent items, like scientificopulences and nectar, were produced. Later, by discussing knowledge of the self,poison, in the form of renun ciation of fr u i t ive work and self-destruction, wasproduced. Maha-Rudra, who knew the spiritual science, controlled that poison bythe power of science. The demons were tactfully deceived from obtaining nectar,and therefore another battle took place. The asuras were defeated in this battle, sothey lived contented with th eir own k i n g do m fo r a long ti me. In the meantim e,Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods, was insulted by Indra and went offi n seclusion. At this junct ure the demons again lit the fire of war on th einstructions of Sukracarya. With the permission of Brahma, Indra acceptedVisvarupa, the son of Tvasta, as his priest. Then, with various tactics, Visvarupahelped the demigods defeat the demons. Visvarupa used to drink w i ne, and due tohis friendship with the asuras he devised a plan for the asuras to captureBrahmavarta in return for a share of the sacrifices. For this reason, Indra killedhim. Visvarupa s father, Tvasta, thus became angry with In dra and started a revolt.His other son, Vrtra, joined the demons and began to harass Indra, and thedemigods then decided to take shelter of Dadhyanca (Dadhici). After the death ofDadhyanca, Visvakarma, with hard labor and scientific methods, created a vaj ra, orthunderbolt. Then Indra ki l led Vr tra with th e help of this vaj ra, and he becamecondemned as the killer of a brahmana Al o ng .with other brahmanas, Tvasta exiledIndra for some time. At that time In dra lived near Manasa-sarovara. The brahmanasquarreled among themselves but were unable to find a proper candidate for thepost of Indra. Finally they decided to install Nahusa, the grandson of Pururava, asthe king. In a short time Nahusa developed a tendency to neglect the brahmanas,so the brahmanas reinstalled Indra as the king after sending Nahusa back to hisprevious duties. The battle between the demigods and the demons took place atKuruksetra, near Brahmavarta. There is no doubt about this, because Indra killedVrtra and went northeast to Manasa-sarovara to reside22. It is also proved thatDadhici Muni previously lived near Kuruk setra. Some people say that three raisedhillocks, called Tripistapa, may be found either at Kuru k setra or north ernBrahmavarta.On the instigation of Sukracarya, the demons gradually became powerful, andbecause the demigods were unable to check them, they took the help ofVamanadeva. By Vamanadeva s tactics, the demigods thus drove King Bali and hisfollowers from the area of Tripistapa. Perhaps the asuras took a vow to live on the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"bank of the River Sindhu, at the place known as Sindhu23. At that time the placewas known as Patala, because the descendants of the ¹ g a s r e s i ded there. Thedescendants of the ¹ g a s , s uch as Elapatra and Taksaka, resided in that countryfor many years. After the asuras resided there for many years, they returned tor eside at Tripistapa. At that time, the lake known as Elapatra and the city kn ow nas Taksasila were founded. The ¹ g a s a l s o l i ved in the pr ov i nce of Kashmir .Elaborate descriptions of this are found in the Raj a ta-ranginI K.ing Bali was in thefifth generation from Kasyapa. During his reign, the asuras were tactfully exiled toPatala.The topics of King Vena are one of the main subjects of Aryan history. King Venac ame in the eleventh generation from Svayambhuva Manu. At this point it sh o u l dbe considered where Manu and his descendants were residing. In some places ofthe scriptures it is stated that Manu resided in Brahmavarta. Manu s city ofBarhismati was situated south of Brahmavarta and southwest of Kuru k setra. Theboundary of Brahmarsi-desa was not established at that time, hence the sagesconsidered Manu s city as within Brahmavarta. Actually the city of Manu should beconsidered as a part of Brahmarsi-desa, as it was situated to the southeast of theSarasvati River29. It is described that Manu visited many sages asramas on bothbanks of the Sarasvati when returning to his abode from the asrama of PrajapatiKardama of Bindu-sarovara. Eventually he left the Sarasvati before entering his cityof Kusa-kasa. Another consideration regarding Manu is the question of why hebecame a ksatriya Brah.ma's sons were called Prajapatis, and they were allbrahmanas So fo.r what reason did Svayambhuva Manu accept an inferior position>Perhaps when the Aryans established Brahmavarta there was only one caste. Butfor increasing the population there was a shortage of women. They took a boy anda girl from an unkn ow n caste and, after converting them into Ar y ans, they marriedthem. They were Svayambhuva Manu and his wife, Satarupa. Their daughters weremarried to various sages, and in this way the Aryan dynasty prospered.Considering that it was improper for the Aryans to openly accept a girl from anon-Aryan family, their parents were first converted into Aryans and the fatherwas awarded the post of Svayambhuva Manu. This was the tactic adopted foraccepting their daughters in marriage. Therefore the sons born from th o sedaughters were not given equal status with pure Aryans, and they were calledksatrus Someon.e who is able to deliver one from ksata, or injur y, is called aksatru This is t.he explanation that is found in Ma l l i n a t ha s commentary on theRaghuvamsa. Although the Aryans accepted Manu and his descendants as membersof their communi ty, still, with a desire to keep them separate from the originalAryans that established Brahmavarta, the Aryans remained brahmanas andengaging the members of the ksatriya families for protecting the brahmanas T h e .demigods used to reside on the northwestern side of Brahmavarta as the protectorsfrom the asuras, who were living in Panca-nada at the time. The rsis used to liveon the banks of the Sarasvati. Manu and his descendants resided on thesouthwestern side of the Sarasvati, in a place called Daksinatya. They protected thebrahmanas from the uncivilized castes. The earthly kings were under the control ofthe heavenly kings. The demigod Indra was the emperor over all. The place wherethe demigods resided was called Tripistapa, or the place where there are threehillocks. On the northern side of the peak of those hillocks is the palace of Indra.That palace is protected on each of its eight sides by Dikpalas. I will not expl ain"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"the modern opinion on this out of fear of increasing the size of this book. But Icannot refrain from menti o n ing one more thing in t his regard. The sons ofK asyapa, who is the fourth generation from Brahma, founded the kingdom of th ed emigods. From Brahma to Kasyapa there were two kingdom s M a n u a n dPrajapati. The kingdom of the demigods was founded later. When the demigodskingdom became powerful, then the fighting between the demigods and thedemons began. As the demigods' kingdom became weaker, Manu's kingdombecame more powerful. The duration of Svayambhuva Manu's rule was not verylong. As the kingdom of Vaivasvata Manu became powerful, the kingdom ofSvayambhuva Manu gradually dim i n i sh ed. Vaivasvata Manu was the son of Surya.But the writers of the scriptures have different opinions about the name of hismother. Perhaps he was an adopted son, or perhaps he was born of a non-Aryan.That is why he could not be accepted as a brahmana, like his brothers, rather hewas accepted as a ksatriya, like Svayambhuva Manu. There is no need to furtherdiscuss the modern opinion in t hi s regard. In due course of time, when he saw thedemigods weakness, King Vena tried his best to disperse them25. Then thebrahmanas, who were the leaders of the demigods, killed him. Aft er massaging hishands, they found a great personality named Prthu and a woman named Arci one ither side of his body, and they handed the kingdom over to Prthu for r u l i n g .During Prthu s reign, villages were founded, farming was introduced, gardens wereplanted, and many other material facilities were provided26.If we accept the modern opinion regarding the Ganges, then it may be said thatKing Bhagiratha of the Surya dynasty performed a great job of spreading the gloriesof the Ganges up to the ocean, thus extending the area of Aryavarta. At that tim eAryavarta extended only as far as Mithila, and the dynasty of Manu was almostextinct. The kingdoms of the Surya and Rudra dynasties were both very powerfulat the time, and they had such an alliance that no general work could go onanywhere in India with out t h eir consent. When King Sagara s sons were cursed todie near the ocean, it created a bad name for the Surya dynasty. In order tocounteract that bad name, King Bhagiratha worshiped Brahma, the leader of thedemigods, and Siva, the King of the Rudra kingdom, and thus received permissionto make Aryavarta prosperous. Bhagiratha then connected the Ganges with theocean. In the beginning, the Sarasvati was the only sacred river. Gradually whenthe areas around the Yamuna were populated by the Aryans, the glories of theYamuna also spread. Then during the time of Bhagiratha, the Ganges becamecelebrated as the topmost of all sacred rivers.Some time after this incident there was a great quarrel between the brahmanas andthe ksatriyas Duri ng .this time the Aryans and the ksatriyas saw that thedemigods' kingdom had become weak and they began to neglect them; they evenkilled many of the promin ent rs is Wh e n t .he brahmanas were unable to toleratethese incidents, they appointed Parasurama as their commander-in-chief andbegan to retaliate. Kartaviryarjuna of the Haihaya dynasty accumulated manyksatriyas and entered the war against the brahmanas Kartavir.ya was killed byParasurama s unbearable axe. Kartaviryarjuna had ruled the city of Mahismati, ont he bank of the Narmada River. He was so powerful that the non-A ryans from th eDaksinatya had always remained fearful of him. King Ravana of Lanka did not dareto come to Aryavarta out of fear of Kartaviryar~una. The brahmanas, however, werenot satisfied by killing Kartavirya. They gradually began to fight with th e k i ngs of"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"the Surya and Candra dynasties. It is said that Parasurama rid the whole world ofall ksatriyas twenty-one times and then gave the world to Kasyapa to rule. Thepurport is that the demigods' kingdom of Brahmavarta fell into the hands of thebrahmanas of the Kasyapa dynasty. When the Kasyapa dynasty had nearlycollapsed and many kings were ruling, Parasurama reestablished the Kasyapadynastys' rule. Learned scholars of that time, however, considered that thebrahmanas were no longer capable of ruling the king d o m, so the ksatriyas shouldrule. Prominent brahmanas and ksatriya kings had various meetings, out of whic hthe Manu scriptures were brought into being. Later we will di scuss whether thoseM anu scriptures are still current or not. Brahmavarta, or the kingdom of th edemigods, was no longer respected by the local people. The demigods wererespected only during sacrifices. That also was simply in the form of names andmantras. The actual brahmana communities became highly respected. In this way,although the brahmanas and ksatriyas had an alliance between themselves,Parasurama again fought with the ksatriyas o ut of greed to capture the kingdom.In the Ramayana it is stated that Parasurama went to fight Ramacandra, but he wasdefeated and exiled to Mahendra Mount ain, near Kanya-kumari. The brahmanasassisted Ramacandra in achieving this, and thus Parasurama became particularlyenvious of the brahmanas and created a few kinds of brahmanas in the South. Manybrahmanas from the South admit that they were turned into brahmanas byParasurama. Those brahmanas who lived with Parasurama in the province ofMalabara preached the Aryan scriptures throughout Daksinatya. That is how th eastrology of Kerala and other sciences were introduced. The descendants of thosebrahmanas are still current today; they are known as Sarasvata brahmanasImmediately after this incident, the battle between Ravana and Rama took place.Ravana, the King of Lanka, was very powerful at the time. One rsi f rom thedynasty of Pulastya left Brahmavarta and resided on the island of Lanka for sometime. The dynasty of Ravana began after that rsi married a daughter from thedynasty of Raksa. We can therefore say that Ravana was half Raksa and half Aryan.Due to his prowess, King Ravana gradually captured many of the southernprovinces of India. Finally his kin gdom extended up to the banks of the GodavariR iver, where he appointed two commander s K h a r a an d D u s an a t o g u a r d t h eborder. When Rama and Laksmana built a cottage on the banks of the Godavari,Ravana thought that the descendants of the Surya dynasty were building a fortnear his border in order to attack his kin gd om. Considering this, King Ravanatook the help of Marica, the son of Taraka, who was a resident of Bakasara, andkidnapped Sita. Ramacandra took the help of people from Daksinatya andKiskinda in order to locate SIta. Valmiki was an Aryan poet who had a naturaltendency to tease the people of Daksinatya. That is why he described the greatheroes and friends of Rama in a comical way. He described some of them asmonkeys, some as bears, and some as Raksasas. He even described them as havingtails and being covered with hair. Anyw ay, during the time of Ramacandra, theseed of friendship was sown between the Aryans and the people of Daksinatya.There is no doubt about this. The seed later became a large tree, which producedexcellent fruits. Otherwise, the people of Karnata, Dravida, Maharastra, andMysore would not have become known as Hindus. Ramacandra took the help ofthe people of those countries to conquer Lanka and rescue Sita.Modern scholars have also concluded that the battle between the Kauravas and the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Pandavas took place 775 years after the victory of Ramacandra over Lanka. Therewere no major incidents during this period except the gradual expansion of theAryan kingdom. The Aryan ksatriyas lived in the province of Vidarbha, or Nagpur,which gradually became known as Maharastra. During that time the descendantsof Yadu extended their kingdom from Sauvira of Sindhu to Mahi smati Chedi ofNarmada to Mathura of Yamuna. During the same period the descendants of theSurya dynasty became extremely weak. King Maru of the Surya dynasty and KingDevapi of the Candra dynasty both left their ki n g d oms and went to the vill age ofKalapa (nearby Badarikasrama). Industry advanced, the position of cities andvillages gradually improved, the language of the Aryans was refined, many sacredplaces were established in non-Aryan provi nces, and Hastinapura was founded byKing Hasti on the bank of the Ganges27. With the permission of the demigods,King Kuru established the sacred place named Kuruksetra in the country ofBrahmarsi.The battle between the Kurus and the Pandavas was a major incident becausemany different kings of India gathered there, and after a fierce battle they attainedheaven. All the incidents of this battle are daily topics amongst Indians, so there isno need for any special mention of those incidents herein. It can only be said thatJarasandha, the King of Magadha, was killed by Bhima a short time before thebattle. The kingdom of Magadha was gradually and powerfully in c reasing.Jarasandha even tried to curtail the prestige of Hastinapura in order to in crease theprestige of Magadha. Although many ki ngs in the family line from Pariksit ru led akingdom in the vicinity of the Ganges and Yamuna, still, their ki n g dom was underthe jurisdiction of the King of Magadha. This is understood because only thenames of the subsequent kings of Magadha are prominent in the PuranasNow we will have to decide when the battle of Kur u k setra took place. MaharajaP ariksit was born just after the battle. From the birth of Pariksit up to t h ecoronation of Nandivardhana (the fifth of the Pradyotana kings) was 1,115years28. Conningham Sahib and others say that the word nandabhiseka in theprevious footnote verse from the Srimad Bhagavatam refers to the first of the nineNandas. But although the respected Sridhara Svami also accepts this, he says thenumber is irrelevant. Therefore we fearlessly accept this Nanda as Nandivardhana.Moreover, in the Ninth Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam it is stated that 20 kingsfrom the dynasty of Brhadratha, beginning from Ma rj ari up to Ri p u n j aya, woul drule for 1,000 years29. The names of those 20 kings are also given in the TwelfthCanto of the Srimad Bhagavatam The n, af.ter five Pradyotana kings rule for 138years and ten Sisunaga kings rule for 36Q years, the nine Nandas will rule for 100years. So if we refer to the first of the nine Nandas, it will be about 1,500 years; butif we deduct the 23 years of Nandivardhana's rule, then we have the correct figureof 1,115 years. Again3Q, in the Srimad Bhagavatam it is stated that during the reignof King Pariksit the constellation of the seven rsis took shelter in the naksatracalled Magha. When this constellation of the seven rsis crosses the naksatrasbeginning with Magha through Jyaistha, then the age of Kali will be 1,200 yearsold. If that constellation remains 1,200 years in nine naksatras, then the durationin each naksatra is 133 years 0 months. When the constellation of the seven sagesgoes to the Purvasadha-naksatra, another Nanda will become king; then theconstellation of the seven sages must have traveled through the eleven naksatras anadditional 19 years. If we add 360 years t h e d u r a t i o n of th e ten Sisunaga kings"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"rule t o t h e 1 , 138 years up to the end of Nandivardhana's rule, then the totalcomes to 1,998 years. Since the duration of the kings r ul e is equal to the durationof the movement of the seven rsis constellation, this further confir ms the previousstatements. On hearing the statement that the rsis will remain in t he Magha-naksatra for 100 years, many people may think that the rsis stay in each naksatrafor 100 years. But the seven rsis were to stay in the Magha-naksatra for 100 yearsfrom the time that Sukadeva was speaking to Pariksit. If we accept that beforeSukadeva spoke to Pariksit the rsis had already stayed in the Magha-naksatra for33 years 0 months, then there is no longer any doubt. Therefore it is correct to saythat up to the coronation of Nandivardhana was 1,115 years. After his rule, duringthe reign of the other Nandas, Kali became extremely promin ent. This is alsoconfirmed by practical observation. After the fifth generation, Ajatasatru becamethe king. During his reign, Sakyasimha preached Buddhism, in the form ofk nowledge of self-realization devoid of a conception of the Infallible [G o d ] 31. Th eNandas were like cowherd men and were envious of eternal religious principles.Asokavardhana even widely propagated Buddhism. Gradually various castes likeSundhas ruled the kingdom and created many obstacles in the path of religion.The total duration to the end of the nine Nandas' rule was 1,598 years. CanakyaPandita killed the last of the Nandas and gave the kingdom to the ki ngs of theMaurya dynasty. According to some opinions, King Dasaratha, and according toothers, Candragupta was the first king of the Maurya dynasty. During the time ofCandragupta, people from Greece visited India first with Al e x andra and later withSeleucus. According to the opini ons of Greek literature, the great dynasties fromS imhala, and the Buddhist history of Brahma-desa, Candragupta took the thron e215 years before Christ. From this calculation it may be understood that the battleof Kuruksetra took place 3,791 years ago from today. Dr. Bentley Sahib calculatedthe position of the stars mentioned in the Mahabharata and decided that the battleof Kuruksetra took place 1,829 years before Christ. When we compare hiscalculation with m ine th ere is a difference of 89 years. So either Bentley Sahibmade a mistake or the 1,000 years duration of the Barhadrathas' rule was anapproximation that we have to deduct 89 years from. The future swanlike scholarscan determine the correct figures after further research.The Mauryas ruled their kin gdom for ten generations. It is said in the SrimadBhagavatam that the total duration of their rule was 137 years. Asokavardhana wasthe most powerful of the Mauryas. He was Aryan at first, but later he became aB uddhist. He then established many Buddhist pillars throughout I n d ia. Du r ing hi sreign, eight Yavana kings such as Diodotos, Demetrios, and Eucratides captured aportion of India on the western side of the Sindhu River. It has not beenestablished in which dynasty the Maurya kings were born32. They were perhapsb orn in the dynasty of the Mayuras, who resided near the Rohita Mountain on th ewestern bank of the Vitasta River. Actually they did belong to any of the fourstandard castes. From the way they maintained their relationship with th e Yavanasit appears they were from an insignificant class of the Saka caste. It is alsounderstood that before the Yavanas' arrival, the Mauryas established their kingdomat either Mayurapura or Haridvara and called themselves Aryans. The nameMaurya came from the name Mayurapura. Just prior to the Mauryas' rule, the nineNandas lived on the western side of the Sindhu River, at the place known asAvabrtya, or Arabaita. Perhaps the Nandas resembled cowherd men, because in the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Srimad Bhagavatam they are called Vrsala. Also, the seven subordinate kings weredescribed as Abhiras, or cowherds.As far as the kingdom of Magadha is concerned, the Sundha dynasties captured thethrone just after the Mauryas' rule. They then ruled the kin g dom for 112 years.A mong them, first Puspamitra, and then Agnim i tra extended their kin g dom f r o mMagadha up to Panca-nada. In order to tactfully make friendship with th e Ar y an s,they then started harassing the Buddhists in the city of Sakala, of the Madraprovince. They announced that whoever brings the head of a Buddhist sannyasiwould be rewarded with a hun d red coins. After them the kings of the Kanvadynasty ruled Magadha. There were four kings of the Kanva dynasty who rul edMagadha for a total of 05 years. The duration of their rule is described in theSrimad Bhagavatam as lasting 395 years, but in the Visnu Purana it is said thatV asudeva ruled for 9 years, Bhumimi tra ruled for 10 years, ¹ r a y a n a r u le d for 12years, and Susarma ruled for 10 years. From this it appears that the statement inthe Srimad Bhagavatam may be incorrect. Unfortunately, Sridhara Svami alsoaccepted this incorrect statement. Anyway, at this point let us accept that theopinion of the author of the Bhagavatam is W5 years. After the Kanva dynasty, thedynasty of Andhra ruled Magadha for 956 years. The last king of this dynasty wasSalomadhi. The rule of the Andhra dynasty ended in 035 A.D .Among these non-Aryan kings, no one could be accepted as the emperor. Only thekingdom of Asokavardhana was particularly large. There is no doubt that th eSundhas and Kanvas were like plunderers of the Sidhia province. The varioustypes of coins that have been found buried in pl aces like Kabul, Punjab, andHindusthan are marked with the signs of the Greek Yavanas and various castesfrom the Sidhia province. Coins marked with the names of Haviska, Kaniska, andVasudeva have been found in the province of Mathura. From this it is believed thatthose people ruled Mathura for some time. From the time of these kings [Haviska,Kaniska, and Vasudeva] the calendar known as Samvat was introduced. After KingVikramaditya defeated the Sakas by his prowess he became known as Sakari, orenemy of the Sakas, and it is sometimes said that he introduced the Samvatcalendar. This statement, however, is difficult to believe, because the writers of thePuranas mentioned the names of the kings who ruled the first five hund red yearsof the Samvat calendar but did not in c l ude Vi k r a m aditya s name. If Vikramaditya,the King of Ujjain, had actually ruled at that time, the writ ers of the Puranas wouldhave certainly glorified him. It is th erefore understood that many ki ngs ruledunder the name Vikramaditya. The Vikramaditya who ru led Ujj ain became king inthe year 592 A.D. In the first century after Jesus Christ in the city of Sravasti therewas a Vikramaditya who was an enemy of the Buddhists. King Salibahana was arespectable king from Daksinatya. The Sakabda calendar, which he intr o d u ced,was widely accepted in the South. It is said that in 78 A.D. King Salibahanaharassed the Sakas and established a city named Salibahanapura in the Punjabprovince. Again it is stated that Salibahana had his capital in a place known asPathana on the bank of the Narmada. Therefore the actual life history of these twokings [Salibahana and Vikramaditya] is still un clear.Nimicakra came in the sixth generation after King Pariksit. He left Hastinapuraa nd resided at Kusambi, or Kausikipu ri. The Pandu dynasty continued up to K i n gK semaka, who comes in the twenty-second generation from N i m i c a k r a .The Surya dynasty ended with King Do l angula Sumitra, who appeared in the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"twenty-eighth generation after King Brhadbala. Therefore after the reign ofNandivardhana both the Candra and Surya dynasties ended. Kings like the nineNandas, who became prominent afterwards, were all outcastes. The kings of theTailanga province of Andhra thereafter conquered and ruled Magadha. It seemsthat they were from the Chola dynasty, because when the kings of Andhra rul edMagadha the Chola kings were ruling the city of Varangala in Andhra. It is verydifficult to confirm w h e t her or not th e Ch ola ki ngs were Aryans, but due to theirbehavior and absence of any relationship with the Surya and Candra dynasties it isassumed that they were outcastes. The Chola kings were originally from the city ofKancinagara of the Dravida province. They gradually expanded their kin g dom upto the banks of the Ganges. When Parasurama lived in the South, he establishednew brahmana and ksatriya communi t i e s, including the Cholas. Anyway, the kingsof the Andhra dynasty are mentioned in the PuranasIn the 772 years from 935 A.D. up to 1206 A.D., when the Moham m edan rul eb egan, no emperor ruled the whole of Ind ia. During this time many small ki n g sruled different provinces of India. Many Aryan and mixed caste people becamevery powerful in Kanyakubja, Kashmir, Gujarat, Kalinjara, and Gauda. The Rajputsof Kanyakubja and Palas from Gauda-desa became equally powerful. The kin gsfrom the Pala dynasty ruled their ki n g dom and accepted the title of Cakravarti.During this time King Vi k r a m adi tya of Ujjain studied many sciences.H arsavardhana and Visaladeva were also equally strong. I am not wr i t in g t h ehistory of those dynasties, as this book would then become too volum i n o us. So Istop here. In brief, the Rajput kings who eventually succeeded the kings of theSurya and Candra dynasties were more or less modern. The writers of the Puranasd id not glorify them very mu ch 3 3 .The Mohammedans ruled over India from 1206 A.D. to 1757 A.D., when they wered riven away by the Englishmen. During the Moh a m m edan rule India fell in t oinauspiciousness. Temples were destroyed, the Aryan blood was polluted invarious ways, the standard of varnasrama dharm-a was diminished, and thediscussion of ancient Aryan history was almost stopped.At present, under the rule of the English, the Aryans are living more peacefullyand prosperously. Vedic history and the glories of the Aryans are again beingdiscussed. There is no longer fear of temples being destroyed. In brief, we havebeen delivered from a great calamity.The modern scholars have discussed whatever incidents I have mentioned so fara nd divided the history of India into eight periods, as illustrated in the follow i n gchart.Rulingdynasty's namePrajapatisMeaning of the nameRule of sagesDuration ofrule in yearsBeginningdate%063 B.C.ManusDemigodsdescendantsRule of Svayambhuva Manu andVaivasvataRule of Indra and othersRule of Vaivasvata andRule of the Abhiras, Sakas,Yavanas, Khasas, and Andhrasdescendants1233798 B.C.Outcastes"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"BratyaRule of the new Aryan castesRule of the Patans and Moghuls935A.D.1206 A.D.MohammedansRule of the British3%BritishI have given only a hint about the rule of In dia according to modern calculation.Now I will present the modern opin ion regarding the scriptures written by th eAryans. During the rule of the Prajapatis there were no scriptures written. Therewere only a few pleasing words. In the beginning there was only pranava; writtenscript was not yet introduced. There was only one syllable with anusvara added toit (om). When the Manus' rule began, other syllables, such as tat sat, appeared.During the rule of the demigods, ancient mantras were composed by joining smallwords together. The performance of sacrifices began at this time. Gradually ancientpoetic meters like Gayatri appeared. Caksusa Manu appeared in the eighthgeneration from Svayambhuva Manu. It is said that Lord Matsya appeared duringhis reign and delivered the Vedas. Perhaps during this time many poetic metersand verses of the Vedas w ere composed, but all these were only in sound vibration,not written. They were passed on by hearing. After the Veda had remained in thisunwritten state for a long time and the number of verses gradually increased, itbecame difficult to grasp. At that time the sages, headed by Katyayana andAsvalayana, made memorizing the sutras of the one Veda easier by composingthem after careful consideration. Still, many other mantras were composed afterthis. When the one Veda became greatly expanded, then Vyasadeva, after dulyc onsidering the subjects, divided the Veda into four and wr ote them in bo o kform35. This took place a few years before King Yudhisthira s reign. ThenVyasadeva s disciples divided those words among themselves36. Those rsis, whowere disciples of Vyasadeva, then divided the four Vedas into different branches sothat people could easily study them37. It should be now un d erstood that the Rg,Sama, and Yajur Vedas are the most widely respected and quoted38. It seems thatall the ancient verses were compiled in these three Vedas. But we cannot neglectthe Atharva Veda due to considering it modern, because in the Brhad arany-akaUpanisad (0.5.11) the following verse is found: asya mahato bhutasya nisvasitametad yad rg vedo y-aj ur vedah -sama vedo t-harvangirasa itihasah puranam vidyaupanisadah slokah sutranyanuvyakhyananyasyai vaitani sarvani nisvasitani\"TheRg Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, and Atharva Veda, the Itihasas, or histories, thePuranas, the Upanisads, the slokas, or mantras chanted by the brahmanas, thesutras, or accumulations of Vedic statements, as well as vidya, transcendentalknowledge, and the explanations of the sutras and mantras are all emanations fromthe breathing of the great Personality of Godhead.\" The Brhad aranyak-a cannot beconsidered modern because it was composed before the writings of Vyasadeva.In the above-mentioned verse there is a description of the histories and Puranas,which are both Vedic literatures that contain ancient topics similar to those foundin the Vedas. Whatever arguments Jaimini Rsi presented in order to establish theVedas as eternal are all for the benefit of the neophytes. Swanlike personalitiesshould accept the purport of swanlike Jaimini s teachings. The purport of hi steachings is as follows: All tru ths discovered are related to the Supreme Lord,therefore they are eternal. Those who describe the Vedic truths as temporary byciting the examples kikata, naicasaka, and pramangada are not aspiring to"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"understand the truth. This is Jaimini s conclusion.Now I will establish the dating of the smrti sastras according to the opinion ofmodern scholars. Manu-samhita is the first and foremost of all smrtis T.here is noe vidence that the Manu-samhita was written during the time of Manu. W hen M a n ubecame a prominent ruler, the Prajapatis had him establish and live in a citynamed Barhismati, just outside Brahmavarta, so that his sons would remain aseparate class. From that time on the Prajapatis called themselves brahmanas andaccepted the Manus as ksatriyas In .this way castes other than brahmanas wereintroduced. Manu also gave due respect to the brahmanas and arranged for thedifferent occupational duties of the different castes with the help of rsis such asBrghu. The rsis approved Manu's arrangement. At the time, however, the variousoccupational duties were not wri t ten down. Later, when the brahmanas andksatriyas fought, Parasurama appointed someone from the Bhrgu dynasty whoknew those arrangements to write everything down in th e form of verses. Theduties suitable for vaisyas and sudras were also included. About 600 years after theb attle of Kuruksetra the present Manu scriptures were written down w it h t h eassistance of another Parasurama, whose position was similar to the originalParasurama. That more recent Parasurama had appeared in the dynasty of theAryans and lived in a southern provin ce. There is a calendar that was begun fromthe time of his birth still cu r r ent in t hat pr o v i n ce. This calendar began 1176 B.C.B ased on this calendar, Respected Prasanna Kumar Thakura wrote in th eintroduction of his book, Vivada cinta-mani, that the scriptures of the Manus werefirst written at that time. This is wrong, however, for we find references to theManu scriptures in the Chandogya sruti39. The original Parasurama was acontemporary of Ramacandra. There is no doubt that dur ing his time brahmanasand ksatriyas entered into an alliance after establishing the system of varnasramaBut in the scriptures of the Manus it is stated that the two oceans were the bordersof Aryavarta, and there are references to a few castes, such as Cina, who existedhalfway through the Manus' reign. Therefore it is to be concluded that thesel iteratures were expanded at a later date. The conclusion is that the wri t ing of th eManu scriptures was begun from the time of Manu and conti n ued up to 1 176 B.C.Other religious scriptures were written in various other countries before or afterthis period.Although the Ramayana is counted as poetry, it can also be called a history. It waswritten by Valmiki Rsi, who was a contemporary of Ramacandra. We don t feelthat the current Ramayana was written by Valmiki a lo n e. By considering theconversation between ¹ r a d a an d V a l m ik i an d th e recitation of the Ramayana inRamacandra s assembly by Luva and Kusa, it is understood that Valmiki c o m p o sedmany of the verses glorifying the characteristics of Ramacandra in the Ramayana,b ut after some time one scholar elaborated on Valmiki's work. I t h in k t h a t t h epresent day Ramayana was propagated after the composition of the Mahabharata,because while chastising Jabali, Ramacandra accused him of being polluted by theSakya philosophy00. It is felt that the present day Ramayana was written around500 B.C. It is said that the Mahabharata was composed by Vyasadeva, and there isno objection to this. But it cannot be accepted that the Vyasa who divided theVedas and received the title Vedavyasa at the time of Yudhisthira was the sameVyasa. The reason for this is that in the Mahabharata there are descriptions ofkings such as Janmejaya, who ruled after Yudhisthira. There are specific references"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"about the Manu scriptures in the Mahabharata, therefore the present dayMahabharata must have been written some time after 1000 B.C01. From this itappears that Vedavyasa first made a draft of the Mahabharata, and later on anotherVyasa elaborated on it and presented that under the name of Mahabharata O n elearned scholar from the sudra commun ity named Lomaharsana recitedMahabharata before the sages at Naimisaranya. Perhaps he created the present dayMahabharata, because during his time the original 2,%00 verses that were writtenby Vyasadeva were expanded to 100,000 verses. Now we have to consider whenLomaharsana lived. It is stated that he was killed by Baladeva. From this incident itis to be understood that if one becomes a learned devotee, he should be respectedas a brahmana even if he is a sudra Th.e Vaisnava community of that time createdthis incident in order to confirm t hi s statement. Actually that assembly gatheredlong after the time of Baladeva. The Lomaharsana who is said to be Vyasadeva'sdisciple may not have even been the speaker of that assembly. MaybeLomaharsana, the disciple of Vyasadeva, was killed while speaking on Vedichistory during the time of Baladeva. Much later, even after the conversationbetween Janmejaya and Vaisampayana, a person named Sauti recited MahabharataThe previous incident was then connected to that recitation in the course of time.Since there is no special mention of Buddha in the Ma habharata it is understoodthat Mahabharata was recited by Sauti92 before the reign of Ajatasatru and afterthe reign of Brhadratha's descendants. If we study the descriptions ofNaimisaranya, then we come to know that when the peaceful rsis saw the end ofthe Candra and Surya dynasties, they felt unprotected due to the absence ofksatriyas Ther.efore they went to the secluded Naimisaranya and passed their livesdiscussing the scriptures. There is one more belief about the assembly ofNaimisaranya. For some time after the battle of Kuruk setra and before thecoronation of King Nandivardhana the Vaisnava religion was very promin ent. Th emain conclusion of the Vaisnavas is that every living entity has a right to cult i v atespiritual life. But according to the opinion of the brahmanas, persons of castesother than brahmana are ineligible for liberation. Sober persons of other castes maybe born again as brahmanas to endeavor for liberation. Because of these twoconflicting opinions, the Vaisnavas highly regarded the scholars of Suta Gosvami sline and thus established them at Naimisaranya as superior to the brahmanasSome of the brahmanas there who were less qualified and controlled by wealth alsoaccepted the scholars of Suta s line as superior. Those less qualified brahmanasdefied the doctrines of karma kanda a-nd accepted Suta as their spiritual master.They took shelter of Vaisnava religious principles, which are the only means ofcrossing the influence of Kali, the abode of sin93. Anyway, that assembly gatheredlong after the battle of Kuruksetra. There is no doubt about thi s.The Darsana sastras, -philosophical scriptures, were compiled a short time after thecompilation of the Mahabharata Th e re are .six prominent phi l o s ophical systemscurrent in Indi a N y a y a , o r l o g ic ; Sankhya; Patanjala, or yoga; Kanada, orVaisesika; Purva-mimamsa, or Karma-mimamsa; and Uttara-mimamsa, or Vedanta.All these philosophical systems were introduced after Buddhism. The rsis whopropounded these systems first composed these philosophies in sutras The Ved.icsutras were compiled to facilitate easy remembrance, but this was not the case withthe sutras of these philosophical systems. When the brahmanas were attacked bythe mighty Buddhist philosophy, they first compiled the Upanisads, which are the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"pinnacle of Vedic literature, and thus strengthened their doctrine with l o gic andargument. The Buddhists gradually presented many philosophical systems such asSaugata, Madhyamika, and Yogacara. Soon afterwards they entered into intensedebate with the brahmanas T.he brahmanas then introduced their six phil o s ophicalsystems, beginning with Ny aya and Sankhya, keeping them in the form of sutrasand passing them on only to th eir disciples. During the time of Ramacandra someVedic logic in the form of An v i k s iki was composed by Gautama Rsi and wascurrent at that time. According to their needs, the brahmanas composed thepresent system of Nyaya under Gautama's name and substituted it for the previoussystem. In Gautama's sutras there is a tendency to counter the Saugataphilosophy00. The scriptures of Kanada come under the category of Nyayascriptures. In the system of Sankhya there are also many statements againstBuddhism. The system of Patanjala falls under the category of Sankhya. The Purva-mimamsa propounded by Jaimini supports the karma kan-da system that wasrejected by the Buddhists. Although Vedanta scriptures are the most recent, theyhave been accepted as another form of Anv i k s i ki , since they are based on theUpanisads Th.erefore all philosophical scriptures were written in the 800 yearsbetween %00 B.C. to 000 A.D.The Puranas were compiled after the Darsana sast-ras, or philosophical scriptures.The Puranas that are mentioned in the Mahabharata and Brhad aran-yaka Upanisadare composed of Vedic stories. There are eighteen in all. The Markendeya Purana isthe oldest, because there is no mention of fu t ure ki ngs in it. The Ma r k e ndeyaPurana contains explanations of the Dharma sastr-as, glorifications of the sun-godand goddess Durga, and elimination of doubts regarding the Mahabharata T h e .story of King Suratha of the Caitra dynasty is also given. From this it is understoodthat the Markendeya Purana may have been written after the kings of the Citranagadynasty of Chotanagapura were defeated by the Kolas [Cholas]. This is confirmedby the word kolavidvamsinah At th.at time the brahmanas and ksatriyas created byParasurama were very prominent in I n d ia. Therefore it has been concluded thatthis Purana was written after 500 A.D. Among the other Puranas, the Visnu Puranais the most respected. It was compiled just after the Markendeya Purana Th e re .isno doubt that the Visnu Purana was composed by a South Indian scholar because itis stated therein that people should begin their meal with tasty preparations andfinish with bitter preparations. This practice is current in South In d ia. The authorof the Visnu Purana has mentioned in his book the particular system of eatingfound in his own prov i n ce. The Aryans, however, ate sweets at the end of theirmeal. The Visnu Purana was written about 600 A.D. Other Puranas like the Padmaand Skanda Puranas were written around 800 A.D., because those Puranas containdiscussions of modern philosophies%5. These Puranas were written afterSankaracarya preached his philosophy of advaita vada, or -monism. In hiscommentary, he quotes verses from the Visnu Purana, so it is believed that VisnuPurana was written before his time.Now we will consider the modern scholars view on the date of the appearance ofSrimad Bhagavatam, the jewel of all scriptures. Not understanding our statements,third-grade people may lose all faith and consider this scripture a recent work.Therefore they should not read this section. Actually Srimad Bhagavatam is not arecent book. It is eternal and ancient like the Vedas. Respected Sridhara Svami hasconfirmed the eternality of the Bhagavatam by using the words tarankurah sajj anih"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Srimad Bhagavatam has been accepted as the supreme fruit of the Vedic desiretree96. From pranava (om) came Gayatri, from Gayatri came the Vedas, from theVedas came the Brahma s-utras, and from the Brahma s-utras came SrimadBhagavatam T.his Paramahamsa s-amhita consists of inconceivable topics inrelation with the Supreme Truth that have brightly risen in the form of a sat ci-dananda sun after being reflected through the samadhi of the author. Those whohave eyes should see, those who have ears should hear, and those who have amind should meditate on the topics of Srimad Bhagavatam P.eople who areinfected by the blindness of partiality are deprived of the sweet taste of SrimadBhagavatam Le.t the supremely conscious Lord be merciful by destroying theirblindness.Srimad Bhagavatam has no birth because it is eternal, without beginning or end.N evertheless it is extremely desirable to ascertain when, where, and by whom t h i sliterature was manifested according to modern opin i on. M o d ern scholars haveconcluded that Vyasadeva wrote Srimad Bhagavatam on the bank of the SarasvatiRiver under the instructions of ¹ r a d a M u n i , t h e k n o w e r of th e tr u th .

Those great personalities who wrote thescriptures were all known as Vyasas, and they were all respected by people ingeneral. In this regard, the title Vyasa indicates all Vyasas, beginning fromVedavyasa up to the Vyasa who wrote Srimad Bhagavatam Whe.n he was unable toascertain the Absolute Truth after studying all the scriptures, then Vyasadeva, whois expert in the spiritual science, withdrew his mind and speech from thoseliteratures, realized the Truth th r o ugh samadhi, and then wrote the SrimadBhagavatam The m.odern scholars also say that Srimad Bhagavatam appeared inDravida-desa (South India) about 1,000 years ago. The living entity has a naturalinclination for being attached to his native place. Therefore even greatpersonalities have this inclination to some extent. Due to the glorification found inthe Srimad Bhagavatam of Dravida-desa, which is not very ancient, it appears thatVyasadeva was a native of that place07. If the glories of Dravida-desa werementioned in other scriptures, then we would have no right to give thisconclusion. Our conclusion is further confi r med by the mention of a very recentholy place in the Srimad Bhagavatam't8 It is st.ated in the Venkata mahatm-ya,which is popular in the South, that Venkata-tirtha was established whenLaksmidevi went to Kolapura from Ch o la. Kolapura is situated to the south ofSatara. The Chalukya kings defeated the Cholas in the eight century andestablished a large kingdom in that pr ov i n ce. Therefore Laksmi went to Ko l apur aand Venkata was established at that time. For this reason, they do not hesitate toaccept that Srimad Bhagavatam was written in the nin th c entur y. Sathakopa,Yamunacarya, and Ramanujacarya vigorously preached Vaisnavism in the tenthcentury. They were also from Dravida-desa. They all highly respected SrimadBhagavatam, so we cannot accept that Srimad Bhagavatam was written after theninth century. Furtherm ore, when Sridhara Svami wrote his commentary on th eSrimad Bhagavatam in the eleventh century, there were already a fewcommentaries like Hanumad bhasya av-ailable. So there is no need to furtherconsider this matter.

There is no need to analyze all the scriptures of the Aryans.There were many other ancient scriptures studied by the Aryans. After consideringthe views of Playfair Sahib, Mahatma Archdikan Prat Sahib has decided thatastrology was current in Aryavarta 1000 years before the beginning of Kali-yuga.Prior to that the Vedas existed in the form of sruti, or hearing. Wilf o rd Sahib hasd etermined that the Vedic astrologer Parasara Rsi wrote his astrology book in 139 1B.C. According to the opinion of Davis Sahib, this is confirmed in a verse of theAtharva Veda Bu.t the possibility that this verse on astrology in the Atharva Vedawas later added on was not considered by Wil f ord Sahib. According to ouropinion, Archdikan Prats calculation is more acceptable, because the stars namedafter the seven rsis were originally named after the Prajapatis. Since there was nowritten language at that time, astrology was expressed through various signs. Inthis way, medicine, in the form of ayurveda, was practiced since very ancienttimes. If we consider all these things, this book will become volum i n o us, so westop here. We have described the various books that directly and indi r ectly explainthe spiritual science in the following chart.Name of scriptureTime period when preachedDuring Prajapatis' reignPranava Eom].

Swanlike people are not interested in quarre150,therefore if some contrary conclusion is presented with proper argument, we will accept it. We hopeto hear further on these conclusions from future transcendentalists or intelligent materialists.According to our scriptures, the calculation of the dates are not like this. Webelieve only the statements of the scriptures. I have presented the modernconclusions for the benefit of the concerned people. According to them th ebeginning of the Aryans' rule in In dia was 6,3%1 years ago. We have thusestablished the incomparably long history of In d ia. No other civil i zation cancompare with it. It is said that Egypt, or Mi sore, is a very ancient country. It isestimated from the descriptions of Menit ho, a historian from M i s o re, that peoples tarted living in that country in 3 553 B.C. The name of their first king was Mi n i s .It is calculated that his rule began when Hariscandra was ruling India. The strangething is this: There was a king named Maniscandra who was a contemporary of"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Hariscandra. It may be noted how similar the names Maniscandra and Minis are. Itis also said that King Minis came to Egypt from some eastern country. The greatpyramid was created by the Suphu dynasty. A king named Hiksas from the eastattacked Egypt about 2000 B.C., or about two hu n d red years before the battle ofKuruksetra. A religion similar to varnasrama d-harma was previously practiced inEgypt. From these facts it appears there was some kind of connection betweenEgypt and India. Let future scholars research more about this. According to th eopinion of the Hebrews, their kingdom was created around 0000 B.C., probablyfrom the time of King Sravasta. It is difficult, however, to prove these thingsnowadays. When the situation of the Hebrews and Misore LEgypt] is such, there isn o need to mention other races. Descriptions of incidents prior to the time of Ki n gMinis of Egypt are uncommon. The 1,000 year life history of Adam of the Hebrewsh as become the subject of discussion for the thir d -grade people of that country .Modern scholars of India compare his life-span with the seventy-one maha-yugalife-span of a Manu or the 1,000 year life-span of Dasaratha. Swanlike peopleshould not think t hat we are trying to establish India as the oldest country in or d erto increase its prestigious position. Since swanlike Vaisnavas see all people asequal, they accept whatever truth is substantiated regarding the age of the differentThe previous history of India and the age of the various scriptures are thusdescribed according to the modern scholars opi n i on . Everyone has a right todecide whether or not these should be accepted as facts. The advancement ofV aisnavism does not depend on this type of conclusion. We know t h a tVaisnavism, the Vedas, and devotional scriptures such as the Srimad Bhagavatamare eternal. Now I will tr y to d i s cuss the development and advancement ofspiritual knowledge from the time of its appearance up to the present. Thec onstitution duty of the liv ing entity is to in q u ire into the Absolute Tru th. W eh ave to accept that these eternal duties accompany the creation of the livin gentities51. In the beginning these eternal duties were self-manifested in the undeveloped state ofconsidering the Lord and the living entity as one. At that time specific differences between the Lordand the living entity had not yet been established and the knot of devotion for the Lord had not yetbeen tied52. This spiritual perception of oneness between the Lord and the living entity was currentfor a long time. But the sunlike truth does not like to be covered forever by the cloud of ignoranceand illusion. From time to time the rsis have revived the living entities' constitutional duties byintroducing various methods like sacrifice, austerity, worship, self-control, peacefulness, tolerance,and charity53. A long time ago people rejected the idea of oneness with the Lord and began toengage in mundane fruitive activities. Falling from one illusion into another appears to beadvancement for a person in illusion. But within a short time this illusion is dispelled. When theAryans considered the insignificant and adverse results of fruitive activities, they turned their mindstowards liberation54. But that also is simply dry and fruitless. The truth certainly prevails, however,even if it takes time. Later, when the incomparable truth appeared in the hearts of the Aryans, theform of ecstatic love became clear to them55. The swanlike Vaisnavas have ascertained thefollowing subjects regarding the living entities' eternal duties. They may have changed in the courseof time.races.1. Paramatma t h e s u p e r c onscious sunlike personality, who is eternally full ofknowledge and bliss. Jivatma t h e m i n u t e l y c o n s cious rays of the supreme sun.2. The superconscious Lord is different from the mi n u t ely conscious livingentities, who are the superior eternal energy of the Lord. The living enti ties areindividual, and they reside in different environm ents according to theirqualification. The material world is an emanation from the superconscious Lord.3. The material world is a perverted reflection of the spiritual wo r ld. The pure bliss"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"of the spiritual world is pervertedly reflected as the happiness and distress of thematerial world.0. The living entities have no relationship with the material wor ld. The materialworld is the residence for only the conditi oned souls. By the inconceivable energyof the Lord, the conditioned souls are encaged in material bodies. Some areabsorbed in material happiness, and some endeavor for spiritual happiness.5. The natural tendency for attachment to the Lord is the constituti onal duty of aliving entity. In condi t i o nal li fe, this constituti onal duty is transformed intoa ttachment for material enjoyment. This is a lamentable condition of li f e .6. Liberation means being situated in the constituti onal position of one sconstitutional duties. This is attained through devotional service.7. According to one s qualification, the cultivation of constitu t i o nal du t ies varies.It may be either direct or indi r ect.8. Direct cultivation aims at realizing one s constitutional position; there is nopossibility of other results.9. Indirect cultivation results in irr elevant fruits related with one s material body.10. Samadhi, or full absorption in the Supreme, is the primary and direct means ofcultivation. Activities such as bodily maintenance that are meant to help attainsamadhi are called primary indi r ect cultivation .11. It is the living entity s eternal duty to cult i v ate Krsna consciousness followingin the mood of the residents of Vraja through samadhi, because this is the mostdesirable goal.12. The most glorious activity of a living entity is to engage according to one squalification in discussions of the conjugal mellows enjoyed by Krsna, thepersonification of sweetness.Among these twelve items, the first four concern the living entity s relationshipwith the Lord. Items five to ten concern the living entity s duties, and the last twoconcern the supreme goal.During the reigns of the Prajapatis, Manus, and demigods, the science of one srelationship with the Lord remained in the form of a seed. They only consideredthat there was a worshipable personality who should be kept happy. This isunderstood from the pranava and Gayatri mantras. At that time there was somedebate between karmis and jnanis over the duties of the living entities. A fewpersonalities like Sanaka and Sanatana completely neglected pravrtti marga-, thepath of increasing material prosperity, while the Prajapatis, Manus, and demigodsl ike Indra desired to satisfy Hari by advancing in material prosperity thr ough th eperformance of sacrifices. As a result, the thought of heaven and hell entered theirminds. At that time the pure state of the living entities, the search for liberation,and, ultimately, love of God were unkn o wn . In th e later part of Vaivasvata Manu'sreign, when the smrtis and histories were introduced, people began considering thescience of self-realization and the goal of life56. But it does not appear that therewas any progress made towards the goal of life. During the reign of the Outcastesand the brahmanas and ksatriyas created by Parasurama there was particulara dvancement made in understanding one s relationship with the L o rd, th eactivities in cultivating that relationship, and the attainment of life s goal, as foundin the Puranas and philosophical scriptures57. The complete discussion of thesethree truths is found in the Srimad Bhagavatam, and the conclusions are clearlypresented. But the Srimad Bhagavatam is like an ocean, and it is extremely difficult"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"for a madhyama adhikari to ascertain what part contains which jewels. Afterconsidering this, the most merciful disciple of Sathakopa, Sri Ramanujacarya,compiled the essential truths of Vaisnavism for the first time. Some time beforethat, Sri Sankaracarya wrote a commentary on the Vedanta s-utras and thusextended the cultivation of kn o w l e dge so far that Bhaktidev>58 became surprisedand full of anxiety. She hid herself within the core of the devotees' hearts. Wecannot blame Sankaracarya, for he was a devotee of the Lord and benefactor of all.We therefore offer our obeisances unto him. He had a reason to engage in suchwork at that particular time. Everyone knows that about 500 B.C. a great soulnamed Gautama took birth in th e family of Sakas in the village of Kapilavastu. Hepreached the principles ofj nana ka-nda so vigorously that the religious principle sof varnasrama dh-arma established by the Aryans were almost destroyed. TheBuddhist philosophy that he preached became like a thorn in the side for all theAryans ancient practices. With the help of Kaniska, Haviska, and Vasudeva of theSidia dynasty, Buddhism gradually crossed Punjab and extended to variouscountries like China, Tatara, and Trivarta, which are situated north of th eHimalayas. In the South, King Asokavardhana vigorously preached Buddhism inBrahma-desa and Sri Lanka. Under the patronage of Asokavardhana, Buddhismwas gradually spread throughout In dia by the disciples of Sariputra, Modgalayana,Kasyapa, and Ananda. The holy places of the Aryans were converted into holyplaces for Buddhists. All signs of brahminical culture practically disappeared. Inthe seventh century, when this disaster was no longer tolerable, the brahmanasbecame very angry and conspired together to destroy Buddhism. At that ti me, byprovidence, the most learned and intelligent Sankaracarya became the commander-in-chief of the brahmanas in Kasi. By discussing his activities, it appears he was ani ncarnation of Parasurama. There are many differing opini ons regarding his birth .His brahmana followers accept him as the son of Mahadeva. Actually his widowmother was from Dravida-desa, but she moved to Kasi out of a desire to live in thatholy place. Swanlike persons do not care about faults pertaining to a person'sbirth, because a person s greatness is judged according to his advancement inVaisnavism. ¹ r a d a , V y a sa, Jesus, and Sankara have all become respectedthroughout the world by the qualities of their wo rk. Th ere is no argument. But Ih ave mentioned Sankaracarya at this time to illu strate a point. That is, from th eseventh century, keen and powerful in t el l igence was found among the people ofSouth India, and nowhere else. From that time on, Sankaracarya, Sathakopa,Yamunacarya, Ramanuja, Visnusvami, Madhvacarya, and many other great learnedscholars appeared as shining stars in the southern sky. Sankaracarya was notsatisfied with his brahmana followers, so he introduced ten types of sannyasis, suchas Giri, Puri, and Bharati. With the help of these sannyasis physical and mentalstrength, Sankaracarya converted the brahmanas w ho were attached to fruitiveactivities and prepared himself for vanquishing the Buddhists. Wherever he failedto convert the Buddhists to his philosophy, he engaged ¹ g a s , n a ked sannyasis,who took the help of weapons such as spears. Ultimately he wrote a commentaryon Vedanta, and thus he combined the karma kanda of -the brahmanas with thej nana kanda of -the Buddhists. In this way he united both groups. After that, all theBuddhist temples and deities were converted into Vedic. Out of fear of beingbeaten, as well as by realizing the insignificance of their religious practices, theBuddhists helplessly accepted the authority of the brahmanas Th o se Bu.ddhists"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"who hated being converted took the remnants of their cult and fled to Sri Lankaand Brahma-desa (Burma). The old Buddhists took Lord Buddha's tooth and wentto Sri Lanka from Jagannatha Puri. They left Buddha, his teachings, and hisassociation in Jagannatha Puri. Later these three were identified as Jagannatha,Baladeva, and Subhadra. In the fifth century a scholar from Ch ina named Phahiyanvisited Jagannatha Puri and joyfully w r ote that Buddhism was present there in apure state and there was no torture by the brahmanas A.fter this incident, in theseventh century, another Chinese scholar named Huyensam went to JagannathaPuri and wrote that the tooth of Lord Bud dha had been taken to Sri Lanka and thebrahmanas had totally polluted Puri. When we discuss these incidents, theactivities of Sankaracarya appear astonishing. Sankaracarya has, to some extent,done a favor to India by evicting Buddhism. He helped stop the gradualdeterioration of the ancient Aryan comm u n i ty . In p a r t i c u l ar, he changed thec ourse of the Aryans' mentality by in t r o d u c ing a new method of th o u ght on th e i rscriptures. He even inspired in them an urge to consider new subjects with theirintelligence. The flower of devotion in the devotees hearts became unsteady as itfloated in the current of Sankaracarya's arguments. Based on the strength ofSankaracarya s philosophy, Ramanujacarya, by the mercy of the Lord, wr ote acommentary that differed from Sariraka bha-sya Thu.s the strength and prosperityof Vaisnavism again increased. Within a short time Visnusvami, Nim b arka, andMadhvacarya all introduced slight variations of the Vaisnava principles bypresenting their own comm entaries on Vedanta. But they all followed the footstepsof Sankaracarya. Like Sankaracarya, they all wrote commentaries on the Bhagavad-gIta, Visnu saha-sra nama-, and the Upanisads At th.at time a thought arose in thehearts of people, that in order to establish a sampradaya one must havecommentaries on the four above-mentioned works. From these four Vaisnavas, thefour Vaisnava sampradayas, such as the Sri-sampradaya, have been introduced.Among the previously mentioned twelve truths, the first ten were particularlyaccepted by the four sampradayas. The last two truths were accepted to someextent by the Madhva, Nimbarka, and Visnusvami sampradayas.Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared in Navadvipa in 1%86. In the beginning of Hislife, He remained at home. Later He accepted the renounced order of life andpreached knowledge of the last two items. Where is the doubt that the land ofBengal is rarely attained even by the demigods> Who does not know that the sonof Sacs, who is supremely worshipable by Vaisnavas, descended in the land ofBengal and distributed matchless wealth to one and all> Fortunately we were bornin that country. All Vaisnavas who are born in that land in the fu t ure wil l c o n siderthemselves fortunate like us.Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, with the help of Ni t y ananda and Advaita, clearlyexplained the truth regarding one s relationship with the Lo rd. He clearlye xplained the truths of the living entities' relationship with th e L ord t h r o u g hRupa, Sanatana, JIva, Gopala Bhatta, the two Raghunathas, Ramananda Raya,Svarupa Damodara, and Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya. He consohdated the process ofacting in that relationship by establishing the supremacy of performing kI r t a naRegarding the ultimate goal of life, He ascertained the simple means of relishingthe mellows of Vraja.If the readers carefully consider, they will find t hat the spiri t ual science graduallyevolved from ancient times and became more simple, more clear, and more"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"condensed. The more impuri t ies arising from time and place are removed, themore the beauties of spiritual science brightly shine before us. This spiritualscience took birth in the land of ku sa grass on the banks of the Sarasvati River inBrahmavarta. As it gradually gained strength, this spiritual science spent itschildhood in the abode of Badarikasrama, which is covered with snow. It spent itsb oyhood in Naimisaranya on the banks of the Gomati River and its youth on th ebeautiful banks of the Kaveri River in the provi nce of Dravida. The spiritualscience attained maturity in Navadvipa, on the banks of the Ganges, which puri fi esthe universe.By studying the history of the wor ld, it is found that the spiri tual science reachedits peak in Navadvipa. The Supreme Absolute Truth is the only object of love forthe living entities. Unless one worships Him wit h a t t achment, however, the livinge ntity can never attain Him. Even if a person gives up all affection for this wor l dand thinks of the Supreme Lord, He is still not easily achieved. He is controlledand attained by transcendental mellows alone59. Those mellows are of five typessanta, dasya, sakhya, vatsalya, and madhurya Th .e first mellow, santa, is the stagein which the living entity surpasses the pains of material existence and situateshimself in transcendence. In that state there is a little happiness, but no feeling ofindependence. At that time the relationship between the practitioner and the Lordis not yet established. Dasya rasa -is the second mellow. It contains all theingredients of santa rasa -as well as affection.\"The Lord is my master, and I am Hiseternal servant.\" This type of relationship is found in da sya rasa. -No one will caremuch for any of the best things of this world u n l ess they are connected withaffection. Therefore dasya rasa -is better than santa rasa i-n many ways. Just asdasya is better than santa, know for certain that sakhya is superior to dasya. Indasya rasa t-here is a thorn in the form of awe and reverence, but the mainornament in sakhya rasa is -the f eeling of friendship in equality. Amo ng theservants, anyone who is a friend is superior. There is no doubt about it. In sakhyarasa all the wealth of santa and dasya is included. Just as sakhya is superior todasya, similarly vatsalya is superior to sakhya. This is easily understood. Among allthe friends, the son is more dear and the source of more happiness. In vatsalyarasa the wealth of four rasas, beginning with santa, is found. Altho ugh vatsalyarasa is superior to these other rasas, it appears insignificant before madhurya rasa-There may be many secrets unknown between father and son, but this is not th ecase between wife and husband. Therefore if we deeply consider, it will be seenthat all the above-mentioned rasas are seen in perfection within ma d hurya rasa-If we go through the histories of these five rasas, it is clearly believed that santarasa was seen in the beginning days of India. When the soul was not satisfied afterperforming sacrifices with material ingredients, then transcendentalists likeSanaka, Sanatana, Sanat-kumara, Sananda, ¹ r a d a , and M a h adeva all becamedetached from the material world, situated in transcendence, and realized santarasa Much la.ter, dasya rasa ma-nifested in Hanuman, the leader of the monkeys.That dasya rasa grad-ually expanded to the northwest and manifested in a greatpersonality named Moses. Long after Hanuman, the leader of the monkeys,Uddhava and Arjuna became the qualified authorities of sakhya rasa. They-preached about this rasa throughout the worl d. Gradually that rasa expanded upto the Arabian countries and touched the heart of Mohamm ed, the knower ofreligious principles. Vatsalya rasa manife-sted throughout India in dif f e rent forms"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"at different times. Among the different forms, vatsalya m ixed with opu l e n c ecrossed India and appeared in a great personality named Jesus Christ, who was apreacher of Jewish religious principles. Madhurya r-asa first shone brightly inVraja. It is extremely rare for this rasa to enter the hearts of conditioned souls,because this rasa tends to remain with qua lif i e d, pure living entit ies. Navadvipa-candra, Sri Saci-kumara, preached this secret rasa along with His follo we rs. Thisrasa has not crossed beyond India as yet. A short while ago a scholar from Englandnamed Newman realized something about this rasa and wrote a book about it. Thepeople of Europe and America have not been satisfied with vatsalya ras-a mixedwith opulence, as preached by Jesus Christ. I hope, by the grace of the Lord, in avery short time they will become attached to drink ing the in t o x i c ating nectar ofmadhurya ras-a It .has been seen that any rasa that appears in India eventuallyspreads to the western countries. Therefore within a short time madhurya ras-a willpreached throughout the world.

Swanlike people offoreign countries, whose language and social position are different, should acceptthese holy names in their own language by taking a hint from t hi s m an t ra.

They say that unlessone endeavors to prosper in family li fe, the Supreme Lord is not satisfied; andb ecause of excessive endeavors for self-realization, affection for family li f ediminishes. This argument, however, is extremely weak, because if one carefullyendeavors to act according to the desire of the Supreme Lord and in the courseone's temporary material life is ruined, then what is the harm63> It is a fact thatthe material world was created in order to ful f ill a distant plan of the SupremeLord, but no one can explain what that plan is.

Attachment is present whether therepository is the Lord or something mu n d ane, the only difference is its repository.When attachment is turned towards Vaikun t ha, then no attachment for th ematerial world remains; one accepts only what is required for maintenance.

If we try to search out the root cause ofsinful desire, or the seed of sin, then we can ascertain that identifying one s bodyas one's self is the root cause of the pure living entity's sinful desires. From thismisidentification of one's body as one's self, both sin and piety arise. Therefore"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"both sin and piety are relative, not constituti onal. The activities or desires thatrelatively help a soul attain his constituti onal position are called piety. Theopposite are called sin. Since devotional service to Krsna is one s constitutionalposition, when one cultivates this service, then nescience, which is the root causeof relative situations in the form of sin and piety, is gradually fried and abolished.Although the desire to engage in sinful activity may suddenly manifest like a friedkai fish, it is quickly subdued by the process of devotional service. The endeavorfor atonement at this point is useless. There are three types of atonementatonement through karma, atonement through jnana, and atonement throughbhakti. Remembering Krsna is the atonement through bhakti. Therefore devotionalservice is atonement through bhakti. There is no need for devotees to separatelyendeavor for atonement. Atonement in jnana is through repentence. By atonementthrough jnana one s sins and seeds of sin, or desires, are destroyed, but nescienceis not destroyed without bhakti. By atonement through karma, such as candrayana(a kind of expiatory penance), one's sins are checked, but the seeds of sinfuldesires and nescience, the root cause of sins and the desire to sin, remains. Onemust understand this science of atonement with careful consideration. Thepractice of repentance is observed in some foreign devotional processes based onpaternal rasa, and since this paternal rasa is mixed with jnana and opulence, it isreasonable. In the unmotivated devotional service of the sweet Lord, however,there are no opposing rasas like fear, repentance, or liberation. Realization of one sconstitutional position and elimi n ation of all previous sins, in the form of bot hfructified and unfructi fied sins, are both irrelevant fruits of bhakti and thereforeeasily attained by the devotees. As for the jnanis, they destroy their unf r u c t i f i edsins by the indirect process of repentance and they enjoy the results of theirfructified sins in their current li fe. As for the karmis, their sins will be destroyed byenjoying the fruits, in the form of pu n i s h m e nt. Th erefore in the science ofatonement it is extremely impor t ant to consider the qualification of the performer.TEXT 3adhikara vicare-natyaj anti satatam vadanguna dosau -vivicyatesuska tarkan-anatmakanFrom animal life to human life and from regulative principles to attachment thereare many levels of qualification.

Whatwe call the mind has no existence of its own, for it is only a perversion of the soul scontact with matter for increasing the knowledge of the conditioned soul.

We have covered all relevant topics in theverses of this samhita, but we have not used the method that modern scholars usein considering those topics. Therefore I fear that many people will reject Sri Krsnasamhita as an old-fashioned book. I am in a dile mm a. If I wou ld h a ve used themodern process when I composed the verses, then the ancient scholars would havecertainly disregarded the book. For this reason, I have composed the main bookaccording to the ancient method, and I have written the In t r o d u c t ion andConclusion according to the modern. In this way I have tried to satisfy bothclasses of people. Therefore I have been compelled to accept the fault of repetition.In this Conclusion I will b r iefly con sider all topics.The swanlike Vaisnava-dharma is the soul s eternal constitutional duty. It is no tcreated by any person or sect. In the course of time we are gradually realizing thepurity of these duties. Where is the doubt> The progression of clarity depends onthe person, not the subject. The sun is always equal to everyone, but due to theperception of the observer it appears hotter at midday. Similarly, pureconstitutional duties are progressively understood as superior by progressivelyadvanced people, though in truth c o n sti t u t i o nal du t ies remain the same at alltimes. Now I will begin to discuss the science of these constitutional duties.The inaugurator of the swanlike Vaisnava faith, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, hassaid,\"Since people are all conditioned, we are compelled to consider their eternal"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"duties in three different categories sa m b a n dha, t he soul s relationship with t h eLord; abhidheya, the regulated activities for reviving that relationship; andprayoj ana, the ultimate goal of life.\" According to the Lord's instructions, we willnow separately discuss these three subjects.First we will discuss sambandha O.ne who is thoughtful should fir st examineoneself. From the existence of one's own self, the existence of other objects isascertained. A thoughtful person may say,\"If I do not exist, then nothing elseexists; because without me, how is it possible to realize other things>\" By thetendency to believe in one s self, a thoughtful person establishes his own existenceand then observes the insignificance and dependence of the soul. As soon as onesees one's own self, one immediately observes the support of the Supersoul.Feeling the existence of the atma and Paramatma should be the first step in beliefof one's self. When a thoughtful person looks at the material world, he can easilysee three things t h e a t ma , the Paramatma, and the material world. Those whocannot realize the soul consider themselves dull matter. In their estimation, matteris eternal. They also come to the conclusion that all material elements produceconsciousness through the process of evolution, and when they are separated fromtheir natural status then consciousness reverts to unconscious matter. Thoughtfulpersons conclude like this because they are more under the control of materialpropensities than spiritual propensities, and as such they are more inclinedtowards matter than knowl edge. That is why their hope, faith, enthusiasm,consideration, and love are all material. It is unfort u n ate that the dealings ofpersons who are in samadhi cause pain to the hearts of such people. There is nopossibility of reconciliation between their opin ion and ou rs, because we are notready to accept the method they follow to ascertain the Absolute Truth. They areunder the grip of argument, and arguments are never able to establish theexistence of the self. What is the use of putting a telescope to the ears> Can one seep ictures through a microphone> How, then, can one see Vaikuntha through th einstrument of argument> All subjects of this material world are under thejurisdiction of argument, but the soul cannot be seen by any method other thanself-realization. If argument accepts the proper path, then one can quicklyunderstand its incompetence in matters related with the soul. The soul is pureknowledge, and therefore it is self-illum i n a t ing and the ill u m i n a tor of m a t t er. Butthe propensity for argument born of matter can never illum i n ate the soul.Therefore, not being obliged to accept the materialistic conclusions of those whoargue, we will consider and perceive the soul and Supersoul through the process ofself-realization and with the temporary instrum ent of argument, which is situatedb etween matter and spirit, we will en u m erate the truths of this material worl d .We need to separately discuss the atma, Paramatma, and material world. SriRamanujacarya has elaborately explained these three subjects as spiritual, material,and the Lord. In the discussion on sambandha, we should consider and ascertainthe relationship between these three. Acarya Kapila, the propounder of Sankhyaphilosophy, has enumerated twenty-four elements within the material world. If w ewant to discuss the material world, we have to take Kapila's twenty-four elementsinto account. Modern scholars who are expert in material sciences arepainstakingly discovering the original elements names, qualities, andcharacteristics through newly inv ented machines. In this way they increasepeoples material knowledge. Their discoveries are especially respected because"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"they are helpful in the progress of spiritual life. Yet even though we respect theirdiscoveries, that does not mean we have to disrespect Kapila's Sankhyaphilosophy. There may be sixty, sixty-five, or seventy original elements, but thisdoes not disturb the Sankhya system of counting the gross elements like earth,water, and fire. Therefore Kapila s discussions about the material worldconsisting of the material elements, their qualities, the senses, the mind, theintelligence, and the false ego ar e no t u s eless. Rather, the divisions of Sankhyaappear more scientific. In the Bhagavad gi-ta (7.0), which is a compilation ofVedanta, the following elements are enumerated:kham mano buddhir eva cabhinna prakrtir astadhabhumir apo 'nalo vayuhahankara itiyam me\"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence, and false egoall together theseeight constitute My separated material energies.\" In this context, the qualities ofthe elements are included in the elements, and all the senses are merged into thesubtle material elements, consisting of the mind, in t el l igence, and false ego.Therefore as far as counting the material elements is concerned, Sankhya andVedanta are the same.At this point it should be considered whether the mind, in t elligence, and false egoare material elements or characteristics of the soul. In this regard, a few scholarsfrom Europe have concluded that the mind, in t el l igence, and false ego arecomposed of material elements and the soul is beyond them. Modern scholarsoften accept the mind and soul to be one. I have discussed with many Englishs cholars and found that they consider the soul to be different from the mi nd , bu tdue to language shortcomings, they often use the word \"m i nd \" w h e n r e f erring th esoul. In the Bhagavad gita (-7.5) it is stated:prakrtim viddhi me paramyayedam dharyate j agatapareyam itas tv anyamj iva bhutam -maha baho-\" Besides these, 0 mighty-armed Arju na, there is another, superior energy of Min e ,which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of thismaterial, inferior nature.\" By studying this verse it is clearly understood that theliving entities are different from the previously mentioned material elementsmind, intelligence, and false ego. This is certainly a swanlike conclusion.I n this visible world of varieties, two subjects are found s p i r i t a n d m a t t er , or th eliving entity and the material elements. The Vaisnavas accept these two subjects asthe effects of the inconceivable potency of the Supreme Lord. Now let usstandardize the definitions of the material elements and the living entities. Theliving entities are conscious and can act independently. Matter is dull and un d erthe control of consciousness. If we consider the existence of a human being in hi spresent conditioned state, then we will un d o u b t edly consider his consciousnessand the material elements, because by the Lord's sweet will the conditi o ned soulsare seen to be riding on a machine of the material elements.The material b od y m a d e o f s e v e n c o n s t i t u e n t fl u i d s 7 0 , the senses, as well as the mind,intelligence, and false ego (which are the sources of material knowledge), the place, the time factor,and consciousness are all seen in the existence of a human being. The body is completely material,because it is made of material elements and their characteristics. The material elements are not ableto realize spirit, but we can perceive some evidence of spiritual existence in wonderful instrumentslike the eyes, ears, and nervous system in the body of a human being. The instruments by whichmaterial knowledge enters the material body are called senses. After entering the material body,"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"mind as eternal.material knowledge mixes with an internal instrument that interprets the material elements. Thisinstrument is called the mind. The mind realizes material knowledge through the medium of theheart and accumulates knowledge through the medium of remembrance. The shape of materialknowledge changes through the medium of imagination. Material objects are considered with thesupport of two mediums d e v eloped and undeveloped intelligence. Apart from this, in theexistence of a human being an indication of spirit (cidabhasa) is found in the form of ego, whichpervades the intelligence, mind, and body. From these symptoms a strong feeling of \"I\" and \"mine\"has become accepted as part of the human beings' existence. This is known as false ego. It is to beunderstood that knowledge of subjects up to false ego is called material knowledge. Yet false ego,intelligence, mind, and the prowess of the senses are not totally material. In other words, they donot consist entirely of material elements, but their existence is rooted in material elements. In otherwords, unless they are related with the material elements their existence is incomplete. They areunder the shelter of spirit to some extent, because the act of revelation is their very life and materialknowledge is the result. From where does this consciousness originate'? The soul is pure and thebasis of consciousness. It is not easy for a soul to come under the subordination of matter. By thewill of the Supreme Lord c e r t a inly for some reason a p ure spirit soul has contacted matter.Although in our conditioned state it is very difficult to investigate the cause, if we consider the lackof happiness in our conditioned state, we can certainly realize that our present condition is adegradation from our original consciousness. Although modern scholars think,\"The living entitieshave been created in this condition and by fruitive activities they gradually advance,\" according tothe process of self-realization this cannot be accepted as a fact. There is no further argument in thisconnection, because argument is a product of material elements and has no entrance in the scienceof self-realization or the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. It is our duty to establish that an indicationof spirit, in the form of false ego, intelligence, mind, and senses, has been manifested due to thepure soul's contact with matter. This indication of spirit will no longer exist when the soul isliberated. Therefore three items are found in the existence of a human being th e soul, theinstrument that indicates the presence of the soul and connects it with matter, and the materialbody. According to Vedanta, the soul is called jiva, or living entity, the instrument that indicates thepresence of the soul is called the subtle body, and the material body is called the gross body. Afterdeath the gross body is left behind, but the subtle body continues to exist by taking shelter offruitive activities and their results until one is liberated. The instrument for indicating the presenceof spirit remains as long as the soul is conditioned, but it has no actual connection with the purespirit soul. The pure spirit soul is full of spiritual bliss. The pure spirit soul is aloof from materialexistence, beginning from false ego down to the gross body. If one wants to realize the existence ofthe pure spirit soul, one must give up material thoughts; but in the presence of false ego, allthoughts are material. Thoughts cannot leave the association of matter, because they are born froman indication of spirit. Therefore only one who checks the activities of the mind and cultivates self-realization through samadhi can realize the soul without doubt. But those who have surrenderedtheir independence to the false ego are not brave enough to cross the border of argument and aretherefore totally unable to realize the existence of the soul. Those who argue on the basis ofVaisesika philosophy can never realize the existence of the pure soul. That is why they accept theIn the Seventh Canto of the Srfmad Bhagavatam (7.19.20) the twelve symptoms ofa pure spirit soul are described by Prahlada Maharaja as follows:ekah ksetra jna asrayahvyapako 'sangy anavrtahatmano laksanaih paraihdehadau mohaj am tyaj etatma nityo 'vyayah suddhaavikriyah sva drg hetu-retair dvadasabhir vidvanaham mamety asad bhavam-The soul is nitya, or eternal, for it is not temporary like the gross and subtlebodies. Avyaya means the soul is not destroyed when the gross and subtle bodiesare destroyed. Suddha refers to that which is free from material contamination.

Learned people shouldd istinguish the soul by these twelve spiritual symptoms and give up illu sion in t h ef orm of \"I\" and \"m i n e . \"There is much argument over whether a pure living entity has any existence intime and space. But argument is useless in considering the Absolute Truth and istherefore condemned. Arguments can only reveal indications of spirit; they cannever fully reveal spiritual subjects. The spirit soul is transcendental, or beyondeverything material. The word \"m at erial\" in t hi s case does not refer only to th ematerial elements, but it refers to the characteristics of the elements, the indicationof spirit, and the activities of the senses, mind, intelligence, and false ego. Since theindication of spirit is under the juri sdiction of ma tt er, many material situations aremistaken for spiritual activities. Although time and space are found among thematerial elements, they nevertheless have their pure spiritual existence. If onecarefully studies the first and second chapters of Sri Krsna samh-ita, one willunderstand that although spiritual and material sciences appear contradictory,they are not. All spiritual existence is pure and faultless. But when this spiritualexistence manifests in the material world, it becomes full of inebrieties. Thereforepure time and space will be seen in the pure state of the living entity, andc ontaminated time and space will be seen in the contaminated material world. Th i sis the only scientific consideration of time and space. In his pure state, a livingentity is a pure spiritual being, but in the condi t i o ned state there are three types ofexistence p u r e e x i s t ence, or spiritual existence; an indication of spiritualexistence, or subtle existence; and material existence, or gross existence. Thenatural law is that gross elements cover subtle elements. Because the indication ofspiritual existence is more gross, it has covered the soul s pure spiritual existence.And because material existence is the most gross, it has covered both the purespiritual existence and the indication of spiri tual existence. Still, all three of theseexistences do manifest, because even when they are covered, they are not lost. Thesoul s pure spiritual existence is properly situated in pure time and space.Therefore it should be understood that an indiv i d ual soul is properly situated inpure time and space. Since the soul has a proper abode, we can accept that he has afixed place. Since the soul has a fixed place, we can also accept that the soul has apure body and form. We then have to accept that this form has spiritual qualitiessuch as beauty, will-power, feelings, and actions. This form cannot be seenthrough the indication of spirit, because it is beyond matter. As all the limbs of agross body act in harmony and thus exhibit the beauty of that form, all th erequired instruments are similarly present in the spiritual body, wh ich is the idealmodel of the gross body. The difference between gross and spiritual bodies is thatthe spirit soul is the proprietor of the gross body. Therefore the body and its"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"owner are different. But in the spiritual body there is no difference between theb ody and its owner. Every object has two means of identification b y f o r m a n d b yactivity. Consciousness, or knowledge, is the identification of a liberated soul. Theliving entity is the personification of kn o w l e dg e t h a t i s , hi s body is composed ofpure knowledge. Blissfulness is the identification of his activities. Therefore theexistence of the liberated soul is complete spiritual happiness. The ego, heart,mind, and senses are nondifferent from consciousness in the living entity s pures tate. But in the conditioned state a living entity is seen as an indication of spirit ,and material happiness and distress, which are reflections of spiritual bliss, are theidentification of his activities.The omniscient Supersoul is eternal, full of kn o w l e dge and bliss. Another name ofthe omniscient Supersoul is Bhagavan. The material world and the living enti t i esare products of His superior energy. When we speak of a living entity, we refer toan atomic spiritual spark. Similarly, when we speak about the Lord, we refer to aextraordinary spiritual personality. This personality is seen by pure living entiti esas full of all good qualities, most beautiful, and enchanting. Endowed wit hindescribably sweet qualities, beautiful Sri Krsnacandra manifests eternal bliss andincreases the beauty of Vaikuntha. Pure living entities are eternally absorbed in Hisbeauty, and conditioned living entities are searching for His beauty in the pastimesof Vraja. It has been explained in Srila Rupa Gosvami s Bhakti rasa-mrta sind-hu thatt he living entities possess fifty qualities in min ute quanti ty. In L or d ¹ r a y a n a t h e s efifty qualities are present in full, along with ten other qualities. His form, endowedwith spiritual happiness, Sri Krsnacandra, possesses sixty-four qualities. Thereforedevotees accept Lord Krsna as the topmost embodiment of the manifestation of theSupreme Lord's energies.Consideration on sambandha means to ascertain the relationship between thesethree subjects. This has already been described in the follow ing verses from theBhagavad gita (-7.0-7):kham mano buddhir eva cabhinna prakrtir astadhabhumir apo 'nalo vayuhahankara ittyam me\"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence, and false egoall together theseeight constitute My separated material energies.prakrtim viddhi me paramyayedam dharyate j agatapareyam itas tv anyamj Iva bhutam -maha baho-\" Besides these, 0 mighty-armed Arju na, there is another, superior energy of Min e ,which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of thismaterial, inferior nature.etad yonmi b-hutaniaham krtsnasyaj agatahsarvanity upadharayaprabhavah pralayas tatha\"All created beings have their source in these two natures.

T h eliving entities and the material world have been manifested from the aspects andpotencies of the superior energy, therefore the entire universe is the effect of Hisenergy71. By this conclusion the long-standing philosophies of vivarta, the Mayavada theory ofillusion, and brahma-parinama, the theory of transformation of the Supreme, are defeated. Wecannot accept vivarta or parinama of the Supreme Lord, rather we understand that everything ispossible by the activities and effects of the superior energy. Since the living entities and the materialworld are manifested from the energy of the Supreme Lord, they are considered separated from theLord, but they have no independent power. They cannot do anything without the mercy of theLord. This is clearly described in the first and second chapters of this book. We can briefly say thatthe Lord is their only shelter and they are totally dependent on Him. The Lord is the sole cause oftheir existence, so they are fully under His shelter. The special feature of the living entities is thatthey are conscious by nature, therefore the supreme conscious Lord is their only shelter. Thematerial world is foreign to the living entities and therefore unfit as their shelter. The constitutionalduties of the living entities are presently transformed into material activities, and their lovingsentiments for the Lord have become perverted into material attachment. Therefore, to minimizethis perverted attachment and increase one's real attachment is called sreyah, or ultimate benefit, forthere is no permanent relationship between the living entities and the material world. Whateverlittle relationship does exist is merely transient. Until one is liberated by the mercy of the Lord,however, one must accept this material connection as unavoidable for maintaining one's life. Onecannot achieve liberation just by searching, but it can be easily achieved by the mercy of the Lord.Therefore one should abandon desires for liberation and material enjoyment. The only duty of aliving entity is to engage in one's constitutional occupation by practicing yukta-vairagya without anydesire for material enjoyment or liberation. This material world is a product of the external energy,which is a shadow of the superior energy, who is the maidservant of the Lord. It is thereforeunderstood that the external energy is always engaged in carrying out the will of the Lord. Thismaterial universe is the house of enjoyment for the living entities who are averse to the Lord. Theonly way to escape the imprisonment of Maya is devotional service to the Lord, as stated in theBhagavad g>ta (7.1-%):mama maya duratyayamayam etam taranti tedaivf hy esa guna mayf-mam evaye prapadyante\"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, isdifficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily crossbeyond it.\"We have considered the relationship, or sambandha, between the three subjects,and now I will try to b r iefly ex pl ain abhidheya and prayoj ana The pr.ocess bywhich prayoj ana is achieved is called abhidheya There.fore I will considerprayoj ana first.The condition of the living entity is very pathetic, for although he is pure spirit, hehas become the servant of matter. He considers himself a product of matter andbecomes afflicted by material scarcity. Sometimes he cries due to scarcity of food,sometimes he laments due to being attacked by fever, and sometimes he engages inabominable activities in order to draw the attention of wo m en. Sometimes heexclaims,\"I'm dying!\" and sometimes he says,\"I've been saved by this medicine.\"Sometimes he is absorbed in the formidable ocean of lamentation due to the deatho f his child.

If we carefully consider what we actually are and whatwe have become, then we can understand that we have fallen and become inflictedwith threefold miseries t h o s e c aused by the demigods, those caused by otherliving entities, and those caused by one s own body and mind. Why h ave we beenmisguided> We have certainly become offenders to the all-blissful Supreme Lord.That is why we have become fallen; there is no doubt about it. Our o f f ense isdiscrepancy in the constitutional occupation of the spirit soul. It has already beenshown that the living entity is full of spir i t ual bliss. The soul is pure know l edge,and blissfulness is his constitution. The thread of relationship between a livingentity and the Absolute Truth, who is eternally full of k n o w l e dge and bliss, iscalled priti, or love. This thread of love eternally connects the happiness of theliving entities with the happiness of the Lord. The quality of their love is mutuallyattractive. It is most pleasing, subtle, and pure. When a living entity falls into th enet of illusion, however, he shuns the loving service of the Lord and searches forenjoyment in the material world. Kn o w in g hi m t o be an offender, Maya, themaidservant of Krsna, then imprisons him. We are suffering in the material worl ddue to this offense. Our constitutional du ti es, in the form of l ove of God, havebecome reflected as attachment for material objects, which increases ourinauspiciousness. At this juncture, cultivation of our constit u t i o nal du t ies is ouronly prayoj ana, or goal of life. As long as we are conditioned, we cannot purelypractice our constitutional du ti es. Our constitut i onal propensities are neither lostnor can they be lost; they are simply in a dormant state. As soon as one startscultivation of those duties, they will awaken from th eir do r m ant state and againshine brightly. Then liberation and attainment of Vaik u n tha wil l au t o m a t i callyensue. Since liberation is not our goal of life, it is not our pr a yoj ana Priti i.s ourgoal of life and therefore our only prayoj ana Peopl.e who are on the path ofknowledge and are disturbed by material miseries search for liberation; but th eendeavors of those with undesirable goals will be unsuccessful, for the performerachieves no benefit. Those who cultivate priti can easily achieve completeknowledge and liberation. Therefore priti is the only prayoj anaThe symptoms of priti are described in my book, Da tta kaustub-ha, as follows:a karsa sannidh-au lauhah pr av r t t o d r s y a t e y a t h aanor mahati caitanye pr av r t t i h p r i t i l a k s a nam-\"As a piece of iron is naturally attracted by a magnet, the atomic spirit soul isnaturally attracted by the supreme consciousness of the Personality of Godhead.\"This natural tendency is called priti Ju st as t.he soul and Supersoul are both devoidof material designations, the priti exchanged between them is similarly pure andwithout a tinge of material inebriety. Our prayoj ana is to awaken this pure pritiIf one wants to achieve a goal, then he must follow the pr oper method. Accordingto their qualifications, previous great souls have introduced various methods toachieve success in their respective goals. I will now di scuss abhidheya, which is themethod for achieving prayoj ana"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"All the methods that have been devised for achieving success in spiritual life aredivided into three classes. The names of these three classes are karma, jnana, andbhakti.To maintain one s life by performing prescribed duties is called karma. Karma hastwo aspects p r e s c r i p t i ons and proh i b i t i o ns. Akarma, or inactivity, and vikarma,or sinful activities, are both prohibit ed. Karma is prescribed. There are three kindsof karma c o n s t i t u t i o n al , cond i t i o n al, and desirous. Activities that are alwaysrequired to be performed are called constitutional. Maintaining one s body andfamily, performing welfare activities, gratefulness, and worshiping the Lord arecalled constitutional activities. That which becomes a duty by circumstance iscalled conditional activity. Attempt ing to avoid death after seeing the death ofone s father is an example of a conditional activity. Activi t ies that are performedwith a desire are called desirous activities. An example is performing a sacrifice toget a child.If one wants to properly perform one's duties, then he must connect theprescriptions for bodily activities, moral codes, acts of chastisement, inheritance,ruling the kingdom, divisions of work, war, alliances, marriages, time, andatonement with the devotional service of the Lord and thus be properly situated inthis world. This has been practiced by various castes in some form or other. Theland of Bharata is populated by Aryans, therefore it is an example for all castes, fora ll the above-mentioned activities are beautifully present in this land in th ewonderful form of varnasrama dhar-ma No .other race was able to make such aperfect arrangement. Among other races, activities are performed according topeople's nature and the above-mentioned prescriptions are chaotically arranged;but among the Aryans of India, these prescriptions are arranged so that allactivities become favorable for devotional service. What a wonderful in t el l igencethe Indian rsis possessed! Even in the very ancient past they made anextraordinary arrangement with out the help of any other race. When we refer toIndia as the land of karma and the example for other countri es, it is not anexaggeration.T he sages realized that people's eligibility for perform ing du t ies is born from th e i rnature. If we prescribe activities without considering one s qualification, then theactivity will never be properly performed. Therefore the sages ascertained people'sduties after considering their nature. Human nature is divided into fourcategories br a h m a n a, ksatriya, vaisya, and sudra The sa.ges have thus ascertainedpeople's varna according to their nature. In the last chapter of Bhagavad gita-(18.01-05) it is stated:brahmana ksatriya -visam - s u d r a n a m ca parantapakarmani pravibhaktani svabhava prabhav-air gunaih\"Brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas, and sudras are distinguished by the qualities bornof their own natures in accordance with the material modes, 0 chastiser of theenemy.ksantir arjavam eva cabrahma karma sv-abhava jamsamo damas tapah saucamj nanam vij nanam asti ky am\"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, knowledge,wisdom, and religiousness t h e s e are the natural qualities by which the brahmanaswork."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"sauryam tejo dhrtir daksyam y udd h e c a p y a p alayanamdanam Isvara b-havas ca ksatram karma svabhava jam\"Heroism, power, determination, resourcefulness, courage in battle, generosity,and leadership are the natural qualities of work for the ksatriyasvaisya k-arma svabhava jamsudrasyapi svabhava jamsamsiddhim labhate narahkrsi g-o ra-ksya va-nij yamparicaryatmakam karmasve sve karmany abhiratah\"Farming, cow protection, and business are the natural work for the vaisyas, andfor the sudras there is labor and service to others. By following his qualities ofwork, every man can become perfect.\"After dividing the varnas according to people s qualities and activities, which areborn of one's nature, the sages considered that there was a need for ascertainingtheir asrama position. They thus designated married people as grhasthas, travelingstudents as brahmacaris, elderly retired people as vanaprasthas, and those whohave renounced everything as sannyasis Th.ey have also concluded that womenand sudras are meant to be grhasthas No .one can accept sannyasa other thanbrahmanas Thi.s arrangement is a clear indication of the sages extraordinaryintelligence. All the prescriptions and prohib i t i ons that are born of sastra andargument are under the jurisdiction of varnasrama dhar-ma It is .difficult to discussall the prescriptions in this small concluding chapter, therefore I will con cl ude bysaying that the varnasrama system is a wonderful prescription for peoples' materiallife. This varnasrama system is certainly the most respected of all arrangementsthat have been manifested from the Aryans' intelligence.Due to improper consideration and envy, people from foreign countries criticizethis arrangement. Some foolish people of our country do also. This is primarilydue to their animosity towards their own cou n t ry . In adequate understanding of itspurpose and imitating the behavior of foreigners are also counted among the mainBesides that, there is no doubt that this arrangement has been polluted. It has beenimproperly functioning due to a lack of scholars who know th e pu r p ose of thesystem. That is why people nowadays criticize the varnasrama system. Actually thearrangement of varnasrama is faultless. But how can it remain faultless whenemployed in an inappropriate way> One's varnasrama p osition, which is born fro mone's nature, is now being designated according to one's birth. This yields contraryresults. The unqualified son of a brahmana will be known as a brahmana, and alearned peaceful son of a sudra will be known as a sudra Th is ar.rangement is mostcontrary to the original varnasrama system. The ancient custom was that when aboy attained maturity, the elderly family members, the family priest, the familyacarya, the landlord, and the leaders of the village would consider his nature andthen ascertain his varna The ma.in consideration in ascertaining a boy s varna wasto analyze whether he was qualified to accept the same varna as his father. Due totheir inherent nature and hard work to achieve a high status, higher caste childrenwould often be accepted as belonging to the same varna as their father. Yet due toinability, some children would be accepted as lower caste. Then again, children oflower castes would often be accepted into the higher castes at the time ofexamination.

To some extentit is natural for the son of a great person to become great, but this should not betaken for granted. The natural system of varnasrama was established in order todeliver the world from the leadership succession of blind men, but the religiousscriptures unfortunately fell into the hands of some selfish and foolish smartas, orritualistic brahmanas Th.e danger that this system was introduced to prevent hasitself attacked the system. This is a subject of great lamentation. One who tries toremove the contamination that has entered into this system is engaged in hiscountry's welfare. It is not the duty of in t e l l igent persons to remove the wholesystem because some portion of it is contaminated. Therefore, 0 great souls! Youwho wish to engage in the welfare of your count ry, please reestablish this faultlesssystem given by your forefathers after collectively refining it. Do no t tr y to g ive upthe proper system of your country un der the bad advice of foreigners. Will th o sewho live in the land of India as the glorious descendants of great personalities likeBrahma, Manu, Daksa, Marici, Parasara, Vyasa, Janaka, Bhisma, and Bharadvajalearn the arrangements for material life from mo d ern races> Alas! I don't seeanywhere for such people to hide their shame. If the varnasrama system isfaultlessly reestablished, then India will advance in all respects. I need notelaborate on this. The main purpose of the varnasrama system is to help onegradually advance by performing prescribed duties with the Lord in th e center.In this way people can gradually attain spiritual life by perform ing th eir prescribedduties according to the varnasrama system. Therefore in the karma kanda-scholars consideration on abhidheya, fruitive activities are accepted as the onlymeans for achieving prayoj ana Ac o n d .itioned soul cannot live for a momentwithout activity. He must at least work to mai n t ain his li fe. Unless we maintainour lives, we cannot practice the means for attaining prayoj ana Theref.ore activitiesare unavoidable. Since one cannot remain with out activi ty, all activities should bedovetailed for the pleasure of the Lord, otherwise those activities will transforminto atheistic activities. As stated in Srimad Bhagavatam (1.5.32):etat samsucitam brahmams ta p a t r a y a c i k -itsitam-yad Isvare bhagavatikarma brahmani bhavitam\"0 Brahmana Vyasadeva, it is decided by the learned that the best remedialmeasure for removing all troubles and miseries is to dedicate one's activities to thes ervice of the Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead [Sri Krsna].\" Fr u i t i v ea ctivities are simply a disturbance, even if they are performed with out m o t i v e .Therefore, unless the activities one performs according to one s qualification areoffered either to Brahman through kn o w l e d ge, to the Supersoul through th eresults, or to the Supreme Lord thr ough the path of attachment, such activities will"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"never yield auspiciousness. We will describe the path of attachment in its properplace. The activities one performs to achieve the supreme goal must be directedtowards the worship of the Supersoul, the Lord of sacrifice. Worship of the Lordcannot be given up either in constitu t i o nal or condi t i o nal activities, because one isenjoined to perform his prescribed duties with a sense of gratefulness towards theSupreme Lord, and this is called worshiping the Lord. Desirous activities aremeant for low-class people, yet there is an arrangement to dovetail those activitiesin relation to the Lord. As stated in the Srimad Bhagavatam g . 3 . 1 0 ):moksa ka-ma udara dh-ihyaj eta purusam paramakamah sarva ka-mo vativrena bhakti yo-gena\"A person who has broader intelligence, whether he be full of all material desire,without any material desire, or desiring liberation, must by all means worship thesupreme whole, the Personality of Godhead.\"Jnana is also considered a means of attaining spiritual perfection. The SupremeB rahman and the living entities are beyond the material creation. Thej n a n i sconclude that certain transcendental activities are the only means to attain theSupreme Brahman, which is the goal of spiritual life. Alth ough karma is sufficientfor maintaining one s body and family li fe, it is born of material activities and sohas no potency to detach one from matter. Through karma one's mind is trained toconcentrate on the Supreme Lord, but one cannot achieve eternal benefit untilmaterial activities are given up. One achieves spiritual results only by spiritu alendeavors. A living entity should fi rst discuss the material world, and aftersubduing all material qualities and existence he should engage in samadhi to attainthe wealth of Brahman. As long as one remains in a material body, he must acceptbodily activities. There are two types ofjn a na kn o w l e d g e of Brahman andknowledge of the Supreme Lord. By knowl edge of Brahman a soul achieves theresult of merging with Brahman. Such brahma jnanis do not accept theindependent existence of a soul after merging. Brahman is impersonal, and when asoul is liberated he also becomes impersonal and merges with Brahman. This typeof practice is a stimulation for cul t i v ating kn o w l e dge of the Supreme Lord. As theLord Himself says in the Bhagavad gita (1-2.3-5) concerning the purpose ofdevotional service:ye tv aksaram anirdesyam avy a k t a m p a r y u p asatesarvatra gam ac-intyam ca k u t a s t h a m a c-alam dhruvamsarvatra sama buddha-yahsarva bhuta h-ite rat-ahavyaktasakta cetasam-dehavadbhir avapyatesanniyamyendriya gramam-te prapnuvanti mam evakleso 'dhikataras tesamavyakta hi gatir duhkham\"But those who fully wor ship the un m a n i f ested, that which lies beyond theperception of the senses, the all-pervading, inconceivable, unchanging, fixed, andi mmovable t h e i m p e r s o nal conception of the Absolute Trut h b y c o n t r o l l i n g t h evarious senses and being equally disposed to everyone, such persons, engaged inthe welfare of all, at last achieve Me. For those whose minds are attached to theunmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is verytroublesome. To make progress in that discipline is always difficult for th ose who"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"are embodied.\" The main purp ort of th ese three verses is that when the materialconception of a living entity is destroyed by the cultivation of brahma jnana,impersonal knowledge, then by the association of devotees and the mercy of theL ord, he attains the spiritually variegated Supreme Lord. The contamination of th i smaterial world poll u tes the concentration, or samadhi, of the living entity so muchthat after giving up the material elements, from the five gross elements up to thefalse ego, one needs to focus on the impersonal Brahman in the beginning of one'ssamadhi. But when the spirit soul transcends material pains and attains onenesswith Brahman, then with fi xed in t e l l igence through samadhi he soon sees thevariegatedness of Vaikuntha. Then uncertainty will no l o n ger block his ability tosee the Lord. Then the beauty of Vaikun tha gradually manifests and satisfies thetranscendental eyes of the devotee. At this point, brahma jnana transforms intobhagavad jnana, knowledge of the Personality of Godhead. When one's knowledgeof the Supreme Lord awakens, he automatically understands all mysteriesregarding the Lord. Thereforej nana, which is a means for achieving the AbsoluteTruth, is also recommended as abhidheya, or a means for achieving the ultima tegoal. If one cultivates knowledge of the Supreme Lord, then there is a goodpossibility of awakening pure love, which is the living enti ties pr a yoj anaIt is necessary to say one other thing aboutjn a n a. Kn o w l e d ge of the Supreme Lordis natural knowledge, whereas nescience and too much kn o w l e dge are unnaturalk nowledge. Nescience results in adoration of matter, and too much k n o w l e d g er esults in atheism and monism. Adoration of matter has two form s p o s i t i v eadoration is to accept material characteristics as knowledge of the Supreme Lordand negative adoration is to accept material characteristics as the Supreme. Thosewho engage in positive adoration accept and worship a material image as theSupreme. Those who engage in negative worship accept the negative features ofmaterial characteristics as Brahman. Such people conclude that the Supreme isimpersonal, without form, w i t h ou t acti v i ty, and wi t h ou t senses. Regarding thesetwo classes, the Srimad Bhagavatam g. 1 0 . 33-35) states:etad bhagavato rupam sthu l a m t e v y a h r tam mayam ahy adibhis -cavaranair asta b h i r b a h i r a v r t a mavyaktam nirvisesanamnityam van manas-ah parammaya te hy anuvarnitemaya srste vi-pascitahatah param suksmatamamanadi madhy-a nidhan-amamunt bhagavad rupe-ubhe api na grhnanti\"Thus by all this, the external feature of the Personality of Godhead is covered bygross forms such as those of planets, which were explained to you by me.Therefore beyond this jgross manifestation] is a transcendental manifestation finerthan the finest form.

When reasoning overcomes knowledge and becomesestablished as argument, then one does not accept the soul as eternal. In thissituation the philosophy of atheism is born. When kn o w l e dge comes under thesubordination of reasoning and gives up its nature, then one aspires for merging.This aspiration is born from too m uch k n o w l e dge and does not benefit the livin gentity. As stated in the Srimad Bhagavatam (10.2.32):ye 'nye 'ravindaksa vimukta m-aninastvayy asta bh-avad avisuddha bu-ddhayaharuhya krcchrena param padam tatahpatanty adho 'nadrta yu-smad an-ghrayah\"0 lotus-eyed one, those who think t hey are liberated in this life but do not renderdevotional service to You must be of impure in t elligence.

If merging with the Supreme Brahman were the living entities ul t i m ate goal,then we would have to imagine that the living entities have been created by theLord out of cruelty. If we did not i n t r o d uce such an impr oper existence, we wouldnot feel any difficulty. If we accept Maya as the sole creator in order to verifyBrahman as faultless, then we are bound to accept an independent truth that isseparate from Brahman.2. When a soul merges with Brahman, neither are benefited.3. In the eternal pastimes of the Absolute Truth th ere is no need for the souls tomerge in Brahman.9. If one does not fully accept the quality of variegatedness, which is themanifestation of the Lord s energies, then there is no possibility of existence,knowledge, or happiness, and as a result, the Supreme Brahman is consideredimpersonal and without basis. One may even develop doubts about the existenceof Brahman. But if one accepts the quality of variegatedness as eternal, then thesoul cannot merge with Brahman.Please refer to Mayavada sata du-sani -for an elaboration on this subject.If one can understand the relationship between knowledge and love, then one willsee that there is no discord between them. The original feelings of a soul are one sconstitutional duties. These original feelings expand in two ways: (I ) t h e y expandin the form of kno w l edge of an object and its characteristics, and (2) they expandthrough the realization of rasa An o t h e.r name for the first way is jnana, orspeculative knowledge, which is naturally dry and tr ou b l esome. Another name forthe second way is priti, or love. At the time of realizing an object and itscharacteristics, an extraordinary feeling of rasa between the subject and object isexperienced. This is called priti In t h e r .elationship between jnana and priti, we seea proportionate increase in one relative to the respective decrease in the other. Asj nana increases, priti decreases, and as priti increases, jnana decreases. When jnanaattains its highest platform, then the original feelings of the soul become one. Thisplatform is dry and totally devoid of happiness. When priti attains its highestplatform, the original feelings of the soul are not lost, rather they become alive in"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"the subjects of sambandha, abhidheya, and prayojana and they then expand the rasaof love. Therefore expanding love is the only prayoj ana for a living entity.In the consideration of abhidheya, devotional service is accepted as the mainpractice. Sandilya Rsi has stated in his book named Bhakti mimamsa, bhaktihparanuraktir isvare\"Pure attachment to the Supreme Lord is called bhakti.\"Bhakti, or devotional service, is defined as the activities a conditioned soulperforms out of attachment for the Supersoul. Some of these activities resemblekarma and some resemblej nana. The gross bodily activities are called karma, andthe subtle bodily activities are calledjnana. Devotional service is the practicemeant for conditioned souls, so it cannot be called priti, or love. When priti i sawakened it should be understood that devotional service has reached its fullmaturity. It is not possible to elaborately describe each of the stages of devotionalservice, so we will describe only the main stages. If after understanding the basicscience of bhakti the esteemed reader studies devotional scriptures such asSandilya sut-ras and Bhakti ras-amrta sin-dhu, then all the topics related withdevotional service will be understood.Bhakti, like priti, has two natures o p u l e n t ( b a s ed on aisvarya) and sweet (basedon madhurya) Wh .en bhakti is attracted by the glories and opulences of the Lord, itis called aisvarya bha-kti Am .ood of servitude arises from the practitioners feelingsof insignificance. The Lord is known as the extraordinary master due to Hissupremely opulent aspect. Then the Lord, who is supremely opulent, appears asthe King of kings, ¹ r a y a n a , and bestows auspiciousness on the living entities.This is not temporary, it is eternal and ever-lasting. The Supreme Lord is by naturefull of all opulences. One cannot separate opulences from the Lord. But He alsopossesses a wonderfully sweet feature, which is superior to that of opul ence. Whenthe sweet nature of bhakti becomes prominent, then the sweet feature of the Lordis manifest and the opulent nature of bhakti becomes invisible, just as the moon isinvisible in the presence of the sun. When the nature of opulence becomesinvisible, then the Lord becomes the subject of higher rasas. Then the heart of apractitioner takes shelter of different rasas like sakhya, vatsalya, and madhuryaThe Lord then manifests as Krsna, the personification of compassion for Hisdevotees, the abode of supreme bliss, and the attractor of everyone's heart. It is notthat Krsna has manifested from ¹ r a y a n a , bu t T hey are both eternally wond erfuland ever-lasting. The different forms of the Lord manifest according to the natureand qualification of the devotee. The personality of Krsna is the shelter of thetopmost of the five primary rasas of the living entities, therefore Lord Sri Krsna isaccepted as the topmost personality in the science of bhakti and priti Th i s su.bjecthas been clearly explained in Sri Krsna samhita-If we deeply consider, we can understand that only topics concerning the Lordshould be discussed. In order to understand the nondual tru th, we have toconsider the three features of the Absolute Truth described in the SrimadBhagavatam (1.2.11):vadanti tat tattva vidas-tattvamyaj jn anam advayambrahmeti paramatmeti bhag a v a n i t i s a bdyate\"Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this non d u alsubstance Brahman, Paramatma, or Bhagavan.\" At first, due to indi r ect perception,the Absolute Truth is kn own as Brahman. The direct form of Brahman is notvisible; only an indirect form of the Absolute Truth is realized through j nana."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Attainment of know l edge is the highest achievement of inquiry i nt o Brahman. Yetin Brahman one cannot relish know l edge, because in Brahman there is nodifference between the enjoyer and the enjoyed. In the second case, through theh elp of direct and indirect features, the Paramatma, or Supersoul, is known by th eindividual soul. Although in t hi s case there is a hint of difference [between thes oul and Supersoul], due to the absence of the complete form of the Lord, thi sfeature of Paramatma is only known t h r o ugh ar t i f i cial samadhi. A t this junc tu r ethe devotee and the Lord cannot fully man i f est variegated exchanges. The Lord, orBhagavan, is the only worshipable truth. He is therefore mentioned in th econclusion of the previously quoted verse. Among the many qualities of the Lord,He is manifest as Brahman by one of those qualities and as Paramatma by anotherof those qualities. But when all the qualities are gathered together, the feature ofthe Lord described in the Srlmad Bhagavatam g. 9 . 35 ), yatha mahanti bhutani\"just as the universal elements,\" becomes manifest in the heart of the livin gentities th r o u g h sa m a d h i . Of a l l t h e n a m e s 7 2 a nd forms of the Lord current in the world,the form of Bhagavan mentioned in SrImad Bhagavatam is the most pure. That is why theParamahamsa-samhita is known as the Bhagavata. The Absolute Truth, Bhagavan, is the source of allqualities. The word Bhagavan refers to six principle qualities mentioned in the Visnu Purana(6.5.%7) as follows:aisvaryasya samagrasyaj nana vair-agyayos caivavlryasya yasasah sriyahsannam bhaga itinganaopulences. He has full strength, fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty, andrenunciation.\" It is to be understood at this point that the Lord is not simply acollection of qualities, rather the qualities are naturally manifest in a particularform. Among the six qualities of the Lord, opulence and beauty are seen as one inHis form. The other four qualities shine brightly as His characteristics. In theopulent form of the Lord the quantity of enjoym ent is less, while in the sweet formof the Lord enjoyment is more relishable, because only sweetness is experienced.Opulence and the five other qualities are identified as characteristics of that form.There is naturally an inverse ratio between sweetness and opulence. Opulencedecreases in proportion to the increase in sweetness, and sweetness decreases inproportion to the increase in opulence. The wonderful feature of sweetness in theLord is exhibited by independence and equality between the devotee and the Lord.In this position the Lord maint ains His features as the supreme controller, asBrahman, and as Paramatma, because the Absolute Truth naturally remainsnondual, although according to the qualifications of the devotees He appearsdifferently. The form of Srl Krsna, who is the sweet kadamba flower of madhuryarasa, i s the only independent object of spiritual cultivation.As Sukadeva Gosvaml described the rasa 2I2a, Ma-haraja Parlksit had a doubtwhether cultivation of God consciousness without a tinge of opulence could besuccessful, so he inquired:\"Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is He who is full in si xkrsnam viduh param kantam na t u b r a h m a t ay a muneguna pravahop-aramas t a s a m g u n a d h i yam k-atham\"0 sage, the gopfs knew Krsna only as their lover, not as the Supreme AbsoluteTruth.

Since even Sisupala, who hatedKrsna, achieved perfection, then what to speak of the Lord's dear devotees. 0King, the Supreme Lord is inexhaustible and immeasurable, and He is untouchedby the material modes because He is their controller. His personal appearance inthis world is meant for bestowing the highest benefit on hum an i t y.\" (B h a g.10.29.13-10)Among the six qualities, headed by opulence, the quality of beauty is the best. Thisw as concluded by Sukadeva Gosvami. Therefore those who support thi s w h e t h e rkanistha adh-ikari or uttama adh-ikari wi l l a t t a i n t he s up re me goal. By the strengthof their sadhana, the kanistha adh-ikaris give up connection with m a t e rial qualities,which are born from pi ous and im p i ous activities, and become uttama adhi-karisand thus achieve Krsna, while the uttama adhi-karis receive some uddipana, orinstigation, and enter the rasa dance.The primary symptoms of bhakti are described in the Bhakti rasa-mrta sind-hu,(Purva vibh-aga 1.9) as follows:anyabhilasita sunya-manukulyena krsnanuj nana karm-ady anav-rtamsilanam bhaktir uttama\"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsnafavorably and without desire for material profit or gain th r o ugh fr u i t iv e activitiesor philosophical speculation.

Devotion has no shelter in Brahman.N or is loving service offered to Paramatma, because Paramatma is known th r o u g hthe path of yoga. Therefore Paramatma is not the object of devotion.

Sri Krsnacandra is the ideal object for the propensities ofb hakti. Therefore cultivation of Krsna consciousness is the ideal symptom of pur edevotional service. In this cultivation of Kr sna consciousness one should notmaintain any desire other than the advancement of his constituti onal du ti es. If onecultivates the desire for liberation or sense gratification, then one s rasa will notdevelop and his cultivation will r esult in j nana or karma. One should be carefulthat fruitive activities and speculative knowledge do not cover this wonderfulsubtle propensity. Ifj nana covers this propensity, then one will be attracted toBrahman and lose one's identity. If karma covers this propensity, then one's heartwill become attached to dull fru i t ive activities like an ordinary smarta and one willultimately leave Krsna to engage in atheistic activities. Qualities like anger are alsoa type of cultivation, but by cul t i v ating Krsna consciousness in such a mood onewill taste the opposing rasa enjoyed by Kamsa. Therefore this type of cultivation isu nfavorable. At this juncture one may argue that if bhakti is like karma andj n a n a ,then the names \"karma\" and \"j nana\" should have been sufficient. What is the needof uselessly naming some practices bhakti> The answer to this question is that thescience of bhakti cannot be explained in the name of karma andj nana Th e .re areseparate results in constitutional, conditi on al, and desirous activities. Thep rinciple goal of all activities is to attain one's constitutional occupatio n o f t h i sthere is no doubt. But all activities have their own irr elevant frui ts. For example,the irrelevant fruits of bodily activities are nourishment of the body and sensualpleasure. No one can deny this. The irrelevant fruits of mental activities arehappiness of the heart and sharpness of the intelligence. One who surpasses theseirrelevant fruits and searches for the principle fruit may develop a devotionalmood in his activities. That is why activities with ir r elevant fruits are known askarma kanda -Karm.a and bhakti have been scientifically divided in order toincorporate the favorable fruits of karma into bhakti. Similarly, jnana that simplyaims at liberation is calledjn a na kanda-, while the favorable fruits ofjn a na th at helpone progress towards the goal of life have been incorporated into bhakti. There issomething more to be said in this regard. If all karma andj nana aim at attainingthe principle fruit, then they may be considered bhakti. But only some karma ismeant for attaining the principle fruit. Th ese activities are identified as directdevotional service. Some examples are worshiping the Lord, chanting j apa,following devotional vows, visiting holy places, studying devotional scriptures,and serving the devotees. When other karmas and their irrelevant fruits aim at theprinciple fruit, then they may be called indirect devotional service. Similarly,knowledge of the Supreme Lord is closer to bhakti than kno w l edge of Brahman orfeelings of renunciation. If renunciation and kn o w l e dge of Brahman, along withtheir irrelevant fruit, liberation from ma ya, helps one achieve attraction for theLord, then they are also included in bhakti.Another name for karma kanda is -karma-yoga, and another name for j nana kanda-is j nana yoga or S-ankhya-yoga. The main purpose of sadhana is to awaken one sattraction for the Supreme Lord. When favorable karma andj nana are dovetailedwith bhakti they are called bhakti yoga Th -ose w.ho cannot understand thissynthesis are improperly engaged either in frui t ive activities, speculativeknowledge, or demigod worship.

The priti th at is the constitutio nalnature of a living entity is at present pervertedly transformed into priti for obje ctsof the senses. In this condition one should endeavor to follow pr a t yag gati for-attaining one s constitutional duties. Under the influence of the false ego, theliving entity accepts a form made of material elements and their qualities and withan irreligious mentality and the help of the senses experiences happiness anddistress. This material attachment is called the current of parag. I n other wordsone s internal feelings are improperly flow in g externally. When this curr ent isbrought back from external objects, it is called the current of pratyak Th e m e t.hodby which this is achieved is called sadhana bhakti.

This current is so powerful that it is not possible for the mind tocheck it.

When attachment is absorbed in material objects, how can it experience ahigher taste> Therefore Vaisnavas, who are the well-wishers of all living entities,have devised a process for dovetailing material objects with Krsna consciousness.A lthough the creation of Maya is a perverted reflection of the pure Absolute Tru t h ,she is the maidservant of the Lord and always engaged in His service. So if onedesires to worship Krsna through Maya, she abandons her adverse aspect andaccepts that worship with respect as a devotee. This is the great mystery of theVaisnava faith.

People whoenjoy eating grains can eat maha pra-sada that has been offered to the Lord, and inthis way practice the pratyak current of the tongue. Similarly, those who are fondof hearing can hear the names and pastimes of the Lord and thus practice thepratyak current of the ears. In this way they gradually engage their senses andsense objects in the service of the Lord and thus increase their internal current ofraga by providing their senses a higher taste. This is called sadhana bhak-ti. In orderto deliver the living entities from the atheistic mentality of,\"I am the enjoyer,\" SriMahadeva, who is worshiped by all Vaisnavas, has established in the tantrasdsfferent methods such as lata sadh-ana, vamacara, viracara, and pasvacaraUltimately, Sri Mahadeva has established the Supreme Lord as the enjoyer and theliving entities as the enjoyed and created a platform from w h ic h on e can achieve ahigher taste from material sense objects.

But in bhava-bhakti theactivities of the spiritually reflected subtle body, being very close to the subtleexistence of the soul, are more prominent than gross bodily activities. In thissituation one's bodily requirements dimin ish and one's desire and endeavor toattain prayojana become very strong.

Meanwhile Shree Krishna had been bornin Kansa's prison and had been conveyed by His father Vasudeb to the house ofHis foster parents Nanda and Yasoda in Braja during the night of His advent. Theguards of the prison had failed to detect the movements of Vasudeb who hadreturned to his prison with the new-born daughter of Yasoda with whom he hadexchanged His own Boy with out the kn o w l e dge of Yasoda herself. Vasudeb hadc arried Krishna in his arms across the flooded Yamuna lashed into fury by th etempestuous weather of that moon-less night. He had waded on foot the deepwaters which had been turned into yawning w h i r l p o ols by the fury of the tempest.The iron chains, bolts and locks of the barred gates of the prison had opened oftheir own accord on the approach of Vasudeb carrying Krishna to the home of Hisfoster parents. The daughter of Yasoda was thereupon duly reported to King Kansaas the new-born dreaded eighth issue of Devaki. The King rushed into the prison-cell on receipt of the tidings for which he had been waiting thr o ugh long years ofsleepless nights. He was at first willing to spare the life of the baby as the prophecywas to the effect that he would be killed by a male-child, eighth issue of Vasudeband Devaki. But he thought of being relieved of all possible doubts on the point by"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"putting to death the new-born girl. As, however, King Kansa was on the point ofdashing the baby on the block she escaped from the grip of the King and disclosingherself as the Deluding Energy of Godhead as she remained visible for a short tim ein mid-sky, assured the King of the certainty of the birth of his fu t ure slayer butdissuading him from the fr u i t l ess attempt of avoiding his fate by the cruel murd erof innocent infants. Saying this Mahamaya disappeared from the view of theastounded King. Kansa was subsequently informed by the sage Narada that hisfuture slayer must have been born among the denizens of Braja and that if he wasmindful of his safety he should lose no time in taking drastic measures for nippingthe danger in the bud. This advice was relished by the blood-thirsty coward and hehad accordingly deputed the demoness Putana to kill by an unsuspected processa ll the new-born infants of the surround ing coun t r y .The demoness Putana accordingly made her appearance in Braja and presentedherself in the home of Yasoda during the absence of Nanda who was then inMathura to pay the tribute due from him to K in g K a n sa. The demoness hadassumed the form of a most beautiful matron w it h a m ost benignant aspect as sheapproached the couch where Infant Krishna had been put to sleep by Yasoda.Yasoda had noticed the unknown female as she entered the house, but did notsuspect any foul play. She accordingly watched the new-comer with out anya nxiety as she made her way to the couch of the Baby, took Him up in he r ar m sand offered her breast to the Infant to give Him suck. But the nip p les of Putana'sbreast had been tipped with the deadliest poison.The Infant Krishna was aware of the intention of the demoness and took hold ofthe breast of the monster with His supple Arms. The grip of the Infant was soterribly severe that it was enough to drive the demoness to despair of her life asshe was convulsed by the mortal agony of the pressure of Krishna's little Hands.The Infant then applied His lips to the breast of Putana and sucked away her life inan instant. The terrible monster bellowing with p ain was compelled to disclose herown huge, loathsome demoniac form as she fell lifeless on the ground coveringwith her hideous carcass a long distance with Infant Kri shna still clin ging to herpoisoned nipples.Accordingly the first act of the mil k m a i ds, who with Yasoda rushed to the spot,was to snatch the Infant Krishna from the breast of the terrible demoness. Thenthey all marveled how the Baby could escape unhurt from the clu t ches of thedemoness. They attributed the safety of the Infant to the mercy of the gods whoare specially kind to the helpless. The affrighted milk m a ids invoked the help of allthe gods and goddesses for their continued protection of the Infant .M eanwhile, Putana was saved by her service to Krishna for having offered Him th esuck of her poisoned breast. The author of the Bhagabatam is careful to mentionthat the good fortune of the demoness equaled that of Yasoda in as much as herbreast had been sucked by Krishna. Putana, therefore, attained to the eternal statusof the foster-mothers of the Supreme Lord in the Realm of the Absolute.T he above narrative of the Bhagabatam embodies a most important moral for th eseekers of the Absolute. But before offering the interpretations of the texts favoredby the former Acharyyas I would like to draw the attention of the reader to certainpossible misconceptions regarding the nature of the interpretations about to beoffered.There is a class of persons who insist on the texts being taken in their li t eral"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"worldly sense. Much ingenuity has been expended for extracting meanings thatm ay be satisfactory to the empiric jud gm ent of the int erpreters working by th i sliteral method. Their argument is not un i n t e l l i g i b le. As the revealed literatures areto be regarded as containing the information of the Absolute the language shouldbe regarded as part and parcel of the meaning of the text. From this conclusion th eliteral interpreters jump to the wr ong in f erence that it should be possible for theconditioned soul to ascertain the real meaning of the scriptures by sticking to th elexicographical sense of their actual wordings. This latter part of the argument isinapplicable to the subject which is transcendental. The words possess a doublemeaning. The lexicographic meaning refers to the entities of this world and is,therefore, inapplicable to the case. The esoteric meaning is not accessible to thegross senses and mind of the conditi oned soul. This is the great and insuperabledifficulty. The literal interpreters who follow the lexicographical meaning of thewords err grievously in overlooking this all-im p o r t ant consideration.The transcendental meaning of the words cannot be conveyed to the senses of theconditioned soul so long as he does not agree to follow the method of submissivelistening to the transcendental sound appearing on the lips of the pure devotee.There is a definite line of succession of the bonafide teachers of the truth. Th eb onafide teacher should be available sooner or later to the real seeker of the Truth .The bonafide Acharyya is not recognizable by the hypocrites and atheists who donot really want to serve Godhead. So long therefore, as the bonafide teacher doesnot manifest his appearance to the pure cognitive essence of the seeker of theAbsolute Truth it is necessary for the candidate for spiritual enlightenment toconcentrate on self-examination to be able to avoid harboring any lur k in g t r aces ofinsincerity. The words of the sadhu are also available, by his causeless mercy, forb earing the efforts of such candidates, for finding out th eir own i n s i n c erity .I t is by overlooking or deliberately neglecting to undergo this prelimin ary train i n gfor obtaining access to the transcendental meaning of all words that the literalinterpretationists who follow the or d i n ary lexicographical meaning of the words ofthe scriptures fail to understand the necessity of never deviating from th einterpretations offered by the self-realized souls to whom the transcendentalm eaning of the words is available. Those empiricists who, while foll o w ing th elexicographical and syntactical method of the literal interpretationists, do notscruple to read their own meanings into the texts under the impression that thescriptures and the products of the human brain liable to every form of error and,therefore, fit to be corrected by the equally erring caprices of other hypotheticalthinkers on the ground of allegations of error that cannot be proved, are disposedto think that the interpretations offered by the Acharyya are not scrupulouslyfaithful to the texts and offer allegorical explanations for supporting their ow nThese possible misunderstandings are stated to invite the attention of the reader totheir bearing on the following in t er pretation of the narrative of Putana based onthe exposition of the former Acharyyas heard from the lips of the bonafide teacherof the Absolute.

He is ever on the look-out for the Appearance of theTruth for the purpose of suppressing Him before He has time to grow up. This isno exaggeration of the real connotation of the consistent empiric position. Th ematerialist has a natural repugnance for the transcendental. He is disposed to thinkthat faith in the incompr ehensible is the parent of dogmatism and hypocrisy underthe guise of religion. He is also equally under the delusion that there is and can beno really dividing line between the material and the spiritual. He is strengthened inhis delusion by the interpretation of the scriptures by persons who are like-mind edwith himself. This included all the lexicographic interpreters. The lexicographicalinterpretation is upheld by Kansa as the real scientific explanation of theScriptures and one that is perfectly in keeping with his dread of and aversion ofthe transcendental. These lexicographical interpreters are employed by Kansa inputting down the first suspected appearance of any genuine faith in th etranscendental.King Kansa knows very well that if the faith in the tr anscendental is once allowedto grow it is sure to upset all his empiric prospects. There is historical ground forsuch misgiving. Accordingly if the empiric dom i n a t ion is to be preserved intact itwould be necessary not to lose a moment to put down th e tr anscendental heresythe instant it threatens to make its appearance in right earnest. King Kansa actingon this traditional fear is never slow to take the scientific precaution of debutin gempiric teachers of the scriptures backed by the resources of Dictionary andGrammar and all empiric subtleties to put down, by the show of spaciousarguments based on hypothetical principles, the true interpretation of the eternalreligion revealed by the scriptures. Kansa is strongly persuaded that the faith in th etranscendental can be effectively put down by emp i r i c ism if pr o mp t and decisivemeasures are adopted at the very outset. He attributes the failures of atheism in thepast to the neglect of the adoption of such measures before the theistic fallacy hastime to spread among the fanatical masses.But Kansa is found to count wi t h ou t hi s h o st. When K r i s hna is born He is foundto be able to upset all sinister designs against those who are apprised by Himself ofHis Advent. The apparently causeless faith displayed by persons irrespective of age,sex and condition may confound all rabid empi r i ci sts who are on prin ci ple averset o the Absolute Truth W h ose Appearance is utterly incompatible with t h edomination of empiricism. But no adverse efforts of the empiricists, whose ruleseems till then to be perfectly well-established over the minds of the deluded soulso f this world, can dissuade any person from exclusively follow ing the Tr uth w h e nHe actually manifests His birth in the pure cognitive essence of His soul.Putana is the slayer of all infants.

No human con t r i v ance can prevent thesePutanas from obtaining possession of the pulpits. This is due to the generalprevalence of atheistic disposition in the people of this world.

The churches have always proved the staunchestupholders of the grossest forms of worldl i n ess from which even the worst of non-ecclesiastical criminals are found to recoil.It is not from any deliberate opposition to the ordained clergy that theseobservations are made. The original purpose of the established churches of theworld may not be always objectionable. But no stable religious arrangement forinstructing the masses has yet been successful. The supreme Lord Shree KrishnaChaitanya in pursuance of the teaching of the scriptures enjoins all absence ofc onventionalism for the teachers of the eternal religion. It does not follow that th emechanical adoption of the unconventional life by any person will m ake him a fi tteacher of religion. Regulation is necessary for controlling the inh erent wor l d l i n e ssof conditioned souls. But no mechanical regulation has any value even for such ap urpose. The bonafide teacher of the religion is neither any product nor th efavorer of any mechanical system. In his hands no system has likewise the chanceof degenerating into a lifeless arrangement. The mere pursuit of fixed doctrin esa nd fixed liturgies cannot hold a person to the true spirit of doctr ine or li t u r g y .The idea of an organized church in an in t elli gi ble form, in d eed, marks the close ofthe living spiritual movement. The great ecclesiastical establishments are the dykesand the dams to retain the current that cannot be held by any such contrivances.They, indeed, indicate a desire on the part of the masses to exploit a spiritualmovement for their own pu r p o se. They also unmistakably indicate the end of theabsolute and unconventional guidance of the bonafide spiritual teacher. Thepeople of this world und erstand preventive systems, they can have no idea of theunprevented positive eternal life. Neither can there be any earthly contrivance forthe permanent preservation of the life eternal on this mun d ane plane on thepopular scale.T hose are, therefore, greatly mistaken who are disposed to look forw ard to th eamelioration of the worldly state in any worl dly sense from the worl dly success ofany really spiritual movement. It is these worldly expectants who become thepatrons of the mischievous race of the pseudo-teachers of religion, the Putanas,whose congenial function is to stifle the theistic disposition at the very moment ofits suspected appearance. But the real theistic disposition can never be stifled evenby the efforts of those Putanas. The Putanas have power only over the atheists. It isa thankless but salutary task which they perform for the benefit of their wi l l i n gBut as soon as the theistic disposition proper makes its appearance in the purecognitive essence of the awakened soul the Putanas are decisively silenced at thevery earliest stage of their encounter with N e w - b orn K r i s h na.

He represents evils that arepeculiar to boyhood. The neophyte is extremely susceptible to such evils. Theycannot be got rid of except by the Mercy of Kri shna. If one engages in the serviceof Krishna the juvenile vices are completely eradicated at an early stage.There is an English proverb that sowing of wild oats is inevitable at a young age.The term Pur i t ani sm' was originally coined to express the protest of boys andyoung men against any undue curtailment of the scope of enjoyment that shouldbe regarded as permissible to them. Boys and young men claim the right to bemerry and frolicsome. There is nothing objectionable and much that is of positivevalue in the display of these juvenile qualities. If the attempt be made to stifle thisinnocent play of the boyish nature under the impression that it is an exhibit ion ofs ensuousness and for that reason, as being as harmful as similar conduct on th epart of grown-up persons, the result is not assurance but discouragement, ofjuvenile innocence.T here are, indeed, black sheep and these should not be allowed to taint the wh o l eflock, for this purpose caretakers with full sense of their delicate responsibility arerequired to keep watch over them for ensuring the inn ocence ofb o y - h ood andyouth without k i l l in g t h eir j o ys. But with every precaution it has been foundimpossible to attain this double purpose.T he Scriptures say that it is not in the power of man to ensure the imm u n it y o fboys and girls from the blight of precocious sensuousness except by means of theservice of Krishna. This is declared to be the only effective and natural method. Letthe boys be exposed to the attraction of the Cow-Boy of Braja. They will soon learnto pick up His Company. They will easily realize that the Boy-Krishna can alonesave them from every form of danger to which they are exposed by the r i g ht ' oftheir juvenile nature.W hy should this be so> There is a very simple reason. Krishna does not limit H i sservice only to the middle-aged and old people. The Puritanic ideal of Godhead isa conception which owes its origin to persons who are elderly although honestlyenough anxious to establish the K i n g do m of G od ' on t his earth. But if you scratchthe thin coating on the surface of their sage and sober scheme as befitting their ageyou only detect the rotten arrangement for securing the maximum of sensuouse njoyment even for those very children who are to be brought up in t hi s v i r t u o u s 'way. If the child is allowed to spoil his health in boy h o od, th ink t h ese righteouspeople, he will not be in a position later on to enjoy the legitimate pleasures of thegrown-up man. Unless the young man husbands his resources of sense-capacity hewill also be a victim to premature old age. It is a policy of expediency ofpostponing a small present enjoyment for reaping a much larger measure of itthrough the long tracts of the years to come.The spurious Brahmacharya ideal as misconceived by its worldly supportersembodies this Puritanic outlook. The Scriptures, indeed, enjoin that every one"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"should serve Godhead from the womb. This is the real meaning of Brahmacharya.The ascetic practices that have come to attach themselves to the conception wereinterpolated into the Scriptures in order to ensure worldly values by this form oft he empiric method. The scheme requires that the laws of the growth of th ephysical and mental bodies should be observed and followed. Nature is regarded asthe kind mother who favors only those of her children who cu l t i v ate the filialh abit of prying into her secrets. Nature is supposed to be unable to avoid divulgin gher secrets to her inquisitive children although she is well aware that her childrenwill exploit this kn o w l edge for troubl ing herself by harnessing her to their service.In other words it is also assumed to be the duty of the kind m o t her to consent toput herself in chains in order to mi n i s ter to the sensuous appetites of her worthierchildren. Nature is assumed to be able to do good to her children only bys ubmitting to be the victim of th eir lu st .The practices of asceticism are really conceived in the epicurian spirit. The asceticd reams of obtaining the mastery over Nature by the method of contr o l l ing hi ssenses. If the senses grow callous to the temptations of the world the ascetic thinksthat he will have less chance of falling into the power of Nature. He has an ideathat when he will have perfected these defensive arrangements he will havebecome the real master of the situation. The Brahmacharin, according to theascetic point of view, is to pass through a period of training in severe abstinencew ith his guru in order to be fitted to discharge the duties of citizenship, which w i l lmake a great demand on his nerves and muscles with greater thoroughness. Thereis no reference to the service of Godhead or to any spiritual issue.We have had many occasions to explain that the spiritual is transcendental. Nomundane consideration can form any part of spiri tual training or con du ct. It is nota spiritual affair to be even able to control one's carnal desires. Such self-controlitself is, indeed, automatically produced by the awakening of the soul. But self-control itself is not therefore a function of the soul. The soul has nothing to dowith the senses. The soul desires neither sensuality nor sexual purity. The soul isnot a mere moral being. If Brahmacharya means a method of gaining moral powerit is wholly a mundane affair and is as such not only of no concern to the soul butis positively obstructive of spiritual well-being.This is bound to be so because the point of view of the soul is all-embracing. Thesoul rejects nothing. He regards nothing as redundant or useless. The soul has ause for everything. But the soul sees everything as it is really related to himself andto other entities. There is, therefore, no room for the temporary type of morality inhis relationships with the other entities. Everything is absolutely good on theplane of the soul. The scriptural Brahmacharya institution accordingly meansservice of the Brahman i.e. the Reality Who is always the Great and always theHelp. The servant of the Absolute is free from all delusion.Morality is a valued commodity only on th e pl ane of delusion. But it has no locusstandi on the plane where the conditions of existence are perfect.T ill the service of Godhead is realized it is impossible to be really moral in th esense of being needlessly and perfectly virtuous. If a person is causelessly virtuousin the worldly sense he or she will be a subject of easy exploitation for all th ecunning rascals of this world. This is so because morality as conceived by theempiricist, has a reference to the physical body and the changeable mind and is,therefore, liable to change so long as the conditions are not radically altered."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The empiric contriver of juvenile welfare strives to produce conditions that wil lfavor the growth and continu ance of the empiric moral aptitu de.

Certain other functi ons are reserved to Krishna.B atsasur cannot be killed by us. He is too strong for us. This is in keeping with t h eexperience of most educationists. Juvenile innocence is a necessity for both youngand old. One cannot acquire it by any artificial process. No person can alsoordinarily retain it after boyhood and youth. This is a real tragedy of human lif e.Juvenile innocence is desired on account of its enjoyability. But it should pr o p erlybe desired only for the service of Krishna. (The parent can have no higher dutythat to employ his boy in the service of Krishna by putt ing him u n de r the pr op erteacher viz., the pure devotee of Krishna. No parent is entitled to undertake thecharge of the spiritual training of his own boy. He is unfi t ted for the task by hismundane relationship. Once such relationship is grasped to be an obstacle in thew ay of juvenile training the necessity of sending the boy at the earliest opportuni t yto the proper teacher becomes self-evident. If the parent continues to retain hispaternal interest in the boy after he has been put to school for the above purposeh e will be only standing in the way of his boy s progress. The training is not for th eboy only but it is a training for his parents as well.)Boyish naughtiness is apt to be overlooked, nay encouraged, under the impressionthat it is his nature to be naughty. This opinion overlooks the all-imp o r t ant factort hat the training is intended for the welfare of the soul of the boy and not for th ejuvenile body or mind. The soul does not require to be treated with in d u l g ence. Heis neither young nor old in the w o r l dl y sense. The body and mind of the boy haveto be employed in the interest of the soul. Boyish naughtiness and boyish virtu eare alike unnecessary for the soul. It is necessary for the soul to be freed fromeither form of worl d l i n ess. The mundane nature of the boy is no less a clog to thew heel of spiritual progress than the adult nature of the grown-up w o r l d l i ng . Th eprocess of training is identical in the two cases as the soul is neither young norold.M uch irrational pity is wasted on boys who are employed from early infancy in th ewhole time service of Krishna, on exactly the same terms as grown-up persons."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Persons who affect much kin d n ess of disposition towards juvenile frailties professto be unable to understand why juv enile offenses are taken as seriously in spiritualtraining as those of adult persons.But the teacher in charge of the spiritual training of boys can perform his duty bythem only as the special agent of Krishna. If such a teacher choose to confide in hisown devices he is bound to be undeceived at every step. What he has really to do isto use the boy constantly in the service of Krishna. For this purpose it is necessaryfor the teacher himself to be a whole time servant of Krishna. It is only byabstaining to do anything that is not distinctively commanded by Krishna or Hi sreal agent viz., the Sat-Guru that the spiritual teacher of b oys can hope to be of anyhelp to his pupils.The so-called science of pedagogies requires to be thoroughly overhauled in orderto afford a free hand to the bonafide devotee of Krishna in managing youngpersons. The present arrangements based on the experience of this world and onthe hypotheses of an absolute causal relationship connecting each phenomenonwith the rest, by leaving out the reference to Krishna, can only realize the tragicp art of a quack lightly admini stering all the wr ong drugs to a patient smitten wi t ha mortal illness.The King of atheists Kansa is always setting the demon Batsasur to corrupt anddestroy the boys. The teacher of the young employed by the athiestical society isverily the agent of King Kansa. The atheist is afraid lest the boys are employed inthe service of Krishna. He is naturally anxious to prevent any acquaintance of theboys with Krishna. But if a boy has really found Kr i shna the nefarious attempts ofthe empiric teacher are powerless to destroy his innocence. If such a teacherperseveres in the fruitless attempt he will th ereby quickly br ing about his ownutter moral degradation and his sorry trick w il l also be fully exposed. Because inthis case it is Krishna Himself Who op p oses his wicked activities on behalf of Hisprotege.A s a matter of fact the concern of empiric educationists for ensuring imm u n it y o fboys from the blighting effects of precocity is altogether hypocritical. The empiri cpedant only wants the boy to grow a body and mind t hat w il l en sure greater andlonger scope for their worl dly use. He does not want that the worl dly use of hisb ody and mind should be curtailed in any way. In other wo rds he is on prin ci p l eo pposed to the employment of the healthy body and sound mind for any spir i t u alpurpose.

On a certain day while the cow-boys of Braja were"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"out pasturing their calves on the wooded banks of the Yamuna they happened tofeel thirsty and not kno w in g that the water of the lake had been poisoned byKaliya drank of its water which resulted in their in stantaneous death. On beingapprised of their plight Kr i s hna came to the spot and restored them to life.T hereafter Krishna got down into the lake with the in t en t ion of sport ing in i t swater. This enraged the hideous monster who fort h w it h c ame out of the depths oft he lake in the company of his adherents and fell upon Kr i s hna coiling Him up i ntheir great hoods for Kaliya was a thousand-hooded Serpent and his brood wereequally formidable.Thus attacked by Kaliya with his wh ole brood Kr i s hna appeared to faint awayunder their murderous onslaught. On seeing Him apparently slain by His enemiest he cow-boys and all the assembled milkmen fi l led the air with t h eir l o u dl amentations. But Krishna soon showed that He was quite safe and He forthwi t hclimbed up the hoods of Kaliya and began to dance on his thousand heads. Hedanced in an infinite variety of the most marvelous of figures. The pressure ofKrishna s Feet crushed the towering pride of the myriad-hooded monster. Kaliyalowered his hoods and vomited blood. But the Dance of Krishna did not cease.Kaliya was found tottering towards death when his wives came out of the lake andwith palms joined in prayer begged Krishna to spare the life of their husband. Theprayers of the wives of Kaliya who had faith in K r i s hna moved the Son of Nanda toh ave mercy on Kaliya. Krishna now desisted from His terrific Dance on conditi onthat Kaliya was to quit the lake at once and to betake himself to his original hom ein the island of Ramanaka. Krishna gave him His assurance that Garuda wouldnow do him no harm as he would respect the print of His Feet on hoods of Kaliya.The water of the Kaliya lake was now rendered immune from all po i son andbecame as sweet as it was before the advent of Kaliya.The taming of Kaliya is one of the Brindaban Pastimes of Boy-Krishna. Kaliya isthe type of cunning and malice. He is the embodiment of unr elenting cruelty.There is no place for Kaliya in the happy realm of Braja. Deceit and cruelty are aspoison to the artless loving nature of the denizens of Braja. It is quite conceivablefor the confiding chums of Krishna not to entertain any suspicion regarding themalicious intention of cruel and deceitful persons whose purpose is to poisonthem against Krishna. They may even unwit t i n gly fall into the counsel of such evilpersons. But Krishna is sure to rescue His Own from the wi les of His enemy.Nay Krishna has also a plan for curing the evil propensity of Kaliya himself. Theprocess consists in making him feel the touches of His Dancing Feet. But Kaliyaattempts to bear up against all curative chastisement. Instead of feeling the joy ofsupporting the Feet of Krishna on his nasty hoods the monster finds it im p ossibleto bear his good fortune with out u n d e r going the pangs of actual death. Even theloyal wives of Kaliya who desire the reformation of the monster and whose goodwishes for his well-being are the cause of Krishna s mercy towards him are at lastforced to intercede by a prayer for his banishment from the realm of Braja. But thepride of Kaliya had received a mortal check.The banishment of Kaliya from the lake of the Yamuna has a most importantspiritual significance. Those who have a purpose to create trouble among the puredevotees of Krishna by infecting their nature with th eir own m a l i c i ous dispositionmeet with a certain degree of initial success in their nefarious undertaking. Thisemboldens them to make a direct attack on Krishna Himself when He appears on"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"the scene of their depraved activities in order to restore the living faith of His Ow nbonafide associates.Those who are not exceedingly clever can never be servants of Krishna. But theservice of Krishna is also never available to those whose cunning is employed fordepriving Krishna of the fullness of His enjoyment. Kaliya and those who areactuated by a naturally malicious disposition are also styled clever in the ordinaryphraseology of this damned world. Such rascals may also have the impudence oft aking their stand upon the texts of the Scriptures by using their cunn ing in t h egraceless attempt of depriving Krishna of the service His Own. This kind ofconduct may also pass undetected and may even be regarded as possessing theperfect skill of confidential service. But Krishna is sure to expose the real nature ofthe villainy just at the moment when it has been successful in misleading His best-beloved ones.It is, indeed, very difficult to un d erstand the Ways of Krishna. Krishna apparentlypermits almost every form of offense to be perpetrated with im p u n it y against Hism ost beloved ones. This has the effect of providing an opport u n ity to Hi s Ow n f o rp roving their incomparable love for Himself and by means of this uniqu eexhibition of their love to defeat in the most frui t ful m a n ner the machinations ofHis worst enemies. The friends and chums of Krishna are offered to the malice ofcunning and relentless brutes in order to bring out the di fference between the twoand thereby enable the latter to desist from troub l ing the devotees of their ownaccord.But these brutes are never allowed to associate with the servants of Krishna evenafter they forego their malice towards them. They are eternally debarred from theservice of Krishna in Braja. But the touch of Kri shna s Feet makes a real differencebetween the recipient of His mercy and the other brutes. Kaliya is no longerregarded by Garuda as the enemy of Krishna. Kaliya is, therefore, allowed a placeamong the protected of Krishna.It does not follow that it is a paying business to poison the hearts of His servantsagainst Krishna which is sure to be rewarded by the grant of His protection. Yes,t his is so after the pride of the miscreant is thoroughly br oken by being trod up o nby Krishna Himself. His is thereby inspired with a most wh o l esome dread whicheffectively prevents him from tr y in g to br eed mischief among the bonafidedevotees by owning an unwi l l in g allegiance to Krishna and assuming the badge ofHis servitude by wearing on his head the print of His lo tus Feet.The mercy shown to Kaliya is so obviously and disproporti onately great in itsmagnitude in face of the extreme gravity of his offense that no rationalisticexplanation can do justice to its full beneficent significance."}]
