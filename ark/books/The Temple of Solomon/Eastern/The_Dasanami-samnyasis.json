However, my intention from the outset was simply to explore an institution that I believe is not only impor-tant within the religious environment of South Asia, but which has a great deal to teach anyone who engages with it on its own terms. No disrespect is intended either towards the Hindu tradition or saÒny§sÊ-s; but history sometimes reveals that which may be contrary to conventional understanding. It also needs to be stated that the general conclusions of the research presented in this book concern-ing the history of saÒny§sÊinstitutions may turn out to be quite wrong in crucial respects. Should anyone find fault with any of the information provided or present data that undermine the historical arguments presented, reasoned criticism is invited. Despite consid-erable reluctance, it was finally decided to present this study to the general reader.To this author, it is also undeniably evident that some s§dhu-s have acquired what may be described as ‘special powers’, however such complex phenomena may be characterised or explained. It is manifestly a consequence of the philosophy, discipline and religious perspective of the saÒny§sÊthat such powers may accrue. Although throughout this study attention has been devoted to the ‘wordly’ study of saÒny§sÊinstitutions and history, I would urge the reader to bear in mind that there exists another and more subtle dimension ofsaÒny§sÊlife, a dimension that I believe is beyond the means of any kind of conventional understanding or academic explanation:OÒ Namo N§r§yaÖa.clark_BIL25a.indd xi5/30/2006 1:58:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"table of contentsxiiclark_BIL25a.indd xii5/30/2006 1:58:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiiitable of contentsABBREVIATIONS(see the Bibliography for the editions of texts)ADh$pastambha-dharmasåtra(see Olivelle 1999)AREAnnual Reports on Indian EpigraphyARMADAnnual Report of the Mysore Archaeological DepartmentARSIEAnnual Report on South-Indian EpigraphyASIArchaeological Survey of IndiaAVAtharva Veda (see Griffith 1985)b.  bornBGBhagavadgÊt§BSBBrahma-såtra-bh§ßya(of“aØkara)BDhBaudh§yana-dharmasåtra(see Olivelle 1999)c.  circaC“VCidvil§sa-áaØkaravil§sa-vijaya(see Antarkar 1973)d.  diedECEpigraphia CarnaticaEIEpigraphia Indicafl.  floruitGDhGautama-dharmasåtra(see Olivelle 1999)HD“History of Dharmaá§stra(see Kane 1977–1990)l.  lineMBhMah§bh§rataMSManusmÜtir.  reignedR§mR§m§yaÖaRVŒg Veda (see Griffith 1973)“DV“aØkara-dig-vijaya(see M§dhava-Vidy§raÖya 1986)SVS§ma Veda (see Griffith 1986)UVAT Uttankita Vidya Aranya Trust (1985)VDhVasißãha-dharmasåtra(see Olivelle 1999)v.  verseYVYajur Veda (see Griffith 1927)clark_BIL25a.indd xiii5/30/2006 1:58:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"table of contentsxivTRANSLITERATIONTransliteration of Hindi terms generally follows Parikh (1996); for Sanskrit, Monier Williams (1994 [1899]), with the exceptions: ‘Ü’instread of ‘Üi’; ‘ß’ instead of ‘sh’. Personal, place names and other terms that occur in both Hindi and Sanskrit registers are not always transliterated consistently. For example, places such as Allahabad occur in the Hindi register as ‘Pray§g’, and in Sanskrit as ‘Pray§ga’; ‘renunciate’ is usually transliterated as saÒny§sÊ, as accords with the Hindi register and the Sanskrit nominative singular, in distinction from the common rendering of the Sanskrit, as saÒny§sin. Names of Indian states (for example, Maharashtra) and well-known cities (for example, Delhi) have been transliterated according to modern English conventions, while smaller places have generally been trans-literated according to Hindi conventions.A slightly unusual convention has been utilised in the text of this book, of adding a hyphen before the ‘s’ of plural Hindi and Sankrit terms. Although this occasionally results in the ‘s’ becoming detached from the term, owing to automatic formatting by the computer, an advantage gained is the clearer legibility of diacritical marks.clark_BIL25a.indd xiv5/30/2006 1:58:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"introduction1INTRODUCTION0.1Introduction to the Daáan§mÊ-SaÒny§sÊsThis book presents an account of the history and practices of Daáan§mÊs,1 or Daáan§mÊ-SaÒny§sÊs, one of the largest of the orthodox2 sects3 of South Asian s§dhu-s. S§dhu4 refers to someone who has, at least formally if not in practice, renounced family life and conventional means for making a livelihood. Under a guru, assisted by several Brahman paÖ·it-s, the candidate passes through the saÒny§saritual, the abandoning of ‘worldly’ life, an important constituent of which is the performance of the initiate’s own funeral rites. This relieves the renunciate’s family of any future responsibility in that regard. SaÒny§sa entails not only the formal renunciation of worldly life, but simultaneously initiates the renunciate into the lineage of the sect to which the initiating guru belongs. During initiation into the Daáan§mÊs (meaning ‘he who has [one of the] ten names’), a áaivasect,5the neophyte is given a new dÊkß§ (‘initiation’) name, the ‘surname’ being bestowed by an initiating guru with that particular Daáan§mÊ surname.6 The ten names are:1The Daáan§mÊs also refer to themselves as ‘Dasn§mÊ’, in conformity with the Hindi (as opposed to Sanskrit) rendering of the term.2In this context and throughout the book, the term ‘orthodox’ is used to refer to the principles, beliefs, doctrines, categories and behaviour which the Brahmanical tradition itself defines as orthodox, whether or not the objects of reference define themselves as orthodox or otherwise. This is simply to conform to a norm estab-lished by the continued textual and religious authority of the Brahmanical tradition within Hinduism.3The term ‘sect’ is commonly used to refer to various Indian orders. In the Indian context ‘sect’ does not necessarily have the late-mediaeval Christian con-notation of heretical opposition to orthodoxy, but simply that of a group of people with common religious beliefs, rituals and practices, even though some Indian sects (such as Jaina, Buddhist and C§rv§ka) did explicitly challenge Vedic authority.4Derived from the Sanskrit root s§dh, meaning ‘accomplish’, s§dhu also means ‘good’ or ‘virtuous’ in both Sanskrit and Hindi.5Mostáaivasects, including the Daáan§mÊs, perform the saÒny§sarite for initiates, while in most vaißÖavarenunciate sects, instead, a relationship is forged between the initiate and the redeeming deity. 6The intiates of the Agni akh§Ü§are an exception: they do not take one of the ten names, but one of the four brahmac§rÊnames (see Ch. 2.1).clark_BIL25a.indd 15/30/2006 1:58:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"introduction2Giri (‘hill’), PurÊ (‘town’), Bh§ratÊ (‘learning’), Vana (or Ban) (‘forest’), Parvata (‘mountain’), AraÖya (‘forest/wilderness’), S§gara (‘ocean’), TÊrtha (‘pilgrimage-place’), $árama (‘hermitage’), and Saras-vatÊ (‘knowledge’).7ThesaÒny§sÊacquires a new religious identity and is initiated into a parallel social world, with its own heirarchies and implicit codes of behaviour. In the case of a large renunciate sect, such as the Daáan§mÊs, the renunciate also has potential access to an extensive network of maãha-s (‘monasteries’) and §árama-s throughout India, which may provide food and shelter. According to tradition, besides his literary activity and his tour of India—hisdigvijaya—when he defeated a variety of opponents with divergent religious and philosophical points of view, it was the great advaita philosopher “aØkar§c§rya8 who founded or organised the Daáan§mÊ-SaÒny§sÊs and established four maãha-s (known as pÊãha-s) under the authority of his four main disciples, in the west, east, north and south of India at, respectively: Dv§rak§, in Gujarat; Jagann§thPurÊ, in Orissa; Jyoáimaãh, near BadarÊn§th in Uttaranchal; and either“ÜØgerÊ, in Karnataka, or K§ñcÊpuram, in Tamil Nadu.9 The ‘thrones’ (gaddÊ-s) of these pÊãha-s (also known as vidy§pÊãha-s, ‘seats of learning’) are occupied by pontiffs known as “aØkar§c§ryas who all trace their lineage back to $di-“aØkara, via his disciples. If “aØkara did indeed organise the Daáan§mÊs, it would have been the first Brah-manical order of ascetics. Although several scholars have commented that there is little evidence to support these claims of tradition,10 no one has yet proposed any alternative explanation for the origin of the order.The aim of this book is, firstly, to provide the most comprehensive account of the current structure and organisation of the Daáan§mÊ7The most common of the names are Giri, PurÊ, Bh§ratÊ and SarasvatÊ. The meaning of Bh§ratÊ and SaravatÊ, given as ‘learning’ and ‘knowledge’ respectively, is but the symbolic meaning attributed to those names by Daáan§mÊs.8Most scholars date “aØkara to between 788 and 820 CE, but there is still some controversy concerning his dates and what he may or may not have written (see Ch. 4.1). This “aØkara is also referred to as ‘$di’ (‘original’) “aØkara, to distinguish him from subsequent “aØkar§c§ryas.9The issue of the maãha-s supposedly founded by “aØkara is considered in Ch. 4.4.10Potter (1981:14) comments that no other Indian philosopher has been cel-ebrated in so many legends, and that it is difficult to differentiate traditional stories from fact.clark_BIL25a.indd 25/30/2006 1:58:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"introduction3order; this is undertaken in Chapters 1 to 3. Secondly, having pre-sented an overview of the various branches of the sect, the origins of the Daáan§mÊs are investigated in Chapters 4 to 7 from a variety of historical perspectives. It should not be expected that the results of the research undertaken enable the provision of a complete or exact solution to the question when the Daáan§mÊs came into existence as a distinct, recognisable sect. However, the standard claims of tradi-tion will be critically examined, and various religious and political developments will be explored, in order to indicate particular factors that may have led to the formation of the Daáan§mÊ order, most probably in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century.110.2Locating ‘the saÒny§sÊ’Before embarking on the presentation of the organisation and struc-ture of the Daáan§mÊs as a renunciate sect, a preliminary concern is to tackle the prevalent notion of a renunciate as a lone, wandering individual. It is apparent that the self-projection by the Brahmanical tradition of the image of the individualised, male saÒny§sÊ has been remarkably influential on a general understanding of the dynamics of Hinduism. It will be suggested in this section that this projection has contributed to several popular misconceptions concerning the life of saÒny§sÊ-s.12 This image, while bearing a partial reflection of social reality, nevertheless detracts from the significance of saÒny§sa being conferred on a candidate by a guru within a lineage that generally operates within the framework of a sect—however loosely knit—with its own identificatory markers.A related issue, also considered in this section, is the lifestyle of thesaÒny§sÊ. According to the ideal, as presented in texts, renunciates maintain celibacy and undertake austerities of some kind or other to purify the mind and body, in order to ‘realise God’ or obtain libera-tion (mokßa), an objective considered to be difficult in worldly life. There is, however, a complex of sociological and economic factors 11Unless otherwise stated, all dates in this book are CE.12SaÒny§sÊis often translated as ‘monk’, and maãha as ‘monastery’. These terms derive from the Greek monos (‘alone’) and monazein(‘to live alone’), thus reinforcing a notion of ‘aloneness’ (see Meister 1990), which, it will be argued, is not entirely appropriate in a South Asian (or even Christian) context.clark_BIL25a.indd 35/30/2006 1:58:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"introduction4implicit in reasons for initiation, and in the lifestyle of the saÒny§sÊ,who generally engages not only with members of his or her own sect, but with the wider world. It is to a consideration of the ‘lone ascetic’ and his or her lifestyle that we first turn. This discussion is followed by a survey of Daáan§mÊ-SaÒny§sÊs who are settled as a caste in various regions of India.From the early centuries BCE, the Brahmanical textual tra-dition provides us with an image of the Brahmanical ascetic. In works on Dharmaá§stra, the SaÒny§sa Upanißad-s and mediaeval texts on renunciation,13 we find a lone Brahmanical ascetic wandering from one Brahman household to another, typically collecting food from the womenfolk14 in his hands or other designated receptacles, when the pestles are silent and the cooking fires are but embers.15Open a tract or book on Ved§nta recently published in India, and there is considerable likelihood of seeing a picture of one of the “aØkar§c§ryas, portrayed as a living representative of the ancient Brahmanical practice of renunciation, saÒny§sa.16 The “aØkar§c§ryasconsciously identify themselves with ancient Vedic tradition and the four-foldvarÖaand§árama17 systems.18 As is well known, saÒny§sa 13See Ch. 3 for further details.14See Findly (2002).15Probably the earliest available evidence to be found in the Brahmanical tradi-tion for codes of conduct for ascetics is in the Aßã§dhy§yÊ, the grammatical treatise of P§Öini, usually assigned to the fourth century BCE. P§Öini (IV.3.110–111) refers to the bhikßusåtra-s (codes of conduct for mendicants) proclaimed by P§r§áara and KarmaÖda (see P§Öini 1987). The earliest clear formulation of a Brahmanical renunciate’s lifestyle is in the Dharmasåtra-s of $pastamba (2.21.7–17), Gautama (3.11–25), Baudh§yana (2.17–18), and Vasißãha (10.1–29), texts dating from around the third to the second centuries BCE (see Olivelle 1977:21; 1999:xxvii–xxxiv). For details of renunciation procedures in these texts, see Ch. 3.1. For a sum-mary of the lifestyle and rules for the ‘ideal’ Brahmanical renunciate, see Shiraishi (1996:27–135), and Ch. 3.4.16The Sanskrit term saÒny§saoriginated as a specific reference to the ‘throwing down’ or abandoning of the ritual implements used by Brahmans for their daily Vedic ritual, the adoption of an ascetic way of life, and the renunciation of social obligations or ritual duties in pursuit of ‘Knowledge’. The term saÒny§sa (‘renun-ciation’) occurs rarely in the Veda-s and Br§hmaÖa-s, and only appears once in the classicalUpanißad-s, in the MuÖ·aka Upanißad(3.2.6: liberation through “saÒny§sa-yoga”), one of the later classical Upanißad-s, composed in the last few centuries BCE (Olivelle 1984:127; 1996:xxxvii).17The§árama system became fully formulated within the Brahmanical tradi-tion by around the beginning of the Common Era, only incorporating saÒny§saas the ‘ideal’ fourth §árama in the final phase of its development (Olivelle 1978:28; 1993:103). Both Manu (6.33–36) and earlier dharmaá§stracommentaries—for example, clark_BIL25a.indd 45/30/2006 1:58:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"introduction5is the fourth §árama, ideally only suitable for ‘retired-from-Vedic-ritual’ older men who have produced at least one son. The previous “aØkar§c§rya of K§ñcÊpuram, for example, commenting on saÒny§sa(Candraáekharendra SarasvatÊ 1995:539), maintains that only a few (including, by implication, himself) “have the wisdom...necessary to skip two §árama-s” (that of the householder, gÜhastha, and forest recluse,vanaprastha). The “aØkar§c§ryas project themselves in the image of fourth-§árama saÒny§sÊ-s—austere, detached and committed to liberation—yet are the nominal heads of a large áaivasect that has had an intricate relationship with the economy and politics of India for many centuries, instances of which are explored in the latter part of this book.ThesaÒny§sÊ conceived in the stereotypical image of the lone Brahmanical renouncer is often supposed, in various ways, to repre-sent an ancient ‘individualistic’ ascetic tradition receding into India’s remote past. References to what appear to be ascetics (though this is disputed)19 with varied nomenclature in ancient Brahmanical texts, Baudh§yana (2.11.16–27)—emphasise the importance of producing children before renouncing. The stage of forest dweller (§raÖyakaorvanaprastha)—also, like saÒny§sin,a relatively late development—was incorporated into the scheme as an §árama, but seems in practice to have had relatively little import in the general organisation of the ideal stages to be passed through. It seems to have become obsolete in the first few centuries of the Common Era, its memory only preserved in legend, poetry, drama, and works on dharma which still discussed it up to mediaeval times. A modi-fication of the system, as seen in the Y§jñavalkya Dharmaá§stra (3.56), permitted a man to renounce without passing through the third §árama (Olivelle 1993:174). For references in Manu, see ManusmÜti(1983), Doniger and Smith (1991); for Y§jñavalkya Dharmaá§stra, see Y§jñavalkya SmÜti(1913) and Dutta (1987, Vol. 1).18See, for example, Candraáekharendra SarasvatÊ (1976; 1995).19There is still disagreement among scholars as to whether before the so-called ‘axial age’, in the sixth to fifth centuries BCE, asceticism existed in South Asia as a lifestyle, rather than as inherent periodic regimens of asceticism undertaken within the Brahmanical ritual world, such as undertaken by the yajam§nabefore the final bath (avabhÜtha). For the limited periods of Brahmanical asceticism, see Kaelber (1989:78); Lubin (2001). Amongst the most currently influential scholars of ancient Indian asceticism are Heesterman, Olivelle and Bronkhorst. Heesterman (see par-ticularly 1985:34–43) famously argues that ‘orthogenetic’ developments in Vedic sacrificial ritual led to the individuation of the sacrificer, and then the ‘interiorisa-tion of the ritual’ and the concomitant abandoning of Vedic rites in the person of the renouncer. In contrast, Olivelle’s thesis, developed in a number of publications (1980a; 1980b; 1984; 1993), is that, essentially, asceticism, as a lifestyle within the orthodox Brahmanical world, began as a parallel development within the Vedic world in the fifth to sixth centuries BCE. According to Olivelle, Brahmanical asceticism did not develop out of the Vedic ritual complex (as Heesterman maintains), but clark_BIL25a.indd 55/30/2006 1:58:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"introduction6if accepted uncritically, might also lend support to the notion of an individual ascetic. In the Veda-s, for example, there are references tomuni-s20 and yati-s,21 who seem to exhibit classical features of asceticism and aspects of shamanism.22 The terms muniandyati are still used in the Brahmanical tradition to refer to ascetics.23 In the second century BCE, Patañjali (the grammarian) refers24 to the yati(3.1.97.82),muÖ·in(1.1.1.42, ‘shaven-headed’) and áramaÖa25 (2.4.12.2, neither was asceticism a feature of what might be called an ‘ancient shamanic cul-ture’ that, according to some scholars, was evident in the Indus Valley culture of the third millennium BCE. Olivelle (1993:13; discussion at SOAS, 22.02.01) main-tains that muni-s,yati-s and v§taraáana-s who appear in the Vedawere not ascetics (as they appear to be), and that the meaning of the terms changed. Bronkhorst (1998) cogently argues for two distinct streams in ancient India, but does not speculate on ancient origins. For a comprehensive review of opinions on the origins of Indian asceticism, see Bronkhorst (1998:1–9).20Themuni(‘silent one’) is mentioned twice in the earlier portion (Books II–VII) of the Œg Veda: VII.51.8 (muniriva); VIII.17.14 (månÊn§Ø s§kha); and once in the S§ma Veda(I.3.2.4.3). In the well-known keáin(‘long-haired’) hymn of the Œg Veda (X.136), unmadit§(‘intoxicated/frenzied/ecstatic’)muni-s (v.3) are described (for references in theVeda-s, see Griffith 1927, 1973, 1985, 1986). Eliade (1972:407–411) believes this passage indicates affinities, but not a strict identity, with classical shamanism. Werner (1989:35–45) maintains that the keáin muni is “a spiritual personage of very high stature” who lives predominantly outside Brahmanical culture, practising meditation (man) and what came to be later known as the yogic life of the renouncer.21RV (VIII.3.9; VIII.6.18; X.57.7); SV (II.3.1.22.3); AV (I.2.5.3; II.20.9.3). Doniger (1981b:14) compares the yati with a shaman or magician. Mythologically, theyati-s are identified as an ancient race of ascetics who took part in the legend-ary creation of the world, and are connected with the BhÜgus, a group of ancient, mythical beings who are sacrificers, renowned for the bringing of fire to men, and also associated with funeral ceremonies, the underworld and eschatology. BhÜgu became identified as one of the seven Üßi-s, who are the archetypal seers and sages who transmitted the Vedaand revealed the Pur§Öa-s, and who are perhaps closer to shamans than any other figures in Indian literature, including yogin-s. The Üßi-s are usually depicted similarly to the classical áaivaascetic, dressed in deer-skin or bark-cloth, their bodies smeared with ashes, their hair uncut, matted and tied in a knot. See Griffith, AV (1985:270); Macdonell (1974:140); Bhattacharji (1970:1); Mani (1975:139–141); Goldman (1977:5); Mitchener (1982:187–188). For the inclu-sion of BhÜgu within the tradition of the seven Üßi-s, in, essentially, two lists, see Mitchener (1982:4, 30, 126).22For attempted definitions of shamanism, see also Basilov (1999:25–30); Blacker (1999:24–26). 23Another class of ascetics referred to in the Br§hmaÖa-s and Atharva Veda (XV) are the enigmatic vr§tya-s, variously interpreted as a yogin-s, mystics, áaiva-s, nomads, cattle-raiders, non-§rya (see Eliade 1969:103), Vedic sacrificers (Heesterman 1963), or a semi-military sodality with similarities to European death-cults (Bollée 1981).24Vy§karaÖa-mah§bh§ßya(ed. Kielhorn, 1892, 1906, 1909).25The term áramaÖa(‘ascetic striver’) has the same root as ‘shaman’ (Blacker clark_BIL25a.indd 65/30/2006 1:58:54 PM"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"introduction7p. 476), without distinguishing them. Another term for an ascetic that occurs in the Br§hmaÖa-s and$raÖyaka-s is v§taraáana (‘living on wind’ or ‘girdled with wind’),26 a person who is described as bothårdhvamanthin27 andáramaÖa. In the epics, residents of hermitages (§árama-s) are also sometimes identified as áramaÖa-s,28 Manu, who wrote around the beginning of the Common Era, uses several terms for ascetics: yati,29muni,30bhikßu(‘beggar’),31ty§ga(‘renunciate’) and parivr§jaka(‘wanderer/circulator’), terms that had been used for ascet-ics in the older Brahmanical texts. Manu also refers to the state of renunciation as parivr§jya/pravrajya, saÒny§saandty§ga, without dis-tinguishing these as different kinds of asceticism or renunciation.32It is somewhat difficult to determine the difference between these kinds of ascetics, but Manu’s concern is with saÒny§saand how that relates to other phases of a man’s life: he—as a Brahman—is not concerned with the aims and activities of non-Brahmanical ascetics, as any other ethnic group were considered to be áådra-s,33 and hence ineligible to renounce.Manu is the first Dharmaá§straauthor to use the term saÒny§sin (Bronkhorst 1998:24),34 by which he refers to the fourth-§áramarenun-ciate, who is characterised in the image of the ‘ideal’, lone, begging 1999:23–24), and by the time of Aáoka (mid-third century BCE) is generally used to designate all non-Brahmanical ascetics, particularly Jainas and Buddhists (Oliv-elle 1993:11). 26In the TaittirÊya$raÖyaka(2.7) (of the Black Yajur Veda)v§taraáana denotes a áramaÖawearing coloured clothes, who has control over the senses, leads a chaste life and practises austerities. The TA is also the first Brahmanical text to use the termáramaÖa (Olivelle 1993:13).27The term årdhvamanthinmay refer to an erect penis (as a synonym for årdh-valiØga) or to the control of sperm (Olivelle 1993:13).28R§m, I.1.46, I.13.8, III.69.19, III.70.7.

Concerningterminology, it seems that in Brahmanical sources the older terms for renunciates, such as parivr§jaandparivr§jaka (‘wanderer/circulator’) eventually became replaced with the cover-all term, saÒny§sa (Olivelle 1984:140).33“By failing to perform rituals or seek audiences with priests, the following castes of the ruling classes have gradually sunk in the world to the rank of servants: the ‘Sugarcane-boilers’, ‘Colas’, ‘Southerners’, ‘Kambojas’, ‘Greeks’, ‘Scythians’, ‘Quicksilvers’, ‘Chinese’, ‘Mountaineers’, ‘Precipice-dwellers’, and ‘Scabs’ ”(MS,10.43–44, trans. Doniger).34See, for example, MS, 1.114, 5.108.clark_BIL25a.indd 75/30/2006 1:58:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"introduction8renouncer, as presented in the Dharmasåtra-s. It is this characterision of what ‘the saÒny§sÊ’35 represents that seems to have cast an interpreta-tive shadow up to the present day.36 From the period preceding Manu until now, it seems that the status of many ascetics and ‘renounc-ers’ was and is far more phenomenologically and socially complex than the ideal conception might lead us to believe.37 For example, it is generally assumed that once someone has renounced, then the condition is permanent. However, in the Yama-saÒhit§(Dutta 1987, 35Similar conceptions of the ‘ideal’ Buddhist monk have also been challenged by Schopen (1997), who has published a series of influential articles on the differ-ences between the textual representation of the activities of Buddhist monks, and their activities as revealed through inscriptions, the latter indicating the widespread involvement of monks in a variety of ‘worldly’ and ritual activities.36The theme of the ‘individual’ renouncer was famously articulated by Dumont (1960) in his seminal and influential article ‘World Renunciation in Indian Reli-gions’.(See also Dumont 1998:184–187, 273–282). For useful critiques of Dumont, see Kolenda (1975) and Quigley (1999:21–53), who both suggest that Dumont never fully faced the relationship between social interaction and ideology. The ‘ideal’ lone renouncer is also a common motif in many recent works on Hinduism. Basham (1967:159, 175), Hopkins (1971:82–83), Fuller (1992:17), Lipner (1994:298), Klostermaier (1994:50), and Brockington (1996:198), for example, assume that the renunciate is ‘beyond’ caste and ritual (as that is the presentation of the saÒny§sÊsupplied by Brahmanical texts). Although these scholars have a sophisticated under-standing of the Hindu tradition, nevertheless ‘the renouncer’ is generally presented divorced from the sect within which his or her life is embedded, with the concomi-tant social hierarchies, caste-restrictions and social obligations. It is also apparent that the image of the saÒny§sÊin the western world was significantly influenced by Vivek§nanda’s presentation within the general framework of what is generally known as ‘neo-Hinduism’. By the 1890s the notion of the saÒny§sÊhad gained unprecedented significance, as a quintessential bearer of India’s spiritual culture (see Halbfass 1988:217–246; Chowdhury-Sengupta 1996; Radice 1998). However, ironically, Vivek§nanda’s cabin-class journeys to Europe and the USA, and the establishing of foreign advaita maãha-s, is almost the antithesis of the lifestyle of the traditional ancient Brahmanical ascetic. See Pagborn (1976:117) for the establishing of Advaita Ashrama maãha-s.37A similar idealisation by Dumont of the role of the Brahman and the king (juxtaposed with the saÒny§sÊin terms of power, purity and caste) has also been criticised on several fronts. On kings and Brahmans, see Derrett (1976); on the ‘ideal Brahman’, see van der Veer (1997); Quigley (1999:54–86). Van der Veer (1998) observes that, far from aspiring to a ritually pure state as the ideal exemplar should, the Brahmans of Ayodhya maintain a complex set of relations, in terms of financial exchange, with the rest of the community and visiting pilgrims. He chal-lenges (1998:xiv) a prevalent idea, articulated in various forms in Dumont (1960), Heesterman (1985), Parry (1985), and Fuller (1992), that “there is a contradiction in the Brahman’s priesthood, [that] the ‘ideal Brahman’ renounces the priesthood and the dependence on donations. I shall argue that instead of limiting our research to values we should look at behaviour”.clark_BIL25a.indd 85/30/2006 1:58:56 PM"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"introduction9Vol. 2:282) there is a penance prescribed for a Brahman mendicant who wishes to become a householder,38 indicating that, historically, saÒny§sawas not necessarily permanent. We will also see (in Chap-ter 1) that—in a modern context, at least—the caste background of the renunciate loses little of its significance after saÒny§sa, and that specific sectarian identification is a crucial component of the saÒny§sÊ-’s identity.From the Brahmanical perspective, saÒny§sais, by definition, to enter a non-ritual state, and only possible for those twice-born (non-áådra-s) with the ritual implements, fires and formulae to renounce. However, those Brahmans or other twice-born wishing to renounce had already been initiated into the Brahmanical world through the upanayana39 ritual when they earned the right to participate in ortho-dox ritual life and received their sacred thread.40 An important issue is whether the other kinds of ascetics mentioned in the ancient texts referred to were—as a general rule—initiated into some kind of ascetic tradition.Many commentators on life in ancient India distinguish between, essentially, two classes of ascetics, br§hmaÖa-s and áramaÖa-s. They were clearly distinguished by early Jaina and Buddhist sources,41 and also by Megasthen¿s (4th century BCE), who provides some of the earliest recorded visitors’ impressions of India. Megasthen¿s made a distinction between two kinds of ‘philosophers’: the br§hmaÖa-s, following the br§hmaÖaritual life, and the áramaÖa-s,42 the ‘strivers’ for liberation.43 Both kinds of ‘philosopher’ practised asceticism, the br§hmaÖa-s less extremely, but the áramaÖa-s intensely, “undergoing active toil, and by the endurance of pain being able to remain motion-38He should perform three pr§j§patya and three c§ndr§yaÖapenances, becoming again purified with the j§ta-saÒsk§raand other saÒsk§ra-s, previously referred to in the text. See Ch. 3.1 for an explanation of the penances.39For details of upanayana, see Prasad (1997).40This is theoretically discarded during saÒny§sa, but see Ch.1.41See Bronkhorst (1998:78–88); Thapar (1996:56–93). Skurzak (1948; 1967:202–210) argues for three types of ascetic.42See McCrindle (1877:97–103 [Fragment XLI; Strabo XV.1.58-60]).43Megasthen¿s also distinguishes between two kinds of áramaÖa-s.The Hylobioi lived as celibates in the forests, subsisting on leaves and wild fruits; they were the most respected and “advised” kings. The other kind (next in honour) were the physicians who were “engaged in the study of man”. Besides these, there were the diviners and sorcerers who went around begging in towns and villages.clark_BIL25a.indd 95/30/2006 1:58:57 PM"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"introduction10less the whole day”.44 Patañjali (the grammarian) noted the extreme and innate hostility between the br§hmaÖa-s andáramaÖa-s.45 The two kinds of ascetics were also distinguished in Aáoka’s inscriptions46(mid-third century BCE); by Strabo47 (19 CE); by Bardesmanes of Babylon48 (second century CE); by the Chinese Buddhist scholar, Hüang Tsang49 (seventh century CE); and by Alberuni50 (eleventh century CE). According to Brahmanical norms women are not entitled to renounce51—having not passed through the saÒsk§ra-s, they are 44Zysk’s research (1998) reveals how Indian medical knowledge was also developed between 1,000 and 200 BCE by wandering áramaÖa-s uninhibited by Brahmanical restrictions on contact with such things as ‘impure’ dead bodies.45I.2.4.2 (Kielhorn edn., p. 476, line 9). Here, Patañjali, citing one of P§Öini’s rules, provides the phrase áramaÖa-br§hmaÖa as an example of a compound in which the component words refer to objects that were opposed to each other.46Edicts of Aáoka, Rock Edicts 3, 4, 8, 9, 11; Pillar Edict 7. The Edicts indicate a double class of religious people worthy of honour and donations (see Mookerji 1928).47Section 70: “The Pramnai (áramaÖa) ridicule the Brachmanes who study physi-ology and astronomy as fools and imposters” (McCrindle 1979:76).48He divides Gymnosophists into two sects: Bragmanes and Samanaioi (Strabo XV.1.58–60 [McCrindle 1979:67–68 fn. 1; McCrindle 1877:97–103]).49See Beal (1884).50He refers to the antagonism between Brahmanas and Shamaniyya (Buddhists), even though they are akin (Sachav 1996, Vol. 1:21). 51However, some Brahmanical commentary also provides evidence in support of the eligibility of women renouncers. In the JÊvanmuktiviveka (a fourteenth/fifteenth century text attributed to Vidy§raÖya, but see Ch. 6.4 of this book), it is stated that women, either before marriage or after the death of their husbands, have the right to renounce, subsist on alms, study the Upanißad-s, meditate on the Self, carry thetridaÖ·a(a form of the mendicant’s staff), and exhibit all the marks of saÒny§sa.References from Veda-s, Upanißad-s and the Mah§bh§rataare cited in support of this position (see Vidy§raÖya 1996:6–8). In his Yatidharmaprak§áa (61.39–44) (see Oliv-elle 1976–1977), V§sudev§árama (c.1625–1800) cites Vijñ§neávara (c.1100–1120), who cites Y§jñavalkya SmÜti (which in turn cites a såtra attributed to Baudh§yana, “strÊÖ§m caike...”) to the effect that, in some circumstances, a woman may renounce. V§sudev§árama states that the yatishould not associate with women renouncers (saÒny§sinÊ-s), even though some (such as Baudh§yana) declare renunciation also for women. The Arthaá§straof Kauãilya states that under some circumstances, such as in the case of a queen whose husband dies, women did in fact renounce. In the BÜhad§raÖyaka Upanißad(IV.5.3) there is also the well known case of MaitreyÊ, the wife of Y§jñavalkya, who announces her intention to renounce. Women renouncers were, however, generally regarded with disapproval by Kauãilya, Manu, V§sudev§árama and other orthodox commentators (see Kane HD“, Vol. 2:948; Olivelle 1977:24, 34, 175; 1984:115). Although these days women do not become saÒny§sinÊ-s in the “rÊ-VaißÖava order (see Ch. 2.1 fn. 7), there is evidence from the thirteenth century that they did so (Narayan 1993:282). For discussions of women and renunciation, see also Young (1987:68–70); Leslie (1989:318–321).clark_BIL25a.indd 105/30/2006 1:58:58 PM"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"introduction11technically equivalent to áådra-s—yet there is ample evidence of the existence of female ascetics,52 whether or not they had ‘renounced’.53P§Öini,54 Megasthen¿s55 and Strabo,56 who wrote in the period of the compilation of the Dharmasåtra-s, refer to both male and female áramaÖa-s (ascetic ‘strivers’).57From references in the Mah§bh§rataandKauãilya’sArthaá§stra(c.second century CE) it is also apparent that ascetics had a reputation for being useful to the state for a variety of nefarious activities, including spying and assassination.58Although there are abundant references to ascetics in South Asia—dating from the first millennium BCE until the present day—‘the 52WomentapasvinÊ-s and áramaÖÊ-s, such as VedavatÊ,“abarÊ and SvayaÒprabh§,appear in the R§m§yaÖa(III.74.7, IV.50.38, VII.17.2) and also in the Mah§bh§rata,where several devoted themselves to life-long austerities and remained unmarried (see Bhagat 1976:206, 263). They wore deerskins, matted locks and bark garments, kept their ‘senses restrained’, and practised righteousness.53Nothing, to my knowledge, is revealed anywhere in the Brahmanical tradi-tion about how women who were permitted to renounce did so. It would seem reasonable to surmise that they took saÒny§safrom a male preceptor, as is usually the procedure these days (see Ch. 1.1).54Aßã§dh§yÊII.1.70, VI.2.26 (see P§Öini 1987, trans. Katre).55Strabo XV.1. 60, citing Megasthen¿s (McCrindle 1877:103).56Strabo (Sec. II, 60, 70) refers to women who study philosophy with the ‘Sar-manes’ (áramaÖa-s) and remain celibate; and also (Sec. II, 66) to women philosophers who live austerely among the ‘Brachmanes’ (McCrindle 1979 [1901]:67, 76; 72).57Women were admitted into the $jÊvika order (Basham 1951:106) and early Buddhist order (Hüsken 2000).58In Kauãilya’sArthaá§stra, one of the recommended articles of state policy is to attempt to control all aspects of society, including ascetics. Olivelle (1987:42–59) notes that the Arthaá§stra(2.1.30–31) and Mah§bh§rata(XII.63.11–15) both state that government permission is required for entry into the ascetic life (only for vaiáya-s and áådra-s in the MBh). It is apparent from these texts that their authors considered wandering ascetics (particularly ‘fallen’ renouncers) to be the ideal spies: they should exhibit austerity (but may secretly eat), and events should, if possible, be arranged to make it seem that their predictions have come true, thus enhancing their status as visionaries and magicians. Ascetic spies (including women) were to be used by kings to infiltrate monasteries, provide a secret service, initiate conspiracies, and carry out assassinations. Ascetics are one of five kinds of people mention by Manu(7.154) to be used as spies. The dangers of ascetic spies, who are regarded with suspicion, are also evident in the Arthaá§stra. They are to be removed from the road the king is travelling along (1.21.26); they should only be granted an audience in the company of trusted armed guards (1.21.24); the queen was forbidden contact with ascetics, who were also notorious as go-betweens for lovers (1.20.18). Ascetics were to be arrested at state borders should they not be wearing or carrying the proper emblems of a renouncer (2.28.20); a close watch is maintained over their movements, and any kind of suspicious behaviour could lead to arrest (2.36.13–14); they are subject to a night-curfew (2.36.39).

An aim of this book is to examine the roles that saÒny§sÊ-s have played in various contexts, and to illustrate some of the social, economic and political circumstances that have impelled their activities and organisation, a survey of which illustrates to some extent the historical development of saÒny§sÊinstitutions. A related point, which also needs stating, is that ascetics, as a general rule in South Asia, are initiates into a sect. The archetype of the typical ascetic usually presented within the Hindu religious tradi-tion is a áaiva,59 usually covered with ashes, and renowned for the practice of austerities and the acquisition of extraordinary powers. “aivaascetics are attested in Brahmanical literature from the second century BCE,60 around the same time as the production of the first Brahmanical texts that deal with renunciation. It is apparent that ascetic ‘renunciates’ were not only ageing Brahman ex-ritualists. I would argue that although there are examples of individual lone renouncers, as a general rule, like initiated Jainas, Buddhists, $jÊvikasand C§rvakas, nearly all of the various kinds of non-Brahmanical ascetics mentioned in ancient Brahmanical texts would probably have been initiated in some fashion into an ascetic tradition by a preceptor within a lineage.61 This is true today and it seems improbable that it was otherwise in the ancient world, though this would be difficult to substantiate. The significance of initiation is the acquisition of a new religious identity (and usually sectarian markers), bestowed by the initating guru. The social, political and economic significance of initiation into a sect is simply dependent on the socio-political status of the sect at the time of initiation. However, whether as an 59The evolution of sectarian “aivism is discussed in Ch. 6.60The first textual references to “aivism are found in Patañjali’s Mah§bh§ßyaon P§Öini’s grammar, probably written in the second century BCE (Dyczkowski 1989:4). Patañjali (5.2.76, Kielhorn edition, 1906, Vol. 2:387) refers to “ivabha -gat-s, whom he describes as itinerant ascetics wearing animal skins and carrying an iron lance.61Thapar (1996:56–93) has commented that there are essentially two types of renouncer: one is the relatively rare ‘ideal’ lone ascetic; the other is an initiated member of a group. She argues that organised groups of renouncers (of the post-Vedic period) were not seeking to negate or alter society, but rather to establish a parallel society, as members of an order constituting an alternative lifestyle; a kind of counter-culture, often using social heresy to organise a religious identity.clark_BIL25a.indd 125/30/2006 1:59:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"introduction13individual or as a member of a sect, the role of the saÒny§sÊwithin the religious and social history of India is far more complex than the image represented by the archetype. Both within and between the various renunciate sects, a wide spectrum of behaviour, practice and lifestyle is apparent amongst renunciates. While most members of sects of s§dhu-s are avowedly celibate, other sects, such as the D§då, Gau·Êya, R§m§nandÊ and Vallabhac§rÊpanth-s (‘paths/sects’) also have married initiates. Within the Daáan§mÊorder, lifestyles range from that of the poor s§dhu undertaking austerities,62 to the privileges enjoyed by some of the Mah§maÖ·aleávaras63 and “aØkar§c§ryas (jagadguru-s, ‘world-gurus’), who (on occasions) display royal insignia.64 A typical Daáan§mÊmah-ant, an owner or proprietor of an §áramaormaãha, frequently has a demanding and complex occupation, managing the income, taxes, finances, repairs, food supplies, påj§, festivals and labour disputes of a large landed property. Successful maãha-s are run as businesses, which may expand to establish branch maãha-s; and wealthy establish-ments are sometimes the object of intense jealousy from other local landlords.65 In general, even poor s§dhu-s have much closer ties with the world than might be supposed from the ideal.66Since the seventeenth century, another term that has been used 62Depending on predilection and social factors, saÒny§sÊ-s may be more or less involved in the institutional life of maãha-s or§árama-s.Somes§dhu-s are referred to as vir§kt(meaning ‘detached’ or ‘indifferent’): they shun §árama-s and other such institutions, believing them to be contrary to the aims of saÒny§sa. (Viraktais also a generic name in south India for renunciates who belong to the VÊraáaiva sect.)63For the role of Mah§maÖ·aleávaras within the Daáan§mÊ order, see Ch. 2.4.64Such as at the great festivals of Navar§tri and “rÊ“§rad§mb§ Mah§rathotsava (but not at “aØkarajayantÊ): see Sawai (1992:170).65See Morinis (1984:89–96) for an account of the affairs of the mahant-s of the Tarakeávar temple in Bengal. He notes (p. 91) some cases of “extreme forms” of deviation from the ideal role of the saÒny§sÊ, including a couple of murder cases connected with mahant-s’ mistresses.66Formally,saÒny§sÊ-s renounce their families and the rituals connected to family life, ‘home’ and conventional means of livelihood. However, Tripathi’s statistical surveys (1978:98–109) reveal that 76% of s§dhu-s provide financial help of some kind to their families, and that only 20% earned their money mainly through begging, other sources of financial income being mainly from private offerings (26.6%), social services (19%), attention-catching devices (6.8%), landed property (4.8%), employment in an §árama (1.6%), dubious devices (1.0%), and miscellaneous sources (26.2%).clark_BIL25a.indd 135/30/2006 1:59:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"introduction14to refer to Daáan§mÊsaÒny§sÊ-s is gosain.67 Daáan§mÊgosain-s (non-monastic ascetics) are often but not always married, and many lead the lives of householders (gharb§rÊ-s), pursuing a variety of business, priestly and working activities. In the Daáan§mÊ context, the term gosainusually refers to saÒny§sÊ-s who have become semi-secularised and who have married, but who have retained a nominal allegiance to their hereditary order. In the final sections of this book, the activities ofsaÒny§sÊn§g§ gosain-s in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries will be discussed. Many thousands of militant n§g§ saÒny§sÊ-s (also known as gosain-s) were involved as mercenaries in numerous politi-cal conflicts in north India during this period, becoming wealthy as bankers and traders, and acquiring substantial property. The demise of their military activities around the end of the eighteenth century resulted in the settling of gosain-s, mostly in the Gangetic delta and several places in the Himalayas. Some Daáan§mÊgosain-s migrated and settled in south India.Ethnographic accounts dating from before Indian Independence typically treat Daáan§mÊ (or saÒny§sÊ ) gosain-s as a caste or an order engaged in a wide variety of activities, not only as mendicants (s§dhu),but also as priests, bankers, farmers, traders and mercenaries, thus illustrating the complex relationship that saÒny§sÊ-s have had with their social environment. Historically, it seems more accurate to consider the Daáan§mÊs as a caste or a sect with many facets, rather than as lone individuals.68 Writing on the castes of Mysore, Ananthakrishna 67Gosain(orgÙssain/gos§Ên/gÙs§yi/gosaeen) is also the name for heads of monas-teries of the vaißÖava Bair§gÊ/Vair§gÊ/R§m§nandÊ order, and of the followers of Vallabh§c§rya (1479–1531). One of the earliest recorded uses of the term is in the memoirs of Emperor Jah§ngÊr (r.1605–1628), where it is used to describe an ascetic with whom he had religious conversations (Clarke 1998:52). The term most prob-ably derives from the Sanskrit gosv§min, perhaps meaning ‘the master or possessor of a cow or cows’. Sad§nanda Giri (1976:57–59) suggests that gosainmay derive fromgo(‘sense-organ’) and sv§min(‘master’). The first six disciples of the vaißÖavaBengali mystic, Caitanya (1485–1534) are referred to as the six gosv§min-s—of VÜnd§van—(see De 1986:111–165; Dimock 1963:110–113), later followers being referred to as gosayi. (Followers of Caitanya constitute the Gau·Êya panth.) Certainly by the nineteenth century, the term gosain was used locally and by British com-mentators to refer to both áaivaandvaißÖavamendicants,fakÊr-s and yogis (Pinch 1996:43–44). Gosain-s are also referred to as atÊt(‘beyond’).68Partly in response to Dumont’s notion of the ‘lone-renunciate’, Burghart (1978; 1983a; 1983b; 1996) developed a thesis of two parallel hierarchies operat-ing within India: one essentially religious and one essentially political. Some of his central observations are that renouncers of various sects may be married or clark_BIL25a.indd 145/30/2006 1:59:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"introduction15Iyer (1930:256–258) remarks that one of the chief peculiarities of the GÙs§yis is that they constitute not only a religious order, but also a caste. Besides the caste’s natural increase from within, Brah-mans,kßatriya-s and women are also recruited (via initiation) to the order, which then excludes them—via rules of commensality—from their previous caste.69 Concerning the SaÒny§sÊs of the Panj§b and North-West, Crooke (1896, Vol. 2:274) remarks that “the members of the sect are supposed to be strict celibates, but of late not a few of them have taken to marriage, and still continue to beg though married”.70 Initiation into the Daáan§mÊs, whether the initiate subse-quently becomes a gharb§rÊ, a celibate living in a maãha, or a wander-ings§dhu, requires the performance of the viraj§-homa, the saÒny§sa unmarried, of various and differing caste restrictions, and intrinsically involved ‘in the world’ in various types of power, ritual and material exchanges. Regard-ing the Daáan§mÊs, the main thrust of Burghart’s thesis seems apt. However, we will see (in Ch. 7) that the mercenary, military, trading and banking activities of the Daáan§mÊs in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries transgress practically all boundaries between religion and state, and between religious and political heirarchies. The activities of the Daáan§mÊs—and indeed several other sects of renunciates in India—exhibit a complexity and diversity that seems to defy classification in any anthropological structural model. However, that said, the models of both Dumont and Burghart are particularly useful—and not invalid—as general frameworks within which the complex phenomena of renunciation may be initially apprehended.69Marriage between first cousins is prohibited, but widow marriage and divorce are possible. “Women are admitted into the order, when they have their heads shaved, assume the ochre coloured shirt and smear their bodies with ashes. These women are supposed to live in nunneries, leading a chaste and pious life. But many of them live with men of the order, and the sons born of such unions would be adopted as chelasor disciples of other GÙs§yis, who make them their heirs by reciprocal arrangement... During their visits to villages, they engage in intrigues, and ribald Gond songs sung at the Holi festival describe the pleasures of the village women at the arrival of a GÙs§yi owing to the sexual gratification they derive from him. Nevertheless they have done much to maintain the Hindu religion, and are thegurusor the spiritual preceptors of the middle and lower castes” (Ananthakrishna Iyer 1930:256–258).70“They are, as a rule, of a higher class than the Jogis, and their morality is of a higher order, but scandals about their enticing away the wives of rich Hindus are said to be not infrequent, though generally hushed up. The whole order is in theory devoted to contemplation and abstraction and abstracted from the cares of the world, and a large number of Sanny§sis are actually religious mendicants without wives and without money, who wear ochre-coloured clothes and distribute quack medicines, who refuse to touch a coin or to take in alms more food than will suffice for the day; but there are also many who work in business and are men of great wealth” (Crooke 1896, Vol. 2:274).clark_BIL25a.indd 155/30/2006 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"introduction16rite (see Ch. 3.3), which is theoretically irrevocable, yet there are counter-examples.71Samanta (1997:115) lists the thirty major castes of Ujjain, which include Gosains. Maclagan (1911:304–305) provides an account of the Gos§Êns of the Punjab and North-West, who are divided into celibates72 and others who “form a separate caste, as well as an order, and are known as Sanni§sÊs or Dasn§mÊs, because they are divided into ten schools...and may be regarded as a semi-secular-ised offshoot of the Sanni§sÊ order”. Sherring (1879, Vol. 2:339) describes the DowrÊ Gos§vÊs, found in central India, who profess to be Hindu, dress in the ochre robe, have no permanent abode, bury their dead, and who are known to steal crops, thieve and commit highway robberies. They are non-vegetarian, with the exception of beef, and keep weapons ready for use at night. In the west Bengal area, the festival of “ivar§tri is known in many places as g§janor ghambÊr§.Amongst the votaries of this cult of “iva are bhakta-s known assaÒny§sÊ-s (Sarkar 1972:73–87; Morinis 1984:98–102). These are villagers who, for the week-long duration of the festival—and for up to a month—take temporary vows (vrata) and are initiated (dÊkß§)into the lineage (gotra) of “iva as saÒny§sÊ-s. They follow preliminary dietary restrictions, are adorned with sectarian marks and shaved. A måla-saÒny§sÊ, who is the chief votary, is also required during celebra-tions. Those castes participating are often known in west Bengal as saÒny§sÊ-s, though there are no restrictions regarding caste or gender on those taking part, who may be householders with families, and even Muslims in recent times.Maclagan (1911:304–305) describes the saÒny§sÊgosain-s who settled at K§Øgra and Shimla in Himachal Pradesh (in the foothills of the Himalayas). In some places they became cultivators,73 gradually 71Reference was earlier made to the Yama-saÒhit§in this regard. I have also met a number of householders who had previously been saÒny§sÊ-s. 72The celibates are described as being of one of three kinds: first, the maãhdh§rÊ(‘head of a monastery’), whose dwelling (maãha) is in the village, and who may engage in all worldly pursuits but not marry; second, the §sandh§rÊ (‘someone who has a place’), whose house is on the outskirts of the village; third, the avdhåt (‘someone who wanders about begging’), who does not beg for more than seven hours in one place. Maclagan also claims that the fraternities who live in the maãha-s keep women.73Sad§nanda Giri (1976:57–59) comments that, besides celibate gosain-s, there are a large number of gharb§rÊ(i.e. married) gosain-s—who are also religious teach-ers—in the GaÜhv§l and Kullå areas of the Himalayas where, generally, they either clark_BIL25a.indd 165/30/2006 1:59:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"introduction17accumulating much wealth from both trade and usury.74 Maclagan notes that, in theory, the Gos§Êns were celibate and recruited to the order by adopting cel§-s from pure castes who may have been willing to dedicate their sons to them. However, in practice marriage was usual, married Gos§Êns being known as gharb§rÊ, and sons succeeded to the order by becoming cel§-s.At Sirsa, there is a separate caste of gosain-s, founded by “imbu$c§rj, most of whom are either ‘Giri’s or ‘Puri’s.75 Marriage in these Himalayan sub-orders is still usually endogamous.76 Steele, whose information was obtained in N§sik, Maharashtra, also maintains (1868:444) that a gharb§rÊgosainof the “ten sects” may only marry a female ‘Gosawnee’ if he wishes to remain a gosain.77 Exogamous marriage results in exclusion.78 While own temples or work in the fields as manual labourers. They are also to be found in Gujarat, where many own their own maãha-s,and also in Maharashtra, where they are very rich and own large properties. Such married gosain-s dress in white, maintaining only the turban in the traditional ochre colour. Their sons and daugh-ters are married within their own society. Married gosain-s are generally regarded as ‘outcaste’ by celibate Daáan§mÊ-s, who do not dine with them. Daáan§mÊmaãha-s and akh§Ü§-s usually have rules expressly forbidding the association of celi-batesaÒny§sÊ-s with women.74“The hill people, including their R§jas and R§n§s, were in their debt and they controlled all the trade between the hills and the plains. In their practice of usury they were rapacious to an incredible degree...To the power of capital they added the influence of their own sanctity and though the Gurkha invasions broke up their dominion they continued to exhaust the resources of the people in the Outer Sar§j tract of Kullu till quite recently. On the other hand the Gos§Êns of K§Øgra, who are principally found in N§daun and Jv§lamukhi, were an enter-prising and sagacious community engaged in wholesale trade. They monopolised the trade in opium and speculated in charas, wool and cloth. Their transactions extended to the Deccan and indeed all over India...they are now impoverished” (Maclagan 1911:304–305).75The gurus of these lineages were, at that time (1904), presiding over maãha-sin, respectively, B§lak and Kharak, both in Hissar district.76ThegÜhastha gosain-s of Himachal Pradesh, who are believed to have migrated from Rajasthan, marry within the same order but outside their own gotra(‘lineage’) (for example, a Giri may not marry a PurÊ). Divorce is granted on grounds of adultery, chronic mental sickness, impotency and cruelty, and a male or female divorcee may remarry (Sarkar 1986:245).77If a woman born to a gosainfails to marry by the age of seventeen she is obliged to pass her life in celibacy and may not become a disciple. However, once past the age of discretion, she may choose—and is apparently not coerced—to become initiated, which prohibits her from marriage. The natural son of a gosain, born to a woman even of áådracaste, has equal rights to those of an official cel§, after he has been initiated in the usual way. The initiation cannot, however, be performed by the father; the uncle or next nearest relative should officiate.78Divorce is said to be permissible only as a consequence of impotency, for-clark_BIL25a.indd 175/30/2006 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"introduction18there are exceptions, most gosaincommunities enjoy a relatively high caste-status, and are frequently amongst the largest land owners wherever they live.79Daáan§mÊs, some of whom are married, also serve as priests at many temples throughout India. Samanta (1997:30–31), for exam-ple, notes that the most venerated devÊtemple of Ujjain is that of Harsiddhim§t§, one of the fifty-two “aktipÊãha-s. The priests of the temple are gÜhasthaDaáan§mÊs who have served the temple for many generations. At Janakpur in Nepal, near the border of India, a suc-cession of ‘Giri’ mahant-s of the Daáan§mÊs has long managed the R§ma temple, said to have been founded by Catårbhåj Giri (Jha 1978:116–121). However, in general, gosain-s do not perform any priestly functions, most probably as many do not have a Brahman background. In gosainhouseholds, the functions of the purohitare generally performed by Brahmans who are not of their order. Also, in distinction from saÒny§sÊ-s, many gÜhastha saÒny§sÊ-s (gosain-s) wear the sacred thread.In some areas of Nepal there are many householder saÒny§sÊ-s, who are recognised in official surveys as being a caste. (In Nepal the termsaÒny§sÊis usually understood to refer to a caste rather than a renunciate, the term yogÊgenerally being used to refer to a s§dhu.)80malised by a divorce document (chor ciããhÊ). Interestingly, a childless wife—who is not a widow—of an absent husband may enter into what is known as a ‘left-handed/perverse’ (v§m) relationship with another man. However, she is obliged to go back to her husband, should he so desire on return. If the returned husband decides to stay with his wife, he should reimburse the lover for expenses, though he is not obliged to support any illegitimate offspring. Otherwise, the husband may relinquish his wife to the lover, annul the marriage, and receive payment from him. Adultery committed with any woman outside the order results in expulsion. Warden (1847:75) maintains that (female) ‘Gosawunees’ must marry before the age of fifteen; otherwise, without a satisfactory explanation, they are obliged to pass their lives in celibacy. Only in the Deccan are married gosain-s accepted by other Daáan§mÊs.“ådra-s are also said to be recruited in the south.79See, for example, Mayer (1960:80). In one (fictitiously identified) village in Madhya Pradesh, out of twenty-five castes, the gosain-s are second only to R§jpåts in terms of land ownership. Bhattacharya (1973:307) also comments on the gÜhastha gosain-s as a very repectable caste.80Frank (1974:90) records that in the district of Nawakot, just north of Kath-mandu, out of a population of 146,940, comprising twenty-two ethnic groups, the second largest caste—after the Tamangs, constituting 41.4% of the population—are thesaÒny§sÊ-s. In the mountainous areas surveyed—which only include a few of the mountainous districts—Giris (one of the lineages of the Daáan§mÊs) numbered 21,816 persons.clark_BIL25a.indd 185/30/2006 1:59:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"introduction19A caste of Giris living in central Nepal around sixty miles east of Kathmandu are the subject of studies by Bouillier (1976; 1979). According to local tradition, the ancestor of the caste was N§r§yaÖaGiri, a saÒny§sÊwith a kßatriyabackground, who came from Banaras and arrived in the village of Kattike at the beginning of the nineteenth century. He married and had children, and up to the mid-1970s there had been seven generations of saÒny§sÊ-s.81 In lifestyle and general culture, the Giris, according to their caste, are typical for the area (Bouillier 1979:32–58). However, they follow two distinctive saÒny§sÊcustoms, concerning initiation82 and funeral rites.83Bouillier (1978) has also examined the Articles of the Nepalese penal codes (Muluki Ain) concerning ascetics, those of 1853,84 1935 and 1963.85 The term j§tis used in two senses in the codes, one 81Kattike has a population of 2,895, of which there are 335 Giris in thirty-five houses. 90% of the Giris are descended from N§r§yaÖa Giri, and the saÒny§sÊ-s are a dominant caste in the village, in status slightly inferior to Up§dhy§ B§hun (Brahmans) and Cetri (or Kßatri). Over 90% of Giri marriages are within the caste. 17.85% of the Giris are polygamous, all are farmers, and they are non-vegetarian, but with some restrictions.82Formal initiation into the caste of Giris is in two stages (see Bouillier (1979:96–101). The first is the upanayana(bratabandha), which is performed by a Brahman purohit and follows the customary rites for twice-born boys. The second stage is thegurumukha, which is a rite distinctive to the Giris. The gurumukharite may be before or after marriage, and is performed identically for both boys and girls, who becomesaÒny§sÊ-s. In Kattike three people are considered ‘guru’ for the men, while there is one woman guru in Kattike for the women. Initiates receive the “ivag§yatrÊmantra, a trident (triául ), a staff (daÖ·a), fire-tongs (cimã§), a water-pot (kamaÖ·al), a small drum (·amaru), a seed (rudr§kßa) necklace, and Daáan§mÊ saÒny§sÊsectarian marks. Even though a ritual confirmation of the guru-disciple relationship is enacted, henceforth the guru plays no role in the life of the initiate. If a Giri has not received gurumukhabefore death, the mantra is whispered into the ear of deceased by the guru and a lock of hair is cut.83Technically, the renouncer is automatically liberated at death from the rounds of rebirth, and does not become a spirit or ghost (piá§c), thus freeing his family from the need to feed it. However, the Giris of Kattike observe funeral rites which are similar to those of orthodox householders (Bouillier 1976); see also Parry (1982:84–85); Prasad (1995).84Although there were earlier legal codes—notably, those of Jayasthiti Malla (1350–1395) concerning laws applicable to sixty-four castes; and the edicts (incomplete) of R§m“§h of Gorkha (1606–1633)—the Muluki Ain of JaØg Bah§dur R§n§, pro-mulgated in 1853, is the first code to legislate for the whole population of Nepal.85In the codes, ascetics are generally referred to either by the Persian term phakÊr,or as bheß dh§rÊ(a wearer of ascetic’s clothes), and specifically as saÒny§sÊ, bair§gÊ,ud§sÊ, jaØgamandseva·§, terms which refer to, repectively, Daáan§mÊ, R§m§nandÊ,Ud§sin (Sikh), VÊraáaiva and Jaina orders.clark_BIL25a.indd 195/30/2006 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"introduction20being ‘caste’ in general (including the particular caste a renunci-ate previously belonged to), and the other being the order (such as saÒny§sÊ) that the renunciate belongs to. Three categories of ascetics are considered in the code of 1853: ramt§, those always on pilgrim-age, who are assumed to be Indian; maãhdh§rÊ-s, who own or reside in a monastery; and gharb§rÊ-s, married ascetics (for whom, in this code, there is less information). All three types of ascetic may initiate disciples, but only maãhdh§rÊ-s and gharb§rÊ-s are subject to the pun-ishments prescribed for transgressions under the code. Trangressing ramt§-s, for nearly all types of offences, are shaved and expelled from the country. The two chief concerns of the legal code are (improper) initiation into the ascetic life (phakirsita mu·inya),86 and (improper) sexual relations. There is also a prohibition on renunciates perform-ing the bratabandhafor householders. Concerning sexual relations, the code makes no distinction between ascetic orders and other j§t-s in the general hierarchy of castes, no reference being made to the ascetic tradition or the ideology of renunciation which prohibits sexual relations. The code is not concerned with infraction of celibacy rules, but with infraction of caste rules of association.87 The revised penal code of 1935 contains many of the earlier provisions but also some changes.88 Only two categories of ascetic are mentioned, the 86To summarise some of the relevant proscriptions and penalties: initiation into renunciation is forbidden to impure castes; if a girl or boy who is under twelve years old should be initiated, then the initiator ( gharb§rÊormaãhdh§rÊ) is subject to three years in prison and the confiscation of property (or losing all rights at a maãh); initiation of a girl under sixteen (whether married or a widow) results in a one year prison sentence; no one may be initiated against their will, and an initiator will be punished for doing so; under specified circumstances, one forceably initiated may be readmitted to his or her caste, with appropriate rites.87In the hierarchy of castes, at the top are (‘pure’) Up§dhy§ Brahmans, under which, respectively, are •§kuri and R§jpåt, then Jaisi, T§g§dh§ri (kßatri), and Indian Brahmans. In sixth place, regardless of renunciate order, are the aforementioned renunciatej§t-s, ranking just under Jaisi. The bheßdh§rÊare considered as quite high caste and treated as such according to the law. The code specifies that if a Dasn§m (or another order of ascetics) has sexual relations with a woman of a caste higher than him, then, as a member of any other caste of similar rank, he is subject to punishment, the severity of which depends on the number of women violated, and the age of the girl. The most severe punishment, of ten years in prison, is for sexual relations with a girl under eleven years old. There are also provisions for the punishment of an ascetic who seduces a woman whom he has initiated (Bouillier 1978:141).88In general, the code of 1935 is more restrictive, in terms of caste and age, than the previous code concerning eligibility for renunciation; no one under eighteen clark_BIL25a.indd 205/30/2006 1:59:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"introduction21ramt§and the maãhdh§rÊ: thegharb§rÊis not mentioned.89 In the codes prior to 1963, renunciates were under the direct edicts of the king, who legislated against specific activities. However, that domain of influence only came to bear on the renunciate who had chosen to interefere in the ‘ways of the world’—such as the performance of bratabandhaceremonies for householders—a domain he is supposed to have renounced upon initiation. The enacting of legislation by the king nevertheless indicates the extent to which some practices of renunciates had become prevalent.This brief review indicates that Daáan§mÊmaãha-s are not only the seats of celibate saÒny§sÊ-s,90 and that a distinction between the gosain-s as a ‘caste’ and as a religious sect is not clear. A distinc-tive characteristic of a religious sect is obviously, but in a sense quite trivially, that the sect members are particularly ‘religious’, of whatever persuasion that may be. But a general survey of various Indian castes would reveal that, like the Daáan§mÊs, many castes trace years old may be initiated. In this code it is also stated (p. 146) that a husband of a woman initiated into renunciation by a bheß dh§rÊstill has the right to sleep with her, so long as she has not committed adultery, for which appropriate punishments are specified. However, a man of a lower caste who seduces a woman renunciate is liable to punishment. A husband may kill a saÒny§sÊwho seduces his wife, but not if the renunciate is a Brahman (Bouillier 1978:149).89The 1963 Muluki Ain contains only one Article concerning ascetics, in contrast to the several contained in the two previous codes. Initiation is still limited to those over eighteen, but there is no mention of of sexual prohibitions (or discrimina-tory punishments related to the degree of caste-rule violation) nor of a restriction on initiating men and women from lower castes, discrimination concerning caste having been abolished not only for renunciates but for all sections of society. In the new code the justice system only intervenes concerning the initiation of those under age. Bouillier (1978:150) remarks that, “En effet, ce nouveau code, fortement inspiré par les conceptions du droit occidentales, marque une nette rupture avecles codes antérieurs; dorénavant l’accent est mis sur l’individu, en tant que citoyen népalais, et sur l’égalité des droits de tous.” 90There have been several legal cases in the Bombay area (Kane HD“, Vol. 2:952), wherein it was decreed that a saÒny§sÊwho inherits a maãha, as a disciple of a deceasedmahant, does not forfeit his rights to the trusteeship of the property—which is invariably attached to a temple—should he subsequently marry. Bouillier (1997) examines a dispute that first arose in 1923, concerning the rights and property of the Kw§ãhaÖ·o (Baneávar Mah§dev)maãha, a Daáan§mÊsaÒny§sÊ maãhain Bhatgaon, near Kathmandu. The long-running dispute between the Kw§ãhaÖ·omaãhaand the state concerned rights to the property and the surrounding fields, but Bouillier discerns that central to the claims of the various protagonists was the issue of whether entitlement to the maãhaand its benefits should pass to another saÒny§sÊor to the son of the mahant.clark_BIL25a.indd 215/30/2006 1:59:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"introduction22their ancestry to semi-divine beings, contain sub-castes who often have a relationship with other sub-castes in terms of caste hierarchy and commensality, and who exhibit some features of hierarchical ordering not dissimilar to those of the Daáan§mÊs.91 While a general distinction may be made between married, semi-secularised gosain-s and celibate saÒny§sÊ-s, who do not usually inhabit the same social milieux, it is apparent from current and historical evidence that distinctions between gharb§rÊ gosain and celibate saÒny§sÊ-s become tenuous when the various contexts of the Daáan§mÊs are examined. Whether as a gharb§rÊ gosain or a celibate saÒny§sÊ, the initiate is a member of a community that has complex relations with the rest of society, which in many respects defy the archetype of the ‘lone’ saÒny§sÊthat is presented in ancient Brahmanical texts.0.3 Sources for this bookOf necessity, a wide range of textual (including hagiographic), eth-nographic and epigraphic sources are drawn upon throughout this book. The work of many scholars and commentators is utilised in the fields of several of India’s religious traditions, and in particular periods of the history of South Asia. Many of the insights presented in this study are not novel; however, the drawing together of research from such a wide range of areas has enabled a tentative reconstruc-tion of the historical formation of an identity for the Daáan§mÊs. Nearly all the available ethnographic accounts of the Daáan§mÊshave been consulted, including travel accounts from the Mughal period, British Government reports from the nineteenth and earlytwentieth centuries, and contemporary sources. A number of Hindi publications are availed of, which provide details of the organisation, structure and mantras of the Daáan§mÊs. Some of these publica-tions usually only circulate amongst Daáan§mÊ initiates, and I am very grateful to the s§dhu-s who made these available. Research was further informed by fieldwork conducted in 2001 and 2002.9291Gnanambal (1973:199), for example, observes how some of the castes of south India have substituted Sanskritic names for low-caste names, tracing their mythological origin to ancestors like S§gara, V§lmÊki and Jambava.92Thanks to generous grants from research organisations, I was able to attend clark_BIL25a.indd 225/30/2006 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"introduction23An ethnographic overview of the Daáan§mÊs is presented in Chap-ters 1 and 2, considering the subdivisions, hierarchies, caste and functionary positions within the order. The Daáan§mÊ order has two main wings, one being what might be called the monastic tradi-tion, represented by the daÖ·Ê-s, who are ‘staff-carrying’ saÒny§sÊ-s, the preeminent representatives of this tradition being the reigning “aÖkar§c§ryas. The other main wing within the order is represented byparamahaÒsa ascetics and (previously) militant n§g§-s93 (‘fighting ascetics’), the latter being organised in quasi-military divisions known asakh§Ü§-s (‘wrestling ring’). While considerable use has been made ofthe work of other scholars in the ethnographic domain, fieldwork has yielded many details of the organisation of the Daáan§mÊs, some of which were not previously apparent, particularly concerning the hierarchies and organisation of the akh§Ü§-s.The rites of renunciation and initiation are analysed in Chapter 3. References are made to the Dharmasåtra-s, the SaÒny§sa Upanißad-s and several mediaeval texts on renunciation. What is not apparent from a reading of dharmaá§stratexts—on which commentators on the Daáan§mÊ tradition generally rely for their understanding of saÒny§sa—is that initiation into the Daáan§mÊs via an akh§Ü§tran-spires in two stages. The first is the pañc-guru-saÒsk§r, wherein the neophyte acquires five gurus. The second stage of initiation is the performance of the saÒny§sarite, usually performed at a Kumbh Mel§, which brings together the two wings of the Daáan§mÊ order, with their own lineages, which generally have little contact with each other. Both the monastic and militant wings supply preceptors for the the Kumbh Mel§ in 2001, and the M§gh Mel§ in 2002, both held at Allahabad (for details of the Kumbh Mel§, see Appendix 3). These mel§-s (‘festivals’) being the preeminent calendar event for the Daáan§mÊs, it was particularly convenient for conducting interviews (in Hindi and English) and lengthy inquiries into the hierarchies, lifestyles and organisation of the various branches of the Daáan§mÊs. I was also able to inspect various Hindi publications found in libraries in Banaras, and others kindly provided by Daáan§mÊs from maãha-s and akh§Ü§-s in Allahabad, Banaras and Haridv§r. I also attended Kumbh Mel§s at Allahabad (1986), Haridv§r(1989) and Ujjain (1992). Between 1982 and 1996 I also spent around seven years visiting Hindu holy places (a total of around 250 religious complexes) in nearly all states of India, on several occasions travelling with s§dhu-s of various orders on pilgrimage, particularly to holy places in the Himalayas, where more than 2,000 miles were covered on foot.93From the Hindi naØg§, meaning ‘naked’.clark_BIL25a.indd 235/30/2006 1:59:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"introduction24performance of the saÒny§sarite.

Generally known as (“rÊ)Maãh§mn§ya-s,94 these texts were supposedly, but improbably, written by “aØkar§c§rya. In the Maãh§mn§ya-s, amongst other details, the ten Daáan§mÊ names are specified and attached to one of the four maãha-s putatively put under the direct charge of “aØkara’s four main disciples. It is apparent that the information in the Maãh§mn§ya-s provides the primary frame-work within which Daáan§mÊ identity is constituted, as no other textual or epigraphic source supplies the crucial details pertinent to the constitution and emic history of the order. The information in the Maãh§mn§ya-s, representing the locus of popular understand-ing of Daáan§mÊ history, is consequently central to the transmis-sion of Daáan§mÊ tradition, though it is argued that these texts are most probably not more than three or four hundred years old. The well-known claims of the tradition regarding the founding of four maãha-s and the organisation of a sect of saÒny§sÊ-s are contrasted with historical evidence and some legal judgements, revealing numerous maãha-s all over India which have at times claimed to be founded by“aØkara, and casting some doubt on the notion that “aØkara founded any maãha. The main sources for Chapter 5 are the hagiographies of “aØkara.Use has been made of the work of Antarkar and Bader (see Biblio-graphy), two scholars who have worked extensively on these texts. “aØkara’s own works are also examined, illustrating that “aØkara was almost certainly a vaißÖava, and not a áaiva as projected in the hagiographic tradition. An examination of the twenty or so extant hagiographic works reveals that the first mention of four maãha-s appears briefly in Cidvil§sa’s“aØkaravijaya-vil§sa, produced most probably in the late sixteenth or seventeenth century. How-ever, no mention is made of the founding of any maãha in the most popular of “aØkara’s hagiographies, the “aØkara-dig-vijaya attributed to M§dhava, written, at the earliest, in 1650. Further, no reference to“aØkara’s founding of the Daáan§mÊ order of ascetics is to be found in any of “aØkara’s genuine works, or hagiographic texts. 94These texts, also variously known as Maãh§mn§ya-stotra, Maãh§mn§ya-setu, MaãhetivÜtta,Maãh§mn§yaá§sanam and Mah§nuá§sanamare contained, together with translation, in Appendix 2.clark_BIL25a.indd 245/30/2006 1:59:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"introduction25References to the term daáan§mÊ appear to occur first in a couple of late mediaeval texts on renunciation, also produced, at the earliest, in the late sixteenth century.Within the Hindu religious tradition generally, and the Daáan§mÊworld specifically, “aØkara is intimately associated with the advaita maãhaat“ÜØgerÊ (in south Karnataka) which he supposedly founded. In Chapter 6, a detailed examination is undertaken of political and religious developments during the period of the Vijayanagara empire, which flourished in south India between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. The work of eminent historians of the period is availed of, supplemented by epigraphic research. It is argued that in the mid-fourteenth century, the early Vijayanagara rulers patronised what was, essentially, a ‘new’ orthodox áaiva advaita tradition, though this had little to do with “aØkara, who appears to have been relatively unknown in this period. In the image of their áaiva royal patrons, “aØkara’s hagiographers subsequently projected “aØkar§c§rya as an incarnation of “iva who vanquished heresy and reinvigorated the orthodox Brahmanical tradition. This established “aØkara’s reputa-tion as a great áaiva, even though it is apparent he and his immediate disciples were vaißÖava-s.As already mentioned, even the hagiographic tradition does not mention the founding of an order of Daáan§mÊ ascetics. If “aØkara did not found the Daáan§mÊs, then an explanation is needed as to how the sect came into existence. The final layer of the argument presented in this study, in Chapter 7, explores the context in which a Daáan§mÊ identity may have formed. A variety of sources show that between around the mid-sixteenth century and the end of the seventeenth century a number of groups of radical militant ascetics from N§th, Sikh-related and (nascent) ‘Hindu’ orders—including what was to become the militant division of the Daáan§mÊs—becameorganised in military units (akh§Ü§-s), largely as a consequence of state patronage. Relying on the work of specialists in Islam, the develop-ment of SåfÊ sects and lineages in India are explored in respect of their influential relationship with the dominant Islamicate orders of north India in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It will be seen how the organisation of SåfÊ lineages mirrors, in several important aspects, parallel features of Daáan§mÊ organisation. This analysis tends towards the supposition that influential SåfÊ institutions may possibly have provided both a contributory template and a political rationale for the organisation of the Daáan§mÊs, and the formation clark_BIL25a.indd 255/30/2006 1:59:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"introduction26of a distinct identity for an order of saÒny§sÊ-s; even though this cannot be conclusively demonstrated. In the formation of what is argued is a newly created identity, diverse lineages pertaining to both radical militant ascetics and advaita monastic traditions were merged into one order that gained its orthodox legitimacy from its putative inception by “aØkara. The integration of the two wings of the Daáan§mÊs—then§g§and monastic traditions—is apparent in initiation procedures. The sharing of common religious practices and sectarian markers, the identification with a distinct (advaita) philosophy, and the adoption of a common mythology—as reflected in the most popular hagiog-raphies of “aØkara and in the maãh§mn§ya-s—provide the substance for the identification of the Daáan§mÊs as a distinct sect. Although some Daáan§mÊ lineages may stretch back indeterminately, it is argued that particular political processes most probably impelled the formation of an identity for the Daáan§mÊs, resulting in the dissemination of the frame-structure of the maãh§mn§ya-s and the integration within one sect of disparate lineages of ascetics. It is possible that traditionalists might not only disagree with some of the findings of this research but also suspect that the author may have had something like Paraáur§ma’s axe to grind in the deconstruction of oriental saints (such as “aØkara), Hindu tradition or Indian his-tory. However, the author is aware of the extent to which not only religious but also social history has been ‘invented’ in practically all periods of human history in the service of various ideologies.95Even a cursory investigation into hagiography and constructions of various social and religious histories frequently illustrates broadly common processes in a variety of socio-political contexts.96 If we consider Ireland in the seventh century CE (approximately the time of“aØkara), it has been remarked that, “By and large, each dynasty had its own saint, its own foundation, on a principle resembling the 95In this regard, the popular work of Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983) might be mentioned in connection with some British traditions. This collection of learned articles illustrates the ‘invention’ of several ancient traditions, including: the kilt-wearing Highland tradition of Scotland (Hugh Trevor-Roper); the rediscovery of some ‘ancient’ (but, in fact, non-authentic) Welsh traditions in the eighteenth century (Prys Morgan); and the involving of royalty in British parliamentary pro-cedure (David Cannadine).96For studies in Indian hagiography, see Snell (1994); Granoff (1984,1988a,1988b); Schober (1997).clark_BIL25a.indd 265/30/2006 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"introduction27Continentaleigenkloster...Very clearly, the saints’ lives, as propaganda for the power and influence of their subjects, had a crucial role to play in aggrandizing specific monastic centres at (inevitably) the expense of others” (Stevenson 1995:25). Such remarks would be entirely appropriate to the discussion concerning the Indian monastic tradition,“aØkara and his Vijayanagara hagiographers (presented in Chapter 6).A final but important rider to the discussion is the consideration that the Daáan§mÊs and others who find their way into this book—whether as mendicants, mahant-s, mercenaries, scholars, philosophers, political envoys, traders, raiders, property-owners or bankers—are those who by their actions have found their way into history. Those who live more closely to the ideals of saÒny§sa—as lone renunci-ates undergoing austerities, far removed from worldly, economic and political life—and who constitute a significant proportion of saÒny§sÊ-s, leave little, if any, trace in history; perhaps just the pro-verbial and barely perceptible smoke of a fire on a hill. A kind of paradox is implicit in attempting to reconstruct the history of a renunciate movement from accounts of those who have left histori-cal traces: perhaps the true history of saÒny§sawould be simply an almost empty account. clark_BIL25a.indd 275/30/2006 1:59:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"chapter one28CHAPTER ONEBRANCHES OF THE DA“AN$M^ ORDERIn this chapter, the overall structure of the Daáan§mÊs is introduced from a contemporary anthropological perspective, examining the branches and customs of the sect in its constitution as an order of nominally celibate s§dhu-s. Although there are traditional Brahmani-cal restrictions that deny women the option of taking saÒny§saand renouncing, it is evident that amongst Daáan§mÊs and some other renunciate sects there is a significant number of women renunci-ates. Also briefly considered in this chapter is the issue of sectarian identity within the South Asian context, and the ramifications within recent Daáan§mÊ history.1.1 The Daáan§mÊ sect, as currently constituted, in relation to other renunciate sectsAs noted in the Introduction, there are three subdivisions of the Daáan§mÊs,1 namely: 1) the daÖ·Ê-s, who carry a staff (daÖ·a); 2) the paramahaÒsa-s; and 3) the n§g§-s (sometimes referred to as astradh§rÊ-s, ‘weapon-holders’), who belong to one of the seven Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s(‘wrestling rings’ or ‘military formations’).2DaÖ·Ê-s may be recognised by the daÖ·athat they carry, a stick that may be plain or embellishedand which usually has a piece of saffron cloth wrapped around it, under which is tied an axe-head and the sacred thread.3 Unlike daÖ·Ê-s, paramahaÒsa-s and n§g§-s do not carry the mendicant’s staff.4 Although 1See also Ghurye (1964); Tripathi (1978); Sinha and Saraswati (1978); Dazey (1990).2See Ch. 2.13ManydaÖ·Ê-s carry either a small liØga or a á§lagr§ma.“§lagr§ma-s are ammo-nites found in two or three places in the bed of the K§lÊ GaÖ·aki river in eastern Nepal, which are one of the most important emblems of VißÖu.

All the three branches of the Daáan§mÊs have a large network of maãha-s, spread throughout India, though most concentrated in north India, particulary in Banaras, Allahabad and Haridv§r. Most of even the largest §árama-s and maãha-s began as a simple dwelling of a s§dhu who had ceased travelling and settled, frequently after many years of pilgrimage to holy places6 throughout the Indian subcontinent.7Several scholars provide a general overview of around sixty sects ofs§dhu-s8 functioning in India in the last decades of the twentieth century.9 The greatest concentration of s§dhu-s, both now and for the last three or four hundred years, is to be found in north India, particularly in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The three largest sects of s§dhu-s are the vaißÖavaR§m§nandÊs and the áaivasects of N§ths and Daáan§mÊs.10 There are currently, perhaps, around one hundred thou-5Amongst the daÖ·Ê-s, the names used are TÊrtha,$árama and SarasvatÊ.

AraÖyasare rare, while Vanas, S§garas and Parvatas have practically disappeared.6ManysaÒny§sÊ-s (including the akh§Ü§-s) begin the year at the mel§(in January) at GaØg§ S§gar, east of Calcutta. Proceeding west, Paáupatin§th and Banaras are popular for “ivar§tri (in February/March), after which many follow the GaØg§ to tÊrtha-s in the Himalayas, for the summer. Autumn and winter are the seasons when saÒny§sÊ-s may go south, occasionally visiting some of the twelve jyotir-liØgam-s en route, finally reaching R§meávaram and Kany§ KumarÊ.7Before the introduction of passports in the early twentieth century, some s§dhu-s also travelled widely in Central Asia and the Middle East. See Duncan (1799) for a saÒny§sÊwho went to Russia and the Middle-East. See Bennett (1965) for an account of a saÒny§sÊwho walked right round the world.8Some of these sects also have a substantial lay community.9Sinha and Saraswati’s (1978:51) study was based in Banaras; Tripathi’s (1978:156) study conducted in Uttar Pradesh. Tripathi was initiated into both Daáan§mÊ (áaiva)and Nimb§rkÊ (vaißÖava) sects (samprad§ya-s) and conducted sociological fieldwork over several years during the late 1960s and 1970s. Samanta’s (1997:49–52) study was conducted in Ujjain. See Appendix 1 for lists of sects.10According to Tripathi’s survey of a relatively small sample of 500 s§dhu-s, the two largest sects are the Daáan§mÊ and K§nphaãa (N§th), each of which comprises around 12% of the s§dhupopulation. According to Tripathi, the next largest sect is the R§m§nandÊ (6.6%). However, van der Veer (1998:xiii) believes that the R§m§nandÊ sect has become the largest monastic order of North India. Sinha and Saraswati’s research (1978:51) revealed that in Banaras—the main stronghold of “aivism in India—the two largest ascetic sects are the Daáan§mÊ and the R§m§nandÊclark_BIL25a.indd 295/30/2006 1:59:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"chapter one30sand Daáan§mÊs§dhu-s in South Asia.11 Examples of female ascetics and renunciates in ancient India were referred to in the Introduction, and census reports from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries reveal that women saÒny§sin-s12 then constituted up to forty percentorders, the Daáan§mÊs having 610 initiates and the R§m§nandÊs 253. Statistics on s§dhu-s are notoriously hard to obtain, because where records are kept in maãha-s andakh§Ü§-s, information is rarely divulged.11Hartsuiker (1993:122) gives a figure of five million for the number of s§dhu-s, without, however, citing a source for that estimate. If that figure were approximately accurate it would indicate that s§dhu-s, at the time of writing, would have consti-tuted just under 0.5% of the population of India, which at the time was around 930 million. Crooke (1896, Vol. 2: 261) cites the Punjab report of 1891, which lists the number of Daáan§mÊ Gosains in forty-six places in north-west India, most of which are now in the state of Uttar Pradesh. 103,320 Daáan§mÊs are recorded, of whom 55,347 are male, and 47,973 are female. The total population of the province in 1891 is recorded as 46,905,085 (1896, Vol. 1: clix) of whom 623,506 are ‘Fakir’. According to these figures, Daáan§mÊs would have constituted approxi-mately 16% of the renunciate population of north-west India and 0.23% of the general population. These figures are not so different from the estimates arrived at for the percentages of Daáan§mÊs in relationship to other sects but would indicate a figure of approximately one half that of the figure estimated previously for the entire renunciate population.Briggs (1982:4–6) made a useful, if somewhat disorganised, survey of Govern-ment Census statistics concerning ‘Jogis’, ‘FaqÊrs’ and ‘Mendicants’. The census returns for 1901 (Census of India, Vol. 1, part 2, Tables, pp. 283, 288, 301) enumerate 436,803 Hindu FaqÊrs; 659,891 Hindu JogÊs; 43,139 Muhammadan JogÊs; 45,463 Hindu N§ths (K§nphaãa). This makes a total of 1,185,296 ascetics. According to the census, the population of India was at that time around 200 million, so ascet-ics would have constituted around 0.5% of the Indian population, a similar figure reached above by rough calculation for today. If Tripathi’s (1978:156) figure of 12% is accurate for the percentage of s§dhu-s who are Daáan§mÊs, and if we assume that the relative percentages of members belonging to the different sects remains approximately the same (even if the total number of s§dhu-s has declined since the time of Tripathi’s work in the early 1970s), then the total number of Daáan§mÊs§dhu-s would these days be around 600,000. However, this figure seems too high.An indicator of the possible size of the Daáan§mÊ population would be the fact that at the Ujjain Kumbh Mel§ in 1992, the Jån§akh§Ü§, one of the largest sub-branches of the sect, initiated around 3,000 new saÒny§sÊ-s (Hartsuiker 1993:64). Bedi andBedi (1991:85) comment that over 2,500 s§dhu-s were initiated into the Jån§akh§Ü§at the 1989 Kumbh Mel§ at Allahabad. Nearly all initiations into all branches of the Daáan§mÊs, through the saÒny§sa rite, are performed at the Kumbh Mel§s at Haridv§r, Pray§ga (Allahabad) or Ujjain, over a periodic cycle of (almost) twelve years. If, at a rough guess, bearing in mind the relative sizes of the sub-branches of the Daáan§mÊs, perhaps 7,000 or 8,000 men take saÒny§sa in total on each occasion, then every twelve years there would be around 20,000 to 25,000 new Daáan§mÊsaÒny§sÊ-s. Given an average lifespan of sixty or seventy years, a figure of around 100,000 would be reached.12Hindi:saÒny§sin; the term is Sanskritised by some commentators as saÒny§sinÊ,though this term is rarely used in classical sources.clark_BIL25a.indd 305/30/2006 1:59:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"branches of the daáan§mÊ order31of both the general s§dhu13 and Daáan§mÊpopulations in certain regions of India. These days, however, women saÒny§sin-s, who are usually referred to as m§Ê or m§t§-jÊ, may constitute perhaps between approximately two and ten percent of both the general s§dhuand Daáan§mÊ populations.14 Although there are still a significant number of women ascetic renunciates in South Asia, there are very few orders where the guru-parampar§is handed down from woman to woman.15Most of the orders and maãha-s that comprise women are dependent on male preceptors, who in several instances are Daáan§mÊs. There have been several studies of Hindu women saints, some of whom are ascetics,16 though relatively few devoted to female Hindu renunciates.17 Caplan (1973) describes a small group of Daáan§mÊm§Ê-s, all Giris, living in Duari in western Nepal. In this area most ascetics are unmarried women, saÒny§sÊ-s usually being a settled caste, only distinguished from other castes of a similar rank by particular customs of initiation and funeral rites.18 In the village of Duari, besides the women ascetics, there were twenty-eight Giris (2.2% of the village population) at the time of the study, in 1969.

According to the Censuses of 1901 and 1931, women constituted approximately 40% of the wandering ascetic population. Modern commentators, for example Denton (1981:212) and Hartsuiker (1993:62), give an estimated figure of 10%, or just under, for female ascetics, many of whom are widowed. Denton’s estimate is derived from a sample of 1,300 ascetics in Banaras, of whom 130 are girls or women. Sinha and Saraswati’s (1978) general survey of 1284 s§dhu-s in Banaras included 97 women (i.e. approximately one in twelve). However, it has been pointed out to me that estimates based on urban surveys may be significantly higher than surveys would reveal for India as a whole, which might indicate a much lower percentage of female renunciates than the 10% derived for Banaras.15Ramaswamy (1992:134) briefly mentions an example of a female precep-tor: Ven§b§Ê, a disciple of Samartha R§mad§sa (17th century), became head of a maãhaat Mir§j (in Karnataka). Also, it seems that the followers of the saint MÊr§b§Ê(15th/16th century) once constituted a sect of ‘MÊr§b§Ês’. See Sethi (1979) and Alston (1980c) for brief resumés of MÊr§b§Ê’s life. 16See Ramanujan (1973:111–142; 1982); Gupta (1991); Ramaswamy (1992; 1997). Very few women saints married, and almost all were initiated by males.17For the position of (women) s§dhvÊ-s/ár§vik§-s within Jainism, see Jaini (1991); Sh§nt§ (1997); Balbir (2002); Vallely (2002).18One such caste of saÒny§sÊ-s is discussed in the Introduction (see Bouillier 1976; 1979).clark_BIL25a.indd 315/30/2006 1:59:11 PM"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"chapter one32Bhairava.

The third community is of followers of $nanda MayÊ M§24 who live at the Kany§ PÊãha, founded in 1926. The women of the three communities live communally in maãha-s, under the guide of female preceptors,25 and dedicate part of their time to teaching in various schools. Traditionally, the orthodox Nimb§rkÊ order denies renuncia-tion to women, so they undergo an initiation ceremony that contains fewer syllables of the sacred mantra than either householders (lay 19Similar to the settled saÒny§sÊcastes of Nepal, the women are not of Brah-man caste, but the slightly inferior Jaisi caste. Despite being saÒny§sin-s, caste still operates amongst the women, in terms of commensality, purity and pollution (p. 181). They were initiated between the ages of nine and thirty-five, two of them being daughters of ascetics. Some had become ascetics due to marriage problems, and one was widowed.20See also Clémentin-Ojha (1985; 1988).21Followers of Nimb§rka, the twelfth/thirteenth century vaißÖava bhakta, who was born in Bellary, Karnataka, but spent most of his life in the VÜnd§van/Mathur§area; his philosophical system is dvait§dvaita, ‘difference-in-non-difference’.22One of the four vaißÖava samprad§ya-s (see Ch. 2.1, fn. 7).23Both“obha M§ and GaØg§ M§ were initiated by a Bengali, Sv§mÊ Santad§sK§ãhÊy§ B§b§ (Clémentin-Ojha 1988:WS-34).24A mystic (1896–1982) born in Kheo·§, East Bengal.

The female gurus (who are generally referred to as ‘M§t§jÊ’) are from the Daáan§mÊ, R§m§nandÊ, Nimb§rka and Vallabha samprad§ya-s. All were initiated by male preceptors. After $nanda MayÊ M§’s demise, “obh§ M§ became the most important female guru in Banaras, with around 1,000 disciples.

The order of $nanda MayÊM§ is ‘heterodox’—having a woman as preceptor—yet the women are initiated by male Daáan§mÊ priests, under the name of $nanda MayÊ M§ (Ojha 1984:208). It is believed that, during the ceremony, theáaktiof$nanda MayÊ M§ is transmitted to the initiate, who becomes a disciple of the guru. The women become brahmac§riÖÊbut are not fully ‘saÒny§sinÊ’ as they do not perform the second stage of initiation, the viraj§-homa.26 Nevertheless, the saÒny§sin-s have a higher status than lay followers. While generally dressed in the typical garb of a s§dhu, women renouncers do not usually wear any jewelry, as one of the signs of their renunciation. Sinclair-Brull (1997) and King (1984:75–79) provide accounts of the nuns of the “rÊ“§rad§ Maãha, and those of the R§makÜßÖa“§rad§ Mission,27 organisations that run parallel to, but function independently, of the R§makÜßÖa Mission.28 King (1984:79–81) also discusses several branch-orders of the relatively few women ascet-ics in other sects, those of the Sv§mÊ N§r§yaÖ, S§Ê B§b§ of “Êrdi, Brahm§ Kum§rÊs,29 and LiØg§yats.30 C.

Women must be over thirty years old to be initiated into the order; novitiate (brahmac§riÖÊ) vows may be taken after two years, and the full saÒny§sarite of renunciation after another five years. Then, (theoretically) irrespective of previous caste affiliations, the women initiates may perform Vedic rites. Founded in 1960, the R§makÜßÖa“§rad§ Mission (a sister institution) has eight more branches (five in Bengal, one each in Delhi, Arunachal Pradesh and Kerala). In 1981 it had 170 monastic members (King 1984:78). See McDaniel (1995) for a profile of a Bengali saÒny§sinÊ,Arcan§ M§ (b.1928) of the R§makÜßÖa order, who has a large §árama in Calcutta, inherited, unusually, from her male guru.28R§makÜßÖa himself initiated a woman named GaurÊ M§ (d.1938), who became a renunciate and founded an §áramafor women’s education in 1895 in Calcutta. It came to diverge in ethos from the R§makÜßÖa Mission, becoming orthodox in terms of caste and rites, and establishing a line of ascetic female initiates succeeding GaurÊM§. Another §árama (first called M§tÜ Mandir and then “§rad§ Mandir) was opened by Sudhira Basu (d.1920) in 1914 for women to practice renunciation. The §árama was under the authority of the R§makÜßÖa Mission until 1963. Vivek§nanda also seems to have initiated several women, but only through mantra. Proper saÒny§sa was not given to women until 1947, in the first western Ved§nta convent, founded in Hollywood in 1940 (King 1984:77–78).29See Babb (1984) for comment on the role of women in the Brahm§Kum§rÊs. 30The few female ascetics of the Sv§mÊ N§r§yaÖ order are called S§Òkhya YoginÊs; they live in a separate temple and follow their own guru. “rÊ Up§sanÊclark_BIL25a.indd 335/30/2006 1:59:12 PM"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"chapter one34daráan (‘vision/spiritual presence’) and an interview with Her Holi-ness Sadguru “rÊ Jñ§n§nandasarasvatÊ of Madras, a woman who was previously married, raising five children.

A few s§dhu-s practise more radical forms oftapasy§, not infrequently for a period of twelve years.44 There is a 39The most sought kind of coconut used is the extra large variety from the Seychelle Islands.40Ontapasin a Vedic context, see Knipe (1975); Kaelber (1989).41The acquisition of power, through tapas, is also used for immoral purposes. Historically,tapasis not essentially related to ethics, and its association with ‘pen-ance’ is misleading (see Rüping 1977). In the Veda-s and Br§hmaÖa-s,tapasis char-acterised—broadly—as heat, poetic inspiration, and the life-force born through the power of tapas, while in the Mah§bh§rata(MBh 1.25.10–18; 1.101.25; 1.166.9; 1.208.15–20; 1.36.8–19; 3.95.1–4) are to be found instances of powers accrued, and curses being exercised, through the tapasof a renouncer or ascetic (see Olson 1997:8–13). In the epics, tapasis seldom used for liberation, but for worldly gain (such as a son), revenge, status, honour, glory, and military success (see Holck 1969). For psychological interpretations of austerities, see Masson (1976); Cantlie (1977).42Vrata-s (‘vows’), particularly to fast on a particular day, are a general feature of traditional Hindu culture. See Kane (HD“, Vol. 5, part II:255–462) for an exhaustive list of around 1,500 different vrata-s. See also Dutt (2002). On women householders’ religious vows, see Babb (1975:110), who describes the solah somv§rvrat (the ‘sixteen Mondays vow’); McGee (1991); Iltis (1996); Pearson (1996).43The most common form of limiting diet is phal§h§r, technically fruitarian, but usually also consisting of milk, fruits, nuts, and—if a grain is consumed—r§md§n, a kind of reddish millet. The important point about a phal§h§rdiet is that all foodstuff may ‘fall’ into the recipients hands.44Practices include those when the s§dhudoes not lie down or remains seated (when he is known as khaÜeávarÊ), usually supported by suspended sling, or keeps one arm permanently in the air (årdhvab§hu).

He is usually buried with some cannabis leaves (bh§Øg)and a water-pot gourd. Salt and spices are thrown in to assist the process of putrefaction.46 Some time after the burial the saÒny§sÊ-’sdisciples will organise a meal (bhand§r§) for associated ascetics and Brahmans. Tombs and sometimes temples are erected over the graves of important heads of monasteries (mahant-s andmah§maÖ·aleávara-s) and worship of the sam§dhi continues. Mahant-s are occasionally entombed in stone coffins (taØka) which are thrown into the Ganges, notably in holy places along the river, such as Haridv§r, Banaras and Pray§g.

He utters mantras of the Lord’s name, with the aid of a necklace (m§l§) hidden under a cloth. In the following stages the number of smouldering fires is then increased to seven, twelve, eighty-four, and ‘innumerable’ fires. In the final stage a fire is lit in a clay pot (known as kap§r)and placed on the meditating ascetic’s head (kap§r), leaving him surrounded by fire. This form of tapasy§ is typically performed for three consecutive summers, usually only by s§dhu-s of the R§m§nandÊ order.

However, the J§b§la Upanißad(4)48 and Y§jñavalkya SmÜti (3.61)49 maintain that all twice-born (dvija:br§hmaÖa, kßatriya, vaiáya) may renounce. In the mediaeval period, Brahmanical commentators were still undecided as to whether only Brahmans or all twice-born were eligibile to renounce,50 an ambivalence also apparent amongst more recent commentators.51 The majority view is that the three higher varÖa-s are entitled to saÒny§sa.52 However, in the VißÖu SmÜti(5.115)53 and Y§jñavalkya SmÜti (2.241) a punishment is specified for those who entertain a áådra parivr§jakain rites for the gods or manes, indicating that, disregarding varÖaprescriptions, there were instances of áådrarenunciates, which seems to also pertain in more recent times.54 In a landmark ruling in 1980 by the Supreme Court, which is frequently reiterated, a áådra has the right to become a saÒny§sÊ.55 The judge-48See Olivelle (1992).49See Dutta (1987, Vol. 1).50See Olivelle (1977:33–34). V§sudev§árama, for example, in his Yatidharmaprak§áa(composed between 1675 and 1800), expressed both views.51See Sarkar (1958:65).52See Killingley (1991) for a useful discussion of varÖa,j§tiand caste, and how these categories have been interpreted by several influential commentators.53See Jolly (1991).54Sinha and Saraswati (1978:180) report that an $c§rya MaÖ·aleávara, Nar-siÒh Giri, had a highly educated disciple from the Kunbi caste (a ‘clean’ áådra caste). Steele (1868:440) remarks that if a person of too inferior a caste has through inadvertance been admitted to the order, should he be discovered he is branded with a hot coin and expelled. However, Thurston (1909, Vol. 2:299) notes that ‘GÙs§yis’ never marry, and that br§hmaÖa-s,kßatriya-s,vaißya-s and áådra-s may all become GÙs§yi. Crooke (1896, Vol. 2:260, citing Maclagan, Panj§b Census Report 1891:112) states that some lineages of Daáan§mÊs have lower-caste initiates. Rose (1914, Vol. 3:358) believes that originally only Brahmans were admitted, and that R§jpåts were subsequently admitted in the recruitment of n§g§-s.Vaiáya-s, who administered finance, were later admitted, and even men of impure ‘castes’. How-ever, Rose maintains that the order is mostly made up of Brahmans and kßatriya-s, and that caste restrictions concerning commensality are maintained.55The case (Krishna Singh v.

After initiation by an §c§rya-guru, the initiate theoretically loses his previous caste identification. Nevertheless, caste remains an important background element in the life of the saÒny§sÊ,56 as his pre-saÒny§sa caste position is often known by other saÒny§sÊ-s, higher caste initiates generally being accorded greater respect.Three of the four daÖ·Êlineages, namely the TÊrtha,$árama and SarasvatÊ, initiate only Brahmans57 and regard themselves as superior to the paramahaÒsa-s and n§g§-s. Bh§ratÊs are to be found amongst both daÖ·Ê-s, paramahaÒsa-s and n§g§-s, while the non-daÖ·Ê lineages appear to also admit lower-caste initiates. It seems probable that when theakh§Ü§-s first formed, most probably between the mid-sixteenth and mid-seventeenth centuries,58 lower-caste initiates were admitted asn§g§-s to some of the lineages. In accounts of events in northern India during this period it is apparent that it is the names ‘Giri’ (particularly), ‘Puri’ and ‘Bh§ratÊ’ which figure most prominently in n§g§armies.59 Many of these may have been recruited from lower castes (see Chapter 7).

Hartsuiker (1993:31) claims that $áramas are of solely Brahman backgrounds, and that Brahmans predominate in the TÊrtha, Bh§ratÊ and SarasvatÊ sub-sects. There are five main southern divisions (P§nc-Dr§vi·a) of Brahmans, who reside south of the river Narmad§ (with the exception of the Gujarati Brahmans who live to its north), and five northern divisions (P§ñc-Gau·a).

The five northern divisions are the S§rasvat (4), Gau· (15), K§nkubja (or Kanaujia or K§nyakubja) (5), Maiãhila (4) and Uãkala (3). There have, of course, been extensive migrations of all castes of Brahmans over thousands of years; and caste is sometimes contrived.

However there is a general tendency by informants to emphasise the Brahmanical nature of initiates, some akh§Ü§-s, such as the NirañjanÊ, claiming that all initiates are Brah-mans. The initiate should also be physically fit and without any disabilities, yet it is clear that there are exceptions.60 In general, it seems that apart from daÖ·Ê saÒny§sÊ-s, many s§dhu-s, particularly those wandering, are from lower castes.611.3 Subdivisions within the Daáan§mÊ order: DaÖ·ÊDaÖ·Ê-s are sometimes referred to as á§stradh§rÊ-s (‘scripture hold-ers’), or as daÖ·adh§rÊ-s, and constitute the monastic wing of the Daáan§mÊs.62 Many of them have some knowledge of Sanskrit, and their higher caste status is generally recognised (Tripathi 1978:64). They have a reputation for observing convention and conservatism (rå·hiv§dÊ), usually keep their hair cut short, and often maintain deep caste prejuices.63 They generally disassociate themselves from the Daáan§mÊs of the akh§Ü§-s, tending to regard only themselves 60Tripathi’s (1978:88) survey elicited a figure of 8.4% for s§dhu-s with dis-abilities.61The openness of renunciate orders to low-caste initiates varies from order to order. R§mn§mÊs§dhu-s, for example, are almost exclusively low-caste, while one branch of the usually strictly Brahmanical “rÊ-VaißÖavas, the s§tt§ ek§ki, were an order of celibate áådra ascetics who performed important ritual service at the Tirupati temple complex in the fifteenth century (Stein 1968:89). Lamb (2002:18 fn. 15) comments that although (daÖ·Ê)saÒny§sÊ-s are high-caste, many n§g§-s and other wandering s§dhu-s are low-caste.62During the M§gh Mel§ at Allahabad in 2002, I visited camps of daÖ·Ê-s for around ten days, interviewing numerous s§dhu-s.63See Sinha and Saraswati (1978:70): daÖ·Ê-s from one of the five main northern Brahmanical castes neither eat nor reside in the same maãha-s with those from the five main southern Brahmanical castes.Tamils and Keralites do not associate with members of either group of Brahmans. Further, amongst the gau·aBrahmans of Uttar Pradesh there is a further sub-division, the K§nyakubj—from Kanauj, one of the five main divisions of northern Brahmans, see Sherring (1872:23)—and S§ryåpari, who do not dine together in the maãha-s.DaÖ·Ê maãha-s also maintain certain rules about the succession of the gaddÊ.At the MachlÊbandarmaãha, only a Saryåpari/Sarjuparia (one of the five main divisions of K§nyakubj Brahmans) can accede, whereas the daÖ·Ê maãhaat Pushkar only appoints K§nyakubj ascetics.clark_BIL25a.indd 405/30/2006 1:59:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"branches of the daáan§mÊ order41as the ‘true saÒny§sÊ-s’.64DaÖ·Ê-s take initiation from a guru from adaÖ·Ê maãha, while paramahaÒsa-s usually take initiation from a Mah§maÖ·§leávara of an akh§Ü§. Common to both the monastic andn§g§traditions are a shared understanding of the founding and organising of the sect. Further, at times of initiation the two tradi-tions are united. The two traditions are not entirely distinct, though they are distinguished by their institutional independence and their different roles in India’s political and religious history.DaÖ·Êmaãha-s are nominally affiliated to one of the four (or five) main maãha-s (known as pÊãha-s) supposedly established by “aØkar§c§rya. AlthoughdaÖ·Ê-s generally acknowledge the affiliation of their maãha to a pÊãhawith some pride, apart from branch-maãha-s of the main pÊãha-s,daÖ·Ê maãha-s function independently, with no connection to thepÊãhato which they may be nominally affiliated.65 The greatest concentration of daÖ·Ê-s is to be found in Banaras where they have manymaãha-s,66 and where between approximately twenty-five and fifty percent of all daÖ·Ê-s are to be found (Sawyer 1993:159), form-ing approximately one fifth of the ascetic population.67 At the M§gh 64I have even heard daÖ·Ê-s remark that “we are not Daáan§mÊs”, emphasizing their non-identification with the akh§Ü§-s.65ThedaÖ·Ê-s whom I have interviewed regard the southern pÊãhaof“ÜØgeri as genuine and do not recognise the K§ñcÊpurampÊãha.66Sinha and Saraswati (1978:68–72) report 37 daÖ·Ê maãha-s in nine of the districts of Banaras, 23 affiliated to the “§rad§pÊãha, of Dv§rak§, and 14 to the “ÜØgerÊpÊãha.Surprisingly, none of the Banaras daÖ·Ê maãha-s are associated with the Govardhan pÊãhaof PurÊ or with the Jyotir pÊãhaof Jyoáimath. According to the scheme presented in the normative texts of the Daáan§mÊs, the Maãh§mn§ya,Mah§nuáasanam etc., the maãha-s of Banaras should be under the jurisdiction of the JyotÊrpÊãhaof Jyoáimaãh. Four of the maãha-s claim to have been established before the fifteenth century, whereas 27 were most probably built between 1800 and 1968. Only three daÖ·Ê maãha-s have been built since Independence, whereas the number ofparamahaÒsa maãha-s has significantly increased. Sinha and Saraswati calculate a total resident ascetic population (in distinction from the numerous permanently wandering ascetics) for Banaras as 1,284 (providing a ratio of 1 ascetic for every 250 people in Banaras), of whom áaiva saÒny§sÊ-s constitute 48.8%. DaÖ·Ê-s, num-bering 239, form approximately one fifth of the ascetic population. According to Tripathi (1978:67), in Banaras there are twenty-eight maãha-s managed by daÖ·Ê-sand fifteen managed by paramahaÒsa-s.The two groups are said not to be on good terms and do not take meals together.67Sawyer (1993:163), notes that maãha-s continually change, sometimes expanding and becoming more prominent—with new branches being established—under a dynamic head; or alternatively, rapidly declining after the demise of an influential leader.

The name given usually depends on which of the four main pÊãha-s the maãha—via which the candidate was initi-ated—is nominally affiliated to. DaÖ·Ê-s will have been initiated by adaÖ·Êguru, usually a Mah§maÖ·aleávara, but in rare cases directly by a “aØkar§c§rya at one of the four important pÊãha-s. 1.4 ParamahaÒsaLike all Daáan§mÊs, paramahaÒsa-s70 acknowledge that “aØkara founded four pÊãha-s, yet, similarly to the daÖ·Ê-s, their affiliation to apÊthahas virtually no practical relevance. However, their affili -ation to an akh§Ü§is significant,71 as it derives either from their own saÒny§sainitiation—performed by a Mah§maÖ·aleávara of an akh§Ü§—or from a historical connection, via the parampar§ of their guru, whose own guru or guru’s guru may have been in an akh§Ü§.ParamahaÒsa-s generally reside in maãha-s that have little connection or no connection with the life of the akh§Ü§, and apart from some no longer exist, while new institutions have arisen since the time of their study. Sawyer (1993:171) maintains that the largest daÖ·Ê maãhain Banaras is the MumukßuBhavan, established in 1929 by Sv§mÊ Ghanaßy§m§nanda. In response to various enquiries, I was informed, albeit unreliably, that there are perhaps 10,000 to 15,000 daÖ·Ê-saÒny§sÊ-s in India today.68For details of both the M§gh Mel§ and Kumbh Mel§, see Appendix 3.69The name ‘MachlÊbandar’ derives from a story about the land which is the headquarters of the maãha in Nagva, Banaras.

The maãhahas a total of fifteen properties, six in Banaras, and others at Haridv§r, SÊt§pur, Citrakåã, D§dri (Haryana), Karnal (Haryana) Kurukßetra and K§npur. The current chief guru is Kail§áa Bhus§r$árama.70In a number of classical texts, paramahaÒsais a term also used, in an idealised sense, to refer to the highest category of renouncer (see Ch. 3.4).71Sinha and Saraswati found that the 296 paramahaÒsa-s of Banaras are affili-ated to three akh§Ü§-s, the Jån§, NirañjanÊ and Nirv§ÖÊ (or Mah§nirv§ÖÊ), over 50% belonging to the Nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§.clark_BIL25a.indd 425/30/2006 1:59:20 PM"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"branches of the daáan§mÊ order43fewparamahaÒsa-s who may participate in the life of an akh§Ü§with a view to becoming n§g§—which requires a further initiatory rite—the inclusion of paramahaÒsa-s in the ‘military wing’ of the Daáan§mÊssimply stems from their initiation from an akh§Ü§. Although not usu-ally involved, paramahaÒsa-s may actively participate in the life of theakh§Ü§on certain occasions, such as during bhaÖ·§r§-s (com-munal feasts with the distribution of alms), which may be for a single akh§Ü§or for several together. They take place on particular holy days and when an ascetic succeeds to the gaddÊof the maãha,during which rite the successor is presented with a scarf (c§dar) by thes§dhu-s present.TheparamahaÒsa-s have the greatest number of ascetics and maãha-sin Banaras, the maãha-s comprising one fifth of all the maãha-s there (Sinha and Saraswati 1978:72–81).72 Seven of the paramahaÒsa maãha-sadmit women s§dhu-s (also known as avadhåtin),73 two of which are exclusively female, five being mixed male and female. All the m§Ê-s are reported to come from Bengal and Nepal. The author’s field-work has established that some also come from the Kumaun area of Uttaranchal. In contrast to the daÖ·Ê-s of Banaras, who run only one educational institution, the Dharma SaØgha“ikß§ MaÖ·ala, which is in decline, the paramahaÒsa-s run five Sanskrit p§ãhaá§l§-s.74 The significance of the prestigious role, financial viability and expansive programme of paramahaÒsaeducational institutions in the context of recent Daáan§mÊ history can be understood against the background of the militant history of the akh§Ü§-s, and the curtailment of their activi-ties. It seems that some individuals who had been actively involved in the mercenary activities of the akh§Ü§-s had accumulated considerable 72There are fifty-seven paramahaÒsa maãha-s, none of them established before the fifteenth century, over 82% appearing between 1800 and 1968, and thirty-nine instituted since independence. Of all the various ascetic institutions of Banaras (see Appendix 1), the paramahaÒsa is the fastest growing, a new maãhabeing founded, on average, every two years.73This term is sometimes used derogatorily, as an avadhåtinis traditionally the female partner of a Tantric practitioner.74The oldest and most efficient is the SaÒny§sÊ SaÒskÜta Mah§vidy§laya, run by the Aparn§thmaãhaand established in 1906 by Sv§mÊ Gobind§nandajÊ MaÖ·aleávara.The students who have passed through this institution include not only saÒny§sÊ-s but also students from the Sikh-derived Ud§sin and Nirmala orders. Many of the saÒny§sÊ-s have become eminent MaÖ·aleávaras. Sinha and Saraswati (1978:78) note that in 1957, when the institution celebrated its Golden Jubilee, it emerged that practically all the MaÖ·aleávaras of that time had been its students.clark_BIL25a.indd 435/30/2006 1:59:22 PM"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"chapter one44wealth, which was then channelled into land and property. Around the beginning of the twentieth century educational institutions were first established, as part of a process of reforming the general ethos of the paramahaÒsa-s and the akh§Ü§-s, particularly in the Gangetic heartland of their activities. At that time, some of the paramahaÒsa-s were well-known as businessmen and landlords (see Ch. 7).The inheritance of a maãha, which is invariably attached to a temple,is usually decided by the reigning mahant, his decision committed in writing or announced in the witness of others. If the mahantdies suddenly, the issue may be settled by the mutual consent of the disciples. However, Sinha and Saraswati (1978:74ff.) comment that practically every maãhain Banaras, of whatever denomination, has been involved in legal disputes at one time or another over property.75They also note that mahant-s often have histories of affiliations and initiations into more than one akh§Ü§,76 sometimes as a consequence of internal disagreements. Kane (HD“, Vol. 2:972–973) also records several of the numerous legal disputes that have engaged saÒny§sÊ-s over the centuries.77 Regarding the trusteeship of maãha-s and the required comportment of the mahant, there is now a code for reli-giously endowed properties, enshrined in the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Act of 1959.7875See Katju (1961:233–245) for a lively account of his professional involve-ment as a lawyer with several cases involving property disputes between maãha-s andmahant-s.76Confirmed by the author.77Derrett (1974:67) also comments on the frequency with which disputes over the property of maãha-s end up in court. Kane (HD“, Vol. 2:910–911) cites the remark of Sir T. Strange (Hindu Law, Vol. 1, 1839:32) that “Hindu law is meagre in its provisions relating to religious endowments”, observing that in modern times however, courts of India have laid down that an idol is a juridical person capable of holding property, and that an idol or a maãhais in the trusteeship of the manager of the temple or of the mahant. Taylor (2001:50) remarks that legal cases, known as ‘debutter’ cases, concerning the devat§ (the technical owner of the temple or property) and theáebait(usually a priest, standing as the surrogate legal owner on the divinity’s behalf) were extremely frequent at the beginning of the twentieth century in the civil litigation before the Calcutta High Court.78Mahant-ship and the maãha are not alienable or partible, but the mahantmay be removed on the following grounds: 1. Being of unsound mind; 2. Suffering from a mental or physical defect that renders him unfit to be a trustee; 3. Having ceased to profess the Hindu religion; 4. Being convicted of an offence of moral turpitude; 5. Breaching the trust bestowed upon him in respect of any of the properties under that trust; 6. Misappropriating or wasting funds on purposes or properties unconnected with the institution; 7. Diverting funds intended for the benefit of the institution; 6. clark_BIL25a.indd 445/30/2006 1:59:23 PM"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"branches of the daáan§mÊ order451.5 ‘ParamahaÒsa’and ‘Daáan§mÊ’ as categoriesA tripartite division amongst the Daáan§mÊs has been discussed. However, it needs to be considered that in some instances there are branches of saÒny§sÊ-s and Daáan§mÊs that are but tangentially connected with the core Daáan§mÊ tradition. By way of illustration, there are other maãha-s in Banaras founded in the name of well-known paramahaÒsa-s, notably TailaØga Sv§mÊ and Harihar B§b§, but disciples of those orders are not recognised as either Daáan§mÊs or as paramahaÒsa-s. Similarly, the final initiation—leading to his nirvikalpa-sam§dhi—of the famous Bengali Tantric, Gad§dhara Caããop§dhy§ya(1836–1886), who was given the name R§makÜßÖa ParamahaÒsa, was performed by Toãa PurÊ, who, it is believed, belonged to the Mah§nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§.However, the order of saÒny§sÊ-s founded by R§makÜßÖa’s chief disciple, Sv§mÊ Vivek§nanda, has no sectarian connection to the Daáan§mÊs.79 On this point, there is some need to examine briefly the notion of ‘sectarian connection’ and by implica-tion the categories of ‘Daáan§mÊ’ and ‘paramahaÒsa’.In terms of self-identification, it is primarily the parampar§, the guru-áißyarelationship—the ‘vertical’ order—that is paramount within the Indian tradition in general, and the renunciatory environment in particular. An initiate may be vague or unclear as to what the identificatory parameters of his or her sect, or branch of a sect, may be, while certain about their guru-parampar§. As an example, we might consider the Daáan§mÊsaÒny§sÊ-s of the HaÖdiy§ B§b§Yog§laya.80 When asked about which kind of s§dhuthey are, they will usually say “Daáan§mÊ” or “saÒny§sÊ”, invariably qualifying this statement with the remark that they are devotees of HaÖ·iy§81 B§b§,Conducting an immoral life or behaving in a manner likely to bring his office into contempt; 8. Persistent and wilful default in discharging his duties or performing his functions under the act or any other law (Singh 1998:90–91).79Although Vivek§nanda publicly identified himself as a monk of the “oldest order of saÒny§sÊ-s...founded by “aØkara”, there is no record of Vivek§nanda ever formally taking saÒny§sa. Further, he initiated all his gurubh§Ê-s himself (in January 1887), with no links to religious structures or authorities of any sort, telling them that they were neither householders, nor exactly saÒny§sÊ-s, but “quite a new type” (Michelis 2004:79, 108, 112).80At TriveÖÊ Bandh, Allahabad.81HaÖ·iy§means ‘small clay pot’, which HaÖ·iy§ B§b§ always carried and in which he collected alms.

The current disciples of HaÖ·iy§ B§b§ took direct initiation into saÒny§sa from their guru, BißÖudev§nand, who in turn was initiated by HaÖ·iy§B§b§. It seems most probable, though I was unable to establish this, that Yog§nandsarasvatÊ (the guru of the Mah§r§ja of Darbh§Øga) was initiated into the Jån§akh§Ü§, and hence the current identification with the Jån§akh§Ü§, even though the current disciples of HaÖ·iy§B§b§ have not been initiated by, nor do they have anything to do with, the Jån§akh§Ü§.Thus, in terms of their own self-identification, thesaÒny§sÊ-s will say that they are Daáan§mÊ and, perhaps, Jån§akh§Ü§, as their lineage traces back through the Jån§akh§Ü§. However, the disciples of HaÖ·iy§ B§b§ were not initiated via an akh§Ü§or a daÖ·Ê maãha, nor are they Daáan§mÊdaÖ·Ê-s,paramahaÒsa-s or n§g§-s, criteria outsiders may use for identiying Daáan§mÊsaÒny§sÊ-s. Yet the disciples’ claim to being Daáan§mÊ is, in their view, legitimised through lineage.Another example, of which there are many, of a saÒny§sÊlin-eage which traces its ancestry to “aØkar§c§rya, and which might be similarly described as Daáan§mÊ, is the lineage of the Kail§s$áram, founded in 1880 at Muni-kÊ-Reti,Œßikeá. The current lineage derives from Sv§mÊ Dhanr§j Giri, who was born in 1871 (TulÊ 2001:5). The resident Mah§maÖ·aleávara performs traditional Brahmanical rites of initiation for the disciples, who are usually Sanskrit students. After the first initiation, as Brahmac§rÊ, they keep the top-knot, wear the sacred thread and do japa.In the second initiation they perform the viraj§-havanand have their top-knot removed; they are now unques-tionablysaÒny§sÊ-s, and many have one of the ‘ten names’.83around fifty years near TriveÖÊ Bandh, feeding people when he could and teaching haãha-yogatechniques for curing the sick.

The main connections that tie all these institutions together are linkages of guru-parampar§-s at times of initiation, initiates of one institution frequently being initia-ted by a guru from another institution.1.6 N§g§During the first stage of initiation, Daáan§mÊs are usually given one of the ‘ten names’.85ParamahaÒsa-s may then take a further initiation to become a n§g§of an akh§Ü§. Akh§Ü§is a technical name for the institutions governing the n§g§-s, and also has the sense of ‘wrestling ring’ and ‘military formation’, where n§g§-s train for fighting. These arenas are separate from the large network of traditional wrestling akh§Ü§-s which are training institutions with their own history, gurus and organisation.86 A distinguishing feature of life in several of the n§g§ akh§Ü§-s, notably the Jån§akh§Ü§, is the consumption of very large quantities of cannabis, either smoked with tobacco in a cilam (‘clay pipe’), or eaten or drunk in the form of bh§Øg, a preparation of the leaves of the plant.8784The organisation has a press, GÊt§ Dharma Press, at Banaras.85However, an exception are Daáan§mÊs from the Agni akh§Ü§, (one of the seven Daáan§mÊ akh§Ü§-s), who do not ever take one of the ‘ten names’. Similarly to the daÖ·Ê-s, they are given one of the four brahmac§rÊnames (Svaråp, Prak§áa,$nanda or Caitanya), depending on nominal pÊãhaaffiliation.86See Alter (1992) for an account of Indian wrestling. There are around 150 akh§Ü§-s in Banaras, and around 20 to 30 in surrounding areas. The larger akh§Ü§-s have 50 to 60 members, most wrestlers being relatively low-caste. Akh§Ü§-s specialise in different techniques, such as weights, clubs or maces. The wrestlers’ patron deity is Hanum§n.87The cannabis is smoked either in the form of dried buds of the female plant (g§ñj§), which is grown in many regions of the subcontinent, or in the form of a resin (caras), rubbed by hand from the buds of the female plant. Carasis made almost exclusively in the Indian and Nepalese Himalayas.

Those Mah§maÖ·aleávaras who are affiliated to the akh§Ü§-s, and those who specifically preside over initiations in the role of §c§rya-guru,89 have very little to do with the activities or organi-sation of the akh§Ü§-s, only being consulted in extreme or unusual circumstances.

Usually, they do not smoke for a couple of hours after eating.88A survey of most of the camps of the Mah§maÖ·aleávaras at the Allahabad Kumbh Mel§ in 2001 revealed that their main §árama-s are most commonly situated in Delhi, Haridv§r, KaØkhal,Œßikeá, Banaras, Allahabad, Ujjain and Citrakåã.89In most Sanskrit colleges there are five grades: Entrance; First; Intermediate; “§strÊ;$c§rya. The title of the $c§rya Guru derives from his Sanskrit qualifica-tion.90The ‘holy ash’ worn by n§g§-s is known as vibhåti(also meaning ‘majesty’, ‘dignity’ or ‘superhuman power’), orbhabhåt, or bhasm(a).Besides its religious asso-ciations, ash protects against the cold and wards off insects. Although n§g§-s may use ash straight from a dhånÊin which no ‘unclean’ wood (such as bamboo, which causes itching) has been burnt, ‘pure’ bhasmis made from the faeces of cows grazing in the forest. The dried cow-pats are burned, and the ash is mixed with water and filtered through cloth. The water and fine-ash mixture is then left to stand for the night, after which the water is decanted. The remaining, soggy ash is shaped into balls or lumps, which are placed in a pit walled with other cow-pats, and burned again. The resultant ash is a fine, whitish powder.clark_BIL25a.indd 485/30/2006 1:59:28 PM"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"branches of the daáan§mÊ order49Thevibhåtifrom their dhånÊ-s is one of the most common offerings to visiting devotees or pilgrims, who generally believe in its magical and restorative properties.

Dur-ing a crisis, such as when a mahantdies, the members of the akh§Ü§will meet and attempt to settle any dispute, which is frequent, over succession or acquisition of the maãhahe previously occupied.In Banaras, Sinha and Saraswati (1978:82) survey a total of twenty-fourn§g§centres (akh§Ü§-s),92 which are found to house ninety-one ascetics, who are members of one of the seven major akh§Ü§-s. The akh§Ü§-s with the largest membership are the Jån§ and Nirv§ÖÊ with membership of thirty-three and nineteen respectively. These are fol-lowed by the $nanda (fourteen), Agni (ten), $v§han (six), NirañjanÊ(five), Aãal (two) and, curiously, GådaÜa (two).93 A total of six female n§g§-s are reported, three belonging to the Jån§akh§Ü§94 and three belonging to the $nandaakh§Ü§.95 Five of the female n§g§-s (or avad-91Martial training also has a long history in Kerala. The art of kalari-payattu was first systematised by Brahmans and kßatriya-s around the eleventh century, during a period of wars between the Ceras, CÙÏas and PaÖ·yas. The kalari(practice arena) is presided over by between seven and twenty-seven deities, including one or more forms of the goddess (usually either Bhadrak§lÊ or BhagavatÊ),“iva-“akti combined, GaÖapati, past gurus who go back to Paraáur§ma and DroÖa, Hanum§n, Ayyap-pan, and local heroes or ancestors (Zarrilli 1998:67–78).92Fourteen were founded between 1800 and 1968,five trace their origin to the sixteenth or seventeenth century. Five claim to have been founded between the ninth and eleventh centuries, though these early dates seem highly improbable (see Ch. 7).93The GådaÜaakh§Ü§ is recorded as having two male ascetics. The mention of thisakh§Ü§is anomalous as I have found no record of it either in other published sources or during interviews conducted in the field. It is not currently a recognised Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§. Its identity is analysed in the following chapter.94A woman n§g§ (originally of French descent) of the Jån§akh§Ü§, named SantoßGiri, has run an §árama near Porbandar (Gujarat) for many years. She was initiated by a “aØkar§c§rya and is well known in the area. I have not visited her.95Female membership of the $nandaakh§Ü§is not in evidence currently.

All were aged over thirty-five, and in the akh§Ü§-s of Banaras they were residing with the males.96Theakh§Ü§-s are organised according to what is called the pañc§yatÊsystem, meaning that the organisation is run by elected representa-tives. One may see at the gateway of all akh§Ü§-s throughout India the prefix ‘“rÊpañc ... akh§Ü§’.Although Sinha and Saraswati (1978:196) acknowledge that succession to the leadership of the akh§Ü§is through lineage—being in accordance with the mutual maÜhÊ(lineage)97 of the guru and successor—they also make a substantial claim about the democratic nature of the akh§Ü§-s, stating that in this organisa-tion no decision, great or small, may be taken by a single person of whatever rank, age or personal achievement. As an example, a letter addressed to the th§n§pati98 is opened only in the presence of two other ascetics.According to Sad§nanda Giri (1976:27), in the akh§Ü§-s the relation-ship between n§g§-s and their gurus is described as the relationship ofsiddha-s§dhaka.He claims that it differs somewhat from the guru-cel§relationship found in some other sects, whereby the disciple is exclusively devoted to the guru, also claiming that in the Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s no one is formally a disciple of anyone else. DaÖ·Ê-s, who are outside the akh§Ü§, and those of the Agni akh§Ü§ (one of the seven akh§Ü§-s), specifically maintain the guru-cel§relationship, and the usual hierarchy of guru and disciple. In the other akh§Ü§-s, however, the initiatingsaÒny§sÊ does not, in the technical terminology employed by the akh§Ü§-s, become the guru of the initiate, the term ‘guru’ being reserved for the presiding deity of the akh§Ü§. A n§g§is usually attached to a senior ascetic who becomes his s§dhaka-guru.Thesiddha-s§dhaka relationship means that the disciple serves a siddha-guru, supplying water, sweeping, offering påj§ and so on. In return, the siddha-guru looks after the well-being of the aspirant.Notwithstanding the sometimes fierce independence of the n§g§-s, in practice, besides the unique arrangement amongst ascetic organisa-96Sinha and Saraswati report, somewhat confusingly, that one akh§Ü§is occupied exclusively by female n§g§-s, but supply no further information.

It is not the case that no one is the guru of anyone else, even though the arrangements and hierarchy of service within the Daáan§mÊ order may differ somewhat from other orders. In practice, thesaÒny§sÊ usually has five gurus, to whom he usually refers as ‘guru’, including a digambara-guruif he is a n§g§.(An§g§ is also referred to asdigambara.)101 The highest respect to a human guru is accorded to someone who is sometimes known as the saÒny§sÊ-’ssiddha-guru,whom he may encounter at any point along the renunciate path. Although several commentators have been cited who claim that the akh§Ü§-s function, essentially, in a non-hierarchical way, it is evident that clear hierarchies of both spiritual and practical authority oper-ate between n§g§-s and within the akh§Ü§-s.In general, n§g§-s do not beg for alms. While some are actively engaged in various forms of minor business, such as selling herbal medicines or religious articles such as rudr§kßa seeds, some few others have semi-clandestine businesses. However, it should be emphasised that business is pursued by but a small percentage of n§g§-s and that stipends are paid to all n§g§-s, usually by the th§n§patiof the n§g§-’s akh§Ü§.As a consequence of a combination of mercenary, banking, smuggling and other mercantile activity—which is outlined in Chapter 99Witnessed by the author at the 2001 Kumbh Mel§.100Dazey (1987:557; 1990:309) also endorses Sinha and Saraswati’s suggestion that relationships within the akh§Ü§-s are democratic and non-hierarchical, noting that the n§g§-s are guru-bhai-s (‘brothers’) under a guru, but the real guru of the akh§Ü§is the presiding deity of the akh§Ü§. However, Dazey (1987:542–544) also maintains that “the practice of maintaining a sacred dhånÊfire (for cooking and oblations) is unique to the n§g§-s among the Daáan§mÊ renouncers”: the “formless guru” of the akh§Ü§is said to be the dhånÊ. While it is true that the dhånÊis generally regarded as holy, and prayers made to it, one only has to spend a short time in any akh§Ü§to see both the clear hierarchical ordering amongst n§g§-s and mahant-s and also the enormous respect accorded to the human gurus within the akh§Ü§.101Digambara(lit. ‘sky-clad’) meaning ‘naked’ (as does n§g§), is an epithet of “iva and also the name of one of the two main branches of Jainism (see Dundas 2002).clark_BIL25a.indd 515/30/2006 1:59:30 PM"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"chapter one527—thesaÒny§sÊ akh§Ü§-s had, by the middle of the nineteenth century, accumulated extensive properties and large sums of money.

While there is evidence—for the last 1500 years—of the periodic gathering of ascetics at what have become the four sites of the Kumbh Mel§ (Haridv§r, Ujjain, Allahabad and N§sik), it seems that the linking of the four sites (as sites of the Kumbh Mel§), and the supporting mythology and astrology, is probably not more than around 130 years old. See Bonazzoli (1977); Bhattacharya (1977); Dubey (1988); and, particularly, Maclean (2001; 2003). Appendix 3 of this book reviews the work of these and other scholars.3Sarkar (1958:107) cites a report by Mr. T. Benson on the Kumbh Mela of 1882. He describes six “sects” of akh§Ü§-s that were present: 1. Nirv§ÖÊn§g§ gosain-s; 2. NirañjanÊ, associated with the Jån§; 3. Three sects of Vair§gÊ; 4. Choã§ Ud§sin; 5.

Since 1938, when the R§m§nandÊs split from the R§m§nujas, the four vaißÖava samprad§ya-s have been constituted as follows (confirmed during fieldwork in 2001).1)“rÊ (or R§m§nuja or N§thamuni) / Caudah [=14] Bh§Ê Mah§-Ty§gÊ.2) R§m§nandÊ (or Dakor).3) Harby§sÊ (or Nimb§rka/Sanak§dÊ) / B§rah [=12] Bh§Ê DaÖ·iya.4)“y§m§nandÊ (or Gau·Êya/Madhva) / Terah [=13] Bh§Ê Ty§gÊ.The current formation of the catuÈ-samprad§ya-s does not correspond to the for-mation to be found in the important R§m§nandÊ hagiographical text, Bhaktam§la,by N§bh§d§sa (N§bh§-jÊ), written at the behest of Agra D§sa (disciple of Payah§rÊKÜßÖa D§sa, who was a disciple of R§m§nanda) in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century. According to Pollet (1963:11), this was between 1595 and 1624; according to Varma (1977:5), 1585; according to Snell (1991:12), possibly before 1585. In the Bhaktam§la (v. 28, l.1–5), the four samprad§ya-s are attributed to R§m§nuja, VißÖusv§mÊ, Nimb§ditya and Madhv§c§rya. Instead of the R§m§nandÊsamprad§ya, the VißÖusv§mÊ is listed as one of the four samprad§ya-s (see Pollet 1963:74, 168); it is now defunct. The VißÖusv§mÊs (Rudra samprad§ya) were almost entirely absorbed into the newer Vallabhac§rÊ order (Gokul§sthasamprad§ya). Van der Veer’s (1998:110) account of the current relationship between the ‘Ty§gÊs’, ‘Mah§ty§gÊs’ and the Terah/B§rah Bh§Ês is slightly inaccurate, as it is based on earlier accounts of the catuÈ samprad§ya-s as found in the Bhaktam§la. A link between the Gau·Êya lineage of Caitanya (1486–1533) and the Madhva samprad§yaseems to have been established only in the eighteenth century, by B§ladeva Vidyabhußana (Dimock 1963:106). A total of eight sects (of followers R§m§nuja, Harid§sa, Madhva, Nimb§rka, VißÖusv§mÊ, R§m§nanda, Vallabha and Caitanya) were absorbed into the scheme of the catuÈ-samprad§yain different stages. For an overview of the catuÈ-sampra -d§ya-s see Clémentin-Ojha (1992). For an interpretation of the conflict between the R§m§nandÊs and the R§m§nujÊs, which first began in 1918 and led to the most recent reclassification of the catuÈ samprad§ya, see Pinch (1998).ThecatuÈ samprad§ya-s were organised into systems of dv§ra-s,anÊ-s and akh§Ü§-sunder the leadership of B§b§ Abhay R§m D§s in 1720, according to Sharma (1998:128–135). However, Thiel-Horstmann (unpublished paper cited by van der Veer 1988:136) believes the organisation took place in two steps during four suc-cessive conferences, in VÜnd§van (c.1713), Brahmapåri (Jaipur) (c.1726), Jaipur(1734), and Galta (east of Jaipur) (1756). It was B§l§nand who probably organisedthe army of n§g§-s (r§m·§l) for service to Madho Singh, regent of Jaipur. The 52 dv§ra-s (‘door’/‘gate’) or gaddÊ-s—which are essentially lineages—are assigned to places throughout India and mirror not only the 52 maÜhÊ-s of the Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s (see Ch. 2.2), but also the 52 phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet, the 52 á§kta-pÊãha-s, and the legendary 52 clans of kßatriya-s of Maharashtra. “52 varÖa-s and 18 j§ti-s” clark_BIL25a.indd 545/30/2006 1:59:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"akh§Ü§-s and daáan§mÊ functionaries55referred to as Bair§gÊ or Vair§gÊ). The other three (of the thirteen) extantakh§Ü§-s are affiliated to the Sikh tradition. Two of these are Ud§sinakh§Ü§-s, the BaÜ§(large) Ud§sin (or BaÜ§pañc§yatÊ Ud§sin) and the Choã§ (small) Ud§sin (or Nay§pañc§yatÊ Ud§sin). The other Sikh-affiliatedakh§Ü§is the Nirmala akh§Ü§. Both the Ud§sinakh§Ü§-s and the Nirmala akh§Ü§ are sects which have historical connections with the Sikh movement but which nowadays function as independent organisations.9 Besides the thirteen,10 previously militant, akh§Ü§-s so was a standard expression for describing the entire class structure of Maharashtra in the late eighteenth century; see Wagle (1997:143). The four samprad§ya-s each comprise several of the 52 dv§ra-s: R§m§nandÊ (36); Nimb§rkÊ (10); Madhva (3); VißÖusv§mÊ (3). This constitutes one of the three levels of organisation of the vaißÖavaorders. Another level of organisation is the system ofanÊ-s and akh§Ü§-s (which does not directly correspond to the akh§Ü§-s of the Daáan§mÊs). The three anÊ-s of the R§m§nandÊsamprad§ya are subdivided into eight akh§Ü§-s: Nirmohi (3); Digambar (2); Nirv§ÖÊ (3). The eight akh§Ü§-s are further sub-divided into eighteen sections. The D§dåpanthalso has an akh§Ü§(see Thiel-Horstmann 1991) which joins the Nirmohi anÊfor bathing at Kumbh Mel§s. The catuÈ-samprad§ya-s, which meet at the Kumbh Mel§, have an administrative body, the Akhil Bh§ratÊ Kh§ls§, which oversees 412 sub-branches known as kh§ls§-s, a system not more than 150 years old. This is a third level of organisation.8R§m§nandÊty§gÊ-s have a lifestyle and appearance almost identical to that of Daáan§mÊn§g§-s: see van der Veer (1987:688). While the ty§gÊ-s are R§m§nandÊasectics, the n§g§-s are soldiers who carry weapons and are given money by ty§gÊmahant-s at mel§-s to protect the order. Technically, only the n§g§-s are said to be in the akh§Ü§. Unlike the ty§gÊ-s, R§m§nandÊn§g§-s wear stitched cloth and do not wearjaã§. A R§m§nandÊ disciple wishing to enter an akh§Ü§has to pass through seven levels before he becomes a vaißÖava n§g§, who is known as n§g§-atÊt: 1. y§trÊ,collects neem-sticks for his superiors, and wanders alone or with the Jam§t; 2. chor§, serves, draws water and makes leaf-plates; 3. bandagÊdar, looks after food stores, serves food and cleans n§g§-atÊt-s’ untensils; 4. huÜdaØg, cooks, offers food to the deity, calls “Harihar” (hence huÜdaØgmeaning ‘commotion’ or ‘uproar’), carries the insignia and flag of the akh§Ü§, masters weapons; 5. mureãhiya, worships deities, supervises sevak-s, calls “jay” (a sequence of calls uttered before undertak-ing any work), and is experienced in the use of weapons; 6. n§g§, administers the akh§Ü§, worships the deity, protects the samprad§ya-’s property, leads the Jam§t, and prepares for the Kumbh Mel§; 7. atÊt, decides important issues for the order and guidesn§g§-s. It takes twelve years to become n§g§, after which he may vote in the akh§Ü§, as a member of the pañc(see Sharma 1998:128–135). N§g§-s are organised in four divisions (selÊ), according to where they were initiated, the divisions being: Haridv§rÊ (at Haridv§r), UjjayinÊya (at Ujjain), S§garÊya (at GaØg§ S§gar, near Calcutta), and BasantÊya (other places) (van der Veer 1998:139).9The Ud§sin (Ud§sÊn/Ud§sÊ) and Nirmala akh§Ü§-s revere the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh text that occupies a central place in all gurdv§ra-s. The tutelary deity of both Ud§sinakh§Ü§-s is Candra Bhagv§n (believed to be an incarnation of “iva), who was “rÊ Cand, the eldest of the two sons of Guru N§nak (1469–1539).

According to Ud§sin tradition (Singh (1951:59–64), “rÊ Cand was initi-ated by N§nak and founded the Ud§sins. Although “rÊ Cand is not recognised as a guru within the Sikh guru-parampar§, neither is he rejected, and links remained strong between the communities. However, there is other historical evidence (Pinch 1996:36) that “rÊ Cand and his followers were expelled from the Sikh community in the sixteenth century. “rÊ Cand lived past the age of a hundred, up to the time of Guru Hargobind (1595–1644), the sixth guru of the Sikh tradition. This means that the Ud§sin order was founded, according to the traditional account, between—at the limits—the early part of the sixteenth century and the first decades of the sev-enteenth century. The gaddÊ passed from “rÊ Cand to the son of Hargobind, B§b§Gurdita (a householder and soldier), who had four preaching disciples (masand)who founded four dhånÊ-s (dhå§n) in 1636, which are the four divisions of the BaÜ§(‘large’) Ud§sinakh§Ü§.They are: 1. Balu Hasna; 2. Phul Sahib (or MÊ§n Sahib); 3. Almast; 4. Bhagat Bhagv§n (or Gonda). According to one account (Singh 1951:64), MÊ§n Sahib and Bhagat Bhagv§n (=Bhagat Gir, a saÒny§sÊ) did not found dhå§n-s, but missionary centres, known as bhakßÊ-s.The Choã§ (‘small’) Ud§sinakh§Ü§ was founded by Bh§Ê Pheru, supposedly with the permission of Guru Gobind Singh (1666–1708), who is also believed to have founded the Nirmala akh§Ü§(Ahuja 1994). However, Oberoi (1997:124–127) questions the antiquity of the Nirmalas, observing that references to them in Sikh literature are scarce in the early eighteenth century but abundant at the end of that century. Between the 1790s and 1840s, the Ud§sin and Nirmala orders received extensive state patronage, and the number of their establishments increased five-fold.10An article appeared in an Allahabad newspaper (Dainik J§graÖ, Il§h§b§d, 12 January 2001, p. 3) annoucing the coming into being of the AkhaÖ·akh§Ü§, a new akh§Ü§ instituted by Sv§mÊ Param§nand, who, along with ten others, was made ‘Mah§maÖ·aleávara’ ($c§rya Mah§maÖ·aleávara Yugpuruß“rÊ Sv§mÊ Param§nandJÊ Mah§r§j). The sv§mÊ, who has published several books, has an ever expanding §árama (AkhaÖ· Param Dham) on the outskirts of Haridv§r, and is quite well known internationally. He addressed the United Nations assembly in New York on 28th August 2000, a lecture published as Transformation of Religion Based Conflicts into World Peace: Identification of Dharma and its Utility. Whether the akh§Ü§attracts many saÒny§sÊ-s remains to be seen.11The N§ths (or N§th-Siddhas), also known as yogÊ-s, were supposedly organised by Gorakhn§th, most probably in the thirteenth century (see White 1996:93–100). They are haãha-yogÊ-s, renowned as wonder-workers. As power-brokers and mer-cenaries, they played a significant role in political and military intrigues during the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly in Rajasthan.For accounts of the N§ths, see Briggs (1982); Gold and Gold (1984); Gold (1996; 1999); White (1996; 2001).

There are also a few Daáan§mÊ institutions in Kathmandu, the main one being the “aØkar§c§rya Maãha in Deopatan, founded by R§ma Giri in 1877.

Sarkar believes that the Portuguese system of reckoning, which adds 1,000 years to traditional dates, had not been taken into account by the bards. However, the reckoning is in consistent: adding 1,000 years to the supposed founding date of the NirañjanÊakh§Ü§, given as 960 V. S., would, according to Sarkar’s calculation, be 1903 CE, yet the presence of the NirañjanÊakh§Ü§was reported at the Kumbh Mel§ of 1840 by a Protestant missionary (Sinha and Saraswati 1978:86). For founding dates, see also Sad§nanda Giri (1976:22); Tripathi (1978:70); Sinha and Saraswati (1978:85); Dazey (1987): their repetitions are in several instances erroneous or different, adding unreliability to an account that was already declaredly unreliable.

If the ashes were smeared on the forehead, in the way that s§dhu-s do, then the recipient was regarded as friendly, but a refusal to do so was a sign of enmity. The shape of a gol§is round for the NirañjanÊ,liØga-shaped for the Jån§,four-cornered for the Nirv§ÖÊ, and octagonal for the Aãal. Many of the sources, previously referred to for information on the Daáan§mÊs, record this historical tradition. PurÊ (2001:137) provides mantras for the gol§. However, from various inquiries made by this author, it seems that the custom is not current and but vaguely understood by contemporary Daáan§mÊsaÒny§sÊ-s.26N§g§-s initiated at Ujjain are known as khånÊ(‘killer’)n§g§-s, those initiated at Haridv§r as barf§nÊ(‘icy’)n§g§-s, and those initiated at Pray§ga as r§jar§jeávarÊ(‘lord of the king of kings’) n§g§-s.27See Ch. 3.3 for an explanation of this term.28Sinha and Saraswati (1978:84) note that after the 1954 Kumbh Mel§ the Jån§ and NirañjanÊ came closer together. Relations between the Nirv§ÖÊ and Aãal are said to have become somewhat distant owing to a dispute concerning the selection of a female MaÖ·aleávara.

The seventh akh§Ü§, the Agni akh§Ü§, is supposed to have been founded in 1368 CE and has fifteen branches. Like the other akh§Ü§-s, it is nominally áaiva in orientation. All members are life-long celibates and refer to themselves as brahmac§rÊ, distin-guishing themselves, by that name, from the other akh§Ü§-s. (DaÖ·Ê-s also refer to themselves as brahmac§rÊto distinguish themselves from other Daáan§mÊsaÒny§sÊ-s.) Being known as brahmac§rÊ-s means, also, that members of the Agni akh§Ü§ come, at least theoretically, from a Brahman caste. Unlike the other akh§Ü§-s, which are comprised largely of n§g§-s, none of the members of the Agni akh§Ü§aren§g§.The Agni akh§Ü§ is not connected to the maÜhÊ29 network of the other akh§Ü§-s and only attained equal status with the other saÒny§sÊ akh§Ü§-sin 1971 when, during the $dh§ Kumbh Mel§at Pray§g, Brahmac§rÊPrak§á§nanda was installed as the Mah§maÖ·aleávara of the akh§Ü§.There are currently three Mah§maÖ·aleávaras affiliated to the Agni akh§Ü§, the §c§rya-gururesiding in AmarkaÖãak (Madhya Pradesh).30 As previously noted, unlike in the other akh§Ü§-s, a guru will take only onecel§, in the manner common to many other renunciate lineages.SaÒny§sÊ-s of the Agni akh§Ü§do not take one of the usual Daáan§mÊ‘ten names’, instead taking one of the names of what they describe asbrahmac§rÊ gotra-s, namely $nanda, Caitan, Svaråp or Prak§áa.According to Sarkar (1958:82), the earliest available information concerning the formation of the Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s comes from an oral tradition that can be dated to around 1750, and derives from Rajendra Giri who became famous in the affairs of the Delhi Sultanate (see Ch. 7.4). All the akh§Ü§-s have a hereditary bard (bh§ã) who can recite the oral history of the akh§Ü§.Sarkar inspected a manuscript in the possession of the bh§ãof the Nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§, detailing the founda-tion of the akh§Ü§-s, the succession of pontiffs (mahant-s) and the battles that the akh§Ü§-s fought.He estimated that the manuscript could not have been much more than fifty years old, and while admitting that 29See following section.30The Agni akh§Ü§is nominally under the jurisdiction of the Dv§rak§pÊãha, and traces its origin to the four sons of Brahm§: Sanaka, Sanatkum§ra, Sanandana and San§tana, dividing its members (theoretically) between three areas: Narmad§khaÖ·Ê(Narmad§), UttarakhaÖ·Ê (northern), and Naißãhika (‘faithful’). Some daÖ·Ê-saÒny§sÊ-s reported to the author that the Agni akh§Ü§functions as the akh§Ü§for the daÖ·Ê-s. However, this is denied by the saÒny§sÊ-s of the Agni akh§Ü§.clark_BIL25a.indd 605/30/2006 1:59:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"akh§Ü§-s and daáan§mÊ functionaries61the information is unreliable, gives the dates for the foundation of theakh§Ü§-s as detailed above. Sarkar (1958:83) further cautions that the record (pothÊ) is from but one akh§Ü§and that other akh§Ü§-s may possess quite different records. Notwithstanding Sarkar’s caution, his publication (1958:82–85) of the putative dates of the founding of the akh§Ü§-s (as above) has entered many accounts, albeit inaccurately. This is no doubt largely due to the fact that Sarkar’s account stands, still today, as virtually the only published account to be based on any kind of written record.31While it is probable that ascetic lineages do indeed go back to the seventh century or beyond, firm evidence for the founding of akh§Ü§-s,and their identity with lineages organised by “aØkara, cannot be found before the sixteenth century.32 Concerning the question of when orders of fighting saÒny§sÊ-s may have been organised, it seems most probable that between the late sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, a variety of political factors—that are explored in Chapter 7—led to the formation of various akh§Ü§-s of fighting ascetics, including the Ud§sin, Nirmala, D§då, Bair§gÊ (R§m§nandÊ) and Daáan§mÊ orders, notwithstanding the latter’s claims to greater antiquity. It is suggested that during this period when the akh§Ü§-s formed, the Daáan§mÊs also formed their own distinct (and orthodox) identity, comprising ten lineages from quite disparate backgrounds, one group comprising lineages from the monastic tradition, and the other group compris-ing lineages with a N§th or ‘heterodox’ background. Beginning in the latter part of the sixteenth century, for the first time there are recorded conflicts between the akh§Ü§-s, most frequently between 31PurÊ (2001:83–90), a mahantof the Mah§nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§, also gives the founding dates of the akh§Ü§-s, citing evidence from hand-written pothÊ-s.He claims that the firstakh§Ü§to be founded was the $v§han, in 603 vikram(V. S.), the other akh§Ü§-s subsequently. His information on the dating and some other details concerning places is almost identical to that provided by Sarkar. (PurÊ’s dating reflects his belief that“aØkara was born in 44 BCE.) However, having provided precise dates for the founding of the akh§Ü§-s and a list of the founding saÒny§sÊ-s, he remarks (p. 89) that some people are doubtful about the founding dates. But, he maintains, it is certain that the Mah§nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§was established by the sixteenth century, even though according to his earlier account it was founded in 805 V. S. by eight mah§purußa-s connected with the Aãalakh§Ü§. In evidence, he cites a battle in Bihar in 1664 CE between Aurangzeb and the Mah§nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§, who had come from Banaras.32Intriguingly, all the akh§Ü§-s possess voluminous written records, mostly con-cerning financial transactions recorded on parc§ (birch-bark), which are not available for inspection even to relatively high-ranking officials within the akh§Ü§.clark_BIL25a.indd 615/30/2006 1:59:38 PM"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"chapter two62Daáan§mÊ-saÒny§sÊ-s and bair§gÊ-s33 over bathing priorities at mel§-s and rights to collect taxes from pilgrims. Perhaps the earliest record of a fight between identifiable akh§Ü§-s is that of Abu-l-Faíl, who records (1972:422–424) how, on one occasion, during the latter part of the sixteenth century, emperor Akbar was camped at Th§nesar (Sth§ÖvÊávara), near Kurukßetra, at the time of themel§ there.34 A fight ensued between the PurÊ and Kur (or Gur, Giri?)saÒny§sÊ-s over occupation of an area by the lake, particularly suitable for the collection of alms from pilgrims. The PurÊs, believ-ing that they had been wrongfully usurped by the Kurs, approached Akbar for assistance. Akbar’s solicitations to the parties were to no effect. As the PurÊs were few in number, Akbar enlisted the assistance of some other tribes35 on behalf of the PurÊs who routed the Kurs, slaying their leader (pÊr),$nanda Kur. The combatants numbered around one thousand, and the dead around twenty (Smith 1966:57). Akbar was, apparently, delighted by the sport. In the Dabist§n(Dabist§n1843, Vol. 2:196–197), a battle that took place at Haridv§r in 1640 between Bair§gÊs (also referred to as ‘MundÊs’) and ‘Sany§sis’ is described. According to the account, thesaÒny§sÊ-s were victorious and killed a great number of MundÊs. The MundÊs thew away the rosaries of tulsÊ beads and “hung on their perforated ears the rings of the JogÊs, in order to be taken for these sectaries”. The author of the Dabist§n(Dabist§n1843, Vol. 2:231) also refers to a battle between ‘Sany§sis’ and ‘SÙfÊs’, the former being victorious.3633A conflict between saÒny§sÊ-s and SåfÊs is also recorded (see Dabist§n1843, Vol. 2:231).34The same incident is referred to slightly differently by Al-Bad§oni (1986, Vol. 2:94–95), who describes the two parties of combatants as “JogÊs” and “Sanny§sÊs”, who are said to be “in the habit of fighting there in their bigotry”. At the emperor’s command, a number of soldiers smeared their bodies with ashes and fought on the side of the “Sanny§sÊs” (numbering around 300), against the “JogÊs” (numbering more than 500). Many were slain on both sides, but the saÒny§sÊ-s were victorious. Akbar’s son Jah§ngir is also said to have witnessed a battle between Ud§sin and Vair§gÊs§dhu-s over bathing at the mel§ (PurÊ 2001:181).35These tribes are recorded as the Petamcah§ (unknown to commentators) and the CÊrås, a wild tribe from Mirzapur.36ThesaÒny§sÊ-s had assembled at a Hindu pilgrimage site (unspecified), when an army of naked Jelalis and Mad§ris (sects of SåfÊs) arrived, bringing a cow that they wished to slaughter. To avert the slaughter, the saÒny§sÊ-s bought the cow. However, the SåfÊs brought a second cow, which was also purchased. A third cow was brought, and killed, engendering a battle in which 700 SåfÊs died.

In that year the British took control of the Haridv§r area, and the Bair§gÊswere then reportedly banned from the Haridv§rmel§for forty years (Lochtefeld 1994:597). The dominance of the áaiva gosain-s in the area around Haridv§r may have been partly due to the stationing in 1752 of the gosain Rajendra Giri, a powerful miltary commander,37as commander of forces (faujd§r) at Saharanpur, under the Mughal emperor Ahmad“§h. The dominance of the áaiva gosain-s at Haridv§r,in trade, policing and taxation, appears to have continued largely unchallenged until the end of the eighteenth century. In April 1796 an English officer, Captain Thomas Hardwicke, accompanied by Dr. Hunter, visited the Haridv§r Mel§ on the way to “rÊnagar (Hardwicke 1801:309–347). They attended Makar SaØkr§nti, which fell on April 8th that year. Pilgrims had come from as far as K§bul, Bhut§n and Kashmir. The “Goosseyns” (also referred to as “Mehunts”, “Fakeers” and “Sannyassees”) had set themselves up as the police for the mel§, meeting daily to hear grievances and adjudicate, and collecting levies on cattle, merchandise and pilgrims at the bathing places, taxes that would normally have gone to the Mar§ãhas who were governing the region at that time. Wielding swords, they had effectively silenced all opposition to their regime, including that of the rival bair§gÊ-s. On the last day of the mel§,April 10th, between 12,000 and 14,000 Sikh horsemen arrived and planted their flag near the river. The gosain-s took down the flag and plundered the Sikh party. The Sikhs sent a lawyer to the mah-ant-s, protesting their right to bathe and seeking the return of their looted property. The property was returned but the Sikhs attacked the ascetics at the bathing places, including the bair§gÊ-s,saÒny§sÊ-s and n§g§-s. Panic ensued, in which several drowned. The Sikhs lost twenty men but killed 500.38According to a copper-plate inscription in the possession of Mahant amongst the ‘fanatics’ were taken prisoner and educated “in their own religion” by the saÒny§sÊ-s.37See Chapter 7.4.38Pinch has commented that at this time the Sikhs were on the verge of state-hood in nearby Punjab, under Ranjit Singh. They may well have been exercising territorial muscle at Haridv§r on this occasion.clark_BIL25a.indd 635/30/2006 1:59:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"chapter two64R§dh§mohand§sjÊ of N§sik (Ghurye 1964:177), a great massacre of bair§gÊ-s by áaiva saÒny§sÊ-s took place at the SiÒh§ßãa Mel§ at N§sik in 1690. Both sects were bathing at the same place, CakratÊrtha, and subsequently an arrangement was made whereby at the mel§ of 1702, the two orders bathed at different places—the “aÒny§sÊs at Tryambaka Kuáavarta and the bair§gÊ-s at R§makuÖ·a—an arrange-ment that still continues. This incident, if true, may have been an important impetus for the organisation of the bair§gÊ-s’akh§Ü§-s. At the SiÒh§ßãa Mel§ at Ujjain in 1789 a dispute between saÒny§sÊ-s andbair§gÊ-s led to intense fighting. The Peáv§ eventually ruled that the two orders should bathe at separate places (Burghart 1983:374). However, at the mel§in 1826, another battle ensued between the two sects. The bair§gÊ-s, assisted by the Mar§ãhas, slaughtered many of the saÒny§sÊ-s and plundered their temples and monasteries in the vicinity of the city. Mindful of potentially bloody consequences, the British made elaborate arrangements for policing the Ujjain Mel§ of 1850, which included the positioning of heavy guns along the procession route, and the deployment of two companies of the Gwalior Infantry under Captain Macpherson. The more powerful bair§gÊ-s were separated from the saÒny§sÊ-s, who were instructed to bathe earlier than the bair§gÊ-s, and in a separate area. One hundred Brahmans were stationed (as ‘human shields’) between the two parties to assist with the bathing arrangements, which passed off without significant incident.It appears that the order of bathing for the akh§Ü§-s was fixed first in Haridv§r, and then subsequently in Allahabad in 1870 (Maclean 2003:888). Eventually, an agreement was signed with the British in 1906 (Nandan 2002:58), which is still adhered to.39 While there are records—particularly in the eighteenth century—of conflicts at Haridv§r, Ujjain and N§sik, there is no record in any account of any significant confrontation at Allahabad. Given the strategic importance of the Allahabad fort—adjacent to the saØgam—which was first garrisoned by British troops in 1765,40 if there had been 39See Rai (1993:25–26); Sarkar (1958:99).40The fort was built by Akbar in 1584 CE. In 1765 CE, as part of the Treaty of Allahabad (between the East India Company, Shuja-ud-Daula and emperor “§hAl§m), the fort was occupied by British troops to protect the emperor. After its cession by S§datAli to the British in February 1798, the fort became, briefly, in 1832, the capital of the North-West Provinces (Maclean 2001:142–144).clark_BIL25a.indd 645/30/2006 1:59:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"akh§Ü§-s and daáan§mÊ functionaries65any serious conflict there, it would no doubt have been recorded in a British report. Maclean (2003:895–896) suggests that the reason for the absence of conflict at Allahabad may have been that the Haridv§rmel§was a larger commercial market than Allahabad for trader-s§dhu-s, and that dominance of trade and taxation by one sect or another led to bathing privileges.41 By contrast, Allahabad was a smaller commercial fair, and it was the nav§b-s and then the British, and not s§dhu-s, who taxed pilgrims. In 1938, the Uttar Pradesh State Legislature gave legal sanction for government par-ticipation in funding and overseeing the two Kumbh Mel§s in the state, at Pray§g and Haridv§r.42 After Indian Independence, the U.P. government developed more permanent rules for the financial support and administration of both the Kumbh and $dh§ Kumbh Mel§s (Lamb 1999:196).Despite control over bathing priorities, there are still occasions of disturbance. Low (1906:193–210), visiting the Kumbh Mel§ at Pray§ga in 1906, records that the most turbulent of the attending sects and akh§Ü§-s are the Bair§gÊs, who on this occasion caused a riot, to quell which the police called out the army. More recently, at Haridv§r, in 1998, rioting ensued amongst the Daáan§mÊs over bathing priorities.Besides the seven Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s mentioned above, some com-mentators discuss other akh§Ü§-s, none of which are now recognised 41Lochtefeld (1994:596–597) suggests that changes in trading routes led to the growing importance of the major annual fair at Haridv§r (which was also the largest horse market in India). The fair coincided with the bathing festival and it seems probable that control over trade and the market-place influenced status and bathing priority.42Mela Act 1938; Mela Rules 1940 (Nandan 2002:12). At Kumbh Mel§s, a total of six processions are allowed (two for Daáan§mÊs), the akh§Ü§-s to follow at a hundred yards distance.

He also considers it is possible that three‘akh§Ü§-s’, the SåkhaÜa,—khaÜa and another so-called akh§Ü§-s, the RåkhaÜa, mentioned by Wilson (1861:148–149)—who also mentions the BhukaÜa and KukaÜaakh§Ü§-s but gives no details—are perhaps all to be considered as just one akh§Ü§, the SåkhaÜa, which seems to have been an order of N§ths.44 Sinha and Saraswati (1987:82–83) also include in the list of Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s the GådaÜaakh§Ü§, said to have been founded in K§áÊ in 1617, on the evidence of an inscrip-tion. This brings Sinha and Saraswati’s total number of Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s to eight.45 However, the GådaÜaakh§Ü§also appears to have been a sect of N§ths.4643The Aganakh§Ü§(recognised by Ghurye as a cognate of the Sanskrit term agni) is said not to be connected with “proper” Daáan§mÊs or n§g§-s. Even though the Agni akh§Ü§did not gain full status as an akh§Ü§until 1971, it seems highly unlikely that the Agni sub-branch did not consider themselves as Daáan§mÊs at the time Ghurye was writing, in the early nineteen-fifties. (Sinha and Saraswati (1978:86) note that the Agni akh§Ü§was built in Banaras in 1957.) Ghurye admits puzzlement over the Alakhiya akh§Ü§,noting that they beg for alms and carry long tongs. By way of clarification: the Alakhiyas may be seen at any large assembly ofakh§Ü§-s. They usually wear hats embellished with peacock feathers and have rope coiled around their waist over a tunic. They are often married and might be considered as a sub-sect of the Daáan§mÊs. A particular role they have is to sing and drum at mel§-s, sometimes proceeding from one dhånÊto the next, collecting flour and money for the akh§Ü§in skull-shaped coconuts (kapard), singing on such themes as saÒny§sÊlife, God, and the delights of cannabis intoxication.44Grierson (1916:866–867) also discusses the RåkhaÜa, SåkhaÜa and —khaÜadivisions, believing them to be branches of the K§nphaãa order of yogÊ-s (N§ths or N§th-Siddhas).45They add that the GådaÜa and Agni akh§Ü§-s are not considered as having the same status as the other six akh§Ü§-s, and that they perform “certain func-tions” for the other akh§Ü§-s. The GådaÜaakh§Ü§is stated to perform mortuary rites for the other akh§Ü§-s. Enquiries at and near the address supplied by Sinha and Saraswati (1978:248), at Pitambarpura, K§áÊ, failed to establish their previous existence there.46Wilson (1861:148–149) and Briggs (1938:10–11) state that the GådaÜas wear the earrings or a piece of wood passed through the lobe of the ear, as worn by the K§nphaãas. Briggs adds that in one ear they may also wear a flat copper plate with the imprint of Gorakhn§th. They carry a small metal pan in which they burn scented wood. This is carried when begging.

They men-tion the common worship of both Bhairava and Datt§treya by the N§ths and the Jån§akh§Ü§ (who previously worshipped Bhairava, but now Datt§treya), the use of and reverence for the dhånÊ (sacred fire) by both n§g§-s and N§ths, the common but not universal use of earrings, and the fact that many names that occur in the list of maÜhÊ-s contain the ending ‘n§th’ (see Appendix 4). While it seems probable that N§ths and the Daáan§mÊ lineages of the akh§Ü§-s had some kind of common ancestry, it should, however, be cautioned that reverence for the dhånÊis not exclusive to the two orders. However, it will be argued that the structure of the Daáan§mÊs, in the form into which it evolved in the last few hundred years, is partially a consequence of the integration of quite radical ascetic lineages within the order, many of which could have had common ancestry in N§th or ‘Tantric’ lineages. It could be that the adoption of Datt§treya to supplant the previous tutelary deity, Bhairava,49 represented the integration of radical ascetic lineages within a newly constituted and orthodox Daáan§mÊ order.Aughar sect of “aivites founded by a Daáan§mÊ named Brahmagiri, through the favour of Gorakhn§th.47Dazey (1990:303), for example, comments that the n§g§-s were most likely a separate sect of áaivaascetics who were converted to advaitaphilosophy and incor-ported into the Daáan§mÊ fold early in the mediaeval period. However, he does not expand on this point.48See also Dazey (1990:305–306); Rigopoulos (1998:97). Visuvalingam (1989:159, 213 fn. 15) incorrectly attributes the view to Lorenzen (1972:46) that the Daáan§mÊsmay have been K§p§likas converted by “aØkara. Lorenzen castes doubt on that claim, first made by Ghurye (1964:104), particularly on the issue of the putative transition from the K§p§lika faith (sic.) to Ved§nta. There are also connections between the Daáan§mÊs and the Ud§sins, the latter also having historical asso-ciations with the N§ths. All three sects worship the dhånÊ, and adhere to advaita philosophy.There is also a tradition that a Daáan§mÊsaÒny§sÊ, Bhakta Giri, was the first to take initiation from “rÊ Cand, the founder of the Ud§sinpanth(Sinha and Saraswati 1978:138). 49Most commentators agree on the change of tutelary deity, but I have been unable to establish exactly when that took place.clark_BIL25a.indd 675/30/2006 1:59:43 PM"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"chapter two682.2 MaÜhÊ-s andd§v§-sSix of the seven Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s (excluding the Agni akh§Ü§) are essentially the main organisational bodies for the Daáan§mÊn§g§-s, and comprise a network of a total of fifty-two maÜhÊ-s (a ‘small hut’ or ‘temple’ in Hindi), which function as lineages within the Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s. There is some inconsitency in the available literature con-cerning the identity of individual maÜhÊ-s and their significance.50DaÖ·Ê-s, being outside the akh§Ü§ system in terms of allegiance and organisation, do not recognise the maÜhÊclassification. As mentioned previously, within the overall Daáan§mÊ structure there are essentially two main lineage traditions which, as we will see, come together during initiation procedures. One set of lineage traditions, comprising then§g§-s, many of the paramahaÒsa-s and associated saÒny§sÊ-s, is constituted within the maÜhÊ-s of the akh§Ü§. The other set of lineages is represented in the monastic traditions of the daÖ·Ê-s. The lineages of the akh§Ü§-s are also known as n§d vaÒá(‘sound’ lineage), as it is the mantra-guru who initiates the saÒny§sÊinto the akh§Ü§.51 The other lineage is known as the viraj§ vaÒá. The viraj§-homa—which is examined in Chapter 3.3—is an essential feature of Daáan§mÊinitiations, performed by an §c§rya-guru who is a representative of the monastic tradition. The term maÜhÊmay have derived from the term maãha,52 and it has been suggested by some commentators that there were fifty-two principal maãha-s before the six n§g§ akh§Ü§-s were formed. PurÊ(2001:58) claims that the fifty-two (or fifty-one) maÜhÊ-s are based on fifty-two centres (kendra) that were adjacent to the fifty-two á§kta-pÊãha-s,53 but that precise information connecting the pÊãha-s to the maÜhÊ-s is not available. He also comments that in colloquial langage, aá§kta-pÊãhais referred to as devÊ kÊ maÜhÊ(maÜhÊof the devÊ).

This is the only time when the d§v§-s have a practical significance. N§g§-s and the other saÒny§sÊ-s of the akh§Ü§ trace their lineage through the mahant-s of the d§v§-s, each of whom belongs to a par-ticularmaÜhÊ.Unlike the complete account of fifty-two distinct maÜhÊ-s and eight d§v§-s presented by several commentators, not all maÜhÊ-s are currently represented at Kumbh Mel§s.Whereas the maÜhÊ-s represent ‘real’ lineages of gurus and disciples, the d§v§-s are units of administrationthat function at Kumbh Mel§s for voting purposes. ThemaÜhÊ-s are lineages of gurus, mahant-s and s§dhu-s who, through association and initiation, transmit doctrines, practices and esoteric knowledge. Lineages of such a kind in the Indian tradition are gen-erally notoriously complex given not only the problems inherent in hagiography but also the manifold tendencies of lineages both to subdivide and also, in some cases, to amalgamate. A guru might have several disciples, one or several of whom may form a sub-lineage, with perhaps the same name, say Giri or PurÊ, and to a greater or lesser extent be affiliated with other sub-branches within the family to which an initiating guru may have belonged. Every non-daÖ·ÊDaáan§mÊmaãhais headed by a mahant whose lineage will be traced, at least theoretically, to a maÜhÊ.56 The maÜhÊ-s are usually referred 54In a recent personal communication, this was confirmed by a westerner who was initiated into the Jån§akh§Ü§in March 2001. His n§g§guru and associates perform Tantric rites at their Himalayan §árama.55See Appendix 4.56However, PurÊ (who is affiliated with the Mah§nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§) also accounts (2001:58–59) for all the ‘ten names’ within the maÜhÊscheme, despite the fact that the specifically daÖ·Êlineages, namely TÊrtha,$árama and SarasvatÊ (and half of the Bh§ratÊs) are usually not classified within the maÜhÊsystem, as the daÖ·Êtradition is distinct. According to PurÊ:1. TÊrthas merged with two maÜhÊ-s of the Giris.2.$áramas merged with two maÜhÊ-s of the Giris. Thus, the original twenty-three maÜhÊ-s of Giris were augmented by four maÜhÊ-s, comprising TÊrthas and $áramas, giving rise to the twenty-seven maÜhÊ-s of Giris.clark_BIL25a.indd 695/30/2006 1:59:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"chapter two70to by number, thus, for example, as the fourth or thirteenth maÜhÊ.Initiates know from the number which maÜhÊand hence lineage is being referred to.57It can be seen at a Kumbh Mel§ how the arrangement of the maÜhÊ-s and d§v§-s is represented spatially.

However, one explanation (L§l PurÊ 2001:58, 73) is that the L§m§maÜhÊwas instituted in Tibet by one Ved Giri, whose guru is believed by some saÒny§sÊ-s to have been Padmasambhava (=Kamal Giri: as in Sanskrit,kamalaandpadmaboth mean ‘lotus’). According to tradition, Padmasamb-hava—the famous Tantric yogÊ and siddha—was initiated into Buddhist Cakra-Yogaby a d§kinÊ, came to Tibet in the eighth century at the invitation of King Khri-Strong-Ide-brtsan in order to assist the establishment of the first Buddhist monastery and to suppress local deities, and was the putative transmitter of the Bardo Thödol.During the twelfth century there appeared the first signs of an order identifying itself with the first diffusion of Buddhism, calling itself the rNying-ma Order, the ‘old order’, and retrospectively claiming the siddhaPadmasambhava as its founder (see Govinda 1960:190; Skilton 1997:188). As a siddha—who have a collective religious heritage spanning N§th, Mah§nubh§va, Buddhist and Tantric traditions—it is not inconceivable that a lineage of ‘N§ths’ deriving from Padmasambhava became the L§m§maÜhÊ, though Padmasambhava is hagiographically ubiquitous.The division of the maÜhÊ-s (as above) is accepted, with minor differences, by most commentators. However, there is a minor disagreement between PurÊ (2001) and some informants, the latter maintaining that it is the SarasvatÊs who constitute one of the c§r maÜhÊ-s (the other being the Bh§ratÊ), while according to PurÊ, the twoc§r maÜhÊ-s constitute the Bh§ratÊs and Vanas.clark_BIL25a.indd 705/30/2006 1:59:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"akh§Ü§-s and daáan§mÊ functionaries71put forward during election to offices within the akh§Ü§.

According to PurÊ, an important figure in the early organisation of the maÜhÊ-s is VaikuÖãha PurÊ, said to have been alive between 968 and 988 CE. PurÊ’s information derives from two written records, thought to be around four hundred years old. An extensive account is also provided (pp. 61–85) of the dozens of lineages deriving from the four main disciples, who are attached to one of the four §mn§ya-s (connected to the four pÊãha-s). This information is said to be derived from a pothÊthat is 250 to 300 years old, in the possession of the bh§ãof theakh§Ü§.However, despite PurÊ’s claims regarding the antiquity of the maÜhÊ-s and the akh§Ü§-s, there is no real evidence that can be adduced that dates back more than three or four hundred years. The lineages (maÜhÊ-s) of the akh§Ü§-s may in some instances have had a geographi-cal connection—such as, for example Giris, PurÊs, Bh§ratÊs and Bans60(Vanas)—but these lineages appear to have been subsequently projected back through a paraÒpar§originating with “aØkara and his four disciples.2.3 Functionaries within the “rÊ Pañc Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§organisationHaving examined the the overall structure of the akh§Ü§-s and their lineages, in this and the two following sections the general hierar-chies and bodies of authority within the Daáan§mÊ order will be considered.The most important body within the organisation of the Daáan§mÊ60Sad§nanda Giri (1976:36) notes that the titles ‘Giri’, ‘PurÊ’, ‘Bh§ratÊ’ and ‘Vana’ are found in the modern lists of both the ‘ten names’ and the maÜhÊ-s.

Vanas, AraÖyas, Parvatas and S§garas “roamed alone” and did not initiate disciples, and hence these names have become rare, while the Giris, PurÊsand Bh§ratÊs increased their numbers through initiation.clark_BIL25a.indd 725/30/2006 1:59:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"akh§Ü§-s and daáan§mÊ functionaries73akh§Ü§-s is the “rÊ Pañc61 which consists of a group of n§g§-s and usu-ally four or sometimes eight mahant-s (see below) from the akh§Ü§. ‘“rÊPañc’ is also a formal appellation preceding the name of the akh§Ü§and may be seen on the proscenium-style arch at the entrance to anakh§Ü§.

During the time between Kumbh Mel§s it is the “rÊPañc that has the highest authority regarding administrative affairs, even though the members may be travelling. The “rÊ Pañc has its own flag, deity and insignia but members do not usually own any significant personal property or have any permanent habitation. However, some members of the “rÊ Pañc, particularly mahant-s, may own properties, such as maãha-s or §árama-s, which may be a part of an extensive landholding. In some akh§Ü§-s the “rÊ Pañc may itself, as a body, own land and properties.All seven Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s have their own “rÊ Pañc, to which officials are usually elected every six years, during either a half or a full Kumbh Mel§. All akh§Ü§-s follow this practice. The election is based on representatives selected from the d§v§-s.

The officers of a Bair§gÊmaÖ·al(a regionally organised unit) are: árÊ-mahant, adhik§rÊ, rasoÊy§, jalbh§rÊandkoãv§l.Bair§gÊs are members of a maÖ·alby virtue of their kuãÊ(§árama/sth§n)being in that area.The hierarchical order within the Nirmala akh§Ü§is also similar (see Oberoi 1997:125, who cites Mahant Dial Singh, Nirmala Panth Daráan, Amritsar, 1952:323–337): “the akhara needs to maintain a touring unit and this shall be always made up of a maximum of 50 and a minimum of 20 Nirmalas. Such a unit will always have the following officiants: a head Mahant [a post below that of the “rÊ Mahant], a Granthi, a Påj§rÊ, a PaÖ·it or GianÊ, a Koãh§rÊ, two K§rb§rÊs, and a “rÊ BhaÖ·arÊ”.clark_BIL25a.indd 745/30/2006 1:59:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"akh§Ü§-s and daáan§mÊ functionaries75age the akh§Ü§-’s properties.

In this way his good qualities are developed and he becomes fit to lead a life in the community. Eventually such people become the heads of the Akh§Ü§s. Sometimes after training they become head of the $árama of the Siddha-Guru. From many places the Akh§Ü§s recruit wayward boys. In this respect they have reshaped the life of many unruly boys, and saved them from becoming thieves and dacoits. When these boys come into the Akh§Ü§ they are made into goodsanny§sinsby rigorous training.”68Eachakh§Ü§controls an average of a hundred religious bodies, such as maãha-s, temples and §árama-s (Jaffrelot 1996:471).69One decision taken quite recently was that the akh§Ü§-s should not become involved in any overt or covert ‘religious’ activity (Dutt 2001). Whether this deci-sion has any binding effect remains, however, to be seen. 70Mah§maÖ·aleávaras usually have lengthy titles, a typical example being, ‘“rÊmat paramahaÒsa parivr§jak§c§rya brahmanißãa ananta árÊ vibhåßitaárÊannapårna pÊãh§dhÊávara mah§maÖ·aleávaraárÊ sv§mÊ viáveávar§nanda giri ji mah§r§ja ved§nt§c§rya’.71Sinha and Saraswati (1978:98) list eight MaÖ·aleávaras, including one $c§rya MaÖ·aleávara, for the Mah§nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§,whereas PurÊ (2001:136–137) lists twenty-nine Mah§maÖ·aleávaras affiliated to that akh§Ü§.clark_BIL25a.indd 765/30/2006 1:59:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"akh§Ü§-s and daáan§mÊ functionaries77akh§Ü§, sometimes indicated on the sign over the gateway to the camp or §árama, in most instances the title is essentially honorary, as, at some time in the past, the Mah§maÖ·aleávara’s maãhawill have broken away from the akh§Ü§. Mah§maÖ·aleávaras often own large §árama-s and deliver public lectures on Ved§nta and related religious topics to large audiences, particularly in the rainy season. Many of them have the office bestowed upon them during a ceremony at a Kumbh Mel§.72 The Mah§maÖ·aleávaras are the heads of a hierarchy within the monastic tradition, which is essentially inde-pendent of the hierarchies that operate within the akh§Ü§-s, except at times of initiation.73Mah§maÖ·aleávaras have essentially replaced the former pre-eminence of the §c§rya-s.H. H. Wilson, writing in 1861, makes no mention of them in the Daáan§mÊ order, and Sad§nanda Giri (1976:50–53) concludes that their office has only developed in the last sixty years or so. He remarks that there used to be only three §c§rya-guru-s, of the NirañjanÊ, Jån§ and [Mah§-] Nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§-s,and that the§c§rya-guru-s used to accompany the akh§Ü§-s for thebaths at the Kumbh Mel§s.

Although these days each akh§Ü§has its own affiliated §c§rya-guru, this has not always been so. PurÊ (2001:133) remarks that the Aãal and Mah§nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§used to share an §c§rya-guru,but that since 1922 the Aãalakh§Ü§created an independent §c§rya-guru. PurÊ provides a parampar§ for the Mah§nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§ of twelve Mah§maÖ·aleávaras (as §c§rya-guru-s), which, realistically, would perhaps go back around 150 years.

Thus, for example, Sinha and Saraswati (1978:98), discussing the residences of the Mah§maÖ·aleávaras of Banaras, note that the $c§rya-MaÖ·aleávaras of the Mah§nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§always reside in the Govinda maãha, those of the NirañjanÊ in the Durbeávaramaãha, and those of the Jån§akh§Ü§in the MÜtyuñj§yamaãha.73To give one example, the current $c§rya Mah§maÖ·aleávara of the Jån§akh§Ü§is Sv§mÊ Avadheá§nanda Giri, who was elected at the 1998 Haridv§r Kumbh Mel§.

It seems that from hundreds of years before the time of “aØkara (eighth century CE), until the last century or so, it was parißad-s of learned Brahmans who adjudicated on doubtful points of religious conduct, and prescribed appropriate penances (Kane HD“, Vol. 2:971–974). Only rarely were heads of maãha-s asked to decide. Dur-ing the time of Mar§ãh§ domination, the king or minister consulted the Brahmans in holy places such as Paithan, N§sik and Karad on religious matters and only rarely consulted the heads of maãha-s. This arrangement prevailed until the time of the British, and it was 74Sinha and Saraswati’s account (1978:96) of an anecdote related to them by an informant from the Jån§akh§Ü§may throw some light on this issue. According to their informant, around a century ago n§g§-s used to give the highest honour todaÖ·Ê-s, whom they regarded as their gurus. At that time, the daÖ·Ê-s used to initiate the paramahaÒsa-s and n§g§-s into saÒny§sa.Then§g§-s used to carry the palanquin of the “aØkar§c§rya, who is considered to be the spiritual head of the Daáan§mÊsaÒny§sÊ-s. However, a dispute arose when the d§Ö·Ê-s, who are Brahman brahmac§rÊ-s, cast doubt on the purity of the paramahaÒsa-s and n§g§-s. Henceforth, thedaÖ·Ê-s refused to initiate the paramahaÒsa-s and n§g§-s into saÒny§sa.As a con-sequence, the institution of §c§rya-guruarose, whereby a Mah§maÖ·aleávara from a monastic tradition, and who may also be a daÖ·Ê, will initiate paramahaÒsa-s and n§g§-s at a Kumbh Mel§.75For example, from an inscription of 1356 (Epigraphia Carnatica, vol. X, Kolar, no. 222), we learn that Kum§ra Kampana, one of the early rulers of the Vijay-anagara empire, and the first son of Bukka I, was appointed by his father as the Mah§maÖ·aleávara of the Mulb§gal region, entrusted with the task of extending Vijayanagara rule in the Tamil country. Most of the Mah§maÖ·aleávaras were members of the royal family in the early period of Vijayanagara rule. By the time of Harihara II, local tax collection systems of the village assemblies were bypassed and replaced by directly appointed Mah§maÖ·aleávaras and other such officials.

Cases typically involve marriage, adultery and sexual offences, reli-gious rites and caste practice, anti-social acts, change of occupation, caste pollution, interpreting á§stra-s, caste, initiation and personal affairs. Complaints from individuals are usually first taken to the localpañc§yat, and a report elicited, before the case is presented to a maãha. Branch maãha-s of the “aØkarapÊãha-s have mudr§dhik§rÊ-s who refer cases to the dharm§dhik§rÊ(supervisor), someone who belongs to one of the “aØkaritepÊãha-s and decides on matters of caste, moral conduct and ritual obligation. Many of the cases are also consid-ered by the “aØkar§c§rya. Although complaints are brought to the pÊãha and adjudicated, the pÊãha-s never actively pursue cases in the role of prosecutor. The punishment dispensed in cases which are adjudicated is seldom harsh, typically involving a small fine, forms of social exclusion or purification and expiation ceremonies. Only rarely, usually in cases of sexual misconduct, is someone excluded from the community. The pÊãha-s have considerable authority, par-ticularly among some sections of Brahmans.In this chapter, the structure, organisation and hierarchies within theakh§Ü§-s have been examined. As noted in the previous chapter (1.6), several commentators81 claim that the akh§Ü§-s are in some respects democratic and non-hierarchical. However, it is evident from our consideration of the organisation of the akh§Ü§-s that the akh§Ü§-s are essentially hierarchical in terms of authority and decision-making. Conflicts between the akh§Ü§-s were referred to, illustrating the radically different character of the militant wing of the Daáan§mÊsfrom that of the monastic tradition. Yet it remains to be explained how the “aØkar§c§ryas—the preeminent heads of the Daáan§mÊmonastic tradition—are integrated within a structure that incorporates the militant akh§Ü§-s. This is illustrated in initiation procedures, the main topic of the next chapter. 80Some Daáan§mÊmaãha-s are also known as pÊãha-s: see Ch. 4.4.81See, for example, Sad§nanda Giri (1976:27); Sinha and Saraswati (1978:196); Dazey (1987:557; 1990:309).clark_BIL25a.indd 805/30/2006 1:59:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"renunciation, rules for ascetics, and initiation81CHAPTER THREERENUNCIATION, RULES FOR ASCETICS, AND INITIATIONIn this chapter, the procedures of renunciation are considered. A brief comparison between the earliest texts that provide details of renunciation procedures and a recent account of these rites illustrates the remarkable continuity in saÒny§sarites for around two millennia. However, several points that are not apparent in the ancient accounts are revealed in the details provided for contemporary procedures. Firstly, at least one officiating guru is required to perform the rite of renunciation for the candidate. In a modern anthropological context, such facilitation not only liberates the renunciate from a prior social identity, but, as indicated in the Introduction to this dissertation, the samesaÒny§sarite also simultaneously initiates the renunciate into the renunciate lineage of the initiating guru: the saÒny§sarite has two aspects, constituting both a renunciation of one social order, and an initiation into another social order, that of a renunciate sect. Another key component of this chapter is the illustration of how the militant wing of the Daáan§mÊ order is ideologically linked to the monastic wing, via the auspices and participation of a high executive of the monastic wing (frequently a “aØkar§c§rya) in the initiation of paramahaÒsa-s and potential n§g§-s during the saÒny§sarite.3.1.Renunciation proceduresThe earliest extant account of Brahmanical injunctions for the renun-ciate and renunciation procedures is to be found in the Dharmasåtra of Baudh§yana (2.17–18),1 the earliest portions of which may be dated from around the beginning of the third to the middle of the second century BCE. There seem, however, to have been a sig-nificant number of later interpolations in the text, most probably 1Kane (HD“, Vol. 2: 953).clark_BIL25a.indd 815/30/2006 1:59:54 PM"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"chapter three82including the section on renunciatory rites.2 It is in the Dharmasåtra of Baudh§yana that the term saÒny§safirst appears in dharma litera-ture. Other extant Dharmasåtra texts3 also deal at some length with the life of the renunciate; those of Gautama (3.11–25), $pastamba (2.21.1–17) and Vasißãha (10.1–31).4 These writers frequently quote from unnamed sources (Olivelle 1977:21 fn. 4).5According to Baudh§yana (2.17.1–7),6 renunciation may be per-formed by a widower or by someone who has settled his children in their respective duties. It is also prescribed for people over sev-enty years of age or for a forest hermit who has retired from ritual activities.7 During the procedure,8 the candidate internalises the s§vitrÊ2See Olivelle (1999:xxx-xxxiii). Kane (HD“, Vol. 1:52) tentatively dates Baudh§-yana to 600–300 BCE.3For the translation of the Dharmasåtra-s, see Olivelle (1999).4Rules for ‘fourth-§árama’yati-s (or parivr§jaka-s or saÒny§sÊ-s) also appear in variousPur§Öa-s. See, for example, Kårma Pur§Öa(II.28);N§rada Pur§Öa(I.27.92–106; II.43.123–127).5Kane (HD“ Vol.1:989-1158) lists over eighty works dealing exclusively with renunciation. Unfortunately, most still remain in manuscript form and little work has been done on editing the texts. Until Olivelle’s (1977–1978) editing of V§sudev§árama’sYatidharmaprak§áa, a text dated to between, most probably, 1675 and 1800, the only other mediaeval treatises on renunciation to have been published were ViáveávarasarasvatÊ’sYatidharmasaÒgrahaand Vidy§raÖya’sJÊvanmuktiviveka. 6The candidate first has his head, beard and body shaved and his nails clipped. Then, taking a triple-staff, sling, water-strainer, water-pot and bowl, he goes to the boundary of the village, eats a light meal of ghee, milk and curds, and then fasts. He then recites and internalises the s§vitrÊ mantra several times, in different ways. Before sunset he performs his daily fire sacrifice with offerings of ghee, and spends the night awake. In the last portion of the night he gets up and performs last daily fire sacrifice, making an offering to the Fire common to all men with an oblation prepared in twelve potsherds. He throws into the offertorial fire the vessels used in the daily sacrifice that are not made of of clay or stone (i.e. wood), and into the household fire he throws the two fire-drills. He deposits the sacred fires in himself, breathing in the smell of each fire three times, saying: “With that body of yours worthy of sacrifice, O Fire...” Then, standing within the sacrificial area, he recites, three times softly and three times aloud, the praißa mantra (see below). Filling his cupped hands with water, he pours it out, saying: “I give safety to all creatures!” He takes the staff, sling, water-pot and bowl, reciting appropriate ritual formulae. Taking the aforementioned mendicant’s possessions, he goes to a water place, bathes and sips water, reciting mantras (the SurabhimatÊ, AbliØga, V§ruÖÊ, HiraÖyavarÖaand P§vam§nÊ verses). Entering the water, he controls his breath sixteen times while reciting the AghamarßaÖa hymn; comes out of the water; squeezes the water from his clothes; wears another clean garment; and sips water. Then, taking the water strainer, he recites other mantras: to the elements, the sun, the ancestors and himself; he should then recite the s§vitrÊ mantra, up to an unlimited number of times.7Also, it is meant for “§lÊnas and Y§y§varas who are childless.

I have renounced! I have renounced!” A significant omission in Baudh§yana’s account is the absence of reference to anyone who assists, supervises or instigates the saÒny§sa rites: a guru is not mentioned. The candidate of Baudh§yana’s text would need to have knowledge of the procedures of renunciation for it to be performed. This aspect is crucial, as it is initiation by a guru (who has a lineage), through the performance of correct rites, that validates saÒny§sa.The earliest known Brahmanical text devoted specifically to renun-ciation is the Yatidharmasamuccayaof Y§dava Prak§áa,12 written in who were originally two types of Vedic sacrificer. The former maintained a stable residence, whereas the latter were given to wandering. Together they constitute a category of Vedic sacrificer who is distinguished from the ordinary householder (see Olivelle 1993:162).8A slightly different version of the initiatory rite is given in the Vaikh§nasa Sm§rtasåtra, and reference is made to several of its elements in the Manu SmÜti (6.38),Y§jñavalkya SmÜti(3.56) and VißÖu SmÜti(96.1) (see Olivelle 1977:37). It is also described in most SaÒny§sa Upanißad-s (see Olivelle 1992) and is substantially similar to accounts found in later, mediaeval texts on renunciation.9RV III.62.10, also known as ‘entry into s§vitrÊ’ or the g§yatrÊ mantra: “OÒ Earth! I enter S§vitrÊ; that excellent [glory] of S§vitÜ. OÒ Atmosphere! I enter S§vitrÊ;the glory of god we meditate. OÒ Sky! I enter S§vitrÊ; that he may stimulate our prayers” (tr. Olivelle 1999:204). This mantra is the most sacred mantra of the Brahmanical tradition. It is imparted at initiation (upanayana) when the youth becomes a twice-born and a full participant in the religious life of the Brahmanical community. See Sharma (1988) for the religious use and symbolism of the g§yatrÊmantrain contemporary Hinduism.10One of the central motifs within the complex of ideas concerning renuncia-tion in the Brahmanical world is that the external fires become internalised, as the renouncer’s breath. In most sources the internalised fires are identified with the breath or with the five breaths, but in the $ruÖi Upanißad(2) the external fires are deposited in the stomach and the g§yatrÊ mantra in the fire of speech. The inter-nalisation of the fires is accompanied by the relinquishing of ritual paraphernalia into the fire or water.11Thepraißais the technical term for the mantra, ‘I have renounced’ and con-stitutes an essential feature of the renunciatory rite. Olivelle translates it as ‘Call’. Praißais a technical term in Vedic ritual vocabulary, and within that context it refers to the formulae used by Adhvaryu priests to perform specific procedures. It is unclear why this formula was given that technical appellation (Olivelle 1992:95; 1995:67 fn. 26).12According to tradition, Y§dava Prak§áa was the advaita-Ved§ntin teacher of R§m§nuja, whom he had plotted to kill after R§m§nuja’s challenge to his own advaitaphilosophical view. Y§dava Prak§áa subsequently converted to R§m§nuja’s more devotionalviáißã§dvaita(qualified non-dualism) philosophy and became his disciple. R§m§nuja was the founder of the first orthodox vaißÖavaorder of ascetics, known clark_BIL25a.indd 835/30/2006 1:59:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"chapter three84the twelfth century.13 While it is evident that Brahmanical texts on renunciation are generally of vaißÖavapersuasion, more than other mediaeval works on asceticism, the Yatidharmasamuccayaintegrates ascetic life into the ritual life of the Brahmanical vaißÖavatradition (Olivelle 1995:17).14 Y§dava Prak§áa (4.1-49) details the rites of renunciation, primarily according to “aunaka.15 As a preliminary practice before initiation, the so-called kÜcchra16(arduous) penances are to be performed (4.2), followed by ár§ddhaoblations (4.2, 4, 26).17A crucial feature of saÒny§sais that, unlike the ordinary people, the deadsaÒny§sÊdoes not become a ghost but is united immediately with the ancestral spirits. The ár§ddha-s usually performed for a dead person in a ghostly state (ekoddißãaár§ddha), and the customary rite of offeringpiÖ·aa year after the death of a relative (to six generations as the “rÊsamprad§ya, one of the four extant vaißÖava samprad§ya-s. It is also believed that R§m§nuja climbed the gopuram of the VißÖu temple in Goßãipåra, and shouted out, for all to hear, including áådra-s, the secret eight-syllable saÒny§sÊmantra he had just received from Goßãipurna (Ramakrishnanada 1959:151–155).13See Olivelle (1995). See Olivelle (1976–1977; 1986–1987) for other mediaeval texts on renunciation, several of which refer to a work called Brahm§nandÊ—a lost work—which seems to have been a basic text (Olivelle 1976:25).14There are numerous references throughout the text to VißÖu, his emblem, offerings to him, and to the renouncer as VißÖu: 2.51, 65; 3.6, 10, 53; 4.28, 35; 5.23–24, 32–33, 76-81, 91–142, 260, 293; 6.64, 68, 81, 203–204, 223, 229–314; 7.65–66, 89, 100, 108; 9.25, 45–58; 10.11; 11.28.15He also cites eight other authorites: Baudh§yana, Vasißãha, K§ty§yana, Jama-dagni, Kapila, J§b§li, AØgiras and Likhita.16FourkÜcchra penances constitute what is technically known as a pr§j§patya pen-ance, which consists of taking one meal a day for six days—a morning meal for the first three days and an evening meal the second—eating what is received unasked during the next three days, and fasting during the last three. A single kÜcchra pen-ance—also called p§dakÜcchra(‘quarter penance’) at Y§jñavalkya Dharmaá§stra3.3.18—isto perform the same four austerities for only one day each (Olivelle 1995:60). In Gautama Dharmasåtra(26) three kinds of kÜcchrapenances are described, involving progressive restrictions on eating over twelve days, finally only drinking water. The following chapter (27) describes the c§ndr§yaÖa(‘lunar’) penance, whereby a lunar month of dietary control is observed, progressively decreasing and increasing food intake. The sequential rules of the kÜcchraalso apply to this penance. 17First to the gods, second to the seers, third to the divine beings, fourth to male ancestors, fifth to female ancestors, sixth to human beings, seventh to the elements, and eighth to the self. Kane (HD“ Vol. 2:932), commenting on the NarasiÒha Pur§Öa,remarks that the eight ár§ddha-s are: daiva(to Vasus, Rudras, $dityas);§rßa (to the ten sages, including MarÊci and others); divya(to HiraÖyagarbha and Vair§ja);manußya (to Sanaka, Sanandana and five others); bhautika(to five bhåta-s,pÜthvÊ, etc.); paitÜka (to Kavyav§· fire [?], Soma, Aryaman, pitÜ-s called Agniv§tta etc.); m§tÜár§ddha(to tenm§tÜ-s, such as GaurÊ, Padm§);§tmaár§ddha(toparam§tman).clark_BIL25a.indd 845/30/2006 1:59:56 PM"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"renunciation, rules for ascetics, and initiation85of ancestors), do not need to be performed for the saÒny§sÊwho has performed his own ár§ddha.18 The s§vitrÊmantra is then internalised, followed by a night’s vigil. After bathing at first light, the candidate performs the morning fire sacrifice, reciting the Great Utterances19and the hymn, “Swift runs the river of delight...” (RV IX.58). He should feed some Brahmans and make oblations to the fire, saying: “To the in-breath, sv§h§! To the out-breath, sv§h§! To the dif-fused breath, sv§h§! To the top-breath, sv§h§! To the middle-breath, sv§h§!” After this he recites the Purußa-såkta (RV X.90), offering a piece of firewood, ghee and porridge to the fire at each verse. He then makes further oblations to Agni SvißãakÜt (the aspect of the fire-god that ‘makes a sacrifice properly offered’), makes presents to his teacher (of a cow, a bowl of ghee or anything else) and recitesverses from the TaittirÊya$raÖyaka(II.18.1) and the TaittirÊya Br§hmaÖa(II.5.8.8), depositing the fires in himself. He should then stand beforethe fire or in water and recite the praißa mantra three times softly, three times in a medium voice, and three times in a loud voice.20One of the most detailed accounts of initiatory procedures is con-tained in V§sudev§árama’sYatidharmaprak§áa,21 a vaißÖavaorientated advaita work of the late seventeenth or eighteenth century,22 which18Technically, the ár§ddharites, wherein gods and ancestors are invoked, are essentially a component of, or supplement to, what might be translated as full funeral rites, known as antyeßãi(see Parry 1982:84; Prasad 1995).19There are either three or seven Great Utterances (vy§hÜti), denoting ‘worlds’: bhåÈ, bhuvaÈ, svaÈ,with the addition of mahar, janas, tapas, satya (see Olivelle 1995:63 fn. 13).20Y§dava Prak§áa also includes injunctions (4.40-48) for those who wish to renounce in the face of imminent death or mortal danger. If the man is able, he may perform the proper procedure, otherwise he may simply recite orally the praißamantra. If he is unable to do that he should just mentally abandon attachments.21V§sudev§árama was acquainted with fifteen works dealing with dharma, four of them particularly with renunciation: Vidy§raÖya’sJÊvanmuktiviveka,Yatidharma-samuccayaandPraÖavamÊm§Òs§(c.1360), and ViáveávarasarasvatÊ’sYatidharmasaÒgraha (early sixteenth century), also known as the Yatidharmasamuccaya.Besides the latter works and Vijñ§neávara’s work on dharma,Mit§kßar§(1100–1120), V§sudev§árama was most influenced by the advatin philosopher MadhusådanasarasvatÊ, the pupil of ViáveávarasarasvatÊ: he cities his Siddh§ntabindu (46.12–14). V§sudev§árama also cites or refers to the works of “aØkara (8th cent.), Sureávara (8th cent.), Prak§á§tman (c. 975), V§caspatimiára (c.980), Sarvajñ§tman (c.1027), Vidy§raÖya (c.1340–1386), MadhusådanasarasvatÊ (1540–1647), NarasiÒh§árama (mid-16th century), R§matÊrtha (mid-16th century) and RaØgojÊ Bhaããa (c.1575) (Olivelle 1977:28).22In the final section (73) of his treatise, V§sudev§árama describes himself as aParamahaÒsa renouncer, the pupil of “rÊ Govind§árama, who was the pupil of “rÊ R§makÜßÖ§árama.clark_BIL25a.indd 855/30/2006 1:59:56 PM"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"chapter three86contains one of the first textual references to the ‘ten names’ (66.14–15) of the Daáan§mÊs. Following Baudh§yana (II.17.11), V§sudev§áramamaintains23(3) that five items are obligatory for the renouncer (8.25): either a single or a triple-staff, a braided string to loop around the mouth of a water pot to carry it, a water strainer, a water-pot and a begging-bowl. The triple staff was usually the kind carried by vaißÖavarenunciates, and the single kind by áaivarenunciates. During Daáan§mÊ renunciation procedures the saÒny§sÊis given a loincloth, and a single staff, which is abandoned shortly if the saÒny§sÊis affili-ated to an akh§Ü§but is maintained by daÖ·Ê-s. In his commentary on the BÜhad§raÖyaka Upanißad(III.5.1),24“aØkara maintains that a renouncer should give up all rites and ritual instruments, such as fire, top-knot and sacrificial cord, a position maintained by later advaitin-s. One may easily distinguish Daáan§mÊ from other s§dhu-s (notablyvaißÖava) by the absence of the top-knot, which is removed 23According to V§sudev§árama, renunciation procedures are as follows (see Olivelle (1976; 1977) for the full text; see Olivelle (1977:38) for this resumé). To renounce, he: 1. Performs one penance if he belongs to an §áramaand four if he does not (6.1-19; 21.2). 2. Performs eight ár§ddha-s (nine at 21.3) according to the rules of vÜddhiár§ddha(7.1-61; 21.3-35). 3. Gathers the articles needed by a renouncer (8.24-27).4. Declares his intention to renounce. Three rites follow immediately thereafter: worship of GaÖapati, proclamation of an auspicious day, and worship of the divine mothers (21.37-38). 5. Shaves his beard and head (except the top-knot), pares his nails and bathes (9.10; 21.39-41). 6. Kindles the sacred fires and offers the sacrifice to Brahman (21.41-44). 7. Performs the entry into S§vitrÊ(8.28-29; 9.1-23; 21.49-56). 8. Performs the brahm§nv§dh§naand declares his intention to fast (10.1-4; 21.57-64). 9. Offers the evening sacrifice (11.1; 21.67). 10. Keeps awake and fasts during the night before renunciation (11.1-8). 11. Bathes in the morning, performs the saÒdhy§worship and offers the fire sacrifice (12.1-5; 21.72-74). 12.Offers a sacrifice to Praj§pati or Agni Vaiáv§nara (12.6-27; 21.76-77). 13. Gives away all his possessions to the priest (12.11-12). 14. Deposits the fires in his self and discards the sacrificial utensils (12.29-35; 13.1-18; 21.72-74). 15. Makes a caru oblation to Purußa (13.27-33; 21.82-86). (A caruoblation is an offering of boiled rice with milk or butter. This is performed by someone with one fire, while some-one with three fires offers an ißãi, constituting a burnt offering of rice or barley. It is an oblation customarily associated with the worship of ancestors, frequently mentioned in inscriptions.) 16. Offers the viraj§oblation (an optional rite, 14.1-47). 17. Proclaims the praißa(16.1-27; 21.91-114) in the following manner: (i) takes leave of his relatives; (ii) leaves home and goes to a lake; (iii) declares his intention to renounce; (iv) makes an offering of water; (v) discards the sacrificial thread; (vi) plucks the hair of the top-knot; (vii) declares the praißa; (viii) gives the gift of safety to all creatures. 18. Either commits suicide (17.1-32; 21.115), or 19. Takes pos-session of the articles needed by the renouncer (18.1-13; 21.116-128). 20.

V§sudev§árama makes several references to shav-ing the head (5), some non-specific (8.3; 9.10), and another (21.39) clearly stating that the top-knot should be retained. However, during the subsequent procedures for renunciation, the renouncer discards one by one the symbols of his ritual life: the s§vitrÊformula and the sacred fires (which are internalised), sacrificial utensils, sacred thread and top-knot.The abandoning of all emblems and rites became one of the points of contention during the mediaeval period between adherents of the advaitaphilosophy of “aØkara, and those of the viáißã§dvaitaphilosophyof R§m§nuja, who believed that, at least, the sacrificial cord should be maintained. One of the issues underpinning this debate is the viáißã§dvaitacontention that knowledge alone cannot cause liberation and that action, particularly religious ritual action, should accompany the quest for knowledge. This is in contrast to the advaitaposition that all action should be abandoned and that knowledge alone brings liberation. Unlike many other commentators on renunciation, the advaitinV§sudev§árama was not biased in a sectarian way.25 He does not adjudicate—as had become customary in advaitaorders—over the relative superiority of either advaitin-s (as the carriers of the single staff), or members of one of the vaißÖavaascetic orders (who tradi-tionally carry the triple staff). The type of staff carried had become a self-conscious, emblematic, sectarian distinction.26The final sacrifice a renunciate will make is performed during the 25V§sudev§árama states that, according to one opinion (64.5-30), the renouncer worships KÜßÖa, Vy§sa,“aØkara, his gurus, GaÖapati, Kßetrap§la, Durg§, SarasvatÊ,the guardian deities of the quarters, Brahm§ and Rudra. However, others maintain that only VißÖu in the form of the á§lagr§ma is worshipped (64.1-35). 26Olivelle (1993:172; 1995:132) has remarked on the significance of the types of staffs carried by ascetics in relation to sectarian hierarchies. In a vaißÖava text, theSanatkum§ra-saÒhit§(5.34–38), the advaita HaÒsa and ParamahaÒsa ascetics are described as carrying a single staff, whereas the ‘higher’ classes of vaißÖava ascetics, the Bhagav§n and the Prabhu, carry the triple staff. VaißÖavaorientated texts make frequent derogatory remarks against the áaiva advaita ascetics who carry the single staff, and not the triple staff (see, for example, Yatidharmasamuccaya7.71).“rÊ-VaißÖavaascetics, who carried triple staffs, often accused the advaitin-s of being Buddhists pretending to follow the Brahmanical law. However, most SaÒny§sa Upanißad-s and mediaeval legal texts consider the carrying of either the single or the triple staff as a feature of the four-fold classification of renouncers and not as sectarian badges (Olivelle 1986:43). There is an ‘ideal’ classification of four kinds of renouncer (kuãÊcaka, bahådaka, haÒsa, paramahaÒsa) to be found in many texts, which concerns their different emblems and lifestyles. For further details, see Ch. 3.4.clark_BIL25a.indd 875/30/2006 1:59:58 PM"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"chapter three88saÒny§sarite. V§sudev§árama states (12.6-7; 21.76) that the sacrifice may be to either Agni Vaiáv§nara or Praj§pati, reflecting the divergent views on which deity should be the recipient of the offering.27Dur-ing Daáan§mÊ initiation rites, the final sacrifice is to Praj§pati.28The renouncer should then perform the caruoblation to Purußa(15) and, optionally, a viraj§oblation (16), and should declare the praißa(17). (All three rites are central to Daáan§mÊ procedures and the performance of the viraj§-homais crucial.) The renouncer may then commit ritual suicide (18) or exercise the option of not doing so. The renouncer should take a few steps towards the north until called back by his teacher. The journey to ‘the north’ is symbolic of the Great Journey to the Himalayas,29 undertaken without food or water, until the traveller died.3027Baudh§yana (II.17.23) states that the sacrifice should be to Agni, but the SaÒny§sa Upanißad-s contain contrasting opinions. The J§b§la Upanißad(4) states that though some perform a sacrifice to Praj§pati, one should not do so, rather the sacrifice should be to Agni. However, the N§radaparivr§jaka Upanißad (138) maintains that the sacrifice should be to Praj§pati, and the Kaãhaáruti Upanißad(38) that there should be oblations to Agni Vaiáv§nara, Praj§pati and to VißÖu (see SaÒny§sa Upanißad-s, trans. Olivelle 1992). Both Manu (6.38) and the VißÖu SmÜti (96.1) (see Jolly 1991) state that the final sacrifice should be to Praj§pati. The Kårma Pur§Öa(II.28.4) states that it can be either to Agni or Praj§pati. Y§dava Prak§áa (4.31) cites J§madagnya, who states that the renouncer should perform a sacrifice to Praj§pati at which he gives all his possessions as a sacrificial gift to the priests and deposits the fires in himself. Apart from the inclusion of Praj§pati within a mantra stated by“aunaka, as a feature of the saÒny§sarite (4.12), Y§dava Prak§áa only once mentions a sacrifice to Praj§pati.28Concerning the ambivalence of commentators regarding the deity to be the object of the final oblation, we might consider a feature of the Vedic agnicayana ceremony. Contrasting the generally iconic Hindu religious environment with the generally aniconic Vedic religious environment, Malamoud (1998:212) remarks that the aniconism of the Veda is not absolute. He discusses several instances, one of them during the agnicayanaceremony (the ‘piling of the fire-altar’), when a golden statuette is placed at the base of the brick structure. This statuette is an image of the sacrificer and also of the two divinities Agni and Praj§pati, with whom the sac-rificer is secondarily identified. Agni and Praj§pati are furthermore identified with one another within the ceremony itself. The identity of the two deities is frequently alluded to in many Brahmanical texts. In the “atapatha Br§hmaÖa the identity of the two is continually reaffirmed. The traditional, partial identity of the two deities might to some extent explain the ambivalence of commentators on renunciation in respect of the deity to whom the recipient makes the final oblation.29As in the final two books of the Mah§bh§rata.30On ritual suicide and the rite of renunciation, see Olivelle (1978).clark_BIL25a.indd 885/30/2006 1:59:59 PM"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"renunciation, rules for ascetics, and initiation893.2Current initiation procedures: pañc-guru-saÒsk§rAmong the more comprehensive published accounts of formal Daáan§mÊ initiation procedures are those of Sarkar (1958:63–81), Sad§nanda Giri (1976:26–31) and Tripathi (1978:7–11).31 However, their accounts do not illustrate the two-stage process of initiation.32All candidates first approach a mahantof an §árama or a maãha, having demonstrated a sincere desire to renounce and honour a guru. The first stage of initiation for entrants into non-daÖ·Êinstitutions is known as the pañc-guru-saÒsk§r(‘five guru ceremony’),33 while the first stage in daÖ·Êinitiations is to become a brahmac§rÊ, acquiring one of the four daÖ·Êsurnames,34$nanda, Caitanya, Prak§áa or Svaråpa, depend-ing on the organisational affiliation of the maãhafrom which the candidate is taking initiation.35 A brahmac§rÊgenerally serves fully initiated saÒny§sÊ-s, as, theoretically, a daÖ·Êis not supposed to touch fire or metal. The second stage—for all—is the saÒny§sainitiation, known as vidy§-saÒsk§r or viraj§-havan(orhoma).During the pañc-guru-saÒsk§rthe candidate acquires, besides his main guru, four other gurus, from either the daÖ·Ê maãha, or from 31See also Ghurye (1964:105); Sinha and Saraswati (1978:65); and earlier ethnog-raphers, such as Rose (1914, Vol. 3:348–355) and Anantakrishna Iyer (1930–1931). Sarkar (1958:66) refers to two texts as sources for his information, the Sannyas-grahan-paddh§tiof ParamahaÒsa Gop§l§nand (Banaras 1941)—which I have been unable to locate—and the YatidharmasaÒgrahaof ViáveávarasarasvatÊ (Anand Ashram Press, 1909), who was the teacher of the advaitin MadhusådanasarasvatÊ (1540–1647). The text of the YatidharmasaÒgraha(also known as the Yatidharmasamuccaya) is often in whole or in part contained in manuscripts entitled Viáveávara SmÜti. A work entitled Pañcam§árama-vidh§nais a work based on or contained in the Viáveávara SmÜti, a title of numerous similar but not identical texts (Olivelle 1986:21).32Sad§nanda Giri and Tripathi were both initiated into the Daáan§mÊs, as aparamahaÒsaanddaÖ·Êrespectively. Tripathi describes most of the procedures outlined in the following section. His top-knot and sacred thread were removed by his preceptor, the top-knot being thrown into the Ganges, and the sacred thread tied to the daÖ·a.The climax of his initiation ceremony was when the preceptor whispered the praißa(or“iva)mantrainto his ear.33SomedaÖ·Êinstitutions, such as the MachlÊbandar Maãha (one of the larger daÖ·Êinstitutions, with headquarters in Banaras) also perform the preliminary pañc-guru-saÒsk§rinitiation, some time before the viraj§-homa.34Amongst the daÖ·Ê-s, the guru’s name is referred to as prem-path, and the áißya-’s as yog-path.35Thebrahmac§rÊ-s I interviewed from the MachlÊbandar Maãha of Banaras all took the brahmac§rÊname Svaråpa, owing to the maãha-’s theoretical affiliation to the“§rad§pÊãhain Dv§rak§.clark_BIL25a.indd 895/30/2006 2:00:00 PM"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"chapter three90theakh§Ü§.

Some kind of initiation by a Mah§maÖ·aleávara or Daáan§mÊs§dhumay also be given quite freely to aspirants such as roving and inquisitive foreigners.37 However, although a new name, mantra and meditation techniques may be given, Daáan§mÊsemphasise the importance of the performance of the viraj§-homa (see below), incumbent on all genuine daÖ·Ê-s,paramahaÒsa-s and n§g§-s, before one is truly a saÒny§sÊ.38The following details of current initiation procedures are as per-formed by candidates taking initiation into the Jån§akh§Ü§. First, the keeper of the akh§Ü§records, the k§rb§rÊ, duly records the name of the candidate, whose guru is so and so, and that he has paid his dues (frequently fifty-one rupees) to a particular ma·hiof the “rÊPañcn§m Jån§ Akh§Ü§ for the maintenance of the chaÜÊ (‘mobile shrine’) of Guru Datt§treya. The date is recorded according to the 36Sawai (1992:155) observes that at the time of his research at the “ÜØgerÊmaãha,in 1984: “There are in “ÜØgerÊ currently only three saÒny§sinsincluding the senior Jagadguru (mah§saÒnidh§namin Sanskrit and Dodda GurugaÏa “old teacher” in Kanna·a).

Technically, the initiating guru is not considered to be the candidate’s ‘real’ guru, as the initiating guru is merely the witness guru, s§kßÊ-guru, to the event of the candidate becoming a disciple of Datt§treya, the Lord of YogÊs.Besides the initiating guru (the mantra-guru), who is effectively the main guru, there are four other gurus from the same akh§Ü§ pres-ent, who, with appropriate mantras, will present the candidate with, respectively, holy ash (vibhåti), loin-cloth (langoãÊ), a necklace of beads (rudr§kßa) and sacred thread (janeå).39 These five gurus constitute the so-calledpañc-guru-s that the candidates acquire on their first initia-tion, known as the mantra-guru, rudr§kßa-guruetc. Under the bhagv§,held aloft by other s§dhu-s, the candidate’s top-knot is cut and the guru-mantrais whispered three times into the candidate’s ear by the mantra-guru, ending: “NamaÈ parvatÊ pate, hara hara Mah§deva”. He is given a new name, ending in one of the ten Daáan§mÊ names.40The candidate then bathes, smears his body with holy ash, and is given a loin-cloth, rudr§kßaand sacred thread. He is finally wrapped in the bhagv§and places a monetary offering (dakßiÖ§) at the guru’s feet. He then performs what is known as oÒkar-s to the five gurus, 39PurÊ (2001:160–167) provides the mantras used in the Mah§nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§for the following: cutting the coãÊ (top-knot); mantra ‘blown’ into the ear; bhagv§;guru; ‘laying’ of the gerå(ochre colour) on cloth; vibhåti; Vedic mantra for wearing bhasm (‘ash’); applying candan(‘sandalwood’) paste; rudr§kßa;langoãÊ;pÜthvÊ(‘earth’); jal(‘water’);G§yatrÊ; going in the direction of ‘the field’; purification of the water vessel (kamaÖ·al ); the tent; tooth-brushing; bringing the dhånÊto ‘consciousness’; digambar(n§g§) initiation; jaã§;gol§(‘ball of ash’); sam§dhi.40This ceremony is referred to in the Brahmanical texts on renunciation as the yogapaããa, wherein the candidate receives a new name and recites the fifteenth to the thirty-third verses of the eleventh chapter of the BhagavadgÊt§.SeeYatidharmaprak§áa66. 1–24, ‘The Procedure of (Conferring) the Meditation Shawl’, where one of the first textual references to the ‘Ten Names’ occurs.clark_BIL25a.indd 915/30/2006 2:00:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"chapter three92a cycle of five rounds of a mantra,41 to each guru, presenting each withdakßiÖ§of one rupee. The oÒkar is to be subsequently performed twice a day, morning and evening, the recitation accompanied by a rite involving the touching of thumbs and fingers. The coconut is then cracked open, the amount of water inside indicating the capaci-ties of the novice s§dhu.The coconut water is mixed with raw sugar (gu·) and made into cakes. The guru feeds the áißya and the áißya feeds the guru, and the guru asks three times, “Which is sweeter, guruorgu·?”, to which the áißyareplies, “Guru”. A metal plate is then lifted over the áißya’s head and the guru announces to the three worlds that the candidate has become a cel§(áißya). Such kinds of announcement within the akh§Ü§are known as puk§r(‘call’), a public statement that carries far more weight within what is essentially an oral tradition than in religious culture that is more textually based. Pieces of coconut and gu·are then distributed to all s§dhu-s present, the Brahmans performing the havan, and the fire-places (dhånÊ) of theakh§Ü§.

The vaißÖava pañc-saÒsk§rconsists of: 1. tap-saÒsk§r; being adorned by heated brands with the emblems of N§r§yaÖa, the cakra(to the right arm) andáaØkha(to the left arm); 2. puÖ·ra-saÒsk§r; applying a tilakof white clay to the forehead, arm, chest and stomach; 3. m§l§orkanãhÊ-saÒsk§r; receiving a necklace oftulsÊbeads; 4. n§m-saÒsk§r: receiving the name D§s, together with the name of VißÖu for the current month; 5. mantra-saÒsk§r, receiving the kharaáar mantra from the guru, whispered thrice into his ear, while he is under a cloth. If, after a six-month trial, the disciple’s conduct has been satisfactory, then he is presentedwith: 1. a cloth to cover his head; 2. two loin-cloths; 3. a cloth (acal) to cover the loin-cloth; 4. kamaÖ·al.The“rÊ-VaißÖavasaÒny§sÊ-s, founded by R§m§nuja, are invariably Brahmans and former householders.

This is the mainsaÒny§sarite, which contains most of the features detailed in the texts that were examined in the first part of this chapter con-cerning ancient renunciation procedures. It is uniquely this rite that authenticates the saÒny§sÊ-’s condition of renunciation (as a ‘genuine’ s§dhu), whether as a daÖ·Êor a paramahaÒsa.While the major part of this rite is performed by a Brahman paÖ·it,some parts are performed by the §c§rya-guru (a Mah§maÖ·aleávara), who will represent either a daÖ·Êlineage (initiating daÖ·Ê-s)43 or an akh§Ü§44 (being elected by the n§g§-s of the akh§Ü§). For daÖ·Ê-s, the §c§rya-gurumay be the same person who performs both the preliminary brahmac§rÊrite and the final saÒny§sarite. The §c§rya-guru is also a representative of a reigning “aØkar§c§rya, who also usually presides over major initiation ceremonies at the Kumbh Mel§s. For some days, many hundreds of s§dhu-s will have had a restricted, phal§h§r,diet, which is essentially a diet of milk with some fruit, and will have been repeating the g§yatrÊ mantra. They line up near a river or saØgamat dawn, bringing their parc§, a piece of dried silver-birch bark, on which is written their saÒny§sÊdetails and that their dues have been paid to the akh§Ü§.Koãv§l-s police the assembly. The candidates have their head (except for the top-knot), moustache, beard, armpits and pubic region shaved (pañca bhadra), and are given a sacred-thread, a kulhaÜ(a small clay pot representing a kamaÖ·al), and a daÖ·a,45 an 43Sad§nanda Giri (1976:64–71) remarks that for daÖ·Êinitiations, the number of candidates should equal the number of words in the praißa-mantra, so that during initiation each candidate utters in turn one word of the mantra.44To give an example, paramahaÒsa Sv§mÊ Gop§l§nanda of the DakßiÖamårtÊMaãh of Banaras was initiated by a Mah§maÖ·aleávara from the Mah§nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§.However, he explained (conversation, on 8 February 2002) that initiations in their order are usually performed by a Mah§maÖ·aleávara from the NirañjanÊakh§Ü§.45DaÖ·a-s may be given to the candidates. Otherwise, two days before the ceremony, they go as a group to the jungle, cut their own daÖ·a-s and collect the firewood (samidh) that will be used in the viraj§-homa.A Brahman should have a daÖ·aofpal§áawood (flame of the forest, butea frondosa), whereas kßatriya-s and vaiáya-s should have bilva (Bengal quince, aegle marmelos) (Sad§nanda Giri 1976:65).clark_BIL25a.indd 935/30/2006 2:00:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"chapter three94ancient symbol of not only asceticism, but also royal power.46DaÖ·a-sare only used by brahmac§rin-s, so all candidates become nominal brahmac§rin-s before initiation. The§c§rya-guruinforms the candidates that this is their last opportunity to return to their homes and families, should they wish to do so. Each candidate briefly discards his cloth and walks naked a few steps to the north before being called back by the §c§rya-guru.(This symbolic walk was discussed previously in the context of the saÒny§sÊ-’s potential suicide.)At sunset the candidates return to the akh§Ü§, which has four funeral fires burning at each corner. Around the fires, the viraj§-havan(or homa)47will be conducted, for which the candidates are given some of the requisite materials (which include mustard and sesame seeds, the oblation of the viraj§-havan). While a Brahman paÖ·it performs thehavan, the§c§rya-gurugoes around whispering one of the four mah§v§kya-s (depending on lineage) into the candidates’ ears. Recita-tion of the Purußa-såktais also an important element of the ritual.4846DaÖ·aalso means punishment. For an an analysis of the symbolic value of daÖ·ain both political and religious domains, see Glucklich (1988).47Sarkar (1958:67–73) and Kane (HD“ Vol. 2:959-960) describe the lengthy viraj§-homaceremony, involving a total of forty oblations, of fuel-sticks (the samidh collected by the candidate), boiled rice and ghee. There is a discussion of the viraj§-homain the TaittirÊya-§raÖyaka(1.51-52; 2), wherein the best means to attain self-knowledge is saÒny§sa. (Kane’s account appears to derive from a mediaeval work, Dharmasindhu.) First, the sixteen verses of the Purußa-såkta (RV X.90) are chanted, oblations being performed at the end of each verse. As in many Brahmanical cos-mogonic schemes, a classification of 3 + 1 elements is apparent in the Purußa-såkta,whereby three parts of the whole are ‘visible’ and one is ‘invisible’. The visible part of Purußa includes the four varÖa-s produced from the dismembered ‘cosmic man’ (see Malamoud 1998:111). The recitation of the Purußa-såkta is followed by the reciting of the formulae, after oblations, of the viraj§-homa, such as: “May my fivepr§Öa-s be purified, may I be light, free from r§jasand from evil, sv§h§. This is forpr§Öaand the rest, it is not mine”. The formulae speak of the purification of all the parts of the body, the five elements and their corresponding guÖa-s,purußa, the fivekoáa-s (sheaths), the mind, speech and the §tman, and pay homage to the Veda-s.The sacrificer then bows to Agni, Praj§pati,$tma, Param§tma and Jñ§n§tma, after which the Purußa-såkta is again recited. Recitations follow, of various verses and mantras from the Upanißad-s and the first sentences of the four Veda-s. Oblations to Agni SvißãakÜt follow, and the candidate burns his wooden utensils in the household fire, donates his metal vessels to his guru, and deposits the fire in himself, reciting thrice “ayam te yoniÈ” and “ya te agne yajñiy§”, taking in the warmth of the fire.48Besides its occurrence in the Atharva Veda (19.6), thePurußa-såktais also recited for obtaining a son, for purificatory baths, for the purification of sins, and during ár§ddharites for the deceased (Gonda 1970:27–32). According to some sources, after death the soul assumes what is known as an §tiv§hikaáarÊra, which consists of clark_BIL25a.indd 945/30/2006 2:00:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"renunciation, rules for ascetics, and initiation95With the assistance of the paÖ·it, the candidates perform their own funeral rites (ár§ddha), holding the stem of the sacred dårv§grass. While chanting the prescribed Vedic mantras the candidates perform the eight kinds of ár§ddha(noted previously) and tarpaÖa, wherein water is released to the ground from cupped hands, as an offering to all the gods. They also offer piÖ·§to the gods and ancestors, in the form of (usually) forty-eight balls of wheat flour. There is now no responsibility for anyone after the saÒny§sÊdies.After a night of chanting and initiation, following the performance of the viraj§-havan, the saÒny§sÊ goes to the river with the §c§rya-guru,where he bathes, breaks his daÖ·a, discards his sacred thread, which is thrown into the river, and calls on the Sun and Moon, Wind and Fire, Earth and Sky, Heart and Mind, the morning and evening Twi-lights, and all the gods to witness his resolution to become a saÒny§sÊ.This is followed by the recitation, usually performed in waist-deep water, of the g§yatrÊ mantra, which is henceforth internalised. The praißamantrais also recited—modulated in three different pitches—after which the initiate faces the east, performs an oblation to the water and asks that all creatures be free of fear of him. He gives blessings to his sons and relatives, telling them that he belongs to no one and no one belongs to him. He takes vows of ahiÒs§, truthfulness, not stealing, continence, liberality, non-anger, waiting upon the guru, avoidance of carelessness, cleanliness and purity in food habits.49He then covers his body with ashes and returns to the akh§Ü§. He is instructed on doing good for society and receives a loin-cloth (kaupÊn§)only three (fire, wind and space) of the five elements. If the appropriate rites are performed, the áarÊraof three elements may pass over the space between death and the formation of a new gross body in the following incarnation. The recitation of thePurußa-såktaenables the reconstitution of a new body. For bathing and death-rites, the Purußa-såktawas used to renew the person concerned, underlined in the case of bathing by an obligatory change of clothes. Gonda (1970:27) remarks that “throughout the ages this text was, in religious practice not only an account of the creation but also an instrument of rising above one’s present state of existence. By identifying oneself with the mythical Purußa and by ritually repeating the myth-ical event and so reactivating its inherent power for the benefit of oneself and witha view to one’s own reintegration one believed oneself to achieve one’s own ‘rebirth’”. Gonda also notes (1970:32) that the content of the Purußa-såktabecame one of the foundations of vaißÖava philosophy, besides often being quoted by the áaiva tradi-tion.49See fn. 57 for summaries of rules for saÒny§sÊ-s by Oman (1903:155); Rose (1914, Vol. 3:360); Sad§nanda Giri (1976:25); PurÊ (2001). clark_BIL25a.indd 955/30/2006 2:00:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"chapter three96and water pot (kamaÖ·al). The §c§rya-guruthen cuts the top-knot (áikh§)on behalf of candidate’s guru, and abhißekais performed with a conch-shell over the initiate’s head. The candidate touches a daÖ·a, which is held by the §c§rya-guru, who pronounces a mantra meaning that thedaÖ·ais renounced. Henceforth, the saÒny§sÊaccepts the daÖ·aof knowledge. After this ritual the candidate is instructed in the oÒ,praißaandparamahaÒsamantras and the significance of the mah§v§kya-sby the §c§rya-guru, to whom presents are given.We have so far been detailing initiation rites of paramahaÒsa-s (and potentialn§g§-s), who are initiated by an akh§Ü§ (in this case the Jån§akh§Ü§), and who only hold a daÖ·afor a portion of the renunciatory rite, after which it is renounced. However, daÖ·Ê-s, who are Brahmans initiated by a representative of a daÖ·Ê maãha, keep the daÖ·a. It is referred to as Brahm-svaråp, and is made from bamboo and not the other kinds of wood, mentioned above, used in the saÒny§sarite.50 As previously mentioned, a sacred thread and an axe-head are attached to the daÖ·a, which is covered with a cloth. The sacred thread is carried, albeit concealed, as an indication of Brahman status. The receipt of the daÖ·afrom the guru is one of the central features of the traditional Brahmanical rites of initiation into the renunciatory state, as described in many mediaeval texts on renunciation. The Brahmanical rite of renunciation consists of two major parts, the first being renunciation proper, in which the candidate abandons family, possessions, fire and other symbols of his former life. The second part is modelled after Vedic initiation (upanayana),51 with some 50At no time should the daÖ·acome into contact with anything impure. Once initiated into saÒny§sathedaÖ·ashould never be further away from its holder than the distance a calf would wander from its mother, who will remain within hearing distance should the calf cry. A typical bamboo stick has knots at regular intervals anddaÖ·Ê-s are given one of five sizes of daÖ·a, depending on their height. The tallest saÒny§sÊ-s are given daÖ·a-s with fourteen knots (known as Anant), and successively shortersaÒny§sÊ-s with, respectively, twelve knots (Gop§l), ten knots (V§sudev), eight knots (N§r§yaÖ), and six knots (Sudaráan). (Interviews were conducted with numer-ousdaÖ·Ê-s, mostly of the MachlÊbandar Maãha, at the M§gh Mel§, in January and February, 2002.)51Upanayana is the traditional rite of passage for a Brahman or other twice-born male, into the twice-born (dvija) society of those who are entitled to perform sacrifices. Beforeupanayana, the boy is, technically, a áådra(Vasißãha Dharmasåtra II.6), until he attains twice-born status. The Brahman householder in particular is required to perform sacrifices: nitya (‘permanent’ rites, such as the agnihotraandsandhy§worship), naimittika (‘occasional’ rites, performed at child-birth, j§takarma, and death, antyeßãi)andk§mya(‘supererogatory’ rites, such as to obtain a male child or at the time of a clark_BIL25a.indd 965/30/2006 2:00:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"renunciation, rules for ascetics, and initiation97significant differences (Olivelle 1986:37),52 and has the form of an initiatory rite (dÊkß§) in which the guru plays a central role, ritually handing the new renouncer his staff: the candidate is initiated into a renunciatory tradition.53Current practice, which clearly reflects ancient tradition, is that during initiations at the Kumbh Mel§ all initiates are furnished with a staff (daÖ·a) and sacred thread, which confers temporary status on them as Brahmans,54 whether or not they actually were previously Brahmans by caste. The daÖ·aalso confers the status of brahmac§rin upon the candidate, symbolising his nominal allegiance to the monas-tic institutions. Gurus from daÖ·Êinstitutions present candidates with daÖ·a-s to keep permanently, in continuation of the Brahmanical advaita tradition whereby saÒny§sÊ-s carry a daÖ·ato indicate boththeir sectarian affiliation and their renunciatory condition. How-ever, at the completion of initiatory rites, non-daÖ·Ê saÒny§sÊ-s (i.e. paramahaÒsa-s) discard the staff and sacred thread—the markers of Brahman status—which they have carried and worn for the period immediately prior to initiation, as a sign that they have entered pilgrimage to a holy place). Upanayanais traditionally performed in the eighth year for a Brahman, the eleventh year for a kßatriya, and the twelfth year for a vaiáya,though texts vary on the timing. See Prasad (1997) for further details.52There are distinct parallels and homologies between the life of the boy brahmac§rin,beforeupanayana, and the saÒny§sin: the brahmac§rin studies away from the parental home, serving a guru. As a formal preparation for the life of a householder (gÜhastha), thebrahmac§rin—like a saÒny§sÊ—remains celibate, undergoes various austerities, begs for food and sleeps on the floor (Dharmasåtra-s of $pastamba 1.2.18–41, 1.31–45;Baudh§yana 1.3.7–47; Vasißãha 11.49–79). During the upanayanathebrahmacarinhas his head shaved, leaving the topknot (a ceremony variously known as muÖ·ana,cå·§karaÖaorcaula), and was traditionally presented with a girdle (mekhal§), sacred thread, deerskin and daÖ·a.The Brahman’s daÖ·ashould be of bilvaorpal§áa wood, and should be as long as to reach the end of his hair, the kßatriya-’s of vaãaorkhadira,to reach the forehead, and a vaiáya-’s of piluorudumbara, to reach the tip of his nose (Kaelber 1981; Prasad 1997:117).53See also Kaelber (1989:121): “Whereas the Sanny§sa Upanißads often state that the sanny§singives up his sacrificial cord, girdle, antelope skin, and upper gar-ment, the Vaikh§nasasm§rta Såtramakes it clear that the sanny§sin receives these things anew at his initiation in exactlythe way prescribed at the Upanayana.The instructions given for the reception of the initiate by his new teacher (!), including the recita-tion of the S§vitrÊ(S§vitrÊpraveáana), are virtually identical in each case. As part of the initiation the sanny§sinhas his hair, beard, and nails cut, receives a new name, swears obedience to his teacher, and takes a vow of truthfulness and ‘noninjury’ (ahiÒs§), just as the brahmac§rinhad done before him, and like the brahmac§rin, the ascetic now begins a long period of training”.54See also Crooke (1896, Vol. 2:471).clark_BIL25a.indd 975/30/2006 2:00:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"chapter three98thesaÒny§sÊlife and permanently renounced caste. The mandatory carrying of a staff for initiation purposes may perhaps indicate that in order to obviate potential complaints from genuine Brahman-caste initiates about the admission of non-Brahmans, all candidates temporarily become Brahmans (holding a staff), but then renounce ‘Brahman’ status during initiation.For those who wish,there is a third stage of initiation to become an§g§, which may take place at any age. This initiation was tradi-tionally performed several years after saÒny§sa—younger aspirants usually waiting longer for initiation than older men—but these days n§g§ initiation usually takes place a day or two after the vidy§-saÒsk§rinitiation. According to my informants n§g§initiations may, in some rare instances, occur directly, without prior saÒny§sa initiation. A saÒny§sÊ wishing to take n§g§initiation first approaches a árÊ-mahant(a leadingmahant) who will question him as to whether he really wants to become a n§g§.Some days before the bathing procession (sy§hi/julås) of the Kumbh Mel§, the koãv§l goes to the eight divisions of hisakh§Ü§and announces that each division may send those wish-ing to become n§g§-s.The names of candidates are then recorded by the k§rb§rÊ.N§g§ Initiations take place at night, at 3.00 a.m. or 4.00 a.m. at Kumbh Mel§s and $dh§(half) Kumbh Mel§s. At the appointed time the saÒny§sÊstands next to the kÊrti-stambha, a tall ‘triumphal’ column in the §árama, accompanied by fourárÊ-mahant-s and one §c§rya-guruwho will give him a mantra. A mahantwill then pull the penis thrice, breaking the membrane beneath the skin, an operation known as ãang to·e(literally, ‘broken leg’).55 The saÒny§sÊis hence fully initiated into the akh§Ü§as a n§g§, and attached to a n§g§ renunciate lineage.56Whether initiated as daÖ·Ê, paramahaÒsaorn§g§, the saÒny§sÊis 55From different interviews, Sad§nanda Giri (1976:29–30) maintains that the method of initiating new n§g§-s is different in each akh§Ü§.He also observes that formerlyãang to·ewas performed but that nowadays there is “only a slight pull of the penis”. It seems that formerly some initiates had the penis broken (ãang to·e)beforesaÒny§sa, but never performed the viraj§ homa to become n§g§ saÒny§sÊ-s, remaining ‘ãang to·e’ all their lives.56According to several n§g§informants I have interviewed, in the past the process may have involved the guru breaking the muscle of the erect penis with three sharp movements in different directions, rendering the initiate permanently impotent. However, these days the process involves the breaking of the membrane that attaches the foreskin to the penis.clark_BIL25a.indd 985/30/2006 2:00:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"renunciation, rules for ascetics, and initiation99henceforth a member of a distinct religious community, to a con-siderable extent bound by often unspoken but mutually recognised rules of behaviour appropriate to their status within their branch of the order,57 a position also often influenced by previous caste. How-ever, in the classical textual tradition may be found injunctions for the ‘ideal’ kinds ascetic. Although the images of the kind of lifestyle presented in these texts have been very influential on general under-standing of the renunciate, they seem to bear little correspondence to contemporary or historical reality.57Oman (1903:155) cites the ‘rules’, which he had gathered from a member of the order, as follows: (six prohibitions) 1. do not sleep on a couch, under any circumstances; 2. do not wear white clothes; 3. do not speak to or even think about women; 4. do not sleep during the daytime; 5. do not at any time ride on a horse or other animal, or in any vehicle whatsoever. 6. do not allow your mind to be agitated in any way; (six commandments) 1. leave your abode only for the sake of begging necessary food; 2. say your prayers every day; 3. bathe every day; 4. contemplate daily the likeness or image of “iva; 5. practice purity and cleanliness; 6. perform the formal worship of the gods.An account of the rules for saÒny§sÊ-s to obey is cited by Rose (1914:360), from P. Hari Kaul’s Census Report, §148. He should: 1. wear one cloth around his waist and one over his shoulder (he should beg like this); 2. only eat one meal in twenty-four hours; 3. live outside; 4. beg from seven, and not more than seven, houses (except in the case of the kuãÊcaka); 5.not stay in one place more than a few days (except the kuãÊcaka); 6. sleep on the ground; 7. not salute, or speak well or illof anyone; 8. bow only to saÒny§sÊ-s of higher status or longer standing; 9. only wear the salmon-coloured cloth.Sad§nanda Giri (1976:25) gives ‘six commandments’ to be obeyed by n§g§-saÒny§sÊ-s: 1. accept that all property belongs to the community; 2. abstain from all narcotics; 3. do not go to other akh§Ü§-s; 4. do not quarrel with your comrades; 5. obey your superior officer; 6. use whatever belongs to the community, but do not steal or keep anything for yourself.PurÊ (2001:149) provides rules and prohibitions (paraphrased below from the Hindi text) for mahant-s and th§n§pati-s of the Mah§nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§. They will lose their power and office should they: 1. misuse or destroy any of the moveable or unmoveable property of the akh§Ü§, or use such for the benefit of any other than theakh§Ü§; 2. incur debt for the akh§Ü§through overspending; 3. keep a wife or woman; 4. have any independent business or occupation; 5. make a disciple (i.e. independently), or introduce anyone as a member of this organisation; 6. become a follower of any other dharmaorsamprad§ya; 7. bring harm or loss to any main office or branch (of this institution).

He should not wear white clothes and should carry the single or triple staff. He should maintain the vows of not injuring living beings, speaking the truth, not stealing, celibacy, and renunciation. The secondary vows are not giving way to anger, obedience to the teacher, not being careless, purification, and purity of food habits. He should beg from “§lÊnas and Y§y§varas, and after returning and washing his hands and feet he should offer his food to the sun, reciting appropriate formulae.61 In the SaÒny§sa Upanißad-s the way of life of the wandering ascetic is discussed in many passages. In general the renunciate lives far from his native home, outside the village and its associations with ritual life. Apart from the four months of the rainy season, he wanders without fire or home, living in the wilderness, accepting indiscriminately whatever food is given. The ideal method of begging is to imitate the bee (madhukara), begging 58See Dutta (1987 [1906]): Y§jñavalkya-saÒhit§(Vol. 1:56–66); H§rÊta-saÒhit§ (Vol. 1, ch. 6:1–23); Uáan§-saÒhit§(Vol. 1:1.29–31). The “aØkha-saÒhit§(Vol. 3:7.1–32) also mentions three of the limbs of classical yoga; dh§raÖ§,praty§h§ra and dhy§na.The overall cosmology centres on VißÖu (or V§sudeva), the all pervading.59See Olivelle (1992). Most of the SaÒny§sa Upanißad-s date from between the first few centuries CE and around the twelfth century, some from the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries (Olivelle (1993:8–11).60Similar prescriptions are given by $pastamba (2.21.7–2.23.2) and Gau-tama (3.11–3.35). Vasißãha (9.1–10.29) adds that the ascetic should not display the emblems of the renouncer (staff, begging bowl, water strainer etc.). He should not beg through the means of astrology, interpreting omens or the signs of the body, or participate in debates. He may, however, live homeless and resolute in a village. He may also act as if mad. This is also recommended for the P§áupatas (see KauÖ·inya’s comm., tr. Haripada Chakraborty, on P§áupata Såtra1.8, 2.3,3.12–14). The renunciate may feign madness and attempt to attract censure, court-ing dishonour and insult, so that he may not be attached to the pride ensuing from praise (see also Ingalls 1962).61For a review of rules and vows for Brahmanical ascetics (based primarily on theDharmasåtra-s and Manu SmÜti ) see Shiraishi (1996:27–135). clark_BIL25a.indd 1005/30/2006 2:00:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"renunciation, rules for ascetics, and initiation101a little food from many houses. Another method is to undertake the ‘python vow’ (ajagaravrata), waiting for food to come. The high-est types of renouncers forego their begging bowls and eat directly from their hands (p§Öip§trin), or the ground (udarap§trin) as would an animal. Four kinds of ascetics (kuãÊcaka/kuãicara, bahådaka, haÒsa, paramahaÒsa)are explained in many texts, arranged—with minor modifications and inconsistencies—in a hierarchy of ‘detachment’.62 They are to be found in the Mah§bh§rata(XIII.129.29),63VißÖu SmÜti(4.11),64Skanda Pur§Öa,SaÒny§sa Upanißad-s65 and many of the mediaeval texts on renunciation.66 This four-fold classification is also referred to by 621.KuãÊcaka: lives in a hut (kuãÊ), wears saffron-coloured clothes, has a triple staff (tridaÖ·a) and wears the sacred thread.He should stay with his son and depend on him for his living.2.Bahådaka: should renounce his relatives, have a tridaÖ·a, wear the sacred thread, recite the g§yatrÊ mantra, wear saffron-coloured clothes, and beg for food at seven houses of sage-like Brahmans (or other well conducted men), avoiding flesh, salt and stale food.3.HaÒsa: should be versed in Ved§nta and have the pursuit of knowledge as his aim. He should stay in one place and live on charity. He may carry a single staff and a water-pot and wear the sacred thread. He should stay not more than one night in a village and not more than five nights in a town when begging for alms, otherwise he should subsist on cow-urine and cow-dung, or fast for a month.4.ParamahaÒsa: has attained knowledge and regards all as the Self. He either wears one piece of cloth or goes naked, and begs and eats with his hands only. He lives in an uninhabited house, a burial ground or under a tree. He may carry a single staff but abandons the top-knot, sacred thread and permanent rites.63Kuãicara, kÜtodaka, haÒsa, paramahaÒsa.64See Jolly (1991).65See$árama Upanißad (the earliest of the SaÒny§sa Upanißad-s, dated to around the third century CE) and Bhikßuka Upanißad. In the N§radaparivr§jaka Upanißad(vv. 174-175) several classificatory schemes are provided, including a six-fold scheme that includes the turÊy§tÊta and avadhåta, which, as Olivelle notes (1992:99), cannot be easily distinguished from one another. Both these kinds of renouncers are con-sidered to be liberated beings and not subject to any kind of rule or prohibition. The other four classes of ascetics are also distinguished by the goals to which they aspire: kuãÊcaka-s to the atmospheric world; bahådaka-s to the heavenly world; haÒsa-s to the Penance-world; and paramahaÒsa-s to the Truth-world. There is also a discussion (vv. 204–205) of the relative frequency of shaving, eating and bath-ing, and the application of renunciatory marks of ash and sandal paste, according to the relative grade of the six kinds of renunciates. Lower kinds, the kuãÊcaka and bahådaka, shave, bathe and eat more frequently than the higher kinds. The highest kind, the avadhåta, obtains his food “like a python”, does not shave nor does he apply any sign or mark.66See the twelfth-century Yatidharmasamuccaya(5.7); the P§r§áaram§dhavÊyaand JÊvanmuktiviveka attributed to Vidy§raÖya; and the seventeenth-century Yatidharmaprak§áaclark_BIL25a.indd 1015/30/2006 2:00:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"chapter three102modern commentators on the Daáan§mÊ tradition.67 The four kinds of renouncer are graded in respect of the degree of their renuncia-tion, the ParamahaÒsa-s being the highest,68 a distinctive feature of many classifications of ascetics being the importance attached to eating habits. The paramahaÒsa stage is sometimes referred to as the fifth§árama or as beyond the §árama-s.As a classificatory term for renunciates, it was frequently used by “aØkara, who did not use the other terms for ascetics just referred to. In his commentary on the BÜhad§raÖyaka Upanißad (III.5.1.49) he distinguishes the renunciation associated with the classical fourth §áramafrom the higher type of renunciation wherein all emblems of the renouncer are abandoned, a condition he associates with the paramahaÒsa (as explained, a term that has a specific sense in the Daáan§mÊ social context). “aØkara was also referred to as a paramahaÒsa by his hagiographers, as a sign of respect for the highest type of renouncer.Within the four-fold classification given above, it may be seen that the two lower classes of ascetics carry the triple staff, whereas the higher classes carry either a single staff or none at all. (This is accord-ing to the advaita tradition, whereby the ‘lower’ viáißã§dvaitaadherents carry the triple staff.) The paramahaÒsa discards the top-knot and the sacrificial string, the preeminent marks or signs of Brahman status. Even though, theoretically, renunciation should be of the former life, including caste, in some passages in the advaita-orientatedSaÒny§sa Upanißad-s it is explained that the top-knot and sacrificial thread were in fact retained despite renunciation, albeit symbolically.69(4.1–113) by V§sudev§árama. V§sudev§árama cites several sources on classes of renouncers, including Vidy§raÖya’sJÊanmuktiviveka, the Skanda Pur§Öaand the Yat-idharmasamuccaya. Kane (HD“ Vol. 2:939) notes that the four kinds of ascetics to be found in the Mah§bh§rata,Såta-saÒhit§(M§nayogakhaÖ·ach. 6), Bhikßuka Upanißad and Vaikh§nasa-dharmasåtra(8.9) are not consistently categorised, and that the cate-gorisation in the latter text is probably the oldest.67See, for example, PurÊ (2001:32–33).68TheParamahaÒsa Upanißaddescribes (vv. 1–4) the way of the paramahaÒsa yogin-s, the highest class of ascetics, as extremely rare. “If there is one such person, he alone abides in the eternally pure Being, and he alone is a man of the Veda-s”. He has renounced not only family, topknot and sacred string, but all rites and posses-sions: he goes entirely naked. “He is not attached anywhere either to the pleasant or the unpleasant”. The J§b§la Upanißad (v. 6) adds that they “keep their conduct concealed, and... although they are sane, behave like madmen”.69Thus, for example, in the N§radaparivr§jaka Upanißad(vv. 152–153), in response to the question as to how a man can be a Brahman when he has no sacrificial clark_BIL25a.indd 1025/30/2006 2:00:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"renunciation, rules for ascetics, and initiation103Commenting on the different and conflicting classifications of renouncers to be found in the SaÒny§sa Upanißad-s, Olivelle (1992:100) remarks that, “[they] point to the original variety of ascetic life-styles that...were conflated into the single institution of saÒny§saby Br§hmaÖic theology”. However, the Brahmanical concept of saÒny§sa—to enter a non-ritual state—is evidently but an ideal abstracted from a society with not only many kinds of ascetics, but also, as noted in the Introduction, many kinds of sects of ascetic renunciates that have existed at least since the time of the produc-tion of Brahmanical texts which detail the saÒny§sarite.The rites of renunciation, detailed above, clearly indicate the process whereby the lineages of the daÖ·Ê maãha-s and the akh§Ü§-s are integrated. The saÒny§sÊhas theoretically severed all ties to his previous social world, is nominally—but only nominally—beyond caste, and has become affiliated either to a daÖ·Êlineage, or to a Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§(through his five gurus), in either case affiliated to the monastic tradition represented by the §c§rya-s and the “aØkar§c§ryas.The substance of the saÒny§sÊ-’s new identity is embodied in both the legend of “aØkara and what he represents, and in the structure of the Daáan§mÊ order as presented in the Maãh§mn§ya-s, short texts that are analysed in the next chapter.string, it is explained that the sacrificial (or triple) string resides in the heart; that the renouncer’s string is worn as the supreme and imperishable Brahman; that knowledge is their top-knot; that the top-knot and sacrificial string consist of knowl-edge; and so forth.clark_BIL25a.indd 1035/30/2006 2:00:11 PM"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"chapter four104CHAPTER FOURTHE INTEGRATION OF VARIOUS LINEAGES: THEMA•H$MN$YA-SIn the previous chapters the structure of the Daáan§mÊ organisation was examined largely from an anthropological perspective, in terms of branches, divisions, initiations and hierarchies. It was also shown in the previous chapter how the two main wings of the order are integrated at times of the saÒny§sarite. In this chapter, we will be examining the Daáan§mÊs from a different persective of integra-tion; from that of the normative account of the tradition, in terms of its own history, which is predominantly constituted in terms of lineages. The central focus will be on the Maãh§mn§ya-s, texts that contain the details of Daáan§mÊ lineages and of the pÊãha-s supposed ly founded by “aØkara. The information in these texts provides an overview of the Daáan§mÊ order, integrating the diverse lineages and providing all Daáan§mÊs with a commonly understood identity and a concise framework for their traditional religious history. The disparities between the sect’s own traditional history, particularly regarding the pÊãha-s, and historical evidence in the form of texts and inscriptions, will also be assessed. A brief, preliminary discussion of “aØkara’s authentic works and his probable date will be undertaken in the following section, as both issues bear directly on the history of the Daáan§mÊs.4.1“aØkara’s authorship of texts, and his date“aØkara is supposed to have organised the Daáan§mÊs, and is sometimes attributed with the authorship of one or another of the Maãh§mn§ya-s, short Sanskrit texts that present an overview of the order, its ten lineages and its pÊãha-s. These texts will be analysed in the following section. The issue of the genuine works of “aØkara has attracted considerable scholarly inquiry. The longest list I have so far seen of works attributed to “aØkara is that contained in the Appendix of Piantelli (1974:i–xiii), which lists 433 works, 187 of which, it is indicated, are accepted as genuine by the tradition, including the clark_BIL25a.indd 1045/30/2006 2:00:11 PM"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"integration of various lineages: the maãh§mn§ya-s 105Maãh§mn§y§divic§ra/Saptamaãh§mn§y§divic§ra.1The Maãh§mn§yasetu is included in the list as a text not accepted as genuine by the tradi-tion, and the Mah§nuá§sanam is not mentioned.The sheer volume of texts produced in a short life (of thirty-two years, according to tradition), the poor or different style of writing in some texts, philosophical inconsistencies in others, references to doctrines or schools that may be dated post-“aØkara, and devotional hymns, are amongst the considerations leading most scholars who have looked into the issue to doubt “aØkara’s authorship of a large number of texts attributed to him.2 There remains considerable doubt, however, about some of the criteria, however good,3 used to establish the validity of works, the genies of interpolation and alteration hovering ever close to many conclusions. Nevertheless, evidence derived from “aØkara’s hagiographies, examined in the following chapter, makes it highly improbable that “aØkara wrote theMaãh§mn§ya-s.The issue is further complicated by the fact that numerous §c§rya-sof both the official (four or five) and other advaita maãha-s have been called“aØkara, as have other writers who have no connection to the advaitatradition at all. Rukmani (1998:264) points out that “aØkara is a very common name in Kerala, and that “aØkara (the author of theBrahma-såtra-bh§ßya) had contemporaries named “aØkara, one being the author of the play, $ácaryacå·§maÖi, another being the “aØkara (or “aØkaran§r§yaÖa) who wrote the “aØkaran§r§yaÖam. Another“aØkar§c§rya was the author of the T§r§hasyavivÜttik§(Hacker1995:43), and Rukmani notes yet another, “aØkarapåjyap§dayati, who was the author of the Bhaããikavyavy§khya. However, terms such aspåjyap§da and bhagavatp§daare often used as terms of respect for a guru; they are not exclusively reserved for the author of the Brahma-såtra-bh§ßya.To“aØkar§c§rya is also attributed the Prapañcas§ra, an early digest (10th–11th century?) of Tantric texts (Pal 1981:2).What may indisputably count as “aØkara’s genuine works4 are those 1I have not seen this text, or seen any other reference to it.2See, for example, Potter (1981:14–15).3See Pande (1994:99–129).4First published in 1947, Paul Hacker’s criteria (1995:41–56) towards establish-ing the genuine works of “aØkara have been influential on subsequent discussion. Mayeda (1992), who is influenced by Hacker in many respects, is another commen-tator frequently cited by others.

Sureávara also quotes the Upadeáas§hasrÊin his Naißkarmyasiddhi. Beyond these four works, many have given rise to discussions of authenticity.Belvalkar (1929:215–231) comments on a total of fifty-seven texts, noting the existence of around 400 works attributed to “aØkara.6Using several criteria, he concludes that eleven commentaries (includ-ing those on the BhagavadgÊt§,Brahmasåtra-s and nine Upanißad-s), eight stotra-s, and three prakaraÖagrantha-s can confidently be ascribed to “aØkara. A few other works may be those of “aØkara, while 358 other works must be considered as non-genuine.One of Hacker’s criteria (1995:41–56) for attempting to estab-lish authenticity is the name attributed to the author of the texts. Twenty-one texts examined are attributed to “aØkar§c§rya,“aØkara-Bhagavatp§da or “aØkara-Bhagavatpåjyap§da; fifteen are texts men-and influential study of the issue. His conclusions, and those of Hacker, Mayeda and others, are further analysed by Pande (1994:100–130), who is more open to the inclusion of a greater number of works.5For the authentic works of the disciples, see Potter (1981, Vol. 3:18–19); Mayeda (1992:5); Hacker (1995:58). Padmap§da’sPañcap§dik§ is probably his only genuine work, commented on by Prak§á§tman (mid tenth century) in the Pañcap§dik§vivaraÖa.Two works are attributed to Toãaka, the “rutis§rasamuddharaÖaand a short text, Toã§ßãaka (see S. Rajagopala Sastri 1968:63). Hirst (2005:11) mentions the striking similarities between the thought of Toãaka and his teacher, “aØkara. To Hast§malakais attributed the short work Hast§malakaálok§È (probably spurious). Also attributed to Sureávara (besides Naißkarmyasiddhi) is the M§nasoll§sa, a commentary on the DakßiÖ§mårti-stotra attributed to “aØkara. The authenticity of both these works has been questioned (Potter 1981, Vol. 3:550–551). Alston (1980a, Vol. 1:13) notes that the M§nasoll§sacontains no eulogy to “aØkara, which would render the work unique, should it be included alongside the genuine works of Sureávara. While the influence of Toãaka and Hast§malaka on Advaita Ved§nta has been negligible, Padmap§da founded one of the two main post-“aØkara schools of Advaita Ved§nta,theVivaraÖa(‘uncovering’) school. This was later overshadowed by the Bh§matÊschool. The main point of difference between the two schools is that according to theVivaraÖaview, the jÊvais a nescient reflection of Brahman, whereas according to theBh§matÊview the jÊvaisBrahman, as defined or limited by nescience (avidy§).6Included in Aufrecht’s Catalogus Catalogorum; the Triennial Reports and the Descriptive Catalogues of the Government Oriental Library, Madras, and the col-lected editions of the §c§rya-’s major, minor and miscellaneous works, published in Mysore,“rÊraØgam, PåÖe and elsewhere.clark_BIL25a.indd 1065/30/2006 2:00:12 PM"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"integration of various lineages: the maãh§mn§ya-s 107tioned more than once as the work of “aØkara; and eight are attributed to“aØkar§c§rya and “aØkarabhagavat.

Hacker also considers the terminology used in the various texts. Having surveyed other scholarly arguments concerning authorship, he concludes that, while there may be other genuine works of “aØkara, those mentioned above are provisionally entitled to be called genuine, while, above all, the bh§ßya-s on the prasth§natrayÊcan claim to be “aØkara’s genuine productions. While this restricted list is accepted by most scholars, Ingalls (1952:7) and Comans (1996:xv–xvi) have argued against “aØkara’s authorship of theVivekacå·§maÖi.7Using the Brahma-såtra-bh§ßya as a yardstick for genuine works, Mayeda (1992:6) believes “aØkara’s commentaries on the BhagavadgÊt§and the BÜhad§raÖyaka, Ch§ndogya, Aitareya, TaittirÊya,^á§, Kaãha, MuÖ·aka, PraánaandM§Ö·åkya Upanißad-s are most probably genuine, as are the commentaries on the Gau·ap§da-k§rik§, and the Adhy§tmapaãalaof the$pastamba-dharmasåtra.8 While the Upadeáas§hasrÊis certainly genu-7Alston (2000:108) also does not accept “aØkara’s authorship of either the Vivekacå·§manior$tmabodha.8“aØkara is also attributed with the authorship of a number of independent texts (prakaraÖa grantha-s); Sundaresan (2002) has argued that, besides the Upadeáas§hasrÊ,at least one of these texts, the PañcÊkaraÖa, is most probably genuine, as is a com-mentary on it, the PraÖav§rttikaby Sureávara. Belvalkar also believes the PañcÊkaraÖashould also be attributed to “aØkara, although he acknowledges that there is nothing in the text to warrant its ascription to him.

Currently, the most commonly accepted date for “aØkara is 788 to 820 CE, first (?) proposed by C. P. Tiele in 1877.13 However, the date of the fifth century BCE proposed by Narayana Sastry in his Age of “aØkara—first published in 1916—received widespread endorsement by the monastic tradition, represented by the pÊãha-s, most of which currently have guru-parampar§-s which go back to the earlier date. However, we will see that some guru-parampar§-s appear to have been altered in the twentieth century to accord with a later date.Some of the more useful evidence concerning “aØkara’s date may be summarised. Throughout the discussion it needs to be borne in mind that a disciple is not necessarily younger than a teacher, nor 9Mayeda’s detailed and subsequently influential analyses of texts, which owes much to Hacker’s previous work (see Hacker 1995), particularly concerning “aØkara’suse of specific terms—such as avidy§, m§y§, n§maråpaandÊávara—concluded that several of the important works attributed to “aØkara are genuine: BhagavadgÊt§-bh§ßya (1965a);Upadeßas§hasrÊ(1965b);Kena Upanißad-bh§ßya—there are two commentaries on theKena Upanißad, the Padabh§ßyaandV§kya-bh§ßya, both of which Mayeda believes to be genuine—(1967–1968a); and M§Ö·åkya UpanißadandGau·ap§dÊya-bh§ßya, which are related texts (1967–1968b). Hirst (2005:21) also maintains the authenticity of the Gau·ap§da-k§rik§and the Upadeáas§hasrÊ.Wilke (1995:328–330) provides an overview of the conclusions of Hacker, Mayeda and others on this topic.10On the basis of the signature ‘Bhagavadp§da’.11Leggett, who translates and comments on this work, also accepts it as genuine (1992:1–6). The text certainly existed in the fourteenth century. See also Halbfass (1983:Appendix), whose analysis renders “aØkara’s authorship improbable though not impossible.12The position of the current “aØkar§c§ryas on “aØkara’s genuine works is that a wider body of texts should be included, including the Tantric SaundaryalaharÊ(see Candraáekarendra SarasvatÊ 2001).13Outlines of the History of Ancient Religions (see Kunjunni Raja 1960:129).

A date for Bhavya of approximately 500 to 570 is generally accepted (Nakamura 1983:81–85; Kunjunni Raja 1991:107; Qvarnström 1999:176). Nakamura’s dates for“§ntarakßita (680 to 740) and KamalaáÊla (700 to 750) have been challenged (Thrasher 1979:138). Kunjunni Raja (1960:139; 1991:113) dates both “§ntarakßita and KamalaáÊla forty-five years later: “§ntarakßita wrote his Tattva-saÒgrahabefore he left for Tibet (around 763), and KamalaáÊla arrived in Tibet in 792, and died there shortly after 794. See also Ruegg (2000:12).15Also known as $gama-á§stra.16This concerns Gau·ap§da’s use of the term aj§ti-samat§—one of Gau·ap§da’s ‘fingerprint’ terms—which “aØkara understood differently to the sense intended by Gau·ap§da.17Hirst (2005:198, fn. 28) also comments that Gau·ap§da and “aØkara may have lived several generations apart.18See Aklujkar (1994:21): “aØkara criticises BhartÜhari’ssphoãadoctrine.

In his Upadeáas§hasrÊ(18.141–142),“aØkara quotes two verses22from DharmakÊrti’sPram§Öav§rttika(2.354).23 Sureávara,“aØkara’s main pupil, also cites one of these same verses from DharmakÊrti in his magnum opus, the BÜhad§raÖyaka-bh§ßya-v§rttika(4.3.476),24 and also names him (4.3.753).25 According to “aØkara’s hagiographical tradition, the philosophers Kum§rila and MaÖ·anamiára (“aØkara’s chief adversary) were “aØkara’s contemporaries. However, it seems probable that “aØkara slightly post-dates Kum§rila,26 who may bandhu, who was a teacher of Dign§ga. Vasubandhu lived in the first half of the fifth century (Kunjunni Raja 1960:133).19See Qvarnström (1999:178). Dign§ga, in his Pram§Öasamuccaya(V), quotes two verses from BhartÜhari’sVy§khy§dÊya(II.155, 158) (Lindtner 1994:200). “aØkara (BSB 2.2.28) quotes from Dign§ga ($lambanaparÊkß§, v. 6). This verse is also quoted by Kamalaáila in his Pañjika, as that of Dign§ga (Kunjunni Raja (1991:106).20See Lindtner (1992:56–59): Bhavya (c.500–570) and Dharmap§la (c.530–561)—who Bhavya knew—quote DharmakÊrti. See also Qvarnström (1999:178).21T§r§n§tha, in his History of Buddhism, states that DharmakÊrti was alive during the period of King SroØ-btsan-sgam-po (617–651). The Chinese pilgrim I-tsing (634–713) also mentions DharmakÊrti as Kum§rila’s contemporary (Pathak 1892a, Art. VIII:90; Belvalkar 1929:211). This evidence has been cited to date DharmakÊrti to 634–673 (Nakamura 1983:76–77). Kunjunni Raja (1960:135) dates him to the early seventh century. 22Dign§ga’s main work, the Pram§Öasamuccaya, was reworked by DharmakÊrti in hisPram§Öav§rttika.When, in the BSB, “aØkara is attacking Vijñ§nav§da Buddhists, the ideas attacked—if terminology is taken into consideration—appear almost certainly to be those of DharmakÊrti (Nakamura 1983:76). There has been an attempt made by Sankaranarayanan (1995b) to suggest that some of the quotations of Dign§ga and DharmakÊrti used by “aØkara—which have been cited above as evidence for “aØkara’s date—are in fact from an earlier period. This would permit an earlier date for “aØkara, of earlier than 500 CE. However, as Kunjunni Raja (1995) observes, the arguments are weak.23A third verse (18.143), often cited in philosophical works, also appears to be a quotation of DharmakÊrti (Nakamura 1983:76).24This particular verse, beginning abhinno ’pi hi buddhy§tma..., is particularly famous and is quoted in numerous philosophical works, including Kum§rila’s“loka-v§rttikaand M§dhava’sSarva-daráana-saÒgraha (2.206–207).25See Pathak (1892a, Art. VIII); Belvalkar (1929:211); Umesh (1981:100); Naka-mura (1983:76).26Kum§rila refers several times to Dign§ga (Umesh 1981:35). Kum§rila and DharmakÊrti were probably contemporaries (Lindtner 1992:56–57), as maintained by the Buddhist tradition. DharmakÊrti appears to criticise Kum§rila’s“loka-v§rttika,while Kum§rila, in his BÜhaããÊk§, seems to be objecting to statements in DharmakÊrti’s Pram§Öav§rttika(Kunjunni Raja 1991:109; Taber 1992:180). At the beginning of hisTaittirÊya-Upanißad-bh§ßya,“aØkara appears to be attacking the views expressed in Kum§rila’s“loka-v§rttika.This is corroborated by a remark by Sureávara in his V§rttikaon“aØkara’s commentary (Belvalkar 1929:209; Kunjunni Raja 1960:137; Halbfass 1983:iv). In the “loka-v§rttika Kum§rila frequently criticises the Jaina phi-clark_BIL25a.indd 1105/30/2006 2:00:16 PM"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"integration of various lineages: the maãh§mn§ya-s 111have written his BÜhaããÊk§between 630 and 640, in his old age,27but“aØkara may have been a contemporary of MaÖ·anamiára,28whose literary activity was probably in the second half of the seventh century (Thrasher 1979:137–139).29 In conclusion, while “aØkara’s floruit may have been around 700 CE30 —around a century before the widely accepted date of 788–820—he cannot have lived much later than the beginning of the ninth century.31losopher AkalaØka, who most probably lived after the seventh century (Pathak 1892b, Art. XVI:221–223). According to one tradition, AkalaØka was contemporary of the R§ßãrakåta emperor, S§hasatuØga Dantidurga, who is mentioned in a grant dated 753 CE (áaka675) (Belvalkar 1929:210). If the tradition were true, then the date of Kum§rila would have to be moved to the first half of the eighth century. However, AkalaØka’s dates are controversial.27Concerning an upper limit for Kum§rila: firstly, his “loka-v§rttikais quoted in the Tattva-saÒgrahaof“§ntarakßita (c.680–740) (Nakamura 1983:84–85). Sec-ondly, Maheávara, in his commentary on the Nirukta, quotes from the “loka-v§rttika. Maheávara was a contemporary of Harisv§min, who wrote a commentary on the “atapatha-br§hmaÖain 638 CE (Kunjunni Raja 1991:110). So Kum§rila’s date cannot be much later than middle of the seventh century. (See also Halbfass 1988:183.) It also seems that “aØkara (in his TaittirÊya-bh§ßya) was attacking the views of Kum§rila (Pathak 1892b, Art. XVI:217). 28In his Sphoãa-siddhi,MaÖ·anamiára quotes from DharmakÊrti’sPram§Öa-v§rttika.He also quotes fifteen times from Kum§rila’s“loka-v§rttika, and once from his Tantra-v§rttika.However, neither MaÖ·anamiára nor “aØkara refer to one another, even though both held remarkably similar philosophical positions (Thrasher 1979:118–120). MaÖ·ana almost certainly makes references to “aØkara’s BSB, and appears to have had the text before him when he wrote the Brahma-siddhi, one of his later works (Kuppuswami Sastri 1937:xlv–xlvii, lviii; Kunjunni Raja 1960:143; Thrasher 1979:122–129). Sureávara,“aØkara’s chief disciple, also knew MaÖ·anamiára’s work, criticising him and reproducing his material with only slight rewording. MaÖ·anamiára is not named by Sureávara, but his opponent is almost certainly MaÖ·anamiára, as Sureávara in his Naißk§rmya-siddhi paraphrases or quotes from MaÖ·anamiára’sBrahma-siddhi.It is possible that MaÖ·aÖamiára read “aØkara (who died aged 32 according to tradition), but that a response to their differences was made by Sureávara (Thrasher 1979:131–137). It is suggested (see Ch. 5.3) that the extreme rivalry between “aØkara and MaÖ·anamiára, as depicted in the hagiographies of “aØkara, may have been primarily due to their different religious persuasions rather than philosophical views.29Umbeka is not mentioned in the Tattva-saÒgraha of “§ntarakßita (680–740 or 725–785), but is mentioned by his disciple KamalaáÊla (700–750 or 745–795) in hisPañjik§. Umbeka, whose literary activity may have been between 760 and 790, comments on the MaÖ·anamiára’sBh§van§-viveka(Thrasher 1979:138–139).30This date was argued for by Nakamura (1983:57–89).31Jinasena quotes Vidy§nanda—another Jaina—in his $dipur§Öa, his final work, which was written around 838. Vidy§nanda, in his AßãaáatÊ, quotes from Sureávara’s BÜhad§raØyaka-bh§ßya-v§rttika (Pathak 1892b, Art. XVI:224–229; Belvalkar 1929:214).

Further, the great “vet§mbara Jaina scholar and doxog-rapher Haribhadrasåri (c.730–770 CE),32 although quoting BhartÜh-ari, Dign§ga and DharmakÊrti, also makes no reference to “aØkara (Umesh 1981:ii).33 Nakamura (1962:187ff.) comments that although, beginning around 600, advaita/ved§ntais recognised as a distinct doc-trine by Jaina philosophers,34 who attacked particular advaita-related theories, Ved§nta as a school of philosophy was not significant. He notes that Haribhadrasåri, in his ‘a·daráanasamuccaya, refers to the teachings of the ‘six schools’ (Buddhism, Ny§ya, S§Òkhya, Jainism, Vaiáeßika and MÊm§Òs§) and also Lok§yata in an appendix, but does not refer to Ved§nta at all.35 Nakamura (1992:192) maintains that from the tenth century onwards, however, Ved§nta began to become increasingly significant as a system, and that the philoso-phy recognised by Jaina philosophers was that of “aØkara.36 How-ever, although “aØkara later came to be considered as not only the pre-eminentadvaitin, but as perhaps the pre-eminent philosopher of India, it seems that for several centuries post-“aØkara, it was MaÖ·anamiára—who knew the philosophy of “aØkara, and who was 841 CE (saÒvat898), which is quite reliable (Nakamura 1983:65–66). Kunjunni Raja (1960:143–144) notes Hacker’s suggestion that the date should be taken as áaka 898 (equivalent to 976 CE), but disagrees with the later date. In the Bh§matÊ(1.3.17), a commentary on the BSB, V§caspatimiára criticises the views of Padmap§da, referring several times to his Pañcap§dik§ (Belvalkar 1929:214; Kunjunni Raja 1960:145).32See Chapple (1993:1–2) for Haribhadra’s date.33Vetter (1979:11), following Kunjunni Raja (1960), also remarks that “aØkara was not referred to by “§ntarakßita, KamalaáÊla or Haribhadrasåri. 34By, for example, Samantabhadra (c.600) and his commentator AkalaØka (c.700–770), Mallav§din (8th century), and “Êl§Øka (latter half of 9th century). See also Ghokale (1958; 1961–1962; 1972), who discusses and translates chapters III and VIII of Bhavya’s MadhyamakahÜdaya, which deal with Ved§nta as known to Bhavya in the sixth century.35Nakamura (1962:192) also notes that Siddharßi, in a work composed in 906, refers to a total of twelve systems, but not Ved§nta.36Nakamura (1992:192–193) cites the Yaáastilakaof the Digambara scholar Somadeva, composed in 959, which refers to Ved§nta and the doctrine of the Brahman-advaitin-s. Nakamura maintains that “This is conspicuously the Advaita theory of the “aØkara school”. However, “aØkara is not referred to explicitly. Unfortunately, I have not been able to see this text in order to ascertain what I suspect: that “aØkara may not have been known by Somadeva. clark_BIL25a.indd 1125/30/2006 2:00:17 PM"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"integration of various lineages: the maãh§mn§ya-s 113roughly his contemporary—who was considered the main exponent ofadvaita by later advaitin-s, and not “aØkara (Vetter 1979:11; Wilke 1995:336). V§caspatimiára (9th century), author of the influential Bh§matÊ, a commentary on “aØkara’sBrahma-såtra-bh§ßya, relies for his interpretation of “aØkara on the doctrines in the Brahmasiddhi of MaÖ·anamiára (Subramanya Sastri 1937:vi).37 MaÖ·anamiára was also accepted as an authority by other important later advaitin-s such as Prak§á§tman (10th century), $nandabodha (c.12th century), and Citsukha (c.13th century) (Isayeva 1993:66–67). Nor does any Ny§ya-Vaiáeßika philosopher of the ninth and tenth centuries refer to“aØkara,38 even though they make occasional references to MaÖ·anamiára.Qvarnström (1999:176) also remarks that it was not until the tenth century that Ved§nta gained general recognition in Jaina and Bud-dhist literature as a distinct philosophical system, and suggests that this is possibly on account of “aØkara being from the south and not the north where Jaina and Buddhist systems were flourishing. However, although Jainism and Buddhism were in decline in the south by the time of “aØkara, in some centres,39 particularly K§ñcÊpuram—whichhad previously been a stronghold of both religions—Jainism40 and Buddhism were still influential for several hundred years after the time of “aØkara.41 Yet there seems to have been little contemporary 37Subramahmanya Sastri (1935:vi) also asserts that R§m§nuja (1017–1137), in his quintessential work, “rÊ Bh§ßya, only quotes MaÖ·anamiára as the advaitaprototype. However, it is evident that R§m§nuja also refers to “aØkara and his arguments: asdravi·a bh§ßyak§ra(p. 119); as bh§ßyak§ra(p. 120, p. 144); and as the incarnation, “aØkara (p. 111).

For example, the Ny§ya-Vaiáeßikas“rÊdhara (fl.991) and Apar§kadeva (fl.1125) notice MaÖ·ana’sarguments but not “aØkara’s.39Such as KoØkanapura.40According to one tradition, it was the famous Jaina, AkalaØka—and not “aØkara—who defeated Buddhists in K§ñcÊpuram. A village in the suburbs of K§ñcÊ(puram) is still known by the name ‘Jaina K§ñcÊ’. Many Jaina centres (that appear to have been weaving centres) were subsequently converted into K§l§mukha áaivacentres. Jainism began to acquire more influence than Buddhism in K§ñcÊpuramaround the seventh century, and in other parts of Tamil Nadu during the latter part of the first millennium (Desai 1957:25–96; Champakalakshmi 1996:397–398).41Buddhaghoßa (fifth century) and other Buddhists propagated their doctrine from the vih§ra-s of K§ñcÊ. Dign§ga (c.480–540) was born in a suburb of K§ñcÊ(later going north to study logic under Vasubandhu in Nalanda). Dharmap§la (530–561) was also a native of K§ñcÊ.

If the earlier date proposed for “aØkara is accepted (flourishing around the beginning of the eighth century), then the only conclusion to be drawn is that “aØkara must have remained relatively unknown for several centuries after his demise, perhaps until his promotion by advaita maãha-s, which were first founded in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.4.2 Organisational structure of the Daáan§mÊs, according to the Maãh§mn§yastotra,“rÊ Maãh§mn§yasetuand other textsThe normative account of the Daáan§mÊs is embedded in a few short Sanskrit texts, known variously as (“rÊ)Maãh§mn§ya,Maãh§mn§yastotra,Maãh§mn§yasetu and MaãhetivÜtta, which detail the four §mn§ya-s, all supposedly but improbably written by “aØkar§c§rya. The Maãh§mn§ya-á§sanam (or Mah§nuá§sanam), frequently appended to the Maãh§mn§ya-s, is a text primarily explaining the dharma and entitlement of the four designated §c§rya-s to individual jurisdiction in their four respec-tive regions: the gaddÊis to be passed on only to the virtuous and learned saÒny§sÊ. One aspect of this text is as a legitimation of the four pÊãha-s, to the exclusion of other claims.$mn§yameans: a sacred tradition; that which is to be remembered or studied or learnt by heart; a Veda (or Veda-s in the aggregate); or received doctrine. The term also has a particular significance in the context of the dissemination of Tantric texts during the early medi-aeval period. Similar to the Tantric tradition, which has western, eastern, northern and southern §mn§ya-s,42 pertaining to the four Daáan§mÊpÊãha-s—supposedly founded by “aØkar§c§rya—are four §mn§ya-s, at the western, eastern, northern, and southern borders of India. The four §mn§ya-s of the maãha-s are said to be “revealed” (in all texts) in a sequence, such that the first is the western §mn§ya,as did DharmakÊrti who lived in the kingdom of Cå·§maÖi. Around 640, Hüang Tsang reports more than a hundred Buddhist monasteries in K§ñcÊ, with more than 10,000 SthavÊra monks (Watters, 1905, Vol. 2: 226). Buddhism was still a living religion in K§ñcÊpuram in the twelfth century, surviving there into the six-teenth century (Mahalingam 1969:125; Chaudhury 1969:234–235; Subramanyam 1975:23–24).42For a survey of the four main Tantric pÊãha-s, see Sircar (1973:11–24). For a resumé of the Tantric §mn§ya-s, see Goudriaan (1979: 41–46; 1981:17–20); San-derson (1988:149–158).

There is, however, an ongoing dispute concerning the location of the ‘genuine’ southern pÊãha: whether it should be located at “ÜØgerÊor at K§ñcÊpuram.The information in the Maãh§mn§ya-s, presented below, is known quite well by most initiates, and is repeated, with some minor dif-ferences, in virtually every commentary on the Daáan§mÊs that has been published in the previous 150 years.44 I will be suggesting that this account is probably fictitious in several respects. However, regardless of the authenticity of the Maãh§mn§ya-s, the importance of these texts may be gauged not only from the intrinsic value of constituting a formal identity for various lineages of ascetics as an organised sect with a founder, but also from the fact that they have on several occasions been used as formal evidence in Court cases concerning property, trusteeship and succession.4543There has been some discussion in orthodox Hindu circles concerning why the southernpÊãhais located inland, and not at a costal extremity, such as R§meávaram. See, for example, Ramesan (1968).44There are differences to be found in some of the earlier ethnographies. Crooke’s account (1896 Vol. 4:273) relies on the Panj§b Census Report (3) of Maclagan, who remarked (1891:112) that he had before him eight lists of the “ten names”, from different parts of the Province (Punjab). Only Giri, PurÊ, AraÖya and Bh§ratÊ were common to all lists. The names are associated with one or another of “aØkara’s four disciples, namely Tarnaka, Prithodar (or Prithivi), Saråpa and Padman. (These names of §c§rya-s are not exactly those of the disciples of “aØkara in the standard hagiographies.) Maclagan reports that according to some accounts the distribution of saÒny§sÊ-s per maãhais as follows: Jyotir (Giri, PurÊ, Bh§ratÊ);“ÜØgerÊ (Vana, AraÖya, TÊrtha); Narar§ginÊ (Parvata, $árama); Brahmac§rÊ (SarasvatÊ, DaÖ·Ê). Rose’s account (1914:353) presents four different lists, one of which (‘List A’) distributes the names as below, with the exception of the absence of the SarasvatÊp§da. Rose’s ‘List B’ distributes the p§da-s quite differently. Rose’s two other lists of ‘ten names’ both list eleven names. Included in those lists are the JattÊ, Sukar, Rukar, DaÖ·Ê and SurastÊ, names which do not appear in ‘modern standard lists’. It is just possible that Maclagan and Rose’s ethnographies reveal that the standard account of the ten names as found in the Maãh§mn§ya-s (see below) had not yet become universally standard; or they could have been badly informed.45See Mishra (2001:vii–xiv) for some of the legal judgments that have derived from the Maãh§mn§ya-s.clark_BIL25a.indd 1155/30/2006 2:00:19 PM"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"chapter four116During the first initiation into the Daáan§mÊs, the pañc-guru-saÒsk§r,the initiate is instructed on his lineage, lifestyle, gotra,pÊãha and so on, according to which of the ten names he receives.

As can be seen, the two points of disagreement between the Maãh§mn§ya-s concern the deities (at three of the pÊãha-s) and the appointment of “aØkara’s disciples. The Maãh§mn§ya-s only agree on the appointment of Toãaka to the Jyotir pÊãha.Gotradenotes an ancient Vedic clan or lineage, the gotra-s suppos-edly originating with the seven mythological Üßi-s.73 The gotra-s were most probably distinguished originally on the basis of different Vedic rites performed.74 There are scores of Brahmanical gotra-s, pertain-ing to the ten major divisions (and their sub-divisions) of Brahmans. There are also twenty-five other Brahmanical clans, including the Kashmiri, Nepali and M§lv§ Brahmans, and other groups, all with variousgotra-s. Four groups of gotra-s are traditionally assigned to one or another of the four Veda-s,75 this arrangement also being reflected in the correspondence (albeit inaccurate) in the Maãh§mn§ya-s of four gotra-s to fourVeda-s. Mediaeval §gamatexts of “aiva-Siddh§nta reveal that traditional initiation into “aivism also entails the acquisition of thegotra/gocaraof the initiating guru (Brunner 1964:458).As can be seen from the table giving the structure of the Daáan§mÊs, the four pÊãha-s are represented by four Brahmanical gotra-s (lineages); Avigata, Kaáyapa, BhÜgu and Bhårbhava. Kaáyapa appears in the first fully formulated lists of the seven Üßi-s, in the Dhar masåtra-s (Mitchener 1982:30),76 while the Kaáyapagotrais traditionally in the group of 73In Mah§y§na Buddhism, the term gotra—as with so many other terms origi-nally employed in a Vedic context—has, besides its sense as a spiritual lineage, a technical philosophical meaning, designating both a soteriological principle and an aspect of awakening. For further details, see Ruegg (1969). 74One of the original senses of gotra, as used in the Œg Veda, was of a ‘cowstall’ (Kane 1935:10). For Jainas, gotra had the sense of ‘family’, while in some Mah§y§na textsgotrameant ‘spiritual class’. By the early centuries BCE, gotrahad come to designate not only descendants of a common ancestor, but sometimes a family, an exogamous unit or social status generally. The so-called pravararecitation by Brahmans, which accompanies daily sandhy§ worship, is a recitation of a list of usu-ally three ancestors, who were among the seven primordial Üßi-s, and whose names constitutegotra-s. A gotrais the lineage of the family, thus confirming from which families a potential wife would be acceptable, as marriage cannot be made with a partner from within the same gotra.A man is in one of eighteen gotra-s, and must marry into one of the other seventeen, a system which has survived to the present day (Brough 1953:2–10; Kane HD“ Vol. 2:479–497).75See Sherring (Vol.1, 1872:6–113) for a detailed account of the gotra-s, and (p. 8) their affiliation to the Veda.See also Kamath (1986:83) on particular gotra-s.76Agastya is to be found occasionally in the Dharmasåtra-s as an eighth Üßi.clark_BIL25a.indd 1205/30/2006 2:00:25 PM"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"integration of various lineages: the maãh§mn§ya-s 121gotra-s that follow the S§ma Veda (Sherring 1872:8). This is inconsistent with the scheme of the Maãh§mn§ya-s, whereby the Kaáyapagotrais assigned to the Govardhan pÊãha, which follows the Œg Veda. BhÜgu appears as an eighth Üßi in a second list of Üßi-s, which came to take textual preference over the first list, notably in most of the lists to be found in the Pur§Öa-s (Mitchener 1982:30). In the Brahmanical tradition the BhÜgugotrais amongst the gotra-s that follow the ŒgVeda.Again, this is inconsistent with the Maãh§mn§ya-s, wherein the BhÜgugotrais affiliated to the Jyotir pÊãha, which follows the Atharva Veda.The other two gotra-s, Bhårbhava and Avigata, do not appear in known list of gotra-s,77 but no one has so far been able to provide a satisfactory explanation for them. Gotraand the other elements of theMaãh§mn§ya-s, which initiates are supposed to learn, are essentially esoteric verbal markers of the initiate’s identity and lineage within the Daáan§mÊs, used for mutual identity and detecting imposters: a kind of saÒny§sÊ pravara.The origin of the four samprad§yanames,$nandavara, Bhåriv§ra, Bhogavara and KÊãavara, that are given in the texts cited, similarly defies adequate explanation. Most commentators follow Ghurye (1964:86) in explaining, somewhat vaguely, the samprad§ya in terms of life-style.78 However, in Daáan§mÊ practice, the samprad§yanames, as wth the gotra-s, simply confirm to which of the four groups of lineages the initiate belongs, and do not signify a different life-style. Thesamprad§yanames are used by Daáan§mÊs as an identificatory title, such as, for example, MahantL§l PurÊ, Bhåriv§ra.79 (It can be seen, according to the Maãh§mn§ya-s, that Bhåriv§ra indicates 77See Ghurye (1964:85–87); Dazey (1990:288). This author has also failed to find any references to these gotra-s in published works.78Thus, according to Ghurye, the $nandav§ra is happy (§nanda) with whatever food he gets without begging, or because his happiness is not derived from worldly pleasures. The Bhåriv§ra (bhårÊ meaning ‘very much’) is explained as renouncing wealth and living on vegetation in the jungles. The Bhogavara (bhoga meaning ‘enjoyment’ or ‘pleasure’) are supposedly indifferent to worldly pleasures. Lastly, the KÊãavara (kÊãameaning ‘insect’ or ‘worm’) is supposed either to eat as little as an insect, or to have developed a high level of compassion, not even troubling insects. See also Rose (1914:357): 1. Bhog-b§r, who are indifferent to all earthly things, save those necessary to sustain life; 2. Khet-b§r, who attempt to eat only a small quantity of food; 3. $nand-b§r, who are averse to begging and live on spontaneous alms; 4. Bhår-b§r, who live on forest products and pounded grasses and ashes. 5.

However, the distribution in the Maãh§mn§ya-s of the fourVeda-s to the four cardinal directions is not corroborated in other Brahmanical sources.80The four Brahmac§rÊ names given, $nanda, Caitanya, Prak§áaand Svaråpa, are the names given to brahmac§rÊ-s who have passed their first stage of initiation to become daÖ·Ê-s. They will subse-quently undergo the viraj§-homato become daÖ·Ê-saÒny§sÊ-s. The four Brahmac§rÊ names theoretically correspond to their affiliation to a particularpÊãha.As previously noted, this is determined by the affilia-tion of the particular maãhavia which the candidate is initiated, to either the western, eastern northern or southern pÊãha.4.4The pÊãha-s and guru-parampar§-sIn this and the following sections, the claims by various maãha-s to have been founded by “aØkara will be surveyed, and it will become apparent that there is no substantive evidence to connect “aØkara with the early history of any of the maãha-s supposedly founded by him. Even in the nineeenth century the claims of the ‘official’ four maãha-s to be the only legitimate ones were far from univer-sally established. Over the previous few hundred years, several other advaita maãha-s have also claimed legitimacy, many of the disputes being settled by royal decree or by a court case. The ‘legitimacy’ issue stems primarily from the claims of various “aØkar§c§ryas to be the sole representative in their area for the title of jagadguru,entitled to travel in palanquin (a··§-p§lakÊ)81 and be accorded due 80However, Mishra (2001:2) cites the Bh§gavata Pur§Öa(3.12.37), stating that the Œg, S§ma, Atharva andYajur Veda-s are “expressed” from, respectively, the eastern, western, northern and southern mouths of Brahm§. However, this verse from the text of the Bh§gavata Pur§Öa states that: “Beginning from the front face of Brahm§,gradually the four Vedas—Œg, Yajur, S§ma and Atharva—became manifest” (trans.

Evidence from the Maãh§mn§ya-s have been central to several court cases, as have passages in the hagiographies of “aØkara, particularly those referring to his last days and final sam§dhi.82 Claims and counter-claims by rival maãha-s also frequently involve the assertion by one of the parties that parts of a particular text not agreeing with their claim have been tampered with.It can be seen from the variant schemes of the Maãh§mn§ya-s (as shown above) that there is inconsistency concerning the appointments to the four pÊãha-s, depending on which text is referred to.83The iden-tity of Sureávara, who is claimed by the “ÜØgerÊ, Dv§rak§ and K§ñcÊmaãha-s (see below), is also disputed.84 Most of the maãha-s that will be 82Amongst the hagiographies, the K§ñcÊmaãharelies most on the evidence of the A“V (see Ch. 5.1), where “aØkara is said to have passed away at K§ñcÊ.

In their support, the K§ñcÊmaãhaalso cite evidence for this from the “ivarahasyaand the M§rkaÖ·eya-saÒhit§, the authority of which is disputed by “ÜØgerÊ.83Rose (1914:353) records two (variant) versions of the appointments to the maãha-s.Chakraborti (1973:181) also remarks on the disagreement amongst scholars over the appointments to the maãha-s, one issue being whether it was Hast§malaka or Padmap§da who was the first appointed pontiff of the PurÊmaãha. The “ÜØgerÊtradition, according with the Maãh§mn§ya-stotra, maintains that the first pontiff of Dv§rak§ was Padmap§da. 84Sureávara is identified by the monastic tradition as MaÖ·anamiára (see Pande 1994:281–283). Relatively large parts of all the hagiographies of “aØkara are dedicated to the debate between “aØkara and either MaÖ·anamiára—the famous MÊm§Òsaka and author of the Brahmasiddhi, who is portrayed as a disciple of another great MÊm§Òsaka, Kum§rila—or Viávaråpa. In the “aØkara-dig-vijaya (10.103–107) (see Ch. 5.1), after his conversion by “aØkara, MaÖ·anamiára (a gÜhastha) acquired the name Sureávara (as a saÒny§sin). The “DV also refers to MaÖ·anamiára as Viávaråpa. The identification of MaÖ·anamiára and Sureávara is also made by Anant§nandagiri, in the“aØkaravijaya(sec. 55), and by Cidvil§sa in the “aØkaravijaya (18.44–45). However, in other hagiographies of “aØkara (Vy§s§c§la’s“aØkaravijaya(6.5.36); Govindan§tha’s“aØkar§c§ryacarita (6.1); LakßmaÖa“§strÊ’sGuruvaÒáa-k§vya (2.143), “aØkara’s opponent is identified as a disciple of Kum§rila called Viávarupa; and MaÖ·anamiára is a different person. Many scholars have argued, on philosophical grounds, against the possibility of MaÖ·anamiára being Sureávara: see Dasgupta (Vol. 2, 1975:82–87); Hiriyanna (1923; 1924); Bhattacharyya (1931:301–308); Kuppuswami Sastri (1981:27–50); Alston (1980a, Vol.1:50–51). Sastri (1961:281–291) believes that the two could be the same: MaÖ·ana could have changed his views. However, in perhaps the most extensive and detailed treatment of the topic, Kuppuswami Sastri (1937:xxiv–lvii) not only illustrates the philosophical differences between the two authors, but points to a long line of Ved§ntins—including V§caspatimiára, Vimukt§tman, Prak§á§tman,$nandabodha, Prakaã§rthak§ra, Citsukha, Amal§nanda,$nandagiri, clark_BIL25a.indd 1235/30/2006 2:00:28 PM"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"chapter four124referred to in this section claim to have been founded by “aØkara, and have parampar§-s of §c§rya-s going back to between the eight century CE and the sixth century BCE. However, 44 BCE is taken as the date of the birth of “aØkara by several authorities, including, until recently, the “ÜØgerÊmaãha. The later date of “aØkara (788 to 720 CE) accepted by many contemporary scholars was challenged by Narayana Sastry (1971 [1916]), who proposed an earlier date of 509 BCE for the birth of “aØkara. This proposal for an earlier date was accepted by many Indian scholars, some of whom85 still maintain it, despite many objections raised by various scholars. I suspect that the views of Narayana Sastry (and hence later schol-ars) may have been substantially impelled by the considerable space devoted to the date of “aØkara in The Theosophist during the 1890s. Articles on the date of “aØkar§c§rya appeared in Volumes I, IV, XI, XIV and XVI of The Theosophist,86 volumes XIV and XVI containing theguru-parampar§-s of the “ÜØgerÊ and Dv§rak§maãha-s respectively, the“ÜØgerÊ list recording the birth of “aØkara in 43 BCE, the Dv§rak§list giving the birth-date of “aØkara in 2631 yudhißãhiraáaka(509 BCE). Scholarly opinions on the date of “aØkara seem to have influenced the construction of guru-parampar§-s, and some of them, such as that of“ÜØgerÊ, appear to have been altered during the previous century to accord with the later date (788–820 CE) for “aØkara (Antarkar 2001:45), as previously the “ÜØgerÊmaãhahad had a guru-parampar§that accorded 800 years for the life of Sureávara.Vidy§raÖya, MadhusådanasarasvatÊ, and Brahm§nandasarasvatÊ—and philosophers of other schools, whose works illustrate their understanding that MaÖ·anamiára and Sureávara were different people, with different views on particular philosophical points. Indeed, Sureávara, in his V§rttika and Naißk§rmyasiddhi, sneers at some of the views of MaÖ·ana (p. xxx). The main division in advaita, between the Bh§matÊand VivaraÖa schools (concerning whether the locus of nescience resides in jÊvaorbrahman)goes back to MaÖ·anamiára and Sureávara. However, in some works (see p. xxv), for example Vidy§raÖya’sVivaraÖa-prameya-saÒgraha(p. 92), a passage from Sureávara’s V§rttika(4.8) is attributed to Viávaråp§c§rya (Dasgupta, p. 83), lending some cre-dence to their identification in the Maãh§mn§ya-s. Also, in none of MaÖ·anamiára’s works, or in the philosophical works of other authors, is MaÖ·anamiára mentioned as a disciple of either Kum§rila or SaØkara.85See, for example, Aiyer and Sastri (1962) and Kuppuswami (2001), who argue for a birth-date of 509 BCE.86The dates argued for the time of “aØkara were: 8th cent.

Probably the earliest widely disseminated list of the “ÜØgerÊ§c§rya-s was that published by Gopalacharlu in The Theosophist in 1893, which was based on a text published twenty years previously by KÜßÖar§ja Wodeyar of Mysore. Thisguru-parampar§gives the date of “aØkara’s birth as 43 BCE, his accession to the “ÜØgerÊgaddÊas 34 BCE, and his death as 11 BCE.

A similar but not identical list was subsequently published as an appendix to the Tamil translation of the “DV, under the order of NarasiÒhabh§ratÊ VIII, after his demise in 1879.88 Up to 1989 there were 34 or 35 §c§rya-s in the six lists that Antarkar (2001) inspected.89 However, it seems that “aØkara could not have lived earlier than the seventh century CE,90 rendering spurious all of the guru-parampar§-s that go back to BCE.9187I am doubtful about this early date, as it is based on the report of Venkata-raman (1959:ix), some of whose proposed dates for the §c§rya-s of “ÜØgerÊ lack sufficient historical support.88It was also published in Telugå, by Vavilla R§masv§mÊ in 1885 CE.89Many of the pontiffs of the “ÜØgerÊmaãhahave been from the MålakaÖadu branch of Telugå-speaking Brahmans of Tamil Nadu (Gnanambal 1973:5).90As discussed in Section 1 of this chapter.91Sastry and Kumaraswami (1971:201–206), supporters of the K§ñcÊmaãha,comment that lists of “ÜØgerÊ§c§rya-s are not consistent. A list of thirty §c§rya-s was published in 1854 by His Highness “rÊ KÜßÖar§ja Wodeyar, in which PÜthvÊdh§ra is“aØkara’s immediate successor at “ÜØgerÊ. In some later manuscripts Viávaråpa is introduced in place of PÜthvÊdh§ra, but none of them mention the name of Sureávara, as found in the list prepared by NarasiÒhabh§ratÊ VIII. In the list of “ÜØgerÊ§c§rya-s published by Aiyer and Sastri (1962:164), “aØkara is recorded as ascending the gaddÊin 18 BCE, and passing away in 12 BCE. Sureávara follows him, ascending the gaddÊin 12 BCE, and passing away in 773 CE; a ‘miraculous’ reign of 785 years.

According to this guru-parampar§, Sureávara is followed by Citsukh§c§rya (from 423 BCE). However, Citsukha may be dated to the latter half of the twelfth century, as he comments on theNy§ya-makarandaof$nandabodha Bhaãã§rak§c§rya, who appears to have lived in the latter half of the eleventh and first half of the twelfth century (see Dasgupta 1975, Vol. 2:49; Satchidanandendra Sarasvati 1989:908–943). However, it was long ago suggested (Govinda-D§sa 1894:166) that the Citsukh§c§rya of the Dv§rak§guru-parampar§is different from the more recent Citsuka.93I have not seen this work.94The Dv§rak§guru-parampar§is also published in Govinda-D§sa (Theosophist,Vol. XVI, 1894:164–168); B§ldev Up§dhy§y (1967); Yatisandhy§samuccaya (pub. by Dv§rak§-pÊãha, 1967).95For the Sanskrit text and translation, see Mishra (Math§mn§ya Setu 2001:62–65).clark_BIL25a.indd 1265/30/2006 2:00:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"integration of various lineages: the maãh§mn§ya-s 127on several occasions96 in support of the claims to antiquity of both the Dv§rak§pÊãhaand“aØkara (who is supposed to have been a con-temporary of Sudhanv§), and to authenticate the claim that “aØkara founded four maãha-s in the four quarters of India.97 Sudhanv§ (as a king of Kerala) also appears (four times) in the “aØkara-dig-vijaya (“DV)98 and the Maãh§mn§ya-s.99 Umesh (1981:176–177) is, in my view, rightly suspicious of the authenticity of this inscription: the copper-plate was not available from the Dv§rak§ pÊãha for his inspec-tion, despite his numerous requests; the Sanskrit is not ancient, as would have been used in the fifth century BCE; and the signature of Sudhanv§ as sarvabhauma(‘Lord of the entire earth’)100 is odd, 96Vimaráap. 2 (see Umesh 1981:169); Mishra (Math§mn§ya Setu 2001:xvii).97Installing: (l.1) Padmap§da (alias Sanandana) at Bhogvardhana (Jagann§th); (l.17) Toãaka (alias PratardaÖa) at Jyotir (BadarÊ); (l.23–27) Viávaråpa (alias Sureávara) at “§rad§ (Dv§rak§); and (l.18–19) PÜthvÊdh§ra (alias Hast§malaka) at “ÜØg-ÜßÊ (“ÜØgerÊ).Sureávara is deputed by “aØkara to be the arbiter of important decisions (l.32–33). “aØkara is also said to have installed “rÊ KÜßÖa in the renovated temple of Trailokya Sundar in Dv§rak§, which is particularly renowned for heresies (l.23–26).98See M§hava-Vidy§raÖya (1986). The first appearance (1.60–98) is when Sudhanv§ (an incarnation of Indra) is saved from the perils of Buddhism by the miracles of Kum§rila-Bhaããa (an incarnation of Skanda): he accepts the Vedaand expels the Sugata Buddhists. This incident seems to be partly based on an account found in the Keralopathi (the earliest traditional account of Kerala), according to which two of the twenty-five Perumals who administered Kerala (Palli Bana Perumal and Cheraman Perumal) embraced Buddhism, Palli Bana Perumal (c.305–317 CE) ordering the Brahmans throughout Malan§·u to also embrace Buddhism. The Brahmans, with the help of a saint named JaØgaman and six á§strÊ-s defeated the Buddhists in debate, resulting in their expulsion by the king, who then abdicated in great remorse. Cheraman may have been born, and died, a áaiva, though supporting Palli Bana Perumal’s conversion to Buddhism (Chaudhury 1969:233). In the second incident (5.10–30), Sudhanv§’s attempts to entice “aØkara to his palace are rebuffed. He is finally granted the boon of a son after reciting three self-penned dramas. Sudhanv§ appears (14.166–175) when “aØkara visits Kerala; and when “aØkara commences his digvijaya, he is accompanied by many disciples and Sudhanv§, who here makes his fourth appearance (15.1–29). During his encounter with Krakaca and his ferocious K§p§lika entourage, the king fought with bow and arrow on behalf of “aØkara, who reduced them to ashes with a mystic syllable.99Discussing the various characteristics (lakßaÖa) needed by a wandering mendi-cant (parivr§jaka) to assume authority at either of the four separate pÊãha-s (Dv§rak§,Jyotira,“ÜØgerÊ and Govardhana), the Mah§nuá§sanam, v. 53 (Mishra, vv. 53 and 55 [=“arma 1963:649, Maãh§mn§yasetu, vv. 32 and 33; see Appendix 2]) states that he should have the capacity for exertion of Sudhanv§ for dharma, serving gods and kings. The tradition ofdharma (v. 55) should be protected eternally by Sudhanv§and other rulers. 100See also Miára ($miã K§lrekh§2001:21–23) for a discussion of the term sar-vabhauma.clark_BIL25a.indd 1275/30/2006 2:00:32 PM"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"chapter four128as it is to “aØkara that the plate is addressed as a eulogy. Sanskrit first came to be used in inscriptions only in the first century BCE (Salomon 1998:86), the earliest extant examples of copper plate inscriptions—used primarily to record land grants—dating to around the middle of the fourth century CE (the earliest examples being in Prakrit, issued by the Pallava and “§laØk§yana dynasties in south India), though they appear to have been manufactured from the first or second century CE (Salomon 1998:114). Further, the form of copper plate inscriptions is fairly standardised, and in no respect similar to the copper plate inscription of Sudhanv§. The historical existence of Sudhanv§ as a king of Kerala seems doubtful as I have been unable to find any reference to him in other sources,101 and the copper-plate inscription seems to be entirely spurious, manufac-tured to add credence to the legitimacy of Dv§rak§ and the other threepÊãha-s.1024.4.1 K§ñcÊpuramThere is an ongoing dispute concerning whether “aØkara founded either four maãha-s, as per the Maãh§mn§ya-s, or five maãha-s, including K§ñcÊpuram (known as the K§makoãÊpÊãha). This maãha is neverthe-less fully recognised in most orthodox circles.103 Both “ÜØgerÊ and 101Intriguingly, R§ja Sudhanv§ also features in the semi-mythological history of Nepal (see Wright 1877:83, who edited a translation of the Buddhist recension of the VaÒá§valÊ, ‘The Genealogical History of Nepal’): the Tret§ Yuga is said to have ended in Sudhanv§’s reign; he built a new palace in a town called S§nk§sya-nagarÊ that he founded; and was put to death, for reasons unknown, at Janakpurby R§ja Janaka, the father of SÊt§.102Sureávara’s reputation amongst “aØkara’s hagiographers is such that his appropriation to a particular place seems to be a probable (though admittedly unreliable) indicator of the source of a hagiographic or eulogistic text. The Dv§rak§guru-parampar§begins in 509 BCE, and the copper-plate also records dates in the fifth century BCE. I would even hazard a guess that the inscription may have been fabricated around the time of the previously mentioned disputes over the legitimacy of pÊãha-s in Gujarat during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Curiously, the inscription does not mention Kerala, where, according to the “DV, Sudhanv§ was a king.103Published in Kaly§Ö (TÊrth§Øk)(1997:547–548), a conservative publication, is a list of twenty jagadguruáaØkar§c§rya pÊãha-s and upapÊãha-s, which states that the five main pÊãha-s “established by “aØkara” are: JyotirpÊãha, Govardhan pÊãha,“§rad§pÊãha,“ÜØgerÊpÊãha, K§makoãipÊãha.

Secondly, the name in the inscription is “aØkar§ya and not “aØkar§c§rya.A Tamil inscription in the “iva temple at Ambik§puram, dated 1516 CE (áaka1436), is signed by CandraáekharasarasvatÊ of the K§ñcÊmaãha, and refers to a village granted to the maãha, confirm-ing the aforementioned grant of 1291/2 CE by VijayagaÖ·agop§la (Mahalingam 1940:324; Antarkar 2001:112-115). The next record providing information about the pontiffs of K§ñcÊ is a grant of a village named KÜßÖar§yapuram, made in 1521 CE (áaka1444) by KÜßÖadevar§ya of Vijayanagara, to Candracå·asarasvatÊ, disciple of Mah§devasarasvatÊ.110 In 1527 CE (áaka1450) KÜßÖadevar§ya made a further grant, of the village named Udayamb§kam, to Sad§ái-a commentary on the GRM, the Sußam§, and the P“M (part 1)—part 2 was written at a later date—were both written by $tmabodha.

The main substance of the “ÜØgerÊclaim is that the K§ñcÊmaãhais a branch maãha—of which there are several—of the “ÜØgerÊmaãha.One of the issues that has complicated the argument is the shifting of the K§ñcÊmaãhato Kumbhakonam, which took place certainly prior to 1763 (Antarkar 2001:139), most probably in 1743 (Srini-vasan 1979:246).116 From epigraphic evidence, it appears that the K§makoãÊpÊãhawas located in the VißÖuk§ñcÊ part of K§ñcÊpuram at least until 1686.117 Owing to Muslim raids, the maãhawas then temporarily shifted to Tanjore, at the invitation of the r§ja, Pratapa SiÒha, who built a new maãhaand had a golden image of K§m§kßÊdevÊinstalled. The maãhawas then shifted to Kumbhakonam (Gnanambal 1973:10),118 which may have been the site of a “aØkaramaãhasince the thirteenth century (Champalakshmi 1996:344).119 Endowments 115In 1886, a forum of scholars and pandits met at a vyavasth§(‘organisation/ruling’) held at Banaras and decided that only four maãha-s were legitimate. Their decision was based primarily on the “DV and Maãh§mn§ya-s (Antarkar 2001:135–137). Ironically, it coincided with a tour of the north by Mah§devasarasvatÊ, the 63rd §c§ryaKumbhakonammaãha.However, the purpose of the vyavasth§was to discredit the claim of one Sad§nandatÊrtha Sv§mÊ that “aØkara founded a fifth maãhaat Målab§gala in Dv§rak§ (see below).116“astry and Kumaraswamy (1971:202) believe the maãhamoved to Kumbhako-nam in the latter part of the eighteenth century. Srinivasan (1979:273 fn. 160) refers to a [unidentifiable] copper-plate inscription from the K§m§kßÊ temple at K§ñcÊ that refers to Mah§devendrasarasvatÊ (1703–1746), a pupil of CandraáekharasarasvatÊof the “aØkar§c§ryamaãhaat K§ñcÊ. The inscription mentions the renovation of the temple by CandraáekharendrasarasvatÊ, the pontiff of K§m§koãipÊãham, who came to K§ñcÊ from Kumbhakonam for that purpose in 1840.117ThevaißÖava“§raØgap§Öi temple of Kumbhakonam was renovated in the early Vijayanagara period, beginning in 1385, when the name Kumbhakonam was first used. A vaißÖava maãhawas first attached to the temple in the period of Raghun§tha N§yaka, in the seventeenth century, since when it has served as an important pon-tifical seat of south Indian VaißÖavism (Champakalakshmi 1996:344).118Gnanambal cites T.

In 1894 the Collector of Tanjore recommended that 6743 Rs. be paid as meraito the K§ñcÊmaãha(Anantanandendra Sarasvati 1968:379).121A dispute between the K§ñcÊ K§makoãi and “ÜØgerÊmaãha-s led to two court cases, in 1844 and 1848. This concerned the authority to carry out the repair of the ear-ornaments (taãaØka-pratißãh§) of the Goddess Akhil§Ö·eávarÊ in the Tiruvanaikoil temple at Jambukeávaram, and the entitlement to exclusive jurisdiction over certain spiritual affairs of the area, in this case in district of Tirichinopoly. (Incidentally, the maãhaattached to this temple also claims to be the first and foremost of the maãha-s established by “aØkara; see Antarkar 2001:95). The cases were decided in favour of the K§ñcÊmaãha, and the “ÜØgerÊmaãhafailed to prove its case for its jurisdic-tion over religious matters in the south. A similar dispute over the consecration of the earrings again took place in 1908, with the same outcome, the K§ñcÊmaãha finally performing the consecration. There were several other disputes between the twomaãha-s (Bader 2000:290–291 fn 138; Antarkar 2001:94–101). More recently, in 1984, one K. Rajendran brought a case at the High Court of Madras (Bader 2000:303), claiming that the incumbents of the K§ñcÊpurammaãhaare not Jagad-guru-“aØkar§c§ryas. Rajendran cited the Maãh§mn§ya-s, and called attention to the three branches of the “ÜØgerÊmaãhain Tamil Nadu. He objected to the control of the K§ñcÊmaãhaover the K§m§kßÊ-amman temple, and to the participation of the Chief Minister and the Minister for Religious and Charitable Endowments in a conference partly organised by the K§ñcÊmaãha.The court rejected the suit, and, similar to the ruling in the case brought before the Bombay High Court in 1908, maintained that it was not the duty of the government to declare who is or who is not a “aØkar§c§rya. 122Both the Pußpagirimaãha(Cuddapaht§luk§, Cuddapah District, Karnataka) and Viråp§kßamaãha (Hospet t§luk§, Bellary District, Karnataka) have their own Maãh§mn§ya-s (Antarkar 2001:80). For the Maãh§mn§ya-stotraof the Pußpagirimaãha,see Anantandendra Sarasvati (1968:386–387). It seems possible that the Pußpagiri maãhawas originally one of four “aiva-Siddh§ntamaãha-s known to have been very clark_BIL25a.indd 1335/30/2006 2:00:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"chapter four134Kå·alÊ). While the Ku·alÊmaãha(at the confluence of the TuØg§and Bhadr§ rivers in Shimoga District, Karnataka) may date from the twelfth century, and TuØga “ÜØgerÊ (in Chikkamagalur District, Karnataka) from the fourteenth century,123 the others date from a later period.The TuØga“ÜØgerÊmaãha and Ku·alÊmaãha (whose current jurisdic-tion is in north-west Karnataka and southern Maharashtra; see Anan-tanandendra Sarasvati 1968:363 fn. 11) have both made competing claims for legitimacy, arguing that the other maãhais a subsidiary.124Of the two, the currently recognised “aØkar§c§rya occupies the gaddÊof TuØga“ÜØgerÊ.125 However, it seems that previously the Ku·alÊmaãhaenjoyed supremacy.126 In 1580, during the reign of KÜßÖappa N§yaka of Keladi (1520–1609), an order was passed prohibiting the §c§ryaof the TuØga“ÜØgerÊmaãhafrom going out on digvijaya.Dur-ing the reign of the 52nd §c§ryaof Ku·alÊ, around 1723, the §c§rya-s of Ku·alÊ,“aØkeávara and TuØga“ÜØgerÊmaãha-s met at S§t§r§(Maharashtra) during the reign of Sahu—the successor of “iv§jÊ—to decide which of the §c§rya-s should be entitled to agra-påj§(‘first/foremost’påj§). It was decided in favour of the §c§ryaof the Ku·alÊmaãha.Under the order of Basavappa N§yaka II—during the reign NarasiÒhabh§ratÊ, the 53rd §c§rya of Ku·alÊ (1727–1751)—the §c§ryaof TuØga“ÜØgerÊ was restrained from going on digvijaya; and again in 1806, this time under the order of PurÖayya, the famous minister of Hyder $lÊ and Tippu Sultan. Another restraining order was was also issued in 1820. In 1811, KÜßÖar§jendra III of Mysore permit-influential in the development of temple culture in the CÙÏa period (c.1000–1200) (see Ch. 6.2), given that another maãha, at Tiruv§naikk§val, seems to have once been a “aiva-Siddh§ntamaãha that was converted at an indeterminable time, after 1200, to an advaita“aØkaramaãha (see Annual Reports on Indian Epigraphy 1986:103, no. 538, para. 53, 28th July 1909). 123From inscriptional evidence, it appears that the Ku·alÊmaãhareceived grants from 1155, while the TuØga“ÜØgerÊmaãhareceived grants only after 1345 or 1350 (Antarkar 2001:55–67).124There is a story to be found in several sources that while the §c§ryaof the Ku·alÊmaãha, NarasiÒhabh§ratÊ, was away on an extended tour, around 1570, thegaddÊwas usurped by the TuØga“ÜØgerÊmaãha. This, however, contradicts the account (and the guru-parampar§of TuØga“ÜØgerÊ), that NarasiÒhabh§ratÊ was initially the incumbent of TuØga“ÜØgerÊ (see Antarkar 2001:57–59).125The founding of the “ÜØgerÊmaãha, and its association with “aØkara, are discussed in the following chapter.126Ayer and Sastri (1962:88–92); Anantanandendra Sarasvati (1968:383); Antarkar (2001:59–61). clark_BIL25a.indd 1345/30/2006 2:00:38 PM"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"integration of various lineages: the maãh§mn§ya-s 135ted NarasiÒhabh§ratÊ127 (1820–1856) of Ku·alÊ to go on digvijayain palanquin and with full honours, having recognised him as jagadguru.

Up until the middle the nineteenth century, all of the several court rulings in disputes between the Ku·alÊ and “ÜØgerÊmaãha-s issued in favour of the Ku·alÊmaãha.Although currently the “aØkar§c§rya of the TuØga“ÜØgerÊmaãhaisrecognised as the ‘legitimate’ “aØkar§c§rya, and not that of Ku·alÊ,it seems that it was only in the middle of the twentieth century that the TuØga“ÜØgerÊmaãhastarted pushing the claim that theirs was theDakßiÖ§mn§ya maãha, or one founded by “aØkara for the southern region. Records appear to have been altered to this effect (Antarkar 2001:81).It is not only the K§ñcÊ, Ku·alÊ and “ÜØgerÊmaãha-s that have enjoyed dominance as the southern maãha.The“ivagaØg§maãhawas established at the request of R§ja Wodeyar, the then ruler of Mysore, in 1615 at “ivagaØg§128by an ascetic, “aØkarabh§ratÊ,129 who was ordained by Abhinava NarasiÒhabh§ratÊ V of the “ÜØgerÊmaãha (Row 1914:57ff.). The spiritual jurisdiction of the maãhahas periodically extended over most of the territory of modern Karnataka. Between 1727 and 1846 the maãharose to prominence, so much so that the “ÜØgerÊmaãhawas overshadowed by the influence of the “ivagaØg§maãha.During this period, r§hdarÊ-s (‘passports’) were issued by several local rulers and officials, permitting the jagadguru-s of “ivagaØg§ to travel in the region and collect religious donations, and a number of villages were granted to the maãha.

However, the aim of the “ÜØgerÊmaãha—which was ulti-mately successful—was to absorb the “ivagaØg§maãha-’s jurisdiction into its own and to treat the “ivagaØg§sv§mÊas a ‘disciple’, giving him a small allowance (Row 1914:75). At times, the “ivagaØg§,$vaÖiand (TuØga)“ÜØgerÊmaãha-s have sent payments to the Ku·alÊmaãha,which is evidence of their status as subsidiary maãha-s in previous cen-turies.However, as observed previously, it was the (TuØga)“ÜØgerÊmaãhathat subsequently gained preeminence, gaining control of the “ivagaØg§maãha, and persuading the government to deny it certain privileges, such as the suspension of r§hdarÊ-s.130The$vaÖimaãhawas founded by Abhinava NarasiÒhabh§ratÊ V, of the “ÜØgerÊmaãha, who, according to the “ÜØgerÊguru-parampar§,ascended the “ÜØgerÊgaddÊin 1576, his demise being in 1599 (Aiyer and Sastri 1962:165).

However, at that time Svaråp§nanda was “aØkar§c§ryaof the Jyotir maãha, where he had been installed since 1973 (Jaffrelot 1996:356). This resulted in Svaråp§nanda becoming the “aØkar§c§rya of two maãha-s, which was challenged by M§dhav§árama who wished to occupy the Jyotir maãha gaddÊ(Sundaresan 2000:4).4.4.4 The eastern pÊãhaRegarding the history of the eastern pÊãhain Orissa, little if anything is known of the historical origins. It seems that the oldest maãha-s in the area were K§p§lika and P§áupata.141 The Govardhana maãhaatPurÊ has a list of 144 (or 142) §c§rya-s contained in its Maãh§mn§ya,published in PurÊ as the “aØkar§c§rya-jagadguru-maãh§mn§ya by Yogen-dra Asthav§dana“arma in 1930 (Pande 1994:29). The Govardhan maãhahas four other branches in PurÊ: the “aØkar§nanda,“ivatÊrtha, Gop§latÊrtha and Mahiprak§áamaãha-s.The first three maãha-s are presided over by saÒny§sÊ-s, while the last is a brahmac§rÊ maãha.142The only dates known for the pontiffs of the Govardhan maãha are for the last five pontiffs, the first of whom became Head in 1849. In the bald list many names are repeated. One significant difference between appointments at PurÊ and other pÊãha-s is that at PurÊ the “aØkar§c§ryas are traditionally first householders before assuming office. At the other pÊãha-s the “aØkar§c§ryas are generally appointed much younger, from brahmac§rya. As a consequence, pontiffs at PurÊtend to reign for shorter periods, which could account for its longer list of pontiffs (Lütt 1978:412). However, there seems to have beensome kind of lapse of authority at PurÊ, as suggested by a letter from the “aØkar§c§rya of “ÜØgerÊ to his colleague at PurÊ, dated 141In Bhubaneávara, the oldest maãha is the Sadavrata maãha, dating from (ten-tatively) the seventh century. It was originally in the hands of the P§áupata order, but in 1964 it was administered by Bh§ratÊs of the Daáan§mÊ order (Miller and Wertz 1976:13). The second oldest monastery is the K§p§limaãha, dating (tentatively) from the eighth to sixteenth centuries. This maãhais associated with the K§p§likas, a sect closely associated with the P§áupatas. 142The“aØkar§nandamaãhais the more important of the affiliated maãha-s, supplying the vice-president to an organisation of Brahmans (the Mukti-MaÖ·apa) which oversees sixteen in§mvillages in the PurÊpargana. The Govardhan maãhasup-plies the president to this organisation (Anantanandendra Sarasvati 1968:399). clark_BIL25a.indd 1405/30/2006 2:00:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"integration of various lineages: the maãh§mn§ya-s 1411862.143 The “aØkar§c§rya states that “the Acharyas of the Gov-ardhana and Jyotir Maths degraded themselves to the position of Gosains [presumably married saÒny§sÊ-s] and thus these two Maths remained without any Acharya although the Govardhana Math was subsequently revived by a Sanyasi from Gougak Nakhal.” Beyond this not much is known, but it appears from East India Company documents that the PurÊmaãhawas (still or again?) in the hands of saÒny§sÊ-s around 1800 (Lütt 1978:413 fn. 6). At one time there seems to have been a close association between the Govardhana maãha and the Jagann§tha temple, in that the priests of the Jagann§tha temple used to receive training in ceremonies and rituals in the Govardhana maãha.A certificate was then issued, which, following the confirmation of the king, permitted the priests to carry out their services. Owing to a dispute arising from the removal and destruction of the idols of $di-“aØkara and “iva (or Padmap§da?)144from Jagann§tha, around 1800, the relationship between the two institutions ended.145 Prior to 1900 the “aØkar§c§rya of “ÜØgerÊwas regarded as the preeminent authority regarding the running of the other maãha-s, and the “aØkar§c§rya of PurÊ did not play an important role in the religious life of India. This changed in the twentieth century, since when the “aØkar§c§ryas of PurÊ have played a more prominent role in Hindu religious affairs, notably under Bh§ratÊkÜßÖatÊrtha, who was very active during his period on thegaddÊ, from 1925 to 1960 (Lütt 1978:414–415).146 Prior to becoming 143Madhusudan Parvat v. Shri Shankaracarya, The Indian Law Reports, Bombay Series, 33, p. 289 (see Lütt 1978:412).144During his reign, Gajpati DibyasiÒha Deva II (1793–1798) renovated the Jagann§tha temple, temporarily removing the mårti-s of Padmap§da and “aØkar§c§rya. They were returned but subsequently destroyed by vaißÖava-s (Das 1997:109).145PurÊ has witnessed periodic contests between vaißÖavaandáaivareligious and political authorities since the twelfth century, until which time Orissa was áaiva,with few vaißÖavatemples.“§ktaimages appear from the eighth century onwards. The rise of vaißÖavainfluence began around the time of the construction of the Jagann§tha temple, begun in 1136, attributed to the GaØga king Anantavarman Co·agaØga, who was most probably áaiva. The cult of Purußottama (later known as Jagann§tha) was raised to the status of an imperial cult. Jagann§tha at PurÊ is mentioned by S§yana (c.1370), indicating its importance. See Dimock (1963:107); Dash (1978); Panigraha (1981:335–352); Upinder Singh (1993:249–259).146In January 1906, at the Allahabad Kumbh Mel§, the “aØkar§c§rya of PurÊpresided over the orthodox organisation, San§tana Dharma Mah§sabh§; at the inauguration of the All-India Hindu Sabh§ at Haridv§r, in 1915, the “aØkar§c§rya of PurÊ acted as one of the three “aØkar§c§rya vice-presidents; three “aØkar§c§ryas—ofclark_BIL25a.indd 1415/30/2006 2:00:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"chapter four142“aØkar§c§rya, he was involved in the Hindu Mah§sabh§, after 1923, and ran for presidentship in 1925/26. At the invitation of the Self Realisation Fellowship of Los Angeles, he toured the USA in 1958, becoming the first “aØkar§c§rya to tour outside India.Bh§ratÊkÜßÖatÊrtha died in 1960, having not appointed a successor. ThegaddÊwas vacant for four years, eventually being occupied by NirañjanadevatÊrtha, who became infamous as one of the instigators of the agitation against the government’s failure to implement a pan-Indian ban on cow-slaughter.147 Since the early twentieth century, the“aØkar§c§ryas of PurÊ, Dv§rak§ and Jyoáimaãh have been mutu-ally supportive during various religious and political protests, their orthodox stance being supported by Hindu organisations such as the Hindu Mah§sabh§ and the Jan SaØgh (Lütt 1978:416–417).148PurÊ, Dv§rak§ and “aØkeávara/KaravÊra—presided, at the Allahabad Kumbh Mel§of 1918, over sessions of the All-India Hindu Sabh§ (later to become the Hindu Mah§sabh§) and the All-India San§tana Dharma Mah§sammelan; Bh§ratÊkÜßÖatÊrthawas involved in the nationalist movement, having contacts with Aurobindo and Gokhale. He was arrested but acquitted in 1921 after involvement in the famous ‘Karachi case’, a consequence of the All-India Khilafat Conference held in Karachi in July 1921, when Maulana Muhammed Ali declared it unlawful for any faithful Muslim to serve in, or conscript for, the British army. As “aØkar§c§rya, he was extensively involved, between 1931 and 1933, in opposition to the Untouchability Abolition and Temple Entry Bills. After 1952, Bh§ratÊkÜßÖa spent more time in N§gpur, founding the Viáva Punarnirm§Öa SaØgha(World Reconstruction Association) there in 1953, and eventually settling there. 147On November 6th, 1966, 200,000 people tried to storm parliament, result-ing in eight deaths and many injuries. 750 people (including 500 saÒny§sÊ-s) were arrested. NirañjanadevatÊrtha undertook a 73-day fast in an unsuccessful attempt to change the decision of the government. In 1972, he formed an organisation against family planning, concerned that the proportion of Hindus in the popula-tion was decreasing.148In July 2000 a dispute erupted over the gaddÊof PurÊ (Banerjee 2000:34). Sv§mÊ Adhokßaj§nanda, from Banaras, arrived in PurÊ, claiming that he was the real “aØkar§c§rya, having been ordained by the previous §c§ryaof PurÊ, Sv§mÊ Nirañ-janadevatÊrtha. However, he was arrested and expelled from the town, with widespread support from local dignitaries for the incumbent, Sv§mÊ Niácal§nandasarasvatÊ. The case is not straightforward, as the incumbent’s appointment—finally in 1995—had been surrounded by controversy and had taken several years, an appointment to the gaddÊ needing the recognition of the state’s endowment commissioner. One of the objections raised against Niácal§nandasarasvatÊ’s appointment was that a “aØkar§c§rya of PurÊ should be a TÊrtha, and not a SarasvatÊ. In the context of this particular dispute, it is perhaps interesting to note that according to the Maãh§mn§ya-s—used many times in court in legal and jurisdiction disputes by “aØkar§c§ryas of the four main maãha-s—TÊrthas should belong to the Dv§rak§pÊãha, and SarasvatÊsto the “ÜØgerÊpÊãha.clark_BIL25a.indd 1425/30/2006 2:00:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"integration of various lineages: the maãh§mn§ya-s 1434.4.5 The northern pÊãha Little information is available about the Jyotir maãhain the north, for which Antarkar was supplied with a list of 82 §c§rya-s in 1987 by the then§c§rya.149Miára (Amiã K§lrekh§, 2001:102–106), an affiliate of the Dv§rak§pÊãha, maintains that the Jyotir pÊãhawas vacant from 1776 to 1941 (165 years),150 during which time the gaddÊwas removed to Dholka, where it was occupied by a continuous line of “aØkar§c§ryas during the interval. (It will be recalled that the Dholka gaddÊwas the object of a considerable legal dispute.) Pande (1994:29) observes that the tradition of the Jyotir maãhais incomplete and shows inter-ruption in the succession. Of the earliest period, twenty-one names are recounted in verses contained in an Appendix to a manuscript of the Mantra-rahasya.151There is also a list of twenty-one names for the period between 1479 and 1776,152 then there is a gap until the twentieth century. In 1851/2 there was an earthquake in the area which destroyed the maãha(Mason 1994:17). During the early part of the twentieth century there were several court cases when various people laid claim to be the “aØkar§c§rya of the Jyotir maãha (Sundaresan 2000:1). However, on May 11th 1941, Brahm§nandasarasvatÊ was installed as pontiff, with the approval of the “aØkar§c§ryas of “ÜØgerÊ and PurÊ, and support from Karpatri of Banaras and the Mah§r§ja of Darbh§Øga.153His appointment was, however, surrounded by controversy, as was the appointment—after his demise in 1953—of his successor, “§nt§nandasarasvatÊ, who had a rival, KÜßÖabodh§árama.

In 1979 a meeting of the “aØkar§c§ryas of the four §mn§ya maãha-s took place at “ÜØgerÊ, the first ever such meeting. It was convened by the then “aØkar§c§rya of “ÜØgerÊ,“rÊ Abhinava Vidy§tÊrtha, but neither“§nt§nanda nor VißÖudev§nanda were invited. Another court case which began in 1999, at Allahabad, concerning the succession to the Jyotir maãha, was still running in 2000.1544.4.6 The Sumeru pÊãhaThe Sumeru pÊãhaof Banaras also has a claim to have been founded by “aØkara, as the northern pÊãha. Several of the publications of the Maãh§mn§ya-s155 include another (or extra) text (together with the other four §mn§ya-s and the Mah§nuá§sanam) that presents—with some minor differences—three more maãha-s and §mn§ya-s (see Appendix 2),156 the Sumeru being the fifth.157 The Sumeru §mn§ya is as follows (Mishra 2001:48–52, vv. 66–68):158Maãha  Sumeru-pÊãha(Kail§sa kßetra)Kail§saOrders (pad§ni)Satya (Truth), Jñ§na (Knowledge)Deities (m) Nirañjana(f)M§y§154For further details of the dispute concerning the gaddÊ, the claim exerted bysv§mÊ-s of three separate lineages, political influence, and the subsequent suc-cession, see Daáan§mÊ Samprad§ya(1999); Sundaresan (2000); P.

The maãha is in a district of Banaras named ‘Sumeru’, possibly indicating the antiquity of the maãha, and preserves a pair of wooden sandals (p§duk§), believed to have been used by “aØkara, hence its other name, the ‘P§duk§Maãha’. It admits only daÖ·Ê-s of the SarasvatÊ order, and used to be patronised by the Mah§r§ja of Banaras.162 In the GuruvaÒáa-k§vya,159jaise ‘Sumeru maãh’ ko årdhv§mn§y kah§ gay§ hai (Miára 1996:12).160unkaáarÊr keval vijñ§n hÊ hai (Miára 1996:12).161Sinha and Saraswati (1978:261–262) relate that the maãhawas supposedly founded as a branch of the “§rad§pÊãhaby Mah§dev§nandatÊrtha, who was a disciple of Padmap§d§c§rya, the latter being one of “aØkara’s four chief disciples. The fifty-eighth mahant, Nity§nandatÊrtha, although himself a vegetarian, apparently introduced left-handed Tantric practices, including goat sacrifice to K§lÊ, when he was on the gaddÊbetween 1945 and 1950. $nandabodh§árama, who occupied thegaddÊin 1958, banned women from residence in the maãha.From 1758, when thegaddÊwas occupied by Mah§dev§nandatÊrtha VI, all mahant-s have been of Bengali descent. Several buildings attached to the maãhawere sold off by a drunk-ard, Viáeßvar§nandatÊrtha, the fifty-third mahant, and several bullock-cart loads of manuscripts were sold to Annie Besant. At the time of Sawyer’s (1993) research in Banaras, in 1988, the “aØkar§c§rya of the Sumeru maãhawas Sv§mÊ“aØkar§nanda. This author visited the Sumeru maãhain February 2002. It was in a run-down condition with no resident s§dhu-s. I was informed by several of the caretakers that the current mahantwas away somewhere.162There is a copper-plate inscription on the wall of the maãha,written in both Bengali and Devan§garÊ Sanskrit. It is dated 1290 áaka, and purports to record anin§m, on behalf of the local r§ja, for sustaining a temple there, said to have been founded by $di“aØkar§c§rya in the eighth century, and inaugurated to “rÊBhadrak§lÊ.

This would seem to indicate that the Banaras maãhawas of some considerable importance in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Sinha and Saraswati (1978:60) relate that “some years ago”, Sv§mÊ Maheávar§nanda was designated “aØkar§c§rya of K§áÊ by the then “aØkar§c§rya of Jyoáimaãh at a ceremony at the $dh§-Kumbh at Pray§g. However, Sv§mÊ$nandabodh§árama, the mahantof the Sumeru maãha at the time of Sinha and Saraswati’s study (1967), did not recognise Sv§mÊMaheávar§nanda as the “aØkar§c§rya, nor did Maheávar§nanda live at the Sumeru maãha.One of the most important recent pontiffs of the Sumeru maãhawas Sv§mÊ Harihar§nandasarasvatÊ (commonly known as ‘Karpatri’), who died in 1982. He has been described as the most influential daÖ·Ênot only of Banaras but of all India (Sawyer 1993:170), directing the affairs of the Jyotir pÊãhaeven though he was not a “aØkar§c§rya.Our relatively brief excursion into the histories of various advaita maãha-s has shown that very little reliance, if any, can be placed on the parampar§-s of the maãha-s,163 or the information in the Maãh§mn§ya-s that“aØkara founded four maãha-s in four specific places, each pÊãha being associated with either two or three of the ten lineages: the status of various pÊãha-s was still being contested in the nineteenth century. and concluded that the language and characters used in the inscription would most probably indicate a date of around the seventeenth century at the earliest for the composition of the text, which appears to have been falsely dated.163According to the guru-parampar§of (TuØga)“ÜØgerÊ (see Aiyer and Sastri 1962:164–181), none of the first four §c§rya-s of the “ÜØgerÊ after “aØkara are named SarasvatÊ, Bh§ratÊ or PurÊ, as they should be according to the Maãh§mn§ya;§c§rya-s nos. 8 to 11, and nos. 35 and 36 are named TÊrtha (located at Dv§rak§ in theMaãh§mn§ya); and §c§rya-s nos. 5, 6 and 7 are Giris (located at Jyotir maãhain theMaãh§mn§ya). There are no PurÊs or SarasvatÊs in the list at all. In the Ku·alÊlist all the §c§rya-s are Bh§ratÊs. Of the seventy-nine §c§rya-s of Dv§rak§ (TÊrtha and $árama according to the Maãh§mn§ya), only six are TÊrtha, one is a SarasvatÊ (acc. “ÜØgerÊ), thirty-six are $árama, while the rest have other names. The 144 §c§rya-s of the Jagann§thamaãhashould be called either Vana or AraÖya, according to the Maãh§mn§ya, yet none of them have that name.

In this chapter, the hagiographies of “aØkara will be surveyed for what they reveal concerning the founding of maãha-s and other legends central to the traditional life of “aØkara.“aØkara’s religious orientation will also be analysed, and it will be seen that “aØkara, despite being projected as an incarnation of “iva in the hagiographies, was almost certainly avaißÖava, as were his immediate disciples. In the final section, the hagiographies of “aØkara will be returned to again.

Texts of these passages (the last two without references) are included in Pande (1994:36–38). Details of “aØkara’s life may be found in several other Pur§Öa-s (see Sankaranarayanan 1995a:5–14, who lists a total of 33 sources, including the hagiographies).4One of the better known of these is the “aØkara-digvijaya-s§raof Sad§nanda, composed in the late eighteenth century.

Bader examines eight of the hagiogra-phies (some other texts, not examined, being largely derivative of one of the eight works considered):5 M§dhava’s “aØkara-dig-vijaya(“DV), Anant§nandagiri’s “aØkaravijaya (A“V),6 Cidvil§sa’s “aØkaravijaya-vil§sa (C“V), Vy§s§cala’s “aØkaravijaya (V“V), R§jacå·§maÖi-DÊkßi-ta’s “aØkar§bhyudaya (R“A), Govindan§tha’s “aØkar§c§ryacarita (G“C), Tirumala-DÊkßita’s “aØkar§bhyudaya (T“A), and LakßmaÖa-“§strÊ’s GuruvaÒáa-k§vya (GVK).7 All texts are tentatively dated post-fourteenth century, the earliest being the A“V and the V“V,8 most probably followed by the C“V and T“A.9 Antarkar (1973:2) places the C“Vwhich Ungemach (1992) provides the text and (German) translation.5Bader (2000:342–350) also discusses two so-called ‘lost’ hagiographies of “aØkara, the Pr§cÊna-“aØkaravijaya(Pr“V)—attributed by some (see Pande 1994:7) to$nandagiri (or $nandajñ§nam)—and the BÜhat-SaØkaravijaya(BÜ“V) attributed to Citsukha. (According to one tradition, Citsukha—also called VißÖuáarman—was a direct disciple of “aØkara.) T. S. Narayana Sastry (1971 [1916]) was one of the first scholars to call attention to the ‘lost’ texts. Antarkar (1960; 2001:26) believes in the existence of the BÜ“V, yet has not succeded in seeing it, despite efforts over the last 35 years; nor has Pande (1994:9). According to two commentaries on the “DV—Acyåta’sAdvaitar§jya-LakßmÊ(17.16.103), dated to 1798, and the 4iÖ·ima—the Pr“V was a source for the “DV. However, Bader (2000:342–350) believes the Pr“V to be a summary of the contents of A“V.$tmabodha ($tmabodhendra)’s Sußam§ (a commentary to the Guru-ratna-m§lik§ attributed to Sad§áivabrahmendra) also cites the Pr“V and the BÜ“V. According to the concluding stanzas, it was written in 1720 (Pande 1994:7; Antarkar 2001:38). However, it may be older still, as$tmabodha is dated from 1586 to 1638. No text of the BÜ“V is available, but for a single chapter published by Sastry and Kumaraswamy (1971:272–281). It contains astrological information and faulty Sanskrit that lead both Bader (2000:347 ff.) and Umesh (1981:179–182) to doubt its authenticity. Ungemach (1992:4) notes that material from the Pr“V and BÜ“V is cited in later texts, but also doubts that these two texts existed.6Antarkar (1961) demonstrates that this Anant§nandagiri cannot be identified as$nandagiri, the Ved§ntin, with whom he is sometimes identified.7There is a complex relationship between the texts: see the table comparing contents (Bader 2000:74–76). The texts fall essentially into two groups, comprising slightly different traditions (Bader 2000:242), Group A comprising the A“V, C“Vand the GVK, and the other, Group B, comprising the V“V, R“A, G“C and “DV. The T“A stands somewhat alone.8Some believe the V“V to have been written by Mah§deva IV (Mah§deven-drasarasvatÊ, also known as Vy§s§c§la), the 52nd §c§ryaof K§ñcÊ, from 1498–1507 (Ungemach 1992:4; Pande 1994:20).9In the colophons of the T“A, Tirumala-DÊkßita says that he is devoted to Paramaáivendra. According to the guru-parampar§of the K§ñcÊmaãha, the fifty- seventh§c§ryawas Paramaáiva II (ParamaáivendrasarasvatÊ), who reigned from 1539 to 1586, and who was the guru of Sad§áivabrahmendra (Aiyer and Sastri 1962:131).

Bader (2000:24) believes the R“A and G“C to have been written around 1650, while the GVK may be dated to 1740, and the “DV to between 1650 and 1798 (Sawai 1985; Bader 2000:53–62).The“aØkara-dig-vijaya(“DV/Madh§vÊya)10 of M§dhava11 is by far the most widely distributed of the hagiographies of “aØkara, the incumbent“aØkar§c§ryas of the “ÜØgerÊ and Dv§rak§/Jyotirmaãha-s maintaining that this text is the most authoritative account of the §c§rya-’s life. Since the establishment of its widespread reputation, towards the end of the eighteenth century, subsequent writers largely restate its contents.12 According to the “DV,“aØkara had four direct disciples, whom he converted to his philosophy.13 There is a refer-ence (10.71) to “aØkara’s setting up a temple at “ÜØgerÊ and initiat-ing the worship of the devÊ“§rad§, and to his installing certain of his disciples in §árama-s, such as the one at ŒßyaáÜØga14 (“ÜØgerÊ) for ensuring the greatness of his creed (16.93). He also built a temple todevÊat K§ñcÊpuram, inaugurating worship according to Vedic tradition (15.1–20).15 However, no mention is made anywhere in the text of their appointments to head the four maãha-s, nor is there the Paramaáivendras are identical, then the T“A may be placed in the latter part of the sixteenth century.10For references in this section, see Vidy§raÖya (1915) for the Sanskrit text, and M§dhava-Vidy§raÖya (1986) for the English translation.11Even though the colophons at the conclusion of each of the sixteen chapters state that the text was written by M§dhava, the editor of the widely circulated Anand§árama edition of the “DV has changed not only the title of the work (to SaÒkßepa-“aØkara-jaya) but also the author’s name, to M§dhava-Vidy§raÖya. Besides Bader, several other scholars have presented evidence against the possibility of Vidy§raÖya’s authorship: see Sastry and Kumaraswamy (1971:229); Antarkar (1972:1–23); Sawai (1985:454–459).12There are two exceptions (Bader 2000:23): the $c§rya-digvijaya-campu, by VallÊsah§ya, and the BÜhat-“aØkaravijayaby Brahm§nandasarasvatÊ. The former text may be dated to the end of the nineteenth century, while the latter idiosyncratically diverges significantly from the other hagiographic works.13“aØkara’s first disciple was Padmap§da (Sanandana), whom he met in Banaras; followed by Hast§malaka, who became his disciple in MåkaÒbik§ (Kollår, Kar-nataka); Toãaka (Giri) became his next disciple, in SÜØgerÊ; lastly, Sureávara, who became his main disciple.14In Hindu mythology, ŒßyaáÜØga is (in most texts) a single-horned ascetic who is seduced by an enchantress on behalf of Indra, who fears the ascetic’s tapas(see Doniger O’Flaherty 1981a:42–54).15This was towards the beginning of his digvijaya according to the “DV, and at the end of the digvijaya according to the A“V (see below).clark_BIL25a.indd 1505/30/2006 2:00:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"áaØkara’s hagiographies and his religious orientation 151any mention of the founding of an order of ascetics, nor the term ‘Daáan§mÊ’. Given the relative lateness of this text, the absence of any reference to the founding of an order of ascetics or four maãha-s is indeed intriguing.5.2“aØkara’s life in the hagiographies “aØkara’s own works, previously discussed, provide very little infor-mation on the life of the §c§rya. We know from these that “aØkara became a saÒny§sÊand that his guru was Govinda, but not much more. According to tradition, “aØkara was of the Nambådiri caste, an orthodox Brahman caste who are the only original Brahmans of Kerala, renowned for their maintenance of Vedic rites which are extinct elsewhere.16 Sureávara, in his V§rttika(6.22–23) on “aØkara’s Brahma-såtra-bh§ßya, tells us that his teacher was a “lordly ascetic who walked with a bamboo staff ” and that he was descended from theÜßi Atri, indicating that “aØkara was a Brahman (Alston 1980a,Vol. 1:44). In the Naißk§rmyasiddhi (4.44)17 Sureávara refers to “aØkaraas a dravi·a, indicating “aØkara’s southern origins.18 However, it is interesting to note that in the works considered genuine, all “aØkara’s references to places are to those in the north, in the Ganges delta (Alston 1980a, Vol. 1:44). “aØkara also refers to the Himalayas,19lending some support to the supposition that “aØkara wrote and taught in north India. Our only other source of information for the life of “aØkara is the hagiographies, which Bader (2000:72) considers it more appropriate to take as the creation of hagiographers rather than as any kind of historical record. 16Mayeda (1992:7 fn. 7) notes that insofar as the Nambådiris adhered to any philosophical system at all, it was to the (Kum§rila) Bh§ããa school of Pårva MÊm§Òs§,which“aØkara attacked in his works (see below). It is suggested that advaitaphi-losophy was adopted by the Nambådiris only after it had become popular in other parts of India.17See Grimes (1992).18This is also indicated by “aØkara’s practice of writing as performed through incisions into palm-leaf that were later filled with ink. This is the method utilised in south India, whereas in north India, ink was applied at the time of writing, often on birch-bark. 19In the BSB (II.3.14; III.1.8. See “aØkar§c§rya 1993:468, 567) “aØkara refers to the melting of snow and hail. He refers to a blind man dreaming he has seen a Hima-layan peak (BÜhad§raÖyaka Upanißad-bh§ßyaIV.3.6. See “aØkar§c§rya 1965:605).clark_BIL25a.indd 1515/30/2006 2:00:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"chapter five152Amongst the numerous incidents recorded in the various hagi-ographies, particular stories are common to all.20 However, since the“DV has become the most well-known of the hagiographies, particular incidents contained therein have become standard to the contemporary understanding of “aØkara’s life, even though they do not occur in the other hagiographies.21 All of “aØkara’s hagiog-raphies agree in describing the tapasundertaken in order to have a child by a pious but childless Brahman couple, “ivaguru and his wife, usually referred to by the respectful epithet $rya or $ry§mb§.In all texts but one, “aØkara is born in K§laãi,22 a village in the Ernakulam district of Kerala.23“aØkara is initiated into an advaita lineage by his guru, Govinda, that goes back, ultimately, to Vy§sa and“iva.24 His mission is to restore the true teachings of Ved§nta, to 20See Bader (2000:77–99). Ungemach (1992:11–24) also discusses several of the motifs, similarities, and parallels between events in hagiographies of “aØkara and events in: the R§m§yaÖa; legends of the Buddha (in the Buddhacarita,J§takatales, and other sources); the Basava Pur§Öa(containing stories of Basava, the twelfth-century founder of the LiØgayat/VÊraáaiva sect); the Kalpasåtra(containing stories of Mah§vÊra); the LÊÏ§caritra(an anecdotal biography of Cakradhar, founder of the Maharashtran Mah§nubh§va sect, written between 1272 and 1278); and stories—par-ticularly relating to “aØkara’s entry into the body of king Amaruka—pertaining to the semi-legendary founders of the N§th order, Matysendran§th and Gorakhn§th (c.12th/13th century), found in, for example, the Gorakßa-siddh§nta-saÒgraha.One of the hagiographies of Madhva (see below), the 13th century MaÖimañjarÊ, describes several specific events found in the hagiographies of “aØkara, such as “aØkara’s meeting with MaÖ·anamiára, and “aØkara’s burning of his mother’s body after her death.21One prominent example is when “aØkara avoids an outcaste in Banaras who is“iva in disguise, an incident which only occurs in the “DV and the T“A.22In the Calcutta edition of the A“V“aØkara is born in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, a place more commonly associated with the birth of Patañjali, the author of theYogasåtra, who is an embodiment of the primal serpent, $diáeßa (see DÊkßhitar 1965:5.2–5.8).23The description of “aØkara’s birth uses stock images of k§vyaliterature, as found in Aávaghoßa’sBuddhacaritaand K§lid§sa’sRaghuvaÒáa(Bader 2000:80).When “aØkara was five, “ivaguru was about to perform “aØkara’supanayana, but died; his mother perfomed the rite. Against the wishes of his mother, “aØkara wanted to leave home and renounce. While bathing in the river, “aØkara is seized by a crocodile. Brahmanical tradition permits renunciation in the event of a life-threat-ening calamity (§pat-saÒny§sa), and “aØkara, in the jaws of death, asks his mother permission to renounce, which she, of course, grants, miraculously saving him.24Govinda’s teacher is Gau·ap§da, the author of the earliest specifically advaita commentary available, the Gau·ap§dÊya-k§rik§(King 1995:15). In the hagiographies, Gau·ap§da is also linked with another lineage, descending from Patañjali. Although current tradition, taken from the “DV, locates Govinda by the Narmad§ river, only three texts agree on this, and do not specify the place.clark_BIL25a.indd 1525/30/2006 2:00:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"áaØkara’s hagiographies and his religious orientation 153which end he is to write his commentary on the Brahmasåtra, which is approved by Vy§sa, who grants him an extension of sixteen years on his life, which was originally destined to finish when he was but sixteen years old.25Perhaps the most fundamental theme of “aØkara’s life story is that he is an avat§raof“iva,26 the concept of avat§rabeing common in the traditional biographies of both kings and saints in India. The avat§ra, Buddha or TÊrthaØkara is the divine descendant, sent to earth to rescue people from heresy, encroaching decadence and chaos, and to reestablish cosmic order.27“aØkara moves freely from the human to the divine plane, experiencing human suffering—notably as a child—and is involved in numerous rational debates, yet he is divinely incarnated and can perform miracles in time and space. The incarnations of “iva generally reflect the ambivalent and often frightening qualities of “iva, in contrast to some of the more benign incarnations of VißÖu. One important exception is the incarnation of“iva as L§kulÊáa, the preceptor of the P§áupata order who prob-ably lived in the second century (Chakraborty 1970:8–12),28 and who may possibly have partially inspired “aØkara’s hagiographers: like“aØkara, L§kulÊáa also had four pupils, named Kuáika, Garga, Mitra and Kauruáya. The concept of divine presence—and also, by 25“aØkara’s life-span is omitted in the C“V (Bader 2000:85 fn. 25).26Sawai (1987) also summarises “aØkara’s purpose of incarnation, as told in the“DV: to halt the conduct of “evil” people, establish Vedic dharma, and to guide people to salvation. The áaiva mythological frame of the hagiographies of “aØkara draws on themes found in the Pur§Öa-s. In the A“V, C“V and GVK, it is N§rada who is alarmed by the Brahmans’ neglect of their duties, their rampant heresies, and the decline of Vedic sects. To save the world from chaos, “iva agrees to incarnate as“aØkara, the son of a pious Brahman woman. In the T“A,“DV and GVK, the story begins with “iva himself, who is approached for help by the deva-s. In the T“A and “DV, not only “iva incarnates (as “aØkara), but Brahm§ becomes MaÖ·anamiára, SarasvatÊ his wife, Kum§ra is born as Kum§rila-Bhaããa (§c§rya), N§r§yaÖa as Padmap§da, and V§yu as both Hast§malaka and Toãaka.27See Granoff (1984; 1988a; 1988b) and Snell (1994) for excellent studies of the transmission and common motifs in Indian hagiographies. See Schober (1997) for articles on the importance of the hagiography of Buddha for the Buddhist tradi-tion. Even in the earliest stratum of Buddhist texts, the biography of the Buddha is inherent in the teachings transmitted (Reynolds 1997:19–39). 28The Mathur§ pillar inscription of Candragupta II (of Gupta year 61, regnal year 5, =380 CE) mentions a áaiva guru who was tenth in succession from Kuáika. This provides an approximate date for L§kulÊáa, who is identified with “iva in the inscription, an identification probably made not much earlier (Stietencron 2001:34 fn. 21).clark_BIL25a.indd 1535/30/2006 2:00:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"chapter five154implication, divine grace—being inherent in outstanding religious leaders was first articulated in the Gupta period. The first historical evidence for an identification of a historical person with a deity—even though such an identification may have been made previously—was that made (posthumously) between L§kulÊáa and “iva29 (Stietencron 2001:22).It is evident that many of the motifs central to Indian hagiographymay also be found in other religious contexts. Heffernan’s remarks concerning Christian saints and their biographies in the Middle Ages are appropriate—in a parallel way—to saintly saÒny§sÊ-s: that para-digmatic action dominates narrative structure; and that for actions narrated in the lives of the saints to be binding for the community, they had to be imitatio Christi. Gregory of Tours (538/9–593/4), one of the most influential early mediaeval sacred hagiographers, believed that the saint, unlike the rest of mankind, lived simultaneously in two worlds, the heavenly and the earthly (Heffernan 1988:6–10). “Sacred biography, although it exalts the individual, does so only having made perfectly clear that the exaltation is the result of Providence. There are no genuinely autonomous acts of heroism in this genre; all actions, whether good or evil, are contingent acts” (Heffernan 1988:64). Such remarks are quite apposite to the saÒny§sÊ-s being discussed.A central motif of the hagiographies is “aØkara’s all-India tour of victory, his digvijaya establishing his supremacy over all rival views.30 Throughout his journey he is victorious over all rival sects 29Lorenzen (1983), focusing primarily on the “DV, has indicated several paral-lels between the lives of “aØkara and KÜßÖa, the earliest Indian god to be given a real hagiology. Details of KÜßÖa’s life, particularly the birth and infancy, amply fit the ‘standard saga’ of the hero as elaborated by the psychoanalyst Otto Rank in 1914. Two significant differences between the life-story of “aØkara and KÜßÖaare the lack of conflict with a father figure, such as KaÒsa, and the absence of abandonment and adoption by other, more humble parents, such as Nanda and Yaáod§. Lorenzen has pointed to the tension in the hagiographies between “aØkara, the lone áaiva saÒny§sÊrenunciate, and the householder vaißÖavatradition represented by his mother, a staunch vaißÖava, a tension most famously explored in Dumont’s (1960) structural analysis of Indian society, referred to in the Introduction. Bader (2000:128) acknowledges the tension in the hagiographies between householder and saÒny§sÊbut disagrees with Lorenzen’s (1983:164) supposition of a vaißÖavacomponentin the narrative, implied in a comparison of the childhoods of “aØkara and KÜßÖa; the hagiographies of “aØkara are distinctly áaivain orientation.30This features in five of the hagiographies (Bader 2000:141–182), the most clark_BIL25a.indd 1545/30/2006 2:00:54 PM"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"áaØkara’s hagiographies and his religious orientation 155and views—the very existence of which indicates the decline of the Vedic tradition—and reestablishes the correct understanding ofthe sacred texts. Although the hagiographies differ considerably over the places visited,31 the end of the debates, and the final event of significance before he dies,32 signals “aØkara’s ascension to the Throne of Omniscience.33“aØkar§c§rya also features in the partly mythological—and not extensive account being contained in the A“V, which is associated with the K§ñcÊmaãha, and is particularly áaivain orientation. The A“V provides the largest number of identifiable places that “aØkara visited, including many pilgrimage places, thirteen places being identified as venues for debates with sectarian foes. However, the “DV provides the largest number of places visited, being complied from several sources. “aØkara visits a total of twenty-eight places, scattered throughout India.31In all seven sources: BadarÊ, Pray§ga, K§ñcÊ, R§meávaram. In six: Maghada, GokarÖa, K§laãi. In five: K§ámÊra, K§áÊ, Cidambara, “rÊvali/“ivavih§ra. In four: “rÊáaila,“ÜØgerÊ, Tirupati, Anantaáayana (Bader 2000:143).32The place of “aØkara’s final disappearance, as recorded in the vijaya-s, has been examined by Antarkar (1997), who inspected seventeen works. Amongst the hagiographies that state the place of “aØkara’s demise (not all do so), the locations are: 1) VÜß§cala (Trichår) in Kerala (two works, G“C, and Kåßm§Ö·a“aØkara-vijaya of Purußottamabh§ratÊ); 2) K§ñcÊ (four works: A“V, BÜ“V, R“A, (and presum -ably)$c§rya-digvijaya-campåof VallÊ-Sah§ya; and also in the Sußam§); 3) Himalayas, in either Ked§ran§tha or Kail§sa—and in two accounts via a cave/hermitage of Datt§treya, which could be at M§hårÊ in Maharashtra (see Bader 2000:158)—(seven works:“DV, C“V, GVK, “aØkara-digvijaya-saraof Sad§nanda,Bhagavat-p§d§bhyudaya of Kavi LakßmaÖa Såri, and “aØkara-mand§ra-saurabha and “aØkara-daya, both by NÊlakaÖãha). Kedarn§th has become the most widely accepted of the places men-tioned, owing to the popularity of the “DV. However, Antarkar favours K§ñcÊ,though this is rejected by those who deny the authenticity of the K§ñcÊpÊãha. The iconographic evidence from K§ñcÊ (statues of saÒny§sÊ-s) is relatively modern, and really provides no substantive evidence at all on this issue. Local traditions locate the place of “aØkara’s death at K§ñcÊ, Ked§rn§th,“rÊnagar (Kashmir), VÜß§cala and Nirm§l§ (near Bassein, close to Bombay), all of which contain either shrines orsam§dhi-s for $di-“aØkara. Gadgil (1895:295) visited the sam§dhiof“aØkara at Nirm§l§ but concludes that the festival there, celebrated around the 13th of the bright half of K§rtika, is for a ‘second’ “aØkara. In our current state of knowledge, the question of where “aØkara may have died is still open.33Six of the hagiographies describe “aØkara’s final ascension to the seat of omniscience (sarvajña-pÊãha), while in four of the hagiographies his enthronement is the climax of the narrative: see Bader (2000:96, 177–179). There are various challenges before he ascends, the final one being from SarasvatÊ (MaÖ·anamiára’s wife), who (in some versions) questions him as to whether he can be pure, having enjoyed women. In all the hagiographies “aØkara takes the body of king Amaruka to make love, to gain knowledge of all á§stra-s, including k§ma-á§stra: see Bader (2000:169–182). “aØkara passes the test, and disappears to his abode on mount Kail§sa. This episode may be modelled on a similar story pertaining to Gorakhn§th and Matsyendran§th (see Ungemach 1992:22).clark_BIL25a.indd 1555/30/2006 2:00:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"chapter five156always entirely consistent—Chronicles (VaÒá§valÊ) of Nepal, according to which34 he was born to an immaculate Brahman woman in the Deccan during the time of the Nepalese SåryabaÒáÊ dynasty. Having been defeated by Bauddham§rgÊs in religious debate in six former incarnations,“aØkara went to Nepal to pursue the sixteen remaining learned Bodhisattvas who had fled there in fear of him.35 In Nepal, “aØkar§c§rya found that the four Hindu castes were all Buddhists of one kind or another. The only clever Buddhists he could find invoked SarasvatÊ to help them in debate, but “aØkara dismissed the goddess and defeated them. “aØkara forced some bhikßu-s to marry, prohibited many Buddhist ceremonies, cut the Buddhists’ Brahmani-cal thread, made them shave their top-knots and perform animal sacrifices—contrary to their religion—in order to drive them out of the region. Some Buddhists who refused to accept defeat were put to death, all 84,000 of the extant Buddhist religious texts in Nepal were destroyed, and áaivareligion was introduced. Although “aØkara had vanquished the Buddhist religion in Nepal, but for a few remaining Bauddham§rgÊs, he was obliged to leave some Buddhist priests in temples, as no one else was competent to propitiate the gods. “aØkarathen returned to the seaside in the south. In the hagiographies, the digvijaya-s depict “aØkara as a universal conquerer, frequently referring to him as “the king of ascetics”.36His quasi-military conquest of the four quarters, and subsequent ascent to the Throne of Omniscience, are evidently modelled on the royaldigvijaya (‘conquest of the quarters’) undertaken by kings of the early mediaeval period,37 the philosophical and sometimes dangerous battles with sectarian opponents mirroring the earlier royal submission of feudatory regents. This is a theme also to be found in epic/historic 34See Wright (1877:118–123); Hasrat (1970:38–40).35In these accounts, “aØkara is also said to have brought the Pañca-Gau·a and Pañca-Dravi·a Brahmans to Nepal and to have divided the Nepalese people into sixty-four castes (Wright 1877:185–186; Petech 1958:181–183).36The role of the ‘big-man’ (periyar, periyavatar) in south Indian culture has been examined by Mines and Gourishankar (1990), who illustrate the several parallels between kings, sect-leading renunciates (notably the “aØkar§c§rya of K§ñcÊ), and other community leaders who act as sponsors for worship (as yajam§na-s) and exhibit altruistic behaviour in the giving of charity.37See Inden (1990:240–260) for a study of the R§ßãrakåãas’ performance of thedigvijaya.clark_BIL25a.indd 1565/30/2006 2:00:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"áaØkara’s hagiographies and his religious orientation 157(itih§sapur§Öa), literature.38 It has been suggested (Sax 2000) that the demise of the royal digvijaya—due in large part to the dominance of northern Islamic regimes—led to the production of religious digvi-jaya-s, modelled on the royal performance. It is also possible that the early digvijaya-s of “aØkara were modelled on the already extant digvijaya-s of the vaißÖavadualist, Madhva (1238–1317)39 from U·upi, as it is probable that one of the earliest hagiographies of “aØkara, $nantagiri’s“aØkaravijaya, post-dates Madhva.40 In Madhva’s hagi-ographies, during his digvijaya (similarly to “aØkara), Madhva goes first to “ÜØgerÊ, and also goes to BadarÊkar§árama, establishing holy places and fending off threats from Muslims (Sax 2000:48).“aØkara’s final ascent of the Throne of Omniscience has a direct parallel in the ancient r§jasåyarite, the royal consecration cere-38In this category of literature, Bader (2000:170) notes Ratn§kara’s (9th cent.) Haravijaya, the story of “iva’s defeat of the demon Andhaka; V§sudeva’s (9th cent.) Yudhißãhiravijaya, a retelling of the main events of the Mah§bh§rata; and the (12th. cent.)PÜthvÊr§javijaya, dealing with the war and triumph of PÜthvÊr§ja III (which may have directly influenced the V“V, G“C, GVK and “DV).

Madhva took saÒny§sa from Acyutaprekßa, either at the age of nine or eleven/twelve (see Glase-napp 1992:4), and wrote a treatise on renunciation (see Olivelle 1982). “rÊ Caitanya KÜßÖa was given his name by Keáva Bh§ratÊ, a Daáan§mÊ, from whom he took saÒny§sa in 1510. The initiation seems to have been largely a formality (he did not add Bh§ratÊ to his name); Caitanya was far more influenced by ^ávara PurÊ of the Madhva sect, whom he had met previously in Gay§ in 1508, and who initiated him into the Daá§kßara KÜßÖa mantra, after which he became an ecstatic devotee of KÜßÖa (Kapoor 1994:20–25). Vallabha, besides his other works, wrote a treatise on renunciation, the SaÒny§sanirÖaya, which, according to tradition, was written in BadarÊn§th. He took saÒny§saone month before his death, aged fifty-one. How-ever, his doctrine of renunciation “is tinged by a palpable disinclination for the subject” (Smith 1993:136–137), his view being that the lÊl§-s of the world can be known without it; bhaktiis contrasted with saÒny§sa (see Horstmann 1997:229–231; Bhatt 1980). Sax states that “It is possible—perhaps even likely—that “aØkara’s hagiographers, all of whom wrote after the time of Madhva, were in fact emulating historical accounts of actual journeys by the [other] VaißÖavas”. Madhva attacks “aØkara’s reputation, portraying him as an incarnation of the demon MaÖimat, born to a widow (Bader 2000:37), and the digvijaya-s of “aØkara may, in part, have been responding to those accounts. However, Vallabha and Caitanya both lived after the time the time of the production of the earlier hagiographies of “aØkara. Rather, it seems more probable that later vaißÖava hagiographies were based on the earlier hagiographies of “aØkara and Madhva.clark_BIL25a.indd 1575/30/2006 2:00:56 PM"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"chapter five158mony for a kßatriyaking, which is one of the three large-scale árauta rites, the others being the aávamedhaand the v§japeya. Heesterman’s (1957:222–224) study of the r§jasåya illustrated that it was not a ceremony performed once and for all, but is of the character of a yearly festival (utsava), whereby the powers active in the universe are regenerated. The king’s unction is preceded by a year long dÊkß§, and dÊkß§-like observances. Technically, the consecration rite is reserved for kßatriya-s; and “aØkara is a Brahman, who, having renounced, is beyond ritual action. Yet four specific elements of the r§jasåyaare reflected in the narrative: the preparatory initiation (dÊkß§, received from Govinda); the establishment/conquest of the four quarters (digvy§sth§pana);41the chariot drive42 (also performed by the “aØkar§c§ryas); and the enthronement.43In the r§jasåya the king has a particular association with the tiger, upon whose skin he receives the unction,44prior to the dÊkß§.Similarly,thegaddÊ-s of the “aØkar§c§rya-s are covered with a tiger skin. It is during the chariot drive that the king engages in a ritual battle with another kßatriya, at whom he shoots his arrows, declaring, “the purpose has been fulfilled”.45The parallel in the hagiographies is the verbal battle with the wealthy ritualist MaÖ·anamiára,46 who is presented to “aØkara by his uncle and teacher, Kum§rila-Bhaããa(the foremost authority of his time—seventh century—in the Vedic MÊm§Òs§ tradition), who self-immolated after meeting “aØkara.4741See Heesterman (1957:103–105) for how the royal sacrificer mounts the “quarters of space”, taking one step in each of the four directions, and a fifth towards the centre, which is above.42Ibid.(pp. 127–139).43Ibid.(pp. 140–142).44Ibid.(p. 106).45Ibid.(p. 129).46Identified in four of the hagiographies as Viávaråpa.

To gain inside knowledge of Buddhism, and to defeat them in subsequent debate, he disguised himself as a Buddhist. Realising that he has committed a sin, Kum§rila immolates himself on a fire; when “aØkara arrives, the fire is already alight. (This incident is depicted on a plaque near the saØgamat Pray§g.)“aØkara does not debate with Kum§rila, who expresses admiration for “aØkara’s commentary on the Brahmasåtra but declines to write a sub-commentary on it, assigning the task to a disciple.

The indications are that he was a vaißÖavawith a reli-gious background that was most probably P§ñcar§tra,52 a ritual and philosophical system that also significantly informed the religious background of both R§m§nuja and Madhva, two other important early Ved§ntins.It is known that the P§ñcar§trins produced a vast number of texts, theirTantra-s (or $gama-s) dating from the fifth century.53 Their influence on some aspects of the Brahmanical tradition has perhaps been heretofore somewhat underestimated.54The attitude of both “aØkara and the “rÊ-VaißÖavas to the P§ñcar§trins is ambivalent. On the one hand, a long array of “rÊvaißÖavas and later P§ñcar§trins have attempted to disprove the charge of heterodoxy made against the P§ñcar§trins. On the other hand, while most of the P§nc§r§trin authors regard P§ñcar§tra as being in conformity with the Veda, they also regard the Vedaas either the shoots or the roots of P§ñcar§tra (Bhatt 1968:12).“aØkara’s opposition to the vaißÖava Bh§gavatas (P§ñcar§trins) is known from his remarks in the Brahma-såtra-bh§ßya(2.2.42). As P§ñcar§tra claims to be based on an independent, extra-Vedic revelation, it would have been illegitimate and unacceptable from “aØkara’s perspective. However, P§ñcar§tra gets off lightly. His principal objection to P§ñcar§tra does not concern their shared common Ultimate, N§r§yaÖa, but concerns an aspect of P§ñcar§tra metaphysical doctrine;55 the contention being that an individual soul (called SaÒkarßana) said to be created from the supreme Self (called V§sudeva) will be impermanent, as it is created. “aØkara does not accept this, a component of the P§ñcar§tra doctrine of vyåha-s (ema-nations). However, he agrees with the P§ñcar§trins that N§r§yaÖa52While several scholars have concluded that the origin of the term p§ñcar§tra(lit. ‘night of the five’) is obscure, Neevel (1977:10) believes that the term probably refers to the dissolution of the five elements in mokßa.

By worshipping the lord in these ways for a hundred years, the devotee reaches Bhagavat. Alston (1980a, Vol. 1:10–14) comments on “aØkara’s connec-tion to the early P§ñcar§trins, pointing out “aØkara’s reference in the introduction to his GÊt§commentary to two separate groups of mind-born “sons of Brahm§”,56 who were projected at the beginning of the world-period (kalpa). To them, the Lord, called N§r§yaÖa, communicated a practical knowledge of the two-fold Vedic wisdom. “aØkara also quotes frequently from the N§r§yaÖÊya section of the“§nti parvan of the Mah§bh§rata, which contains (XII.321.27–326.97) the earliest known account of the doctrines of the P§ñcar§trins (Neevel 1977:10); it is of a secret dialogue between N§r§yaÖa and N§rada. In the next section (XII.327ff.), Dvaip§yana praises P§ñcar§tra as the greatest Upanißad.“aØkara could have objected to the P§ñcar§trins on several grounds: the secondary status of the Veda in respect of their own texts; the predominance of Tantric elements and associated anti-Brahmanical rites and practices; image worship and the paramouncy of bhaktiovermokßa; and the admission of women, áådra-s and foreigners within the Bh§gavata fold (see Batt 1963). However, “aØkara equates the Supreme of the Upanißad-s with N§r§yaÖa (BSB 2.2.42), which is the Supreme for the P§ñcar§tras.“aØkara only rejects one aspect of the vyåhadoctrine of the P§ñcar§tras, and expressly approves a considerable part of their system, which is said to agree with his Ved§nta. According to Neevel’s analysis (1977:20), “aØkara’s rejection of P§ñcar§tra doctrine is only partial. “aØkara admits, in a general sense, that param§tmaexists in a manifold way as vyåha-s (‘extensions’ of Himself), and that this concept has a Vedic basis (quoting Ch§ndogyaUpanißad7.26.2).“aØkara also says (BSB 2.2.42–44) that the entire 56Also described in the N§r§yaÖÊya section of the MBh (XII.327).clark_BIL25a.indd 1615/30/2006 2:00:59 PM"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"chapter five162universe is a vyåhaof the Lord, twice referring to a specific aspect of the P§ñcar§travyåhatheory, the ßa·-guÖa-s.57 In his introductionto the BhagavadgÊt§,“aØkara refers to the ßa·-guÖa-s—in the same sequence used by P§ñcar§tra—in explaining how N§r§yaÖa has become the avat§raKÜßÖa (Neevel 1977:20–23). These qualities are said to co-exist in equal fullness in V§sudeva (or N§r§yaÖa), the high-est Godhead and vyåha(paravyåha).“aØkara does not object to the vyåhatheory as such, but only the way that the theory is developed by the P§ñcar§trins.“aØkara is far more critical of the áaivaMaheávaras, K§p§likas and P§áupatas—and also of Ny§ya-Vaiáeßika, S§Òkhya, Yoga, Jain-ism and Buddhism,58 all of which he explicitly describes as heretical (veda-b§hya). Neevel argues that “aØkara placed P§ñcar§tra on a higher level than other systems, closest to Ved§nta. Objections to P§ñcar§tra did come from Pårva-MÊm§Òs§kas, who maintained that P§ñcar§tra was in conflict with the Veda-s, but not from the commentatorial tradition of Ved§nta, of which all known sources reveal a more or less positive attitude to P§ñcar§tra.An important exception is B§dar§yaÖa, who, in the Ved§ntasåtra-s (2.2.42–45, the so-calledp§ñcar§tra section of the tarka-pada), raises objections to what the commentatorial tradition assumes to be P§ñcar§tra doctrines, even though P§ñcar§tra is not named. However, Neevel (1977:18–22) notes that “aØkara and Bh§skara (the earliest two commentators on theVed§ntasåtra/Brahmasåtra) treat this såtrain only a cursory way; they could have levelled many objections to P§ñcar§tra, but refrain. Both Ved§nta and P§ñcar§tra emphasised knowledge over action, and laid stress on a continuity with the Upanißad-s, but P§ñcar§tra had developed an alternative and increasingly popular ritual tradi-tion, which Neevel suggests may have threatened the livelihood and authority of sm§rtaBrahmans, hence their opposition.If“aØkara really was a áaiva, as depicted in the hagiographies, then his attitude towards the vaißÖavaBh§gavatas and his recognition 57The ‘six-qualities’ of P§ñcar§tra are: jñ§na, aiávarya,áakti, bala, vÊryaand tejas.58(BSB 2.1.1–3; 2.2.4–6.) “SmÜtisare the scriptural texts called Tantra, written by the great seer (Kapila)”.

He invokes N§r§yaÖa at the beginning of his GÊt§commentary, who is said by $nandagiri—his sub-commenta-tor—to be his chosen deity (ißãa-devat§), and in the commentary he refers several times to KÜßÖa as N§r§yaÖa, even though the name N§r§yaÖa does not appear in the text of the GÊt§.Hacker (1995:33–39) has also considered the issue of “aØkara’s religious orientation. Lorenzen (1983:160) believes Hacker’s argu-ments that “aØkara was most probably a vaißÖava to be not altogether convincing, but Hacker’s conclusions have yet to be refuted. Hacker observes that in the Brahma-såtra-bh§ßya(BSB),“aØkara’s definitive work,“iva is not mentioned. There is one passing mention (3.3.32), in a mythological reference, to Rudra, who generated Skanda.

Four times (3.3.9; 4.1.3 twice; 4.1.5) an image is used of the superimposition of the spiritual vision 59See also Hirst (1993:131–139), who presents a broad clutch of references from “aØkara’s own works, indicating both his vaißÖavaorientation and his conception of the Lord and ‘Inner Controller’ as N§r§yaÖa.

It merely points to “aØkara’s probable reli-gious background, which was evidently not áaiva.A further clue as to “aØkara’s religious orientation is provided by his attitude to Vin§yaka (GaÖapati/GaÖeáa). Commenting on a passage in the GÊt§(9.25),“aØkara remarks there are four kinds of worshippers (each attaining their own respective goal): Devavrata-s (who attain the deva-s),PitÜvrata-s (who reach the realm of ancestors), Bhåtavrata-s (who attain the bhåta-s, ‘malevolent spirits’), and VißÖuvrata-s (thevaißÖava-s who worship ‘Me’, and reach ‘Me’).63“aØkara men-tions three sects of Bhåtavrata-s by name: the Vin§yaka, the M§tÜgaÖaand the CaturbhaginÊs (Nagaswamy 1996:237–238).

Within the devel-opment of áaivaworship, GaÖeáa had became integrated within the orthodoxáaivatradition by the time of “aØkara, so his attitude to those who worship Ganeáa as bhåtavrata-s seems to be yet another clear indication of his non-áaivareligious inheritance.The second group of bhåtaworshippers that “aØkara mentions are those who worship the M§tÜgaÖa (which represents the Saptam§tÜs),64while the third group of bhåtaworshippers mentioned by “aØkara are those who worship the ‘four sisters’ (caturbhaginÊ-s).65 It is evident from“aØkara’s commentaries that the worship of Durg§, Bhadrak§lÊ,Vin§yaka, the Saptam§tÜs,r§kßasa-s,piá§ca-s and the sixty-four yoginÊ-sis considered the lowest grade of worship. “aØkara’s classification of thecatuÈßaßãiyoginÊworship with the lowest form of worship of bhåta-s, preta-s and piá§ca-s, would provide further evidence against “aØkara’s authorship of the Tantric stotra-s and commentaries attributed to him.64These are usually Br§hmÊ, MaheávarÊ, KaumarÊ, V§r§hÊ, Indr§ÖÊ and C§muÖ·a. ThisgaÖaalso includes GaÖeáa at the beginning and VÊrabhadra (or VÊn§dhara“iva) at the end. The worship of the seven women is ancient, possibly being represented on Mohenjo-d§ro seals (Ramachandra Rao 1992, Pratima-Kosha, Vol. 6:246), and certainly found from the first century CE onwards. It is known that from the sev-enth century their worship in Tamil Nadu involved the sacrifice of goats or fowl, and was performed by non-Brahman priests.65In an intriguing analysis of the term caturbhaginÊused in the GÊt§-bh§ßya, Nagas-wami (1996:242–244) argues, from the evidence of commentators on the passage containing the term, that the original term used was catuÈßaßãiyoginÊ, referring to sixty-fouryoginÊ-s (associated primarily with Tantric worship), and not caturbhaginÊ.There was a close relationship between the sixty-four yoginÊ-s, Tantric Kaulas, and the P§áupatas.clark_BIL25a.indd 1655/30/2006 2:01:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"chapter five166“aØkara’s two most important meetings, in the context of the hagiographies, are with MaÖ·anamiára and Kum§rila, the great debate (lasting between six and a hundred days) being between “aØkara and MaÖ·anamiára.66 The winner must convert to the life-style of the other. The arbiter is MaÖ·anamiára’s wife (Sarasav§ÖÊ/Bh§ratÊ/Ubhaya-Bh§ratÊ/SarasvatÊ), who decides that “aØkara has won. MaÖ·anamiára is then initiated as a saÒny§sÊand becomes a disciple of “aØkara. Hacker (1995:38–39) suggests that the reason behind the traditional emphasis on the rivalry between “aØkara and MaÖ·anamiára—two great orthodox Brahman monists, between whom there were only minor philosophical differences—was that “aØkara was most probably a vaißÖava, while MaÖ·anamiára seems to have been a áaiva, as at the end of his Brahmasiddhi he calls the state of liberation paramaáivabh§va.67 Hacker surmises that a few centuries later, when concrete differences between the two schools had been forgotten, V§caspatimiára successfully meged the two systems into one. From then on, MaÖ·ana’s doctrines survived as the so-called V§caspati (bh§matÊ) sub-school of advaita-Ved§nta. However, it is apparent that Kum§rila was also a áaiva, as the maØgal§caraÖa at the beginning of his “lokav§rttika is an explicit eulogy to “iva.68 The evi-dence fits a hypothesis being presented that the hagiographers could not have sucessfully presented “aØkara as an orthodox Brahman áaivamonist, engaged in an intense rivalry with other orthodox Brahman áaiva-s. MaÖ·anamiára’s and Kum§rila’sáaivaorientation had to be omitted, as in the hagiographies “aØkara is also a áaiva.Although“aØkara’s religious background is not entirely certain, his advaitaphilosophical position, entailing a doctrine of m§y§, would not be inconsistent with a vaißÖavaheritage.

If there is any conclusion to be drawn concerning“aØkara’s religious background, it may be that he is best described as a refomed P§ñcar§trin or Bh§gavata,“aØkara-Bhagavator“aØkara-Bhagavatp§da indeed being one of the names he uses to describe himself. This is but a surmise. However, a P§ñcar§tra (and orthodox Vedic) background is also evident in the two other impor-tant Brahmanical renunciate orders that developed in south India around the beginning of the second millennium: the “rÊ-VaißÖava order of R§m§nuja, and the order of Madhva. Nevertheless, these Ved§ntins’ specific relationship to P§ñcar§tra remains uncertain, as a fundamental principle of P§ñcar§tra is that, for participation in the cult, an initiation ceremony is required, to be performed by an §c§rya,amaãh§dhipatior a guru (Gnanambal 1977:108).71We will first address R§m§nuja’s connection to P§ñcar§tra. Ac cording to the KoÊl Ol..ugu (the somewhat historically unreliable “rÊraØgam temple chronicle), it is said that N§thamuni, Y§munamuniand R§m§nuja (the three most important §c§rya-s in the early develop-ment of “rÊ-VaißÖavism)72 took saÒny§safrom the householder state, but by the consent of Lord Varadar§ja of K§ñcÊpuram, rather than at the feet of another saÒny§sÊ, as was traditional (Lester 1992:91–92). Neevel (1977:37) believes that Y§muna’s family, and that of his grandfather N§thamuni, were of a class of Bh§gavatas, known as áißãaBh§gavatas, who performed both Vedic and P§ñcar§tra prac-70For a useful summary of “aØkara’s relationship to Buddhist philosophy, see Mayeda (2000).71This initiation is based on five sacraments, known as pañc-saÒsk§r(orcakraØkana),thepañc-saÒsk§rinitiation also being fundamental to the first stage of initiation into the Daáan§mÊs. For details of the pañc-saÒsk§rinitiation into “rÊ-VaißÖavism, see Gnanambal (1977:183–186). A yellow string is tied around the wrist, the body is branded with symbols, and the candidate receives a new name and mantra.72N§thamuni was born shortly after 907; Y§muna (his grandson, the fourth §c§rya) most probably flourished between 1022–1038; R§m§nuja’s dates were prob-ably moved back by several decades, to 1017–1137, to enable R§m§nuja (the sixth §c§rya) to receive Y§muna’s blessings (see Neevel 1977:14–16). According to tradi-tion, Y§muna is R§m§nuja’s teacher’s teacher (param§c§rya).clark_BIL25a.indd 1675/30/2006 2:01:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"chapter five168tices, installing images, prostrating and circumambulating temples.73Y§muna makes every effort to distinguish P§ñcar§tra from other non-Vedic traditions, defending it from attacks from the two major schools of Pårva MÊm§Òs§, the Bhaããa (Kum§rila), and Prabh§kara. Halbfass (1983:92) comments that Y§muna’s$gamapr§m§Öya(c.1000) is an exemplary statement concerning the authority of the so-called P§ñcar§tra. Y§muna also presents a long and elaborate refutation of the charge that B§dar§yaÖa rejected P§ñcar§tra. (It was previously mentioned that “aØkara was also uncomfortable with B§dar§yaÖa’s apparent rejection of P§ñcar§tra.) One of Y§muna’s distinctive contri-butions was to deny that there were any general conflicts between Veda(oráruti) and P§ñcar§tra (Neevel 1977:24). Y§muna’s works reveal many influences, including, directly, the bhaktiof the $l..v§rs, tangen-tially Islam, but more importantly, P§ñcar§tra. Neevel (1977:193) contends that by the time of R§m§nuja, a division of labour had taken place, in which “rÊ-VaißÖavaviáißã§dvaitaphilosophy had hived off the philosophical activity of the P§ñcar§tras, leaving their ritual activity to take a separate course.74 However, according to tradition (theKoÊl Ol..ugu) R§m§nuja was also a P§ñcar§trin ritually, opening the temple to full participation by áådra-s, called s§ttadaVaißÖavas (‘those with no thread’) (Stein 1999:233; Hopkins 2002:34).7573For details of P§ñcar§tra eight-fold daily observances, see Czerniak-Droídío-wicz (2002); for the worshipper’s visualisation and installation of the deity, see Rastelli (2002).74Lipner (1986:5) refers to Neevel’s study, but contends that R§m§nuja, while recognising the authority of P§ñcar§tra, does not explicitly identify his position with their views. However, according to tradition, after fleeing from “rÊraØgam to avoid persecution, R§m§nuja settled at MeÏkote, directed the restoration of the Tirun§r§yaÖa-sv§mÊ temple, and renewed his saÒny§saon the stone marking the renunciation of the great sage Datt§treya (also the tutelary deity of the Jån§akh§Ü§)who is listed as the twenty-fifth pr§durbhava(orvibhava) within a list of thirty-eight descents contained in the S§ttvata SaÒhit§(9.77–84)—copied almost verbatim in theAhirbudhnya SaÒhit§(5.50ff.), an important P§ñcar§tra text—one of the earli-est sources within the P§ñcar§tra tradition (Rigopoulos 1998:43). A continuity within the “rÊ-VaißÖava tradition with respect to Datt§treya is still evident. On January 31st 1971, the dying pontiff of the Yadugiri Yatir§ja Maãha at MeÏkoteofficially bestowed the title to the gaddÊof the maãhato a successor, in a ceremony performed at the Datt§treya temple. On the initiation day for the successor, the tridaÖ·awas handed over, and the kaá§ya(ochre-coloured) robe was placed at the feet of Datt§treya (Gnanambal 1977:140). 75In two of his hagiographies, the R§m§nuja-divya-carit§i and the Prapann§mÜtaof Anant§c§rya, it is said that R§m§nuja visited Jagann§tha at PurÊ and attempted, with the support of the king, to reform the worship in the temple and the lives of the priests, by introducing P§ñcar§tra rites.

He also fully accepted the P§ñcar§tra (Zydenbos 2001:113, 116), and wrote a short text,SaÒny§sa-paddhati, on rules for renunciates.77It is apparent that “aØkara was a vaißÖava who seems to have been significantly informed by P§ñcar§tra—as were R§m§nuja and Madhva—yet“aØkara’s hagiographers project him as an ‘orthodox’ (Vedic)áaiva. In the following chapter, it is proposed that “aØkara’s early hagiographies projected him as a áaiva in the image of their Vijayanagara patrons who, beginning in the mid-fourteenth century, patronised what was essentially a ‘reformed’, ‘orthodox’ áaiva tradition that includedadvaitaáaiva maãha-s and Vedic scholarship. In the follow-ing section we will see that the writers of the earlier hagiographies do not clearly mention either “aØkara’s founding of a renunciate order and R§m§nuja was magically removed by Lord Jagann§tha to “rÊ Kårmam, a áaiva temple in Andhra Pradesh. The incident is also briefly mentioned in the temple chronicle,M§daÏ§ PañjÊ(Dash 1978:159–160). Lord Jagann§tha and Balabhadra wear the “rÊ-VaißÖavatilak on their foreheads.76By title, there are three types of renunciates in contemporary “rÊ-VaißÖavism: jÊyar,§Ö·avanandek§Øgin.ThejÊyar-s and §Ö·avan-s are former Brahman householders who have become saÒny§sÊ-s;ek§Øgin-s are important in the historical development of“rÊ-VaißÖavism, but are unrecognised these days in works on or of “rÊ-VaißÖa-vas. With the exception of the ek§ØginBrahmans at Tirupati, ek§Øgin-s came to be regarded generally as low-caste, even though they at one time enjoyed great power and prestige in vaißÖavatemples. Ek§Öginmay be equated with the ek§ntinBh§gavatas, and while “rÊraØgam Brahman authorities state that ek§Øgindesignates a non-twice-born renunciate, it is unclear from the “rÊraØgam chronicles whether the ek§Öginis Brahman or non-Brahman. However, a mid-fifteenth century inscription in the Tirumalai-Tirupati temple contains the earliest reference to S§ttada“rÊ-VaißÖa-vas, who are identified as persons living a life of renunciation (either as ek§kinor ek§Øgin), and as disciples of Kand§·ai R§m§nuja Ayyangar, who refers to himself asparama ek§Øgin, a title suspiciously close to that used by the P§ñcar§tra VaißÖavas.

Most of “aØkara’s hagiographies include the inauguration of a devÊshrine at “ÜØgerÊ,78 and non-Tantric devÊworship at K§ñcÊ.DevÊworship is apparent in the hagiographies of “aØkara, but in a non-Tantric, Vedic (sm§rta)form: radical áaivaopponents are defeated. The hagiographical tra-dition of devÊworship is embodied in the Maãh§mn§ya-s, but we also find there deities such as Bhadrak§lÊ (=Durg§), the tutelary deity of the “§rad§pÊãha. However, we have seen that worship of deities such as Bhadrak§lÊ seems to have been considered by “aØkara as of the lowest order of worship. It is proposed that the Maãh§mn§ya-s represent the final stage of a process whereby radical ‘Tantric’ n§g§áaivaascetics were integrated with a monastic order of ‘reformed’ áaiva-s, into the Daáan§mÊs.5.4 PÊãha-s,maãha-s, and the installation of disciples in the hagiographies The paucity of references in the hagiographies to the founding of maãha-s and the establishing of an ascetic order is striking,79 the most obvious explanation being that, during the period that they were composed, the “aØkaramaãha-s did not have the prominence they now enjoy. There also appears to be no inscriptional evidence connecting“aØkara with any maãha-s prior to 1652, indicating that the idea of his founding monastic centres was not widespread before that time.80 The hagiographies indicate that the notion that “aØkara founded a sect may not have been prevalent for another century.The earliest hagiography to mention the founding of a maãhais78SarasvatÊ is installed at “ÜØgerÊ in five of the hagiographies: A“V, C“V, T“A, “DV, GVK (Bader 2000:75).79The“DV has already been discussed, while the V“V, G“C, R“A (Group B) and T“A make no mention of succession, nor of the founding of monastic centres. Ungemach (1992:27) also remarks that the legend of “aØkara founding four maãha-s under four disciples is not stated in any hagiography.80The first inscription that specifically identifies “aØkara as the founder of a maãhaappears to be one dated 1652.

He placed Padmap§da82in charge. “aØkara then proceeds to K§ñcÊpuram (sec. 63), instigates the construction of two towns in the vicinity, consecrates a temple to the devÊK§m§kßÊ, and installs a árÊ-cakra.He establishes a lineage of disciples, which would last until the end of the eon, in various cities, the first of which was the seat of learning (vidy§pÊãha) at K§ñcÊ(sec. 67). No other maãhais specifically mentioned in this text, which is the one recognised by the proponents of the K§ñcÊmaãhaas the most authoritative biography of “aØkara. Besides the A“V, which only mentions maãha-s and worship at K§ñcÊ and “ÜØgerÊ, only two hagiographers, Cidvil§sa (C“V) and LakßmaÖa-“§strÊ (GVK), mention the founding of four maãha-s.8381References are to the Madras edition of the A“V, edited by Veezhinathan (see Anant§nanda Giri 1971).82Sureávara, according to the Calcutta edition of this text, which also only men-tions the establishing of a lineage of disciples in “ÜØgerÊ, and does not mention any maãhafounded at any other place (Bader 2000:235). This discrepancy between the two editions of the A“V has been one of the contentious points fuelling the ongo-ing controversy concerning the legitimacy of the K§ñcÊpÊãha, discussed previously. Another point of contention is that the Madras—but not the Calcutta—edition of the A“V also mentions “aØkara’s receipt from “iva of five crystal liØga-s (A“Vsec. 55, 66, 74), three of which were established by himself at Ked§ra (mukti-liØga), NÊlakaÖãha (near Kathmandu) (vara-liØga), and “ÜØgerÊ (bhoga-liØga). The fourth (yoga-liØga) and fifth (mokßa-liØga) were given to Sureávara, the former to be worshipped by him, and the latter to be sent to Cidambaram.83See also Ungemach (1992:27). However, despite the fact that there is no mention at all in the “DV of the founding of four maãha-s, the tradition of “aØkara founding four maãha-s (in the four quarters of India) is so prevalent that one may even find this myth perpetuated in recent scholarship. Malinar (2001:93) states that “The philosopher “aØkara is claimed as the founder of the monastic institutions (maãha) of the Daáan§mÊ orders and of the Advaita samprad§ya.This position is elaborated and continuously re-created in numerous hagiographies.” This asser-tion is apparently incorrect. Further, Malinar focuses almost solely on the “DV, which contains no mention of the founding of either Daáan§mÊ orders or four (or any)maãha-s. Similarly, Isayeva (1993:81) maintains, incorrectly, that “Most of the biographers are of the opinion that the main monasteries, which were founded by“aØkara...were established in the following order: Dv§rak§, BadarÊn§tha, PurÊ,“ÜØgerÊ and K§ñcÊ”, and that (p. 88) “The hagiographies enumerate ten Hindumonasteries founded by “aØkara, as well as ten monastic orders of sanny§sins”. Isayeva (1993:82, fn.10) also maintains, but with no supporting evidence, that each of the ‘ten names’ corresponds to one particular monastery, and that “to five other monasteries were assigned the monastic orders of TÊrtha, PurÊ, VaÖa, Parvata and S§gara”.clark_BIL25a.indd 1715/30/2006 2:01:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"chapter five172Jagann§th and Dv§rak§ figure in the digvijayaof“aØkara in only three hagiographies, and the popular tradition of dispatching disciples to the four quarters appears also in only the C“V and GVK (Bader 2000:160–161). We have noted that Antarkar tentatively fixes the date of the C“V around the sixteenth century, though acknowledging that fixing a date for this text is difficult.84 The GVK is known to have been composed at the behest of an incumbent of the “aØkara maãha at “ÜØgerÊ, Sv§mÊ Saccid§nandabh§ratÊ (on the gaddÊfrom 1705–1741),85 and records the traditions of the time (c.1735–1740).86The founding of the monastic centres follows the account of Cidvil§sa(C“V), who appears to have been the first hagiographer to mention fourmaãha-s.Cidvil§sa extols “ÜØgerÊ (C“V 24.31–33a),87 where the first maãha (called“rÊ maãha) is established by “aØkara, who installs Sureávara in that seat of learning. “aØkara is then said to establish other maãha-s: near the Jagann§tha temple in the east (presided over by Padmap§da);in the “western quarter” (where he installed Hast§malaka); and “in the northern quarter he had a heavenly maãhabuilt” (where he installed Toãaka) (C“V 30.10–31.29). While there are specific references in the text to “ÜØgerÊ and Jagann§th, and though the GomatÊ (river) is mentioned by name as a tÊrtha(C“V 30.4) in connection with the western quarter, there is no mention in the text of either Dv§rak§or BadarÊ(n§tha) as the place of the founding of a maãha. In the GVK, besides the specific references to the “ÜØgerÊ and Jagann§tha maãha-s—also found in C“V—there are specific references (3.59–62) to the maãha-s at Dv§rak§ and BadarÊ.88 The appointment of dis-84Antarkar (1973:2) supplies several references—five to kings—from the C“Vthat may at some time help to establish more precisely its date. Antarkar has not been able to deduce any dates from these references: 1. Bhadrasena of Rudr§khya-nagar, near Pray§g (ch. 16); 2. VÊrasena, near the bank of the TuØgabhadr§ river, “ÜØgerÊmaãha(ch. 24); 3. R§jasena, king of of K§ñcÊ (ch. 25); 4. Bhojasingh, king of Cidambar (chs. 26 and 27); 5. Ratnasingh, king of BadarÊ (ch. 31); 6. R§mar§ja of Anantaáayana (ch. 28). Bader (2000:38–40) largely corroborates Antarkar’s findings, but concerning an earliest date for the C“V, he notes (p. 197) that some sections of the C“V featuring debates between MaÖ·anamiára and “aØkara appear to have been lifted from the P§r§áara-m§dhavÊya (1340–1360). 85Miára ($miã K§lrekh§2001:25).86This is the first text giving a guru-paraÒpar§for the “ÜØgerÊmaãha.87All references to the C“V are to the text edited by Antarkar (1973).

However, according to all the Maãh§mn§ya-s, Dv§rak§ is the first of the four maãha-s to have been founded,91atradition that is clearly different from that embodied in the hagi-ographies. Given that the GVK is relatively late (c.1740), the only other source of the tradition of the founding of four maãha-s amongst any of the earlier hagiographies of “aØkara is the C“V, which, as we have seen, is partially incomplete, and which may be assigned to the sixteenth century.5.5 The first references to the ‘ten names’Amongst the eight hagiographies of “aØkara scrutinised by Bader, the only one to mention the establishing of ten lineages is the C“V(24.36–37a).92 This is said to occur while “aØkara is residing at “ÜØgerÊ, but no more information is supplied. The only other hagi- p§d§bhyudaya, mentions, besides the four places in connection with the founding of maãha-s, also K§ñcÊ, but that this text post-dates the GVK.89Regarding our previous discussion of the Sumeru maãhaat Banaras: the GVK (3.23) also refers to “aØkara contemplating five maãha-s when he was in Banaras, four for his disciples and one for himself. However, after this fleeting reference, no more is said of the fifth maãha(Antarkar 2001:23).90See Bader (2000:98). The A“V does not mention Toãaka, who is usually counted, along with Sureávara, Padmap§da and Hast§malaka, as one of the four chief disciples.

In this passage V§sudev§árama is citing an earlier work, the YatidharmasaÒgrahaof ViáveávarasarasvatÊ(pp. 102–103).95 ViáveávarasarasvatÊ was the teacher of the illustrious advaita philosopher, MadhusådanasarasvatÊ (1540–1647), who is the person believed by some to have authorised the acceptance of n§g§lineages within the Daáan§mÊ order.96 Given Viáveávara’s relationship 93Michaels (2004:126) also notes that a connection between “aØkara and the Daáan§mÊs appears to have been made after the 15th/16th centuries, as there is no mention of this in the earlier hagiographies. 94Discussing the procedure of conferring the meditation shawl (yogapaããa)—whichmeans initiation into saÒny§sa—V§sudev§árama explains (66.3–4) that the the cloth is held over the pupil, who, with the guru, other pupils and relatives, recites the chapter of the BhagavadgÊt§calledViávaråpa, up to the words “...enjoy a prosperous kingdom”. (Note that here also a vaißÖavatext is recited.) “Then the guru should give him a name that is approved by all.

The V§r§Ö may be dated to the first quarter of the seventeenth century (Jodh Singh 1998, Vol.1:1–5). It states (V§r8,pau·Ê13 [varÖa]): “Many are yogeávars(great yogis) and many are sannyasis.

A copper-plate inscription of 1635/6 from the Jagann§th temple in Hanum§n4hoka palace square in Kathmandu99 employs the phrase daáan§ma sany§sÊreferring to several individuals with the surnames ‘Giri’, ‘PurÊ’ and ‘Bh§ratÊ’.100That the notion of saÒny§sÊ-s with ten names was established by the seventeenth century101 may be gleaned from a report in the Dabist§n, composed in 1645, where it is reported (Dabist§n, 1843, Vol. 2:139) that the saÒny§sÊ-s are of ten names.102 Our chronicler accurately describes, perhaps for the first time, the division of the saÒny§sÊ-s into the two main branches of the Daáan§mÊ-SaÒny§sÊs, the monastic and n§g§. It is suggested that perhaps a century or so before this report, the ten names—comprising two branches—became established: to my knowledge, there is no earlier reference.103 In the 97SaÖni§sÊ das n§m dhari.98Trans Jodh Singh (1998, Vol. 1:214).99See Vajr§c§rya (1976:198, no. 10). 100Day§la Bh§ratÊ, Renuk§ BharatÊ, R§ma Giri, Nirañjana PurÊ, B§la Giri, “aØkaran§th Gad§dhara Giri, Bhagav§n Bh§ratÊ, Purna Giri, Ayodhy§ Giri, Kula Giri, Purußottama Giri.101Kane (HD“, Vol. 1, part 2:815) notes a reference to the ten names in the SmÜtimukt§phalaof Vaidyan§tha-DÊkßita, a text he dates to c.1700.102“...Ban, A’ran, TÊrthah, A’shram, Kar (Giri?), Parbatah, S§kar, Bh§rthy, PerÊand SarsatÊ.

This claim is based primarily on a Sanskrit inscription, said to be dated to 1142 (V.S. 1199, Nev§rÊ SaÒvat 262), which is on a slab of stone now lying in the grounds of the Government Museum in Kath-mandu. The text of the inscription is reprinted by both Regmi (1966:13–16) and •aÖ·an (1986:27–29), though the renderings of many of the lines and phrases of the inscription are substantially different in the two versions.I have some doubts about both the dating of the inscription and its supposed provenance. Firstly, although Regmi (1966:13) states that the date figures of the inscription are lost, •aÖ·an (1986:27), in his preamble to the inscription, states that the date of the inscription is N.S. 262. I have been unable to ascertain how this was established, given that the date of the inscription is apparently unreadable. Secondly, given the discussion earlier in this chapter of “aØkara’s religious orienta-tion, it would seem improbable that one of his followers would be teaching yoga and Tantra, rather than advaita-Ved§nta.However, the Amaradaki [=$maradaka?]maãha, a “aiva-Siddh§ntin institution that was particularly influential in south India during the twelfth century (see Ch.6, fn. 39, 40) contributed to the development of the temple movement, was associ-ated with Tantra, and supplied áaiva-§c§rya-s who inititiated many regents from the eleventh to thirteenth centuries. It seems possible that if the inscription does indeed date from the twelfth century, as maintained by •aÖ·an (1986:27) and Vajr§c§rya (1980:209ff.), then it may perhaps relate to a “aiva-Siddh§ntin rather than a saÒny§sÊ.In support of this suggestion, firstly, it may be noted that in an incomplete sen-tence in v. 6 of the inscription Durv§sa is mentioned (though in which capacity it is difficult to discern accurately from the fragment). According to several Tantra-s, Durv§sa is the preceptor of the Amaradakimaãha(ARE 1917, part II, para. 37 [1986:124]). Secondly, although •aÖ·an (1986) and Michaels (1994:117ff.) believe that this inscription signals the arrival of saÒny§sÊ-s in the Kathmandu valley, I havebeen unable to see how such a conclusion could be derived from it. Although (pos-sibly) a teacher named “aØkara— approached by pupils—is referred to in v. 9, no reference is made to either a saÒny§sÊ, a daáan§mÊ or a “aØkar§c§rya. Also, in Ch. 4.1 it was pointed out that “aØkara was a relatively common name in the mediaeval period, and that the mention of someone named “aØkara does not necessarily refer to the author of the Brahma-såtra-bh§ßyaor a “aØkar§c§rya.That the Amaradakimaãhawas in south India, yet supplied a preceptor to a Nepalese king would not be improbable: there was considerable religious and cultural contact between the two regions from the twelfth century onwards, and since either the twelfth or the fifteenth century the priests (and their assistants) of the Paáupatin§th temple at Kathmandu have come from south India (Michaels 1994:116–132). Also, the Amaradakimaãhawas connected to the GÙÏakÊmaãha,which had a significant institutional presence in K§áÊ. Notwithstanding a tradition amongst the so-called Bhaããa-priests of Kathmandu that the worship of Paáupati and their priesthood were instigated by “aØkar§c§ry§, it has been suggested that if there were áaivaascetics in the Kathmandu valley during the twelfth to fifteenth centuries, then they were most probably “aiva-Siddh§ntins rather than saÒny§sÊ-s (i.e. followers of “aØkar§c§rya). clark_BIL25a.indd 1765/30/2006 2:01:11 PM"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"the rise and influence of advaita maãha-s177CHAPTER SIXTHE RISE AND INFLUENCE OF ADVAITA MA•HA-SIn order to consider the relative importance and influence of advaita maãha-s within the context of religious developments in India from the early to the late mediaeval period, a brief survey of the develop-ment of early “aivism will first be presented. The processes will then be considered whereby several forms of “aivism gradually came to replace Buddhism and Jainism as the dominant forms of religion in the south. This was primarily due to state patronage. The religious orientation of various rulers and prominent Ved§ntins is discussed, and the initiation of kings by r§ja-guru-s. A more detailed analysis of the institution and funding of áaiva maãha-s up to the Vijayanagara period follows. The central thrust of this chapter is to illustrate how a new monastic tradition was founded by the early found-ers of the Vijayanagara empire, a tradition which also represented a ‘new’ orthodox sm§rta form of advaita“aivism, primarily repre-sented in Ved§nta tradition and philosophy. It was only much later that “aØkara—ideally situated as an orthodox advaita-ved§ntin—was projected onto that new monastic project, which originally seems to have had nothing to do with the §c§rya. Although the work of many scholars of the period has been utilised in this chapter, the argument that a ‘new’ orthodox áaiva tradition was established is essentially novel.6.1 The P§áupatasWe will first consider the earliest known sect of áaiva-s in India, the P§áupatas. In what many scholars believe to be one of the later addi-tions to the Mah§bh§rata (XII, 349.64), there are references to different doctrines (jñ§na) and sects (mata) prevalent at the time (c.300–500): the P§áupata-s, S§Òkhya, Yoga, P§ñcar§tra and Vaidika.In the Pur§Öa-s, the vaißÖava P§ñcar§tras are sometimes condemned, but it is the P§áupatas who are considered to be the most subversive. The P§áupatas can be regarded as the prototypes of “aivite ascetics, covering their body with ashes and sectarian markings, emphasising clark_BIL25a.indd 1775/30/2006 2:01:11 PM"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"chapter six178yoga, and often criticised for anti-social behaviour. “aivite sects, which seem to have developed in the early centuries BCE, all attribute their origin to the P§áupatas—the oldest recognisable “aivite sect—who worshipped Bhairava, the fierce form of “iva (Maheávara). The first textual references to “aivism are found in Patañjali’s Mah§bh§ßyaon P§Öini’s grammar, probably written in the second century BCE (Dyczkowski 1989:4). Patañjali (5.2.76)1 refers to “ivabhagat-s, whom he describes as itinerant ascetics wearing animal skins and carrying an iron lance.The P§áupata doctrine2 is attributed to L§kulÊáa (or N§kulÊáa), ‘The Lord of the Staff ’, who was considered to be an incarnation of “iva. His teachings, according to tradition, had been revealed by “rÊkaÖãha,the consort of Um§ (Chakraborti 1970:8; Pathak 1960:4–8). He is believed to have come from Baroda (Gujarat) and to have lived in the early centuries. However, it is far from certain that P§áupata“aivismbegan with him, as there is a tradition which admits the existence of P§áupata teachers prior to L§kulÊáa (Dyczkowski 1989:20). There were other groups of ascetics also known as P§áupatas, and it is prob-able that P§áupata became a general name for a number of sects. The earliest surviving texts of the sect are the P§áupatasåtra,with the Pañc§rtha-bh§ßyaof KauÖ·inya, which may be dated to around the fourth to the sixth centuries (Dyczkowski 1989:21).3 P§áupata texts inform us that the P§áupata ascetic should be a Brahman, and it was prohibited for him to address women or áådra-s except under special circumstances.4 However, no Brahmanical rite is recommended, and many of its rituals seem to have been entirely non-Vedic (Dasgupta 1975, Vol. 5:142).5 P§áupata philosophy appears to have been a 1Ed. Kielhorn (1906, Vol. 2:387).2P§áupata doctrine and the yoga doctrine of PatañjalÊ bear distinct affinities (see Hara 1999). 3For the chronology of the P§áupatasåtraand its commentaries, see Hara (1994).4Ingalls (1962:291–297) believes that P§áupata actions were far more lecherous than KauÖ·inya’s gloss suggests.5Dasgupta (1975, Vol. 5:130) remarks that the texts do not give us any phi-losophy of “aivism but rather deal almost wholly with rituals, or rather modes of life. It is quite possible that áaivaphilosophy was added to extant ascetic practices, as in the Sarva-daráana-saÒgrahaof M§dhava the P§áupata system is not identified with any form of philosophy, but with different kinds of ascetic practices.clark_BIL25a.indd 1785/30/2006 2:01:12 PM"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"the rise and influence of advaita maãha-s179relatively late accretion to a radically antinomian lifestyle, which included: wearing filthy garments; use of violent and indecent lan-guage; imitation of animals; feigning madness; spitting; defecation; and public sex acts. The P§áupatas specified five levels of attainment,6the second level being distinctively P§áupata, whereby the initiate behaves in a manner (such as being mad, or like a dog) likely to cause censure and reprimand, courting disfavour, thereby relieving the initiate’s previously accumulated bad karma. The P§áupata goal wasmokßa, but also to be free to act at will.The P§áupatas are thought to have survived in two major factions, the K§p§likas7 and the K§l§mukhas. The K§p§likas were a radical and itinerant “aivite sect famed for their carrying of a human skull, their immoral behaviour and their reputation for practising human sacrifice. They are believed to have been the instigators of Tant-ric ritual (White 1998), and are referred to in early (fifth or sixth cent.) Tantric literature (Lorenzen 1972:52). While the K§p§likas repre sented the most heterodox aspects of “aivism, the K§l§mukhas represented the more orthodox aspects, inaugurating temples and col-leges in south India. Despite differences in practice, the K§l§mukhas maintained a doctrine very similar to that of the P§áupatas. We will be returning to these áaivasects, after first examining the causes of the rise of various forms of “aivism in the south.6.2 Maãha-s and competing religious traditions in south India, 600–1500 CEAfter the seventh century, there was a general decline in the influ-ence of both Jainism and Buddhism in south India, with relatively few references to Buddhism in literature and inscriptions, although, as previously noted, Buddhism survived in some centres up until the thirteenth century. Jainism nevertheless still maintained some influ-6See Ingalls (1962); Davidson (2002:183–184). There are distinct parallels between the P§áupatas and the Greek Cynics, both of which Ingalls believes had shamanic roots. The Cynics first appeared in the fourth century BCE and exerted considerable influence until the fifth century.7In Hala’s Prakrit poem, the G§th§saptaáati(third to fifth century) there is one of the earliest references to the K§p§likas (Dyczkowski 1989:26).clark_BIL25a.indd 1795/30/2006 2:01:13 PM"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"chapter six180ence in the south for several centuries, and between the eighth and tenth centuries several new monastic orders were established in the Bangalore and Mysore districts. Royal and private charters registering land grants, and control over local tolls, raised the position of the Jaina pontiff almost to the position of a landlord, giving the maãha considerable status in the local area. The adoration of the preceptor of Jaina maãha-s developed into a cult during this period, numerous burial stones being erected by lay and monastic disciples, to which ritual worship was offered (Nandi 1973:108–113, 170; Champaka-lakshmi 1996:345; Davidson 2002:90). Buddhism and Jainism were being challenged by the growing popu-larity of vaißÖava bhakti (centred on the $l..v§rs) and, more importantly, áaiva bhakti8 (centred on the N§yaÖ§rs).9 Both Jainism and Buddhism had previously been patronised by the non-Tamil C§Ïukyas, but the adoption of “aivism by the succeeding Tamil P§Ö·ya and Pal-lava dynasties entailed a loss of patronage for those religions, and the active promotion of “aivism by the ruling elites of the Deccan and south India.10 The expansion of the powerful Tamil kingdom of the Pallavas under Mahendravarman I (580–630)11 and his son NarasiÒhavarman I (630–668) coincided with the anti-Buddhist and anti-Jainabhaktimovement and the rise of a strong sense of Tamil 8One of the most important centres of the early south Indian bhaktasaints was K§ñcÊpuram, a place also associated with the early career of R§m§nuja (13th century).9In the Tamil region, three áaiva poet-saints, Tirun§Öacampantar, Tirun§vuk-karacar and Cuntaramårti, popularly known as Campantar (or N§Öacam pantar), Appar and Cuntarar (sixth to eighth centuries), are recognised as the principal ‘leaders’ (n§yaÖar), or the ‘First Three Saints’, of the sixty-three N§yaÖ§rs.In a later classification, M§Öikkav§cakar (ninth century?), the author of the Tiruv§cakam(‘SacredUtterances’) is included with the other three poets, as ‘Preceptors of the Faith’(camayakuravar) or ‘The Four’ (n§lvar). Their vernacular poems were incorporated into theT¿v§ram, also known as ‘The Complete Canon’ (aãaØkaÖmuÜai) which comprises seven books and forms the bulk of the primary sacred texts of Tamil “aivism. In the eleventh century the works of the ‘First Three Saints’ were compiled into the seven-volumeTirumuÜai(‘Sacred Utterances’), which served as primary scripture for this branch of “aivism. It seems that the entire canon (which, amongst otherworks, also includes the Tirumantiramas Book X; see below) was not completed until the thirteenth century (Peterson 1991:12–15).10Buddhism survived for longer in the outlying regions of the east and north (Davidson 2002:90).11According to tradition, Mahendravarman was converted from Jainism to “aivism by the poet-saint Appar (Peterson 1991:9). For a brief resumé of the king’s literary activity, see Unni (1998:1–7).clark_BIL25a.indd 1805/30/2006 2:01:13 PM"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"the rise and influence of advaita maãha-s181identity.12 While all the Pallavas worshipped the trimårti(Brahm§,VißÖu and “iva), it was “aivism that witnessed a remarkable growth, particularly during the reign of NarasiÒhavarman II (or R§jasiÒha, c.690/91–c.728/29) (Mahalingam 1969:123–124).13The anti-social practices integral to both Jaina and Buddhist ide-ologies (such as their prohibitions on contact with women, and their generally negative attitude to art, literature and music), and the alien and artificial literary style of Jaina Tamil may also have been sig-nificant contributory factors in the decline of Jainism and Buddhism after the seventh century (Zvelebil 1973:192–197). In the early bhakti hymns of theT¿v§ram (the collective title for the N§yaÖ§rs’ hymns)14particular emphasis is given to the temple15 and ritual worship.16However, it is apparent that the so-called bhaktimovement of south India was mainly represented by Brahman and kßatriyapoets, and was not in any way a low-caste phenomenon articulating class-struggle or social protest, even though the ethos of the bhakta-s could be described as social negativism (Zvelebil 1973:192–197).1712It may also be noted that the bhaktimovements contributed significantly to the cult of the book—notably Pur§Öa-s—in distinction to earlier oral traditions: texts came to be considered as protecting forces for domiciles, and particular merit could be accrued from copying a text (Brown 1986:76–78).13R§jasiÒha also seems to have continued supporting some Buddhist institutions. He is credited with the construction of a Buddhist vih§raat Nagapaããinam.14The collective title T¿v§ram(‘a text related to ritual worship’) was only given to the N§yaÖ§rs’ hymns in, perhaps, the sixteenth century. 15The three poets sang hymns to “iva as the god of shrines situated in 274 sacred places (five belonging to the Himalayas, the abode of “iva), the Tamil places creating a “aivite sacred geography (see Spencer 1970).16Besides the bhaktimovement, more radical forms of “aivism were also prevalent in the south. In the Tirumantiram, Tirumålar (eighth/ninth century), the great Tamil siddha and Tantric, describes four paths of “aivism, also called áuddha-siddh§ntaand ved§nta (Thirumular 1999:vv. 1419–1501). In desending order of accomplishment, fromjñ§natobhakti, are: jñ§nÊ-s, merging the “I in the you”; yogÊ-s, raising kuÖ·alinÊthrough the six centres, attaining siddhiandsam§dhi; those in kriy§,not missing daily worship; those in cary§(performance of rites and cermonies), who perform many pilgrimages. Those on the paths of kriy§andcary§ wear earrings, rudr§kßaaround the neck, and (presumably) the vÜßabha(bull) and trident mådra-s (seals). There is also a reference (v. 1449) to six schools of ved§nta-siddh§nta.This four-fold hierarchical scheme is the same as the four-fold division into ‘quarters’ (p§da) of both the “aiva $gamaand the P§ñcar§traSaÒhit§, and probably does not accurately reflect real socio-religious divisions.17An examination of the caste-origin of the bhaktipoets reveals that around 75% of the poet-saints were either of Brahman or kßatriyaorigin.

They also perpetuated the institution, begun by the Pallava kings before them, of employing singers of the hymns of the N§yaÖ§rs in ritual worship in the temples (Peterson 1991:14).18Although developments in the dominance and decline of vari-ous religious movements are being discussed, particularly concern-ing the rise of VaißÖavism and “aivism, it is important to consider the frequently syncretic nature of religion at a popular level. To give but one example for the period under discussion: in Bengal in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, it is apparent that, in the eyes of the laity, there was practically no distinction between ‘Pur§Öic’ Hinduism and Buddhism; people may have had ten Brahmanical saÒsk§ra-s performed by Brahmans, yet paid homage to the Buddha (Chakrabarty 2001:145).19 However, notwithstanding religious syncre-tism, sectarian conflicts nevertheless took place. The twelfth-century work of C¿kkiÏ§r, the Periya Pur§Öam (a hagiography of the sixty-three N§yaÖ§rs), contains a description of a major conflict between Jainas and “aivas, which occurred at Va·aãali, near Kumbhakonam, wherein the Jainas are accused of hiding a liØgaand are forced to leave by the local CÙÏa ruler. The Jainas appear to have suffered considerably at the hands of zealous áaiva-s.20 The period following practice members of a community of middle-class landlords. The remaining 10% are either low-caste or of unknown caste.18Although they promoted “aivism, the CÙÏas, and the Pallavas before them, were also supporters of Jainism. An inscription dated to 945, in the reign of the CÙÏa king MadiraikoÖ·a Parakesarivarman, records a gift of gold to a devotee at a (most probably) Jaina monastery, JinagiripaÏÏi. Other inscriptions during the reigns of the CÙÏas record various grants and land gifts. These include an inscription of c.1116 (from the reign of KulÙttuØga CÙÏa I), another, a few years later, from the reign of Vikrama CÙÏa, and an inscription dated 1199 records a gift of land to a Jaina temple (Desai 1957:34–35).19It is apparent that in mediaeval contexts, while texts may have been sectarian, ritual was frequently fluid, crossing Jaina, Buddhist, Muslim, Tantric, and sectar-ian ‘Hindu’ boundaries, creating shared patterns of worship. For evidence from the ninth to fourteenth centuries; see Granoff (2000:418–420); Orr (2000:24–25; 204, fn. 45).20One indication of this is an epigraph at “rÊáailam, Andhra Pradesh, dated to 1512, recounting the pious achievements of a VÊraáaiva chief, named LiØga, who took pride in cutting off the heads of “vet§mbara Jainas (Desai 1957:23).

This area, to the east of Goa, is known to have been home to around fifty Jaina, áaiva and Buddhist monasteries during that period.21 Although, as explained, áaiva-orientated sects are known to have existed since at least the early centuries BCE, áaiva monasteries22 were unknown before the eighth century (Nandi 1973:70–90; Swaminathan 1990:117).23 Between the eighth and tenth centuries, there are around thirty-five inscriptions for áaivamaãha-s, the earliest being for the “aiva-Siddh§ntins (see below), P§áupatas,24 K§p§likas,25and the K§l§mukhas26 of Mysore,27 all of is also a persistent tradition that Cuntarar was reponsible for the annihilation of 8,000 Jainas in Madurai (Nampi $Öã§r Nampi, $Ïuãaiya PiÏÏaiy§r Tiruvul§m§lai, 59 and 74; see Zvelebil 1973:106). During the reign of the KaÏacårya king Bijjala (12th century), the K§l§mukha Ek§natada R§mayya exterminated many Jainas at Ablår. K§l§mukhas desecrated dozens of Jaina basadi-s during that period, many of which can be identified, after defeating the Jainas ‘in debate’ (Settar 1999:77–79).21In Karnataka, nine other maãha-s were situated in the Bangalore area, while two Jaina maãha-s were in south Karnataka, one dating from the sixth century, the other from the tenth century. Four maãha-s (two áaiva and two Jaina) were situated in Tamil Nadu, and seven in Andhra Pradesh. Four maãha-s (Buddhist, áaiva and Jaina) were functioning in Orissa, around Bhubaneávara, while twoáaiva maãha-s were situated on the coast of Maharashtra, south of Mumbai. Four áaiva maãha-s are recorded in Madhya Pradesh.22There appear to have been few vaißÖava maãha-s before the rise of the “rÊ-VaißÖava movement under R§m§nuja in twelfth and thirteenth centuries. See Gurumurthy (1979:17, 73), who lists four, the earliest being the Govindapadi maãha founded in North Arcot in 969. 23One of the earliest references to a maãhain inscriptions is in the Tirum¿ÜÜali inscription (of uncertain date) of Dantivarman Pallava (r.796–847) (Swaminathan 1990:117).24The earliest inscription referring to P§áupatas is dated 943, found at Hem§vati,Sira T§luk§, Mysore. Another important inscription, referring to “iva becoming incarnate as L§kulÊáa, is found at EkliØgji, near Udaipur, Rajasthan, dated 1028 (Bhandarkar 1995:166). There was also an important P§áupata centre in U·upi, on the Kanataka coast in South Kanara district, supported by the $Ïupa chiefs. The P§áupatas were also influential in the area around Pal..aiy§r. .ai (south Tamil Nadu) during the CÙÏa period. R§jendra I built a temple there for one of his queens that was used by P§áupatas. The D§r§suram temple in the same town contains 108 sculptured figures of P§áupataáaiv§c§rya-s (Champakalakshmi 1996:346).25The earliest occurence of the word kap§lin(one who bears a skull) is probably clark_BIL25a.indd 1835/30/2006 2:01:15 PM"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"chapter six184whom had established maãha-s in the south by around the middle of the tenth century.The influence of the P§áupatas appears to have been extensive. Davidson (2002:184–186, 341–343) has identified over one hundred P§áupata sites, all over India, dating from the fifth to the twelfth century, and remarks that no comprehensive study has yet been undertaken, which would doubtless reveal more sites.28 It appears (Davidson 2002:85) that Buddhist missionary activity was effectively supplanted by the P§áupatas.29 The P§áupatas and K§l§mukhas, besides promoting their §gama-s, were both associated with Ny§ya-Vaiáeßika philosophy.30By the tenth century there were áaiva maãha-s all over the Deccan, that in the Y§jñavalkya SmÜtiIII.243 (c.100–300). Further references to K§p§likas occur in the Maitr§yaÖÊya Upanißad, and various literary texts from the third to the fifth centuries onwards. The earliest inscriptional evidence is provided by Jaina inscriptions, one at “ravaÖa BeÏgoÏa (dated 960–974), and the other from Tirumakå·al-Narsipur Taluk in Mysore District (Lorenzen 1991:12–24). There is a copper-plate charter dated to 639, granting a village near Igatpuri, Maharashtra, for the worship of the god K§p§leávara (Bhandarkar 1995:168), though this does not indicate a maãha.26The earliest mention of the K§l§mukha sect is in a R§ßãrakåãa grant of 807 (Nandi 1973:85). By the mid-tenth century the eastern Deccan (Telugu speaking) had become a stronghold of the K§l§mukhas. They rose to prominence during the 11th, 12th and early 13th centuries (see Lorenzen 1991:97–172).27The K§l§mukhamaãha-s at Mayil§ppår and TiruvoÜÜiyår (in the Chennai area) and Tiruv§ãutuÜai appear to have an ancient history, and may date from the ninth or tenth centuries (Nilakanta Sastri 1992:117–118; Champakalakshmi 1996:385 fn. 65).28By the seventh century P§áupatas were associated, as teachers, with the court of Bhavavarma II, and during the eighth and ninth centuries P§áupata“aivism was well established in Cambodia.29As late as 900, even Buddhist monarchs respected P§áupata missionaries. In art, L§kulÊáa is usually depicted in the image of the Buddha.30Haribhadra (eighth century), in his ‘a··aráanasamuccaya(vv. 13, 59), mentions thatnaiy§yika-s and vaiáeßika-s are áaiva-s, while GuÖaratna (late fourteenth century; one of Haribhadra’s commentators) states that the naiy§yika-s are áaiva-s, and the vaiáeßika-s are p§áupata-s (Nandi 1973:84). Bhandarkar (1995:167) comments that the identification of naiy§yika-s with áaiva-s must be a mistake, as Bharadv§ja of the Ny§ya school is specifically referred to as a p§áupat§c§rya. Uddyotakara (c.500), an important Ny§ya philosopher, worshipped the Supreme Lord as “iva, in accordance with the practice of the P§áupatas, while Praáastap§da (c.500), an influential Vaiáeßikaphilosopher, was a Maheávaraáaiva(Hirst 1993:121). There are indications that bothnaiy§yika-s and vaiáeßika-s were associated with the P§áupatas, but the precise reference that several mediaeval commentators (including Haribhadra) make in regard to áaiva-s and p§áupata-s is often hard to determine.clark_BIL25a.indd 1845/30/2006 2:01:16 PM"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"the rise and influence of advaita maãha-s185the greatest concentration being around DharvaÜ (central Karnataka). By the end of the CÙÏa period (early thirteenth century), nearly every temple in south India in the region governed by them had one or moremaãha-s functioning in close proximity to it (Nilakanta Sastri 1955:650; Suthanthiran 1986:192). From the early thirteenth cen-tury, numerous áaiva maãha-s were established by devotees of what had become a canon of áaivasaints.31 Besides being educational institutions which were frequently in receipt of grants and donations (vidy§d§na) to further educational activities,32 the maãha-s were also often involved in charitable activities, including feeding arrangements for pilgrims and the poor, and in some cases setting up hospitals and maternity centres.33 The early maãha-s were but a few rooms attached to temples, but by the tenth century there were separate buildings for the residents.During the latter half of the first millennium, it became common practice for regents to take initiation (dÊkß§) from áaivagurus, whose general influence was similtaneously enhanced by the growing popu-larity of devotional “aivism amongst the population in some parts of India. In the south many kings, from the C§Ïukya, Hoysala, CÙÏa, GaØga, CedÊ, Y§dava, and subsequently the Vijayanagara dynas-ties, were initiated by áaivapreceptors—effectively undergoing a spiritual rebirth—usually in return for which substantial properties were donated, with revenue to be derived from the holdings.34Kings 31See Rajamanickam (1964:231–250).32Amongst subjects studied were Veda,Mah§bh§rata, R§m§yaÖa, the eighteen Pur§Öa-s,yogaá§stra, systems of philosophy, logic (tarka), grammar (vy§karaÖa), poetry (k§vya), dramaturgy (n§ãaka), and sciences connected with literature (s§hitya) (Guru-murthy 1979:14; Swaminathan 1990:118). For educational subjects and salaries in maãha-s during the CÙÏa period, see Nilakanta Sastri (1955:628–634).33Gurumurthy (1979:14); Suthanthiran (1986:192); Swaminathan (1990:117).34Vikram§ditya I of the C§Ïukya dynasty of B§d§mÊ had as many as three áaivapreceptors, the first, “rÊ Sudaráan§c§rya, performing the áiva maÖ·ala dÊkß§,for which he was granted a village in 660. Another of his gurus, “rÊ Megh§c§rya, also received a village in the same year. An inscription of 1039 reveals that the K§l§mukha, Kriy§áakti PaÖ·ita Deva, was r§ja-guruof the Western C§Ïukya, (Jaya) SiÒha Deva. Sarveávaraáakti Deva—an §c§ryaof seventy-seven temples—was r§ja-guruof another C§Ïukyan monarch, Someávara Deva, in 1070. In 1129 Someávara Deva Bhålokamalla made a grant to the r§ja-guru, Vamaáakti PaÖ·ita, the greatest of theK§l§mukha gurus, who also received a grant, in 1156, from BijjaÖa Devarasa of the Kal..acuriyas, over whom the guru had considerable influence.Vamaáakti was also most probably the r§ja-guruof the Hoysala king, VÊra, receiv-ing a village from a grant made in 1193.

We will now consider the available evidence on this influential role of the “aiva-Siddh§nta and K§l§mukha sects.It is apparent that the CÙÏar§ja-guru-s (§c§rya) were held in enormous 1191, that Kriyaáakti Deva was also the r§ja-guruof the Hoysala ruler NarasiÒha Deva. The r§ja-guru-s of the Hoysalas seem to have come from $sandi-n§·, where there were five maãha-s, the priests from there being known as KampaÖ§c§ryas. As recorded in 1245, the Y§dava (or SeuÖa) rulers had Rudraáakti Deva, from the Koteávara (or Koãin§tha) temple of Kuppaãår, as their K§l§mukhar§ja-guru(Saletore 1935; Nandi 1973:101–102; Settar 1999).CÙÏa regents, from R§jar§ja to KulottuØga (c.1000–1200), were initiated by a long line of “aiva-Siddh§ntin§c§rya-s, many of whom came from north or central India (Laãa, Gau·a and Madhya regions). Their ‘surnames’ were all -áiva (and often-áiva-paÖ·ita) and they were authors of a number of texts (Rajamanickam 1964:228–231; Nagaswamy 1998).King Devendravarman of the eastern GaØga dynasty was initiated into “aivism by PataØgaáiv§c§rya, who received a village as dakßiÖ§.The K§l§mukha, Vidyeávara, was acknowledged as the preceptor of the eastern C§Ïukya, Amma II (Vijay§ditya VI), who donated four villages to his sect. Kum§ra Sv§mÊ was the preceptor of another regent of the eastern C§Ïukyas, Yuddhamalla II, who built a monastery for the exclusive use of áaivamonks and preceptors.The preceptor of the CedÊ king, Yuvar§jadeva, was Sadbh§va“ambhu, who received a large province as bhikß§(‘charitable donation’).King GaÖapatideva of the K§katÊya dynasty was ordained by his preceptor, Viáveávara“ambhå (Sale-tore 1935; Nandi 1973:101–102; Settar 1999). The eastern C§Ïukyas were also, from the beginning and throughout their rule, active patrons of Jainism. The early K§katÊyas, based in Warangal, supported Jainism at the beginning of their reign (Desai 1957:19–22). 35Ther§ja-gurushould perform a special abhißekaritual, marking the king’s spiritual enthronement (see Nagaswamy 1998:26).36Davidson (2002:129–130) believes that the term devar§ja, which appears in many inscriptions, refers to the king identified with “iva. This seems incorrect (see Kulke 1978b; Chandra 1992). Devar§jarefers to the icon of power (a palladium, typically a liØga) that is at the centre of a royal consecration ritual based on the aindra abhißeka, whereby the king is consecrated with the power of either Indra or “iva. The ancient Vedic rite was augmented by $gamic rites, and by the ninth century it had become established as the preeminent rite of royal consecration in many parts of Asia. clark_BIL25a.indd 1865/30/2006 2:01:17 PM"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"the rise and influence of advaita maãha-s187respect, and considered as the spiritual guardians of the country.37They came from “aiva-Siddh§nta lineages (sant§na), and their func-tions included the supervision of the construction of temples,38 and the keeping of documents and records of temple endowments. R§ja-guru-scould be householders or bachelors (most were householders) but not saÒny§sin-s. They were sometimes hailed as siddha-s who could cure disease, and were meant to be able to predict impending disasters. They also used to perform various rituals to protect the king, includ-ing the annual r§ja-rakß§, during which the king was annointed with sacred ashes mixed with saffron powder (Nagaswamy 1998:24–26). By the thirteenth century, numerous “aiva-Siddh§ntamaãha-s had been established, which exerted a considerable influence in most parts of the Tamil region.39 One of the maãha-s most influential in supplyingr§ja-guru-s was the GÙÏakÊmaãha.4037R§jar§ja refers to his guruas “my Lord” (sv§mÊ/u·aiy§r), whom he adores as “iva himself. According to the K§mik§gama(one of the principal texts in mediaeval “aiva-Siddh§nta), in temples the foremost place is offered to the r§ja-guru, followed by the king and then the queen. It seems that the R§jendra CÙÏa brought áaiva-§c§rya-s south, from Banaras and the God§vari region (Nagaswamy 1998:20–28). 38Three people were responsible for temple construction: the yajam§na(patron-builder); the architect-sculptor; and the §c§rya, who was the most important. He should know v§stu-á§stra, and supervise all procedures (Nagaswamy 1998:24–26).39According to the tradition pertaining to the CÙÏar§ja-guru-s, five Üßi-s (Kauáika, Kaáyapa, Bharadv§ja, Gautama and Agastya [or $treya]) were initiated by “iva. (This group of Üßi-s is often to be found in “aiva-Siddh§nta$gamatexts; see Brun-ner 1964:457.) The Üßi-s produced five lineages (p§ñca-sant§na-s: Durv§sa, DadÊci, Ruru,“veta, and Upamanyu), which resulted in the establishing of five maãha-s in the south: Mant§na-K§lÊávaram (at the centre), surrounded by Amardaki, GÙÏakÊ,Pußpagiri, and RaÖabhadra. Mant§na-K§lÊávaram was most probably in the God§variregion, while the latter four maãha-s (particularly Amardaki) played a central role in the development of the temple movement in south India. According to several Tantra-s, Durv§sa is the preceptor of the Amardakimaãha(ARE 1917, part II, para. 37 [1986:124]). Aghora “iva came from the Amardakimaãhaand was a resident of K§ñcÊ. Though not a r§ja-guru (Nagaswamy 1998:28ff.), he was an influential and prolific systematiser of a dualist form of “aiva Siddh§nta. His Kriy§-krama-dyotika (Aghora-áiv§c§rya-paddhati), written in 1158, is still one of the most important texts in the south (Davis 1991:17). 40The GÙÏakÊmaãha also traces its lineage to Durv§sa, and was probably established in south India by Yuvar§jadeva I (r.915–945?), a king of the Kalacuri dynasty. The maãha had several lineages (sant§na), and by the fourteenth century had numerous branches all over the south (Mahalingam 1962; Rajamanickam 1964:225; Dehejia 1986:89), employing many musicians and craftsmen. The pontiffs (who all have the surnames ‘“iva’ or ‘“ambhu’) came from the same lineage (i.e. “aiva-Siddh§ntin) as those of the Mattamayåra sect, though there is also evidence that the maãha may have had P§áupata adherents and related Tantric associations at the time of clark_BIL25a.indd 1875/30/2006 2:01:17 PM"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"chapter six188A considerable number of the “aiva-Siddh§ntamaãha-s were named after either the famous Brahman áaivasaint, Tirujñ§naáambandar, or the non-Brahman áaiva saint, Tirun§vukkaraáar.41 With regard to VaißÖavism, non-Brahman participation became significant only after the time of R§m§nuja, in the thirteenth century. In the case of “aivism, it is apparent that beginning in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries many new maãha-s42 were established that were headed by lineages (sant§na) of non-Brahman teachers, called mudaliy§r.43 It seems its founding. The name ‘GÙÏakÊ’ may indeed derive from ‘Gola-giri’, indicating a circular Tantric yoginÊ temple, such as that at Bhe·agh§ã, near Jabbalpur (Mahal-ingam 1962:447; Swaminathan 1990:119–121; Nilakanta Sastri 1992:118; Misra 1997:78). The Goll§/GÙÏakÊ or Lakß§dh§yi lineages (of the twelfth to fourteenth centuries) trace themselves from the Goll§maãhaof Banaras (which may be con-nected to the Bhikß§maãhaof Banaras; see Rajaminickam 1964:227). The GÙÏakÊmaãhasuppliedr§ja-guru-s to the Kalacuri, K§katiya, M§lva, and Telugu CÙÏa dynas-ties. One of the maãha’-s most influential preceptors, who founded several branch maãha-s, was Viáveávara“iva (fl. mid-thirteenth century). While it is possible that the GÙÏakÊmaãha-s also supplied the r§ja-guru-s for the Tamil CÙÏas (Rajamanickam 1964:229), evidence indicates that it was the Amardakimaãhawhich supplied most of theiráaiva-§c§rya-s (Nagaswamy 1998:30–33). Nothing is heard of the GÙÏakÊmaãha after the sixteenth century, most probably because the maãhawas overshadowed by the growing influence of the sm§rta maãha-s following the tradition of “aØkara (Mahalingam 1962:450). (For details of the maãha-s’ activities, acquisitions, branches, lineages, and preceptors, see ARE 1917, part II, para. 33–38 [1986:121–125]; ARE 1936–7, para. 19 [1986:67].)41SeeAnnual Reports on Indian Epigraphy (1986:102–104 [no. 538, para. 53, 28th July 1909]); Rajamikkam (1962) supplies a comprehensive list of maãha-s.42See Gurumurthy (1979:70–73) for a list of sixty maãha-s established between the tenth and fourteenth centuries.43Rajamanikkam (1962; 1964:214–250); Champakalakshmi (1981:421). There are some indications that the flourishing non-Brahman maãha-s were opposed by Brahmans, though attempts to take them over were generally unsuccessful (Stein 1999:236–237).$gamatexts, in general, permit the initiation up to the second level (of three levels of initiation: samayadÊkß§, viáeßadÊkß§, nirv§ÖadÊkß§) of both áådra-s and women, though some texts dispute áådra-s’ rights to be initiated to the third (‘highest’) level (nirv§ÖadÊkß§), and become §c§rya-s.In some instances, to obviate restrictions,‘sat’(‘pure’)áådra-s are created. Considerations of caste seem to be behind the scheme of four kinds of áaiva-s (variously named and categorised) to befound in many texts (Brunner-Lachaux 1963, Vol. 1:xxiii–xxiv; Brunner 1964:460ff.). According to the VarÖ§macandrika, a seventeenth century text produced by the (“aiva-Siddh§nta) Dharmapuram maãha (long after the maãhahad been founded) to legitimise non-sm§rtaworship,áådra-s have the right to take all levels of áaivainitia-tion, and to become preceptors (Koppedrayer 1991:201). It is evident that many áaiva maãha-s were significantly supported by members of the v¿Ï§Ïacaste (originally low-caste, but subsequently comprising many middle-class landlords).

A crucial distinction between the Vedic and $gamic traditions is that whereas the Vedais only open to the ‘twice-born’, the $gamic revelation is for all four varÖa-s, includingáådra-s, who seem to have been quite powerful within the general expansion of “aiva-Siddh§nta (Brunner 1964:451ff.).The K§l§mukhas were divided into at at least two major orders, the“akti-parißad, which had four separate subdivisions, and the SiÒha-parißad.TheSiÒha-parißadseems to have been distributed over a large area, including parts of Andhra Pradesh and Mysore, though the“akti-parißadwas probably the more important order. The main centres of activity of the “akti-parißadwere the DharvaÜ and Shimoga districts of Karnataka (Lorenzen 1991:97). Between the middle of the eleventh and the end of the thirteenth century, the K§l§mukha r§ja-guru-s of south India came from either BaÏÏig§ve (BaÏÏig§me/Belag§ve),46 Kuppaãår,$sandi-n§· or “rÊparvata (“rÊsailam), the first two places being most important, particularly BaÏÏig§ve (in the “ik§ripurat§luk§of Shimoga district, in Karnataka), which from of the Dharmapuram and Tiruv§vaãutuÜaimaãha-s; Arooran (1984) for the maãha-s at Tiruv§vaãutuÜai, Tarumapuram and TiruppaÖant§Ï; Yocum (1990) for the Tiruv§vaãutuÜai AdhÊnam (founded in the seventeenth century).44MeykaÖã§r is one of the most important figures in the development of “aiva-Siddh§nta in the south.

The Ko·iyamaãhafirst appears in records in 1139, from when it appears in records alongside the original five maãha-s.49 It received substantial patronage from the KaÏacårya king, Bijjala, who was closely involved with Basava, the key figure in the development of the VÊraáaiva order.50 The short-lived prominence of the Ko·iyamaãha was overshadowed by another “akti-parißadbranch, the MåvarukoÖeyasantani of Parvat§vaÏi (Settar 1999:69, 77).

The K§l§mukhas worshipped not only “iva, but also VißÖuand Brahm§, and accepted not only the $gama-s, but also the Veda-s, varÖa-s and §árama-s. Nevertheless, vaißÖavacritics such as R§m§nuja and Y§mun§c§rya represented the K§l§mukhas as anti-Vedic (Settar 1999:68–69). As revealed in inscriptions, not only were kings being initiated and making substantial donations to K§l§mukha gurus, but so were their viceroys and provincial officials, who were often entitledMah§maÖ·aleávara (Narasimham 1929:116).53Prior to the ninth century, inscriptions hardly mention any lineage of teachers, but from the ninth century onwards a preceptor is rarely mentioned without his lineage. The role of the royal preceptor was clearly becoming institutionalised, resulting in the enhanced role and influence of the institution to which a line of preceptors was attached. Theáaiva gurus were, like their Jaina counterparts, becoming dei-fied as cult objects. Archeological evidence indicates that already by the seventh century (and perhaps earlier) P§áupata teachers were thought to become identical with “iva at the moment of death, and temples were erected with a liØgainstalled bearing their name (Stietencron 2001:24). The enhanced status of many pontiffs of áaiva maãha-s was partly in view of the irrevocable nature of royal grants (á§sana-s) and partly owing to the absolute rights of the pontiff over the temple or monastery. In a record of around 900 is to be found one of the first references to a mahant, whose rights in this instance are absolute.54However, in many instances local bodies or assemblies had the right to remove the pontiff, should he have committed moral offences or be deemed to have brought the maãha into disrepute. Nandi (1973:99–101) comments that absolute control over the properties of the temple or monastery led to a kind of feudal organisation in important monasteries, some of which organised mass áaivainitiation (dÊkß§) rituals, thus furthering their sphere of influence.

The initiates promoted vaiáeßikaphi-losophy and $gamic“aivism, from “fortress-like structures”. The movement was rooted in the GuÖa-“ivpuri region, but spread over central India, and on to Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The network of “aiva-Siddh§ntamaãha-s traced their lineages back to the Mattamayåra (‘drunken peacock’) sect at Kadvaha.56 From the seventh to the thirteenth centuries, these mon-asteries supplied many of the r§ja-guru-s to regents of several of the dynasties previously referred to. Some of the pontiffs were low-caste, but regardless of caste—which had theoretically been eliminated after initiation—received land-grants from the state. Nominally celibate,57several of the pontiffs wrote religio-philosophical texts that became relatively widely known.58 It has been estimated (Misra 1997:74; Dehejia 1986:89) that the dispensation in grants and land to the pontiffs of these áaiva maãha--s amounted to one third of the reve-nue of the entire Kalacuri state, indicating the importance of áaiva maãha--s to Kalacuri polity.Themaãha-s employed not only artisans and tenant farmers, but also a contingent of law-enforcement officers (vÊrabhadra--s and vajramußãi-s) 55Champakalakshmi (1996:385) draws attention to the close relationship indi-cated between the increase in trade activities, craft production—especially oil and textiles—and the institution of áaiva maãha-s. The K§l§mukha (P§áupata)maãha-s of the ninth and tenth centuries (in centres such as Mayil§ppår and Tiruvor. .r. .iyår), thebhakti maãha-s named after áaivasaints (of the eleventh and twelfth centuries), and the well organised maãha-s of the Goll§/GÙÏakÊ or Lakß§dh§yi lineages (of the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, which trace their lineage from the Goll§maãhaof Banaras), were all invariably located in trade and craft centres.56See Davis (2000) for further details of the Mattamayåra sect.57It is apparent from records of various kinds that celibate orders were not always so. Derrett (1974) analyses a legal ruling from the sixteenth century—during the reign of VeØkata I—at Jambukeávara, whereby it is ordered that the pontiff of a P§áupatamaãhashould be a gÜhastha.It is apparent that the maãha had been occupied by various non-celibate P§áupatas, nominally a strictly celibate order. 58These include the VyomatÊ-ãik§of Vyomaáiva, the Pr§yascitta-samuccaya, Naimit-tika-kriy§-anusandhanaandSoma-áambhu-paddhati(Misra 1997:76).clark_BIL25a.indd 1925/30/2006 2:01:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"the rise and influence of advaita maãha-s193whose powers of enforcement included mutilation and castration. In terms of the powers and privileges enjoyed within the hierarchy of the state, the pontiffs of the maãha-s appear to have been ranked higher than Brahmans and the chief priest, in other words, second only to the regent himself.59 The pontiffs also held more land than thekßatriya-s, who were subservient to them. The maãha-s rendered services to the state in various ways, including the garrisoning of war-forces, the provision of elephants, horses and perhaps wealth, the manufacture of armaments for battle, the maintainance of arse-nals, training in warfare, and even participation in battle. Several pontiffs are praised in inscriptions not only for their knowledge of religious texts, but also for their political wisdom, their power against enemies, and their knowledge of weaponry. They also participated in civil administration, one pontiff (Vimalaáiva) being praised for his ability to make even distant people pay taxes.60 Taxes were also levied by the maãha-s themselves on many items, including a wide range of animals and farm produce, taxes being another source of themaãha-s’ considerable wealth.

By 1328 these kingdoms had come under the control of the Delhi sultanate, but subsequent revolts against Delhi resulted in the establishing of the independent sultanate of Ma’bar at Madurai (which lasted from 1335 to 1378), the BahmanÊ sultanate (in 1347 at Bijapur, Karnataka), and the kingdom of Vijayanagara, whose capital was modern-day HaÒpe (Hampi), Karnataka.61Up to 1565, three dynasties ruled Vijayanagara; the SaØgama (1336–1485), S§Ïuva (1485–1505), and the TuÏuva (1505–1570). Harihara (R§ya)62 I, the eldest of the five sons63 of the chieftain SaØgama, was the first king of Vijayanagara (1336–1356). Within a few years, with the assistance of his brothers—primarily Bukka but also M§rappa—Harihara built up an extensive empire stretch-ing from coast to coast, an empire that was constantly at war with the BahmanÊ sultanate. Bukka I (1356–1377) succeeded his brother Harihara I, Bukka’s son, Kum§ra Kampana, being famed for the conquest of ToÖ·aimaÖ·alam, defeating the Muslim governor of KaÖÖanår (six miles north of “rÊraØgam), and the destruction of the Ma’bar sultanate (1334–1371).64The traditional date of the founding of Vijayanagara is 1336. 1346 has also been suggested, the date of the famous ‘festival of victory’ at “ÜØgerÊ, to which we shall return. These dates have been questioned by Kulke (1985:126), who maintains that Vijayanagara probably only emerged under Bukka I as a capital, in the area of the old Hoysala capital, previously called Viråp§kßapaããaÖa, HosapaããaÖa61For the history of this period, see Saletore (1934); Mahalingam (1940); Ven-kataraman (1950); Majumdar (1960, Vol. 6); Krishnaswami (1964); Dallapiccola (1985); Verghese (1995); Aiyangar (2000).62The SaØgamas are frequently referred to in inscriptions as r§ya(‘king’).63The other four brothers were Kampa, Bukka, M§rappa and Muddappa. Curi-ously, the name Muddappa does not appear in some inscriptions as one of the brothers, another brother being named as either SaØgama or SaØkara (Filliozat 1973:135).64The event is celebrated by Kampana’s wife, GaØg§ DevÊ, in her epic, Madhur§vijayam.After the victories, Kampana’s commandant, Goppana, brought back and facilitated the reinstallation of the two main idols of “rÊraØgam that had been secreted at “iØgavaram (Gingee) and the foot of the Tirupati hill. “rÊraØgam had twice been sacked, once by Malik Kufår in 1310–1311, and during the Tughluq incursions in 1327–1328 (Nilakanta Sastri 1992:126).clark_BIL25a.indd 1945/30/2006 2:01:22 PM"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"the rise and influence of advaita maãha-s195or Vijayaviråp§kßapura.65 The first inscription mentioning the name Vijayanagara is from 1357, the year after Harihara I died and Bukka I took the throne. Bukka gave himself the regal title Mah§r§j§dhir§ja parameávara, but only in 1368, shortly before his death. Initially, all brothers had the title Mah§maÖ·aleávara.Bukka I was followed by Harihara II (1377–1404), under whom the Vijayanagara empire expanded all over south India up to the KÜßÖariver. Harihara II’s three sons, Viråp§kßa I, Bukka II and Devar§ya I, all vied for the throne after Harihara’s death, Devar§ya succeedingand ruling from 1406 to 1422. Devar§ya’s two sons, R§macandra and VÊra Vijaya, both ruled for brief periods, followed by VÊra Vijaya’s son, Devar§ya II (1424–1446), the greatest of the SaØgama rul-ers. After Devar§ya II, the reigns of Mallik§rjuna (1446–1465) and Viråp§kßa II (1466–1485) were weak, resulting in S§Ïuva Nara-siÒha (1485–1491), governor of Candragiri, usurping the throne in 1485.S§Ïuva NarasiÒha was succeeded by his minor sons, Timma (1491) and Imma·i NarasiÒha (1491–1505), the latter being assassinated by his TuÏuva minister, VÊra NarasiÒha, whose reign (1505–1509) was followed by that of his half-brother, KÜßÖadevar§ya (1509–1529), the greatest king of Vijayanagara. Acyutar§ya, a half-brother of KÜßÖadevar§ya, then ruled from 1529–1542. Following his death, a faction led by R§mar§ya, KÜßÖadevar§ya’s son-in-law, installed Sad§áiva (the nephew of Acyutar§ya) on the throne, though R§mar§ya remained the de facto ruler. Under R§mar§ya, the Vijayanagara empire regained some territory lost under KÜßÖadevar§ya but the combined forces of the Delhi sultanate finally defeated R§mar§ya, who died in January 1565 at the decisive battle of Rakkasa-TaØga·i, also known as the battle of T§ÏikÙta.

Filliozat (1973:xvii) suggests that there may have been two Hariharas, as a solution to this and other conflicting inscrip-tional evidence.clark_BIL25a.indd 1955/30/2006 2:01:23 PM"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"chapter six196Muslim control, and as the empire disintegrated, independent feuda-tories arose.

The capital of the vestiges of the empire subsequently moved twice, to Candragiri in North Arcot district, in 1592, and then to Vellore in 1606 (Verghese 1995:2).Many historians have presented the glorious history of the Vijay-anagara empire in terms of a Hindu empire established in the face of Muslim aggession and persecution.67 The Vijayanagara rulers have been presented as Hindus whose patronage of and association with Hindu institutions, particularly the advaita maãhaat“ÜØgerÊ, and whose defeat of the Muslims, notably at Madurai, saved and revived Hindu dharma from impending destruction. However, although wars with the BahmanÊ sultans were frequent, their cause was more political and economic than religious. There were also numerous military expedi-tions against less powerful Hindu rulers, such as the “ambuvar§yas, the Re··is of KoÖ·avÊ·u, the Velamas and the Gajapatis (Verghese 1995:3). Muslim soldiers also fought in the armies of the Vijayanagara regents, undermining the notion that the protagonists were fighting essentially religious wars.Kulke (1985:120–125) also questions the traditional account, presented by several prominent historians,68 of the origins of the SaØgama brothers. According to this account, the brothers were serving in Warangal in the Eastern Deccan, which was overrun by Sultan Muhammad Tughluq in 1323. They fled to Kampili, which was also subsequently captured in 1327 by the Muslims, who had them taken to Delhi as prisoners and converted to Islam. The Sultan of Delhi then sent Harihara I and Bukka to take over the admin-istration of Malik Muhammad in Kampili, and put down a revolt by Hindu subjects.

However, the evidence indicates that the SaØgamas began their career under the Hoysala king, Ballala III, and were never converted to Islam.69 We shall also see that the Vijayanagara rulers were indeed initiated into “aivism, but not by Vidy§raÖya.The religious culture of the Vijayanagaras and previous kingdoms was generally cosmopolitan. Inscriptions of the later C§Ïukyas and Hoysalas exhibit an almost uniform pattern, beginning with an invo-catory verse in praise of “iva, VißÖu, Jina or “akti. However, this is not a characteristic of Vijayanagara inscriptions, most of which begin with a short obeisance:70 “Salutation to Viråp§kßa”, “Saluta-tion to GaÖapati”, or “Salutation to VÊrabhadra”, all of which are áaivadeities.71 In general, the inscriptions mention a variety of both vaißÖavaandáaivadeities, goddesses such as SarasvatÊ, and also refer to various characters from the Mah§bh§rata. The Vijayanagara rulers extensively promoted important Hindu institutions, in endowments to “aiva and VaißÖava temples and advaita maãha-s, and in the patron-age of commentary on the Veda. But the earlier Vijayanagara rulers were essentially áaiva, and like many of the other kings and regents of previous times, were initiated by áaivagurus.K§áÊvil§sa Kriy§áakti$c§rya, almost certainly a K§l§mukha, is known from several inscriptions to have been the r§ja-guruof the first two SaØgama rulers, Harihara I and Bukka I, the founders of the Vijayanagara empire, and perhaps also of Harihara II and Devar§yaI.72 The precise lineage of this particular Kriy§áakti is difficult to 69Wagoner (2000) has shown how the account of the founding of Vijayanagara and the ‘conversion’ and ‘apostasy’ of the brothers was derived from a melding together—first by N. Venkataramanayya in 1929, then elaborated by Nilakanta Sastri in 1946, and then repeated by subsequent historians—of ‘histories’ contained in two sets of texts: (i) ‘Iß§mÊ’sFutåÈ al-Sal§ãÊn, written in Gulbarga between 1347 and 1350; BaranÊ’sTa’rÊkh-i Firåz-Sh§hÊ, written at the Sultanate court of Delhi; RiÈlah orThe Travels of Ibn-Baããåãa, written in 1354; (ii) R§jak§la-nirÖaya, Vidy§raÖya-k§lajñ§na, Vidy§raÖya-vÜtt§nta, and Vidy§raÖya-áaka, written in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The latter set of texts is particularly unreliable historically. The Vidy§raÖya-k§lajñ§nacontains distinct motifs in common with other texts, notably the Prat§parudraCaritramuandKoÊl Ol..ugu, indicating a common source for the accounts.70See UVAT 1985.71In two records, obeisance to “rÊ R§m§nuja is found, and in some other records only the name of the deity is mentioned, such as “rÊ Viããhala and “rÊTiruveØgaÏan§tha. Only thirteen inscriptions contain an invocatory verse, two invoking Jina, nine invoking “iva, one praising VißÖu, and one invoking both “iva and M§dhava (Rajasekhara 1985:104).72Only one inscription contradicts this: in 1396 KhaÖ·eya R§ya Khaleávara Devayya is called r§ja-guru(Saletore 1935:39 fn. 29).clark_BIL25a.indd 1975/30/2006 2:01:24 PM"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"chapter six198determine. He is also referred to as R§yar§jaguru-maÖ·al§c§rya(Rama Rao 2000:44). There were two other K§l§mukha gurus, Kriy§áakti Deva and Kriy§áakti PaÖ·ita, who headed two of the five K§l§mukhamaãha-s in BaÏÏig§me in 1113 (Saletore 1935:39).73 Although Kriy§áaktiis also a common name for P§áupatas (Lorenzen 1991:161–164), it seems that this Kriy§áakti (K§áÊvil§sa) was a K§l§mukha of the “akti-parißadbranch of that order, kriy§áakti referring to an office rather than a personal name. As revealed in a stone inscription to Bukka, dated 1368, and two other inscriptions of 1347 (Verghese 1995:8), K§áÊvil§sa Kriy§áakti was also the guru of one M§dhavamantrin,74 who was the great minister of M§rappa, one of the five SaØgama brothers (Saletore 1935:33 fn. 2). Between 1347 and 1442 at least three dif-ferent K§l§mukha Kriy§áakti gurus are mentioned in Vijayanagara literary and epigraphic sources, namely K§áÊvil§sa, V§ÖÊvil§sa and CandrabhåßaÖa.75 After the reign of Devar§ya II (1424–1446) there are no further references to K§l§mukha gurus. The tutelary deity of both the K§l§mukhas and the earlier Vijay-anagara rulers was Viråp§kßa, who was housed in the K§l§mukha Ko·iya (or KÙãi)maãhaat BaÏÏig§ve, and not in the royal temple of Vijayanagara at Pamp§-kßetra (Saletore 1935:38–39), which housed Pamp§devÊ, originally a local goddess, who had become the con-sort of Viråp§kßa. The Prak§áik§of Cannibhaããa,76 who was at the Vijayanagara court, refers to VijayanagarÊ and Viråp§kßa as differ-ent places, Viråp§kßa having probably been derived from the name of the deity (Thakur 1961:527).

The later Vijayanagara regents were primarily vaißÖava.78Whatever their personal initiation or religious inclination, like many successful politicians the Vijayanagara rulers patronised a variety of religious institutions, including VÊraáaivas,79 followers of Madhva,8077In one example the honorific signature names both Viråp§kßa and “rÊkaÖãhan§tha (“iva) (UVAT 1985:83).78The Vijayanagara rulers remained áaivaup until Viråp§kßa II (1466–1485), the first Vijayanagara ruler to convert to “rÊ-VaißÖavism being S§Ïuva NarasiÒha, who usurped the throne in 1485. He was a devotee of VeØkaãeávara of Tirupati (Tirumalai) and NarasiÒha of Ahobalam. Under the later TuÏuvas the VeØkaãeávaratemple was built up to become the most splendid temple of the realm (Michell 1995:276). KÜßÖadevar§ya (1509–1529) is known to have venerated “rÊ-VaißÖava ascetics such as Govindar§ja—who is called his guru—and VeØkaãa T§t§c§rya. The TeluguvaißÖavatradition maintains that T§t§c§rya was the guru of KÜßÖadevar§ya. There is also a story that Vy§sar§ya temporarily occupied KÜßÖadevar§ya’s throne during an inauspicious conjunction of planets (Nilakanta Sastri 1992:128). KÜßÖadevar§ya’s favourite deity was VeØkaãeávara of Tirupati, one of the main centres of “rÊ-VaißÖavism. The last TuÏuva emperor, Sad§áiva, and his regent, R§mar§ya—whose guru was Pañcamatabhañjanam T§t§c§rya—also owed their primary allegiance to “rÊ-VaißÖavism. Patronage for áaiva institutions seems to have more or less ceased under Sad§áiva and R§mar§ya, the last of the Vijayanagara rulers (Verghese 1995:9; Champakalakshmi 1996:343).79The VÊraáaivas, also called LiØg§yats, were widely active in the Vijayana-gara period, particularly in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The most important figure in the development of VÊraáaivism was Basava, who was minister to the Kalacåri king Bijjala from 1162–1167. The most important VÊraáaivamaãha-s were at“rÊsailam, SaØgameávaram and Ummattår (Nilakanta Sastri 1992:129). It is known that Devar§ya II patronised LiØg§yat gurus, and some LiØg§yats, such as the Generals LakkaÖÖa and Camarasa, rose high in state service. Grants were made to various jaØgama-s (wandering VÊraáaiva priests), and it is assumed that there were many VÊraáaivamaãha-s, though there are but a few records. There is no evidence, however, to support the claim that Devar§ya and his immediate successors were VÊraáaivas (Verghese 1995:8, 112, 117). For an account of contemporary VÊraáaiva renouncers (virakta), see Bradford (1985).80Little is known about the presence of VaißÖavism in Karnataka before the time of the dualist Madhva (1237–1317). (For Madhva’s dates, see Glasenapp 1992:9–11.) Madhva ($nandatÊrtha) was born in a vaißÖava sm§rtafamily, and besides accepting theVedasaÒhit§-s as authoritative, also accepted Mah§bh§rata,V§lmÊki’sR§m§yaÖa,Pur§Öa-s agreeing with these, and the entire P§ñcar§tra(Zydenbos 2001:113, 116).

Some records also seem to mention a Christian dÊv§n(chief minister) to Devar§ya II in 1445 (Nilakanta Sastri 1992:127). Up to 10,000 Muslim horsemen were employed in Devar§ya’s army, and Harihara II had a mosque built in 1439 in the Muslim quarter of Vijayana-gara at the behest of a Muslim patron, the warrior Ahmad Kh§nmentioned in an epigraph of 1366–1367 (Ramesh 1970:300). According to tradi-tion, Madhva appointed eight disciples to conduct worship of KÜßÖa at the maãha founded by him at U·upi. This led to the founding of eight maãha-s in U·upi, which currently function as branch maãha-s of the main maãha, known as the KÜßÖamaãha (Nilakanta Sastri 1992:121–122). However, the tradition was primarily established by another group of four of his disciples: Padman§bha, Narahari, M§dhava and AkßobhyatÊrtha. These disciples were succeeded by JayatÊrtha and his successors, who were the most influential group of Madhva’s adherents. This lineage bifur-cated around 1412, the younger division further bifurcating around 1435, result-ing in three branches, known as the Vy§sar§ya, R§ghavendra-sv§mÊ and Uttar§di maãha-s (Verghese 1995:113). The Madhva sect is currently the largest vaißÖavasect in Karnataka State (Siauve 1957:iv).81Bukka I was behind the Jaina-VaißÖava accord of 1368, which specifically mentions, along with others, the Jainas of the PenugoÖ·a N§·u. It seems that this charter was necessary as the Jainas appear to have been subject to consider-able harassment in the latter half of the fourteenth century (Desai 1957:161, 402). There are very few records of the SaØgamas that mention new constructions, the earliest of them dating to 1385 and recording the construction of a caity§layafor the Jina, Kuntu N§tha, the seventeenth TÊrthaØkara (Archaeological Survey of India: South Indian Inscriptions [ASI], Vol. 1, no. 152, pp. 153–160). This was on behalf of a general of Harihara II, Irugappa DaÖ·an§yaka—perhaps the greatest patron of the Jainas amongst Vijayanagara officials—who was a pupil of Pußpasena, and is also associated with other Jaina centres, such as “ravaÖa BeÏgoÏa (‘white tank of the Jainas’) and TiruparuttikunÜu (Nilakanta Sastri 1992:129).82A record of 1426, issued on the order of Devar§ya II for the erection of a caity§layato P§rávan§tha (ASI, Vol. 1, No. 153), reveals that state aid was being given to Jainas, who nevertheless were on the decline both politically and numeri-cally (Rajasekhara 1985:106). Nevertheless, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries Jainism was adhered to by large sections of the population, and all over the south Karnataka region many Jaina basti-s were restored (Ramesh 1970:300). During this period the main Jaina strongholds were K§ñcÊ,“ravaÖa BeÏgoÏa and the TuÏuva area (south-west Karnataka) (Nilakanta Sastri 1992:129).83During this period, although little is heard of Buddhism, there is a refer-ence by a Javanese poet in 1362 to Buddhist monks “living at six monasteries in K§ñcÊpuram”, indicating that Buddhism continued to be practised (Sewell and Aiyangar 1932:195 [Memoirs of the Batavian Society of Arts LIV, 1902]).clark_BIL25a.indd 2005/30/2006 2:01:26 PM"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"the rise and influence of advaita maãha-s201(Rajasekhara 1985:107; Wagoner 1999:250). KÜßÖadevar§ya and his successor, Acyutar§ya, although converted to “rÊ-VaißÖavism,84 gave significant gifts and endowments to both vaißÖavaandáaiva temples,85including some in Kumbhakonam, notably the vaißÖava“§raØgap§Öi,R§masv§mÊ and Cakrap§Öi temples, and the áaiva$di Kumbheávaratemple.86 The political adaptation of Vijayanagara rulers to religious situations is well illustrated by the policy of R§mar§ya, the last of the Vijayanagaras, who allowed mosques to be built, and refused to heed the advice of his brother, Tirumala R§mar§ya, and other Hindu subjects, who wished to prevent cow-slaughter in the Muslim quarter (Turukav§·a). Further, he had the Koranplaced before him-self in the Audience Hall, so that Muslim soldiers would feel more comfortable making obeisance before him. The Vijayanagaras and the N§yakas also made substantial endowments to the darga-s (tombs) of Muslim saints, where miracles were believed to be performed (Nilakanta Sastri 1992:127).Having considered the Vijayanagaras’ general religious orienta-tion, the áaivainitiation of the early rulers by K§l§mukhar§ja-guru-s, and the patronage they extended to various traditions, we now turn 84There is a claim that a sage of the Madhva sect, Vy§sar§ya (Vy§satÊrtha), was ther§ja-guruof S§Ïuva NarasiÒha and of the TuÏuvas, VÊra NarasiÒha, KÜßÖadevar§ya and Acyutar§ya. Eleven sam§dhi-s (known as bÜnd§vana-s) of Madhva saints are to be found at Vijayanagara, indicating their influence there between around 1324 to 1623. Vy§sar§ya was a significant presence in the courts of S§Ïuva NarasiÒha and the TuÏuva rulers—down to Acyutar§ya—from around 1499 until his death in 1539. Although KÜßÖadevar§ya and Acytar§ya are known to have venerated Vy§sar§ya, there is little supporting evidence for the claim that Vy§sar§ya was a r§ja-guru.There is another claim that Viråp§kßa II was a “rÊ-VaißÖava. However, both of these suppositions are principally based on accounts to be found in sectar-ian hagiographic works (Verghese 1995:8–9, 113–114).85KÜßÖadevar§ya repaired the Viråp§kßa temple at HaÒpe soon after his succes-sion, and made gifts to the áaivatemples at TiruvaÖÖ§malai, Cidambaram, K§lahasti,“rÊsailam and Amar§vatÊ. Gifts were also given to the vaißÖavatemples at K§ñcÊ,Tirupati, SiÒh§calam and AhÙbalam. Amongst those in his service were sm§rta-s, Jainas and vaißÖava-s (Nilakanta Sastri 1992:126). Acyutar§ya, on the occasion of his coronation, gave an equal number of villages to the temples of Ek§mbaran§tha and Varadar§ja at K§ñcÊ.86This temple was built during the Vijayanagara period and hosts a twelve-yearly Mah§m§gham festival, when bathing in the temple tank during the month ofM§gha is equivalent to a bath in all the holy rivers of India, mirroring the annual bath at the M§gh Mel§ at Pray§ga.

In this section, an attempt will be made to disentangle epigraphic evidence from tradi-tion, in order to establish the identity of the most important figures in the earliest decades of the maãha, namely its first three pontiffs (Vidy§tÊrtha, Bh§ratÊtÊrtha and Vidy§raÖya), S§yaÖa (the commenta-tor on the Veda-s), and at least two individuals named M§dhava (one of whom is often mistakenly identified with Vidy§raÖya). We have surveyed the importance and influence of various “aiva-Siddh§ntin maãha-s and lineages, and how the Veda was studied, but with fore-most authority bestowed upon the $gama-s. In this and the follow-ing section, it will be seen how the the pontiffs patronised by the early Vijayanagaras at “ÜØgerÊ were essentially representatives of a new, orthodox, áaiva, Brahmanical, advaita-Ve d§nta monastic tradi-tion, ‘orthodox’ in respect of primarily representing Ved§nta, and constituting a tradition that acknowledged its ultimate authority as deriving from the Veda. We will first consider the founding of the “ÜØgerÊmaãhaand its first pontiffs. It is well known that the SaØgamas extended significant patronage to the maãhaat“ÜØgerÊ. In 1346 Harihara I led his four brothers on a pilgrimage there, where they celebrated the ‘festival of victory’ (vijayotsava), the conquest of the earth from the eastern to the western shore. The inscription records grants to forty Brahmans “well-versed in the Veda”,87 and praise is bestowed on Vidy§tÊrtha guru, “whose friendship gained is never lost” (UVAT88 1985:71–73).89Saletore believes (1935:39–40) that Vidy§tÊrtha was the pontiff of87The wife of the late Hoysala king Ballala III, Kikk§yitai, also participated in this ceremony and donated land. This and other evidence undermines the conten-tion made by several historians that the Vijayanagaras conquered the Hoysalas (Kulke 1985:122).88This work, on Vijayanagara inscriptions, hence referred to as UVAT, contains the text and translation of many of the inscriptions referred to in this section.89See also EC VI (“n1), p. 92.clark_BIL25a.indd 2025/30/2006 2:01:28 PM"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"the rise and influence of advaita maãha-s203“ÜØgerÊ at the time, and together with the famous Vidy§raÖya, to whom we shall return, was responsible for considerable financial aid90 to the rulers in their military campaign, which brought on them the envy of their contemporaries, and which caused a pledge of eternal friendship to be made to the head of the “ÜØgerÊmaãha. Although the traditional guru-parampar§of the “ÜØgerÊmaãharecords the death of Vidy§tÊrtha in 1333,91 several epigraphic records, from “ÜØgerÊ and other places, clearly indicate that Vidy§tÊrtha continued to be alive at least until June 14th 1375.92 Saletore (1935:40) believes that Vidy§tÊrtha remained guru of the “ÜØgerÊmaãhauntil this date. However, in 1356 Bukka paid homage to Vidy§tÊrtha, and also made land grants to Bh§ratÊtÊrtha and his disciples “to live and carry on their religious observances in sacred “ÜØgerÊ” (UVAT 1985:70, v. 1; 72, v. 3). According to tradition, Bh§ratÊtÊrtha (=Bh§ratÊkÜßÖatÊrtha) followed Vidy§tÊrtha (=Vidy§áaØkara) as pontiff of “ÜØgerÊ,93 and it seems probable that Bh§ratÊtÊrtha was, for some time, head of “ÜØgerÊ,but perhaps under Vidy§tÊrtha (Rama Rao 2000:42). Bh§ratÊtÊrtha is indeed described in one inscription, in so many words (UVAT 1985:116, v. 10), as the disciple of Vidy§tÊrtha.94 While Vidy§tÊrtha appears not have left any written works, both Bh§ratÊtÊrtha and Vidy§raÖya wrote several advaita-Ved§nta texts which are considered to be important works within the Ved§nta tradition.9590There is a legend (Saletore 1934, Vol. 1:142) of Vidy§raÖya bringing down a shower of gold for three and three-quarter hours. 91See Aiyer and Sastri (1962:164). Venkataraman (1959:28) refers to Vidy§tÊrthaas also Vidy§áaØkaratÊrtha.92On this date (áaka 1298, r§kßasa,§ß§·ha,áukla, 15) a gift of land was made by PaÖ·arideva O·eya (viceroy over the MaØgal..åru-r§jya) to Vidy§tÊrtha for conducting worship in the “iva temple at UÏayibeããu in the Mangalore t§luk§. In an inscription dated 1377, VÊra Bukka O·eya (Bukka I) is spoken of as having become “very great” with the assistance of Vidy§tÊrtha. A stone record at “ÜØgerÊ of 1365 restates the founders’ friendship with Vidy§tÊrtha. See Saletore (1935:40) for further details of the relevant inscriptions. The evidence does not seem to exclude the possibility that Bh§ratÊtÊrtha took over the gaddÊ at “ÜØgerÊ after 1356, yet Vidy§tÊrtha continued to perform functions and receive grants.93See Venkataraman (1959) for the details of the lives of all the pontiffs of “ÜØgerÊ.94According to tradition, Vidy§tÊrtha founded eight maãha-s and installed therein eight of his disciples: “aØkar§nanda, Saccid§nanda, S§ndranda, Advait§nanda“evadhi, Mah§deva“iva, Advaita Sukh§nanda,“ivayogÊ and PratyagjyotÊ.

It is the main temple of the tÊrtha, and tradition associates it with the founding of a maãhain“ÜØgerÊ by “aØkara. Although this temple may have been erected in memory of Vidy§tÊrtha, the notion that the temple was either consecrated in 1356, under the supervision of Bh§ratÊtÊrtha—who granted 120 vÜtti--s (stipends) to various Brahmans on the occasion (ARMAD96 [“ÜØgerÊ] 1916:15)—or constructed as late as 1380 (ARMAD [“ÜØgerÊ] 1933:226), has been challenged by Michell (1995). A careful consideration of both epigraphic evi-dence and architectural style leads Michell to the conclusion that the Vidy§áaØkara temple, which has a liØgarepresenting“aØkara, was constructed in the mid-sixteenth century.97 Inscriptions of 1390, 1430 and of the TuÏuva period (1515–1545) refer to the deity Vidy§áaØkara, but not to any temple. Given the abundance of inscriptions in Vijay-anagara, Michell comments (1995:276) that it is indeed strange that the largest and most finely appointed temple of the area is utterly devoid of any foundational inscription. He believes that the probable reason is that the temple was sponsored and built by the pontiffs of the “ÜØgerÊadvaita maãhaitself, in an attempt to gain prestige for their áaivainstitution. As we have seen, from the late fifteenth century onwards the Vijayanagara regents switched their primary religious allegiance from “aivism to VaißÖavism, an allegiance also followed by family members, ministers and military commanders. This is reflected in the changed honorific signature and the erec-tion of important new vaißÖava temple complexes in the sixteenth century (Michell 1995:276). It is suggested that, in this context, the Vidy§áaØkara temple was built to enhance the prestige of the site. It also seems probable, given the other evidence presented so far in this book, that around the time of the construction of the temple in the mid-sixteenth century, the legend of “aØkara founding pÊãha-s may first have been disseminated.

There are four early inscriptional references to Vidy§raÖya: in a copper-plate grant of 18th April 1336, the village of Y§ragu·i is renamed Vidy§raÖyapura (UVAT 1985:46, vv. 1–38),98 while in a grant made shortly afterwards,99 Harihara I is described (UVAT 1985:57, vv. 22–25)100 prostrating himself at the feet of the holy ascetic Vidy§raÖya, “comparable to Lord “iva Himself, the one of supreme austerity and devotion...”. In these inscriptions Vidy§raÖya is credited with assisting the SaØgamas in founding Vijayanagara in 1336. However, it is almost certain that these two copper-plate grants are spurious, being backdated (ARMAD 1934:139–142; Fil-liozat 1973:xiv–xv; Kulke 1985:123), as are two others, one dated 1370 (?), and another dated March 23rd 1344—twelve years before Bukka became king—in which king Bukka is exalted: seated on a bejewelled throne, he shines “in Vidy§, the city established by [the sage] Vidy§raÖya” (UVAT 1985:66, vv. 14–16).The first genuine epigraphic mention of Vidy§raÖya is dated Octo-ber 25th 1375 (ARMAD “g. 1933:226; Filliozat 1973:xxx, fn. 1). On this date a grant was made by Bukka—during the incumbency of the governance of Mangalore by PaÖ·arideva—[to] “the holy feet of Vidy§raÖya of “ÜØgerÊ” (UVAT 1985:60, v. 1), who had by now, it is assumed, become pontiff of the maãha.101 This would agree with a ka·ita102 of the “ÜØgerÊmaãhathat states that Bh§ratÊtÊrtha died in 1374 (ARMAD“g. 1933:226–227). The land-grant was for the feeding of Brahmans and daily offerings to Lord Vidy§áaØkara, the deity later housed in the temple built in honour of Vidy§tÊrtha. Saletore (1935:41) believes inscriptions indicate that it was to Vidy§tÊrtha, and not to Vidy§raÖya, that the SaØgamas credited their success,103 even though 98According to this copper-plate inscription (vv. 27–28)—the ‘Bestarahalli’ grant—this was the date of Harihara’s coronation, in the presence of the god Viråp§kßa and his consort Pamp§.99The ‘K§paluru’ grant.100See also EC (X, no. 70:241).101Other grants were made: in 1377, in the presence of Vidy§raÖya of “ÜØgerÊ;in 1378, under the orders of Vidy§raÖya (UVAT 1985:89, 93).102Aka·itais a long piece of cloth covered with paste, and used for records (see Shastry 1982:9–12).103A copper-plate grant dated 1377 states that Bukka O·eya was born to free the land of mleccha-s, and became the sole lord of the earth by the grace of Vidy§tÊrthas-clark_BIL25a.indd 2055/30/2006 2:01:30 PM"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"chapter six206in later tradition the honour goes to ParamahaÒsa Parivr§jak§c§ryaVidy§raÖya“rÊp§da.Vidy§raÖya is also credited with the authorship of numerous works, but we shall see that, besides his genuine works, others are not of his authorship, but credited to him in the mistaken belief that he was named M§dhava before he took saÒny§sa.The evidence indicates that it was the triumvirate of Vidy§tÊrtha (Vidy§áaØkara), Bh§ratÊtÊrtha (Bh§ratÊkÜßÖatÊrtha) and Vidy§raÖya who are intimately connected with the politics of the early Vijay-anagaras, Vidy§raÖya perhaps awarded the gaddÊof“ÜØgerÊ as a reward for his manifestation of showers of gold, if the legend has some historical basis.

In the aforementioned inscription of May 26th 1386 (UVAT 1985:116, vv. 10–11) the three sages are mentioned together, Bh§ratÊtÊrtha, as the disciple of Vidy§tÊrtha, “coming to full bloom in the rays of the sun that is sage Vidy§raÖya”.While there is inscriptional evidence for the association of the triumvirate with the (TuØga)“ÜØgerÊmaãha, they are also all claimed by the Ku·alimaãhaat“ÜØgerÊ (Antarkar 2001:61–62). Vidy§tÊrtha is also claimed by the tradition of the K§ñcÊmaãha. The guru-parampar§of the PuÖyaálokamañjarÊ,, by Sarvajñasad§áivabodha (56th pontiff from 1524 to 1539), the earliest account of the pontiffs of the maãha, states that Vidy§tÊrtha, a disciple of Candracå·a,104 ruled there for seventy-three years (from 1297 to 1370) as the fifty-first preceptor, retiring with his disciple, “aØkar§nanda, to the Himalayas, where he died (Rama Rao 1931:83).105 The fifty-second pontiff, according to the traditional account, was Vy§s§cala Mah§devendrasarasvatÊ, who may have been the author of one of the early hagiographies of “aØkara, theVy§s§cala-“aØkaravijaya(see Ch. 5.1 fn. 8). As previously noted, the first mention of Vidy§raÖya in connection with“ÜØgerÊ is in an inscription of 1375; no earlier inscriptions at v§mÊ.

In a copper-plate grant of 1380 (ARMAD 1916:57) it is recorded that Bukka had written a letter to Vidy§raÖya“rÊp§da, who was then in Banaras, requesting him to return to Viråp§kßa (HaÒpe). Vidy§raÖya returned to HaÒpe, from where he was taken to “ÜØgerÊ and granted land for his maintenance, in Kikunda-n§·u.106 Cikka, the son of Harihara (Harihara II), also granted land to Vidy§raÖya, as did Harihara II, who, in 1380, confirmed all previous grants that had been made (Saletore 1935:41; Kulke 1985:133). In an inscription dated Novem-ber 25th 1384, Harihara II is described as having “acquired the empire of knowledge unattained by other kings ... by the grace of Vidy§raÖya muni” (UVAT 1985:108). Harihara II is also recorded in this inscription as having made a donation to two disciples of Vidy§raÖya: Sårappa and KÜßÖadeva. It was during the last two years of the reign of Bukka I, and then in the reign of Harihara II that Vidy§raÖya, most probably, was pontiff of the “ÜØgerÊmaãha,from October 1375 to his death on May 26th 1386.107In 1386, before he died, Vidy§raÖya was present when Harihara II made a grant, recorded on copper-plate, to N§r§yaÖa V§japeya-yati,Narahari Somay§ji and PaÖ·ari DÊkßita, who are acknowledged as “Promoters of the Commentary on the Four Vedas”. On January 29th 1386, Vidy§raÖya made a land-grant to a lay attendant for the pur-poses of food offerings at the temple of GopÊn§tha (ARMAD 1934:139–141; UVAT 1985:111).108 Shortly after Vidy§raÖya’s death, 106This particular account of Vidy§raÖya’s return from Banaras is repeated in theGuru-vaÒáa-k§vyaand in a ka·itaat“ÜØgerÊ (ARMAD 1933:226–227).107The putative date of Vidy§raÖya’s succession is supported by a ka·itaat the “ÜØgerÊmaãha, which states that Bh§ratÊtÊrtha died in 1374 (ARMAD 1933:266ff.). However, the ka·itarecords are not entirely reliable. The situation is further com-plicated by the existence of several other Vidy§raÖyas. One of them is mentioned at“ÜØgerÊ in 1515 (ARMAD 1916:18); another is the guru of a sv§mÊat the Ku·ali maãha in 1591; Vidy§raÖya is claimed by some as the founder of the Ku·alimaãha;another Vidy§raÖya may have been a pontiff of the “ÜØgerÊmaãhaat the time of KÜßÖadevar§ya (ARMAD 1933:146). Vidy§raÖya is also claimed as the founder of the Viråp§kßamaãha, as described in the PußpagiriMaãh§mn§ya(see Anantendra Sarasvati 1968:386–387); also, several gurus of the $vaÖimaãhaare called Vidy§raÖya(Rama Rao 1931:91). 108A disciple of Vidy§raÖya named “aØkar§raÖya-“rÊp§da made an endowment to a temple at Chant§ru in the U·upit§luk§in 1402 (Annual Report on South-Indian Epigraphy1928:81).clark_BIL25a.indd 2075/30/2006 2:01:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"chapter six208Harihara II made further grants, in 1386, of land in KikuÖ·a-n§·u, which was named Vidy§raÖyapura in his honour (ARMAD 1933:134–146). Significantly, in an inscription dated May 3rd 1384 (UVAT 1985:102) Vidy§raÖya is referred to as KrÊy§áakti-Vidy§raÖya,109indicating the probability that Vidy§raÖya was a K§l§mukha before his accession to the “ÜØgerÊgaddÊ, a ga··Êthat had already been occu-pied by Bh§ratÊtÊrtha and Vidy§tÊrtha, Ved§ntins who represented a new orthodox tradition. While Bh§ratÊtÊrtha’s religious background is uncertain, Vidy§tÊrtha was almost certainly a maheávara(see below). We have seen that Vidy§tÊrtha and Bh§ratÊtÊrtha are mentioned in a number of inscriptions dating from 1346. However, as Vidy§raÖya is first mentioned in 1375, it seems highly improbable that he was associated with the founding of Vijayanagara or a maãha.It seems that his active role in the 1330s and 1340s was projected back from a later age (Kulke 1985:128).Also central to this period of early Vijayanagara religious history are S§yaÖa and M§dhava, the latter often being identified errone-ously with Vidy§raÖya. M§dhava’s identity is further complicated by the existence of at least one other contemporary with the same name. Concerning the identities of M§dhava and S§yaÖa, there is an inscription (UVAT 1985:34), unfortunately undated, at the AruÏ§Ïa-Perum§Ï temple at K§ñcÊpuram.This record is dedicated to S§yaÖa, of the Bh§radv§jagotra, S§yaÖa being the famous commentator on theVeda-s. His mother “rÊm§yÊ is named; as are his father, MayaÖa; his younger brother, Bhogan§tha; and his elder brother, M§dhava. This M§dhava, of the Bh§radv§jagotra, and the brother of S§yaÖa, is one of the great mediaeval commentators on dharmaá§stra, whose fame in the south stands second only to “aØkar§c§rya (Kane HD“,Vol.1, part 2:779). For the purposes of explication, this M§dhava will be henceforth referred to as M§dhava [B]. (Futher on in this section we will consider the identity of another M§dhava, who will be referred to as M§dhava [A].)110109This has been interpreted by some as referring to two individuals, but the text (UVAT 1985:98, l.1–7) seems to indicate one person, as the relevant case endings are in the singular.110The distinction between M§dhava [A] and M§dhava [B] was first clearly analysed and demonstrated by Narasimhachar (1916a; 1916b; 1917). It was further commented on by Rama Rao (1930; 1931; 1934), and subsequently endorsed by Kulke (1985). clark_BIL25a.indd 2085/30/2006 2:01:32 PM"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"the rise and influence of advaita maãha-s209During the middle of the fourteenth century, M§dhava [B]—some-times referred to as M§dhava-§c§rya—served as a minister and advi-sor to Bukka I.111 According to Rama Rao (1930:703), there are five works that may be attributed with some certainty to this M§dhava, who was philosophically orientated to advaita.112 This M§dhava [B] has also been identified with the author of the “aØkara-dig-vijaya, the most well-known of the hagiographies of “aØkara. In the opening verse of the “DV, the author pays obeisance to his guru, Vidy§tÊrtha.This work was originally entitled SaÒkßepa-“aØkara-jaya, and in some current printed editions113is attributed to M§dhava-Vidy§raÖya. The colophons at the conclusion of each of the sixteen chapters of the “DV state that the work was written by M§dhava (not M§dhava-Vidy§raÖya). But this author could not have written the text before 1650 (Sawai 1985; Bader 2000:54–55), several centuries after the time of both M§dhava [B] and Vidy§raÖya. The identification of M§dhava [B] with Vidy§raÖya has led to numerous works being wrongly attributed to M§dhava [B] (Rama Rao 1930:705–706).114111Due to the erroneous identification of M§dhava with Vidy§raÖya (see below), it has sometimes been assumed that M§dhava/Vidy§raÖya was also a minister to Harihara I, Bukka I and Harihara II (see, for example, Venkataramanayya [Majumdar] 1990, 4th edn., Vol. 6:323) 112P§r§áarasmÜti-vy§khy§ (P§r§áaram§dhavÊya), Vyavah§ra-m§dhava, K§lam§dhavÊya (K§lanirÖaya), JÊvanmuktiviveka, and JaiminÊyany§m§l§vistara (which examines the såtra-s of Jaimini).

The JÊvanmuktiviveka focusses on the life of the paramahaÒsa,the highest type of renouncer, and is also attributed to Vidy§raÖya (see Olivelle 1977, part II:25; Vidy§raÖya 1996: Translator’s Preface), owing to the frequent but problematic identification of M§dhava with Vidy§raÖya (see below).

The evidence indicates that M§dhava [B] was certainly not the author of the “DV, and probably not the author of the Sarva-daráana-saÒgraha, an account of the sixteen systems of philosophy that espouses advaitaas the ‘highest’ philosophy. In this work it is stated both that the author is S§yaÖa-M§dhava, and also M§dhava, “the Kaustubha-jewel of the milk-ocean of the fortunate S§yaÖa” (M§dhava-$ch§rya 1882:1.3–4). It has been suggested that this work may have been by M§dhava [C], also known as M§yaÖa, one of the two sons of S§yaÖa, who was neither M§dhava [A] (see clark_BIL25a.indd 2095/30/2006 2:01:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"chapter six210In his seven known works,115 which include his Vedic commen-taries, S§yaÖa also provides corroborating information concerning his family, mentioning his parents, his younger brother Bhogan§tha, and his elder brother, M§dhava [B]. S§yaÖa116 first lived at the court of Prince Kampa (a younger brother of Harihara I), in the east of Vijayanagara, and then, following KaÒpa’s death, served as advisor and minister to his young son, SaØgama II, who became ruler of the eastern province. M§dhava [B] became the mah§-mantrin(Kane Vol.1, pt.2:789), and Bhogan§tha a minister-chamberlain for SaØgama II (UVAT 1985:80–83).117 This latter inscription, of 1356, was composed by Bhogan§tha, who states his veneration for the preceptor “rÊkaÖãhan§tha,118 a áaiva advaitin who lived in the early twelfth century (Suryanarayana Sastri 1930:1–35; Nagaswamy 1982:97). This “rÊkaÖãha, who is also referered to in an inscription as a K§l§mukha,119 was most probably the r§ja-guruof Vikrama CÙÏa (c.1121) (Rajamanickam 1964:229; Nagaswamy 1998:35).120below), governor of Banavase (and minister to Harihara I, Bukka I and Harihara II), nor M§dhava [B], minister to Bukka I (Rama Rao 1930:714; Venkataraman 1959:34). The author of the SDS (1.2) states that he daily follows his guru Sarvajña-VißÖu, son of “§raØgap§Öi, who knows all the $gama-s, thus ruling out M§dhavas [A] and [B]. However, a most insightful analysis by Thakur (1961) indicates that the author of the SDS was Cannibhaããa (Cinna or Cennu), son of Sahajasarvajña VißÖu Bhaããop§dhyaya, who was also a preceptor to S§yaÖa and M§dhava [B]. Cannibhaããa was a younger contemporary of S§yaÖa and M§dhava, author of a sub-commentary on the Pañcap§dik§vivaraÖa, and worked in the Vijayanagara court under the patronage of Harihara Mah§r§ja The SDS shares many passages and quotations from Cannibhaããa’s other works. Thakur suggests that the plan of the work may have originated with M§dhava, and been written by Cannibhaããa, with the help of S§yaÖa and M§dhava.115Subh§ßita-sudh§nidhi, Pr§yaácitta-sudh§nidhi (Karmavip§ka), AlaØkara-sudh§nidhi, Dh§tuvÜtti, Puruß§rtha-sudh§nidhi, Yajñatantra-sudh§nidhi.116‘S§yaÖa’ also was not an uncommon name during the period under consid-eration. Filliozat (1973:xxxi) records six different S§yaÖas from inscriptions, son of Harihara I, son of Kampa I, son of Bukka I, son of M§rappa, son of Kampa II, and minister of Kampana I.117Rama Rao (1930:711), however, doubts that M§dhava served SaØgama II, believing that, at Vijayanagara, M§dhava was only ever a minister of Bukka I.118This“rÊkaÖãha (n§tha) is not to be confused with the “rÊkaÖãha who was the preceptor of the P§áupatas.119Epigraphia Carnatica VII (Shikapur), 99 (1113 CE).120“rÊkaÖãha, like “aØkara, R§m§nuja and Madhva ($nandatÊrtha), commented on the Brahmasåtraof B§dar§yaÖa, and spearheaded the non-dualist “iv§dvaita school, which is particularly important in the south, and is based on his commentary, the “rÊkaÖãha-bh§ßya.

S§yaÖa’sguru was Vidy§tÊrtha. In S§yaÖa’s Vedic commentaries and some other later works, the term “M§dhavÊya” occurs in the colophon. However, it is clear from the introductory verses of the Puruß§rtha-sudh§nidhi and theYajurveda-bh§ßyathat M§dhava was approached by Bukka I to write the texts, but M§dhava entrusted their composition to his younger brother, S§yaÖa (Rama Rao 1930:709). There is also no evidence, apart from a copper-plate in§mof dubious authenticity,121that different sections of the Veda-bh§ßyawere written by a team of Brahmans under the guidance of S§yaÖa. A reference was made previously to three Brahmans who received grants at “ÜØgerÊ in 1386 for their commentaries on the four Veda-s. However, S§yaÖa does not acknowledge anyone’s assistance in his works (Kulke 1985:131), and this gift to Brahmans does not necessarily indicate that S§yaÖa was assisted in his commentaries. The works of S§yaÖa and M§dhava [B] also indicate that M§dhava [B] was also a minister to Bukka II (one of the three sons of Harihara II), who asked both S§yaÖa and M§dhava to compose treatises on the Veda-s, Pur§Öa-s andSmÜti-s.Besides M§dhava [B], it is also apparent that there was another M§dhava, [A], who was governor of Banavasi (Goa), and the author ofT§tparyadÊpik§, a commentary on the SåtasaÒhit§.On his instruc-tion, Brahmans were brought from Andhra Pradesh and Kashmir, and settled with land in Karnataka (Rama Rao 1930:709 fn. 1). From several inscriptions, including one from Goa, dated 1391, it philosophers up until the fourteenth century, their systems being the subject of a commentary,Catur-mata-leáa-saÒgraha, by Appaya DÊkßit§, who flourished in the latter half of the sixteenth century. “rÊkaÖãha was a contemporary, or near contem-porary, of R§m§nuja, with whom he had many philosophical similarities, both of their systems being variants of viáißã§dvaita. But for minor details, the philosophy of “rÊkaÖãha is essentially advaita.“rÊkaÖãha is associated with Cidambaram, though may have come from the north (Suryanarayana Sastri 1930:16, 28, 73, 285). He may have come from the GÙÏakÊmaãha(ARE 1936, para. 19 [1986:67]). The sig-nificance of support by the Vijayanagara rulers for particular advaitatraditions is discussed below.121The authenticity of this copper-plate, of 1386, is doubted as it refers to Vidy§raÖya as living some months after his death (Rama Rao 1930:711).clark_BIL25a.indd 2115/30/2006 2:01:34 PM"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"chapter six212is known that his parents were M§c§mbik§ and CauÖ·abhaããa; that he served as minister to Harihara I, Bukka I and Harihara II, from 1347 to 1391; and that his guru was K§áÊvil§sa Kriy§áakti (Filliozat 1973:136).122 M§dhava [A] was also minister to prince M§rappa, the younger brother of Harihara I. In 1368, this M§dhavamantrin is twice described in inscriptions as “depending on king Bukka’s lotus feet”, something that a saÒny§sÊwould never state. This M§dhava [A] also clearly never became Vidy§raÖya (Kulke 1985:128).According to tradition at “ÜØgerÊ (Venkataraman 1959:28–39; Sawai 1985), S§yaÖa is the elder brother of Vidy§raÖya, and this and other references are explained by claiming that Vidy§raÖya was called M§dhava before his taking saÒny§sa from Vidy§áaØkaratÊrtha (=Vidy§tÊrtha), the tenth jagadguru of “ÜØgerÊ, Vidy§raÖya becom-ing the twelfth jagadguru, after Bh§ratÊtÊrtha. The editors of UVAT (1985:33), in accord with the “ÜØgerÊ tradition,123 also maintain that S§yaÖa was named Bh§ratÊtÊrtha after saÒny§sa and that the M§dhava§c§rya [B] who became Vidy§raÖya was different from the M§dhava mantrin[A] of the $Øgirasagotra who was Provincial Governor of the area that is now Goa. However, the claim of tradition that M§dhava [B] became Vidy§raÖya is impossible, not least because M§dhava [B] praises, as his guru, Bh§ratÊtÊrtha, who, according to tradition, would have been his brother with a new name.While there seems to be no doubt that there were at least two M§dhavas (one of the $Øgirasagotra [M§dhava A], and the other of the Bh§radv§jagotra [M§dhava B]), both of whom were closely involved with the Vijayanagara rulers, it is apparent from a careful consideration of both the literary and the epigraphic evidence that neither of the M§dhavas changed their name to become Vidy§raÖya,thesaÒny§sÊ (Rama Rao 1930:712–717; Filliozat 1973:135; Kulke 1985:129–132).124 In the five authentic works of M§dhava [B], partic-122Inscription no.146.123See Venkataraman (1959:29).124One of the most useful studies of the M§dhava-Vidy§raÖya identity issue is presented by Rama Rao (1930; 1931; 1934; 2000). See also Raghavan (1976). Besides M§dhava [A] and [B], Vidy§raÖya has also been identified with Vidy§m§dhava—sonof N§r§yaÖapåjyap§da of the Vasißãhagotra, author of Vidy§m§dhavÊya, an astro-nomical work—and with M§dhava, son of Indukara, author of the medical work of the sixteenth century, M§dhava-vid§na(Rama Rao 1931:82).

He also calls himself a minister (am§tya), and the bearer of the burden of sovereignty of Bukka (Kulke 1985:128). It is also apparent that M§dhava [B] was a married householder and a performer of Vedic sacrifices. In one inscription of 1377 (Mysore Archaeological Report 1915:42), M§yaÖÖa the son of M§dhava is mentioned, while the “ivatattva-ratn§kara(dated to 1709) describes M§dhava as having sons and grandsons (Rama Rao 1931:82).Throughout the works of M§dhava [B], it is Bukka I who is men-tioned as his patron; no mention is made of either Harihara I or Harihara II. The inscriptions mentioning Vidy§raÖya, however, are all of the reign of Harihara II. Moreover, the tradition relating to Vidy§raÖya, including the narratives of Nuniz and Ferishta, depicts Vidy§raÖya as having taken saÒny§sabefore Bukka I came to the throne, and as having gained the throne for Harihara I by dint of his spiritual power. Also, according to the literary tradition of themaãha-s, Vidy§raÖya was a poor Brahman, unable to marry.125TheVidy§raÖya-k§lajñ§,“ivatattva-ratn§kara and Guru-vaÒáa-k§vya also speak of Vidy§raÖya setting Harihara on the throne, yet M§dhava makes no mention of either Harihara I or Harihara II. The married M§dhava (who performs Vedic sacrifice, necessarily with his wife) and the saÒny§sÊVidy§raÖya cannot be the same person in the same period of time, in the reign of Bukka I, or later.Further, M§dhava [B] refers to himself as M§dhava in all his works. If he had become Vidy§raÖya at any time, he would have been prohibited, according to the rules of saÒny§sa, from referring to himself by his pre-saÒny§saname. Yet M§dhava never refers to himself anywhere, even by allusion, as Vidy§raÖya. Nor is an identity made between M§dhava and Vidy§raÖya in the works by the other M§dhavas previously referred to, nor in several other works from the next couple of centuries that refer to either M§dhava or Vidy§raÖya.As already observed, S§yaÖa lived into the reign of Harihara II, yet CÙÏa empire in the tenth century under Par§ntaka I (Nilakanta Sastri 1992:124);and yet another M§dhava, M§dhavatÊrtha, a disciple of $nandatÊrtha, became a vaißÖavapontiff around 1333 (Sewell and Aiyangar 1932:184 [EI, vi, 260]).125According to the MaÖimañjarÊbhedinÊandGuru-vaÒáa-k§vya(Rama Rao 1934:804).clark_BIL25a.indd 2135/30/2006 2:01:36 PM"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"chapter six214S§yaÖa refers to his brother as a performer of Vedic sacrifices, and not as a saÒny§sÊ, nor as Vidy§raÖya.

Vidy§raÖya, in his works,126 instead acknowledges Vidy§tÊrtha and his guru “aØkar§nanda.127 Despite the fact that Vidy§raÖya’s importance and role in the affairs of Vijayana-gara was most probably projected back from a later time, it is clear from inscriptional and other evidence that Vidy§tÊrtha, Bh§ratÊtÊrtha,Vidy§raÖya, S§yaÖa and M§dhava [B] played a highly significant role in the Hindu religious revival under the Vijayanagaras, primarily represented in the advaita-Ved§nta tradition established at “ÜØgerÊ.We now turn to the issue of “aØkara’s putative involvement with that tradition.6.5“aØkara and the founding of the “ÜØgerÊ maãhaTradition associates the founding of “ÜØgerÊ and the other main maãha-s with “aØkara. However, an examination of “aØkara’s hagi-ographies, undertaken in the previous chapter, revealed that there is no evidence for this in the earlier hagiographies. We will see that inscriptional evidence also reveals no connection between “aØkara 126Anubhåti-prak§ßa,VivaraÖa-prameya-saÒgrahaand Pañcadaái.The authorship of thePañcadaáiis slighly problematic, as the author first pays salutations to the lotus feet of his guru, “rÊ“aØkar§nanda (Vidy§raÖya 1975:1.1).

Vidy§raÖya’s literary activity was exaggerated in later times, first occuring in the Vidy§raÖya-k§lajñ§na, a work of semi-prophesy, composed between around 1664—after the collapse of the Vijayanagara empire—and 1709. In this work Vidy§raÖya is credited with initially composing numerous works that were then written by S§yaÖa and M§dhava, including the Veda-bh§ßya. This attribution to Vidy§raÖya is repeated in the eighteenth century Guru-vaÒáa-k§vya.Vidy§raÖya’s hagiography is contained in the MaÖi-mañjari-bhedinÊ, where he is identified with M§dhava and credited with the authorship of many works. M§dhava’s identity with Vidy§raÖya is propounded in several other works emanating from the “ÜØgerÊ and K§ñcÊmaãha-s (Rama Rao 1931:80).127There is one tradition that links Vidy§raÖya with Tantra, indicated in a list of the heads of the “ÜØgerÊmaãha, in the Gady§vali, a work on Tantric ritual by Nij§tmaprak§áayogÊndra (Antarkar 2001:48).clark_BIL25a.indd 2145/30/2006 2:01:36 PM"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"the rise and influence of advaita maãha-s215and either the founding or early history of any maãha.

It will be suggested that he can be seen as a transitional figure in the shift from $gamic “aivism—represented by the previously powerful K§l§mukhas, Mattamayåras and “aiva-Siddh§ntins—to a new Brahmanical advaitainstitution that was established at “ÜØgerÊ.“aØkara has been shown to be vaißÖava, and it will become evident that his immediate disciples were also vaißÖava. It will also be argued that it is improbable that “aØkara inaugurated either devÊworship or the sm§rtatradition at “ÜØgerÊ, with which tradition credits him. Finally, it will be suggested that “aØkara’s projection onto the “ÜØgerÊproject, and the attachment of specific legends to his name con-cerning the founding of maãha-s and the instigation of an order of ascetics, developed in a three-stage process.We will first consider the earliest evidence of any maãhaat“ÜØgerÊ.The two oldest inscriptions at “ÜØgerÊ, found in the P§rávan§tha basti, date from 1150 and 1160. The first praises the Jina-á§sana,and the second contains information about a donation from Jaina merchants, indicating that Jainism was established in “ÜØgerÊ in the twelfth century (Kulke 1985:132). It is known that the South Kanara district of Karnataka was long a stronghold of Jainism, which received considerable patronage after the advent of Hoysala power (Ramesh 1970:298). A Hoysala feudatory, Lokan§thadevarasa, was a Jaina, and an inscription from 1334 records land-grants to the bastiof “§ntin§tha, built at K§rakaÏa by the disciples of the Jaina precep-tor Kumudacandra-bhaãã§rakadeva. The $Ïupa ruler, Kulaáekhara III, was also an active supporter of Jainism, as shown by inscrip-tions dated 1384 at Må·abidure, when he made grants to the Jaina tÊrthaØkara P§rávan§tha, and worshipped at the feet of the Jaina pre-ceptor C§rukÊrti. However, the $Ïupas were predominantly áaiva, as were the early Vijayanagara rulers.The first record of any kind concerning an advaitapresence at “ÜØgerÊ dates to 1346 (UVAT 1985:71–73), an inscription in which obeisance to “ambhu (“iva) and Vidy§tÊrtha is stated. It records the visit of the five brothers—on the occasion of the vijayotsava—and the donation of land for the maintenance of Bh§ratÊtÊrtha (who, as we have seen, is an advaita-ved§ntin), his disciples and forty Brahmans. clark_BIL25a.indd 2155/30/2006 2:01:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"chapter six216But this inscription only refers to “ÜØgerÊ as a tÊrtha, and not as a having a maãha.The first mention of a maãha at “ÜØgerÊ is in 1356, when Bukka I donated villages for the maintenance of those at the “ÜØgerÊmaãha (Kulke 1985:132).128 While we cannot be certain that there was no advaita maãhaat“ÜØgerÊ much before 1356, some cir-cumstantial evidence may indicate the former presence of Jainas, as Bh§ratÊtÊrtha is praised as having demolished the teachings of the Jainas and Buddhists.129An outstanding puzzle is the precise sectarian situation at “ÜØgerÊjust before the founding of a maãha.As mentioned previously, Vidy§tÊrtha left no written works. But in both texts and inscriptions, Vidy§tÊrtha is referred to as a Maheávara,130which may possibly indicate a “aiva-Siddh§ntin. However, as noted at the beginning of this section, Bh§ratÊtÊrtha did leave a text, which is advaita-ved§ntin in perspective.The exact processes which led to the establishing of anadvaita-ved§ntamonastic tradition are hard to determine.From the time of the first recorded Vijayanagara grant to “ÜØgerÊ,in 1346, until Vidy§raÖya’s death in 1386, donations to the advaita maãha increased enormously, multiplying approximately five-fold in that period, indicating the importance of “ÜØgerÊ to the Vijayanagara rulers.131 However, neither the grant of 1380, previously referred to, confirming all previous grants, nor any other inscription, give any indication that there was any kind of institution at the site receiving any kind of income prior to the first grants in 1346. The “ÜØgerÊ128Tradition credits Vidy§raÖya with establishing eight advaita maãha-s, but this remains uncorroborated. Besides “ÜØgerÊ two other advaita maãha-s are known from records, one being the Vidy§raÖya-sv§mÊmaãha, centred on a well, and located to the west of the Viråp§kßa temple at Vijayanagara. This maãhawas associated with the“ÜØgerÊmaãha and is referred to in an inscription of KÜßÖadevar§ya from 1515, but the date of the foundation of themaãha is uncertain and disputed. The head of the maãhain the 1990s, NarasiÒhabh§ratÊ, traces his lineage from Vidy§raÖya. The other advaita maãhais the Cint§maÖimaãhain$negondi, believed to have been established in the early fourteenth century (Verghese 1995:116).129Kulke (1985:133); ARMAD (1933:211–218, l.66ff.).130See Mallappa (1974:28): Vidy§tÊrtha is referred to as a Maheávara in EC VI,“g 2, 5, 12, 14, 24, 28; in the works of S§yaÖa; at the end of every chapter ofAnubhuti Prak§áa; the beginning and end of every part of the Veda-bh§ßya; at the beginning and end of JÊvanmuktiviveka; and in “aØkar§nanda’sBÜhad§raÖya-dÊpik§.131In the first ten years, from 1346 to 1356, the income from the villages at “ÜØgerÊ amounted to between 250 and 360 gady§Öa-s (=610 g.). During Vidy§raÖya’s stay at “ÜØgerÊ, income was between 1419 and 1871 gady§Öa-s (Kulke 1985:133).clark_BIL25a.indd 2165/30/2006 2:01:38 PM"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"the rise and influence of advaita maãha-s217maãhacontinued to be endowed with grants by the later SaØgamas, Bukka II giving an endowment for the maintenance of the library there in 1406. More land was given by Devar§ya II in 1431, and by Mallik§rjuna in 1451. The N§yakas of KeÏadi (Shimoga district) established an independent state from 1499 to 1763, and continued the support of the “ÜØgerÊmaãha originally instituted by the Vijay-anagaras (Shastry 1987).As we have seen, the Vijayanagara inscriptions bestow praise on various deities, including “iva, GaÖeáa, Viråp§kßa and R§macandra;and the §c§rya-s“rÊkaÖãhan§tha, Vidy§tÊrtha, Bh§ratÊtÊrtha and Vidy§raÖya. Given that the eulogies in many of the inscriptions are quite lengthy, and considering that “aØkara is so intimately connected to“ÜØgerÊ in later tradition, it is remarkable that “aØkar§c§rya is not mentioned in any inscription. In an inscription of 1346 praise is bestowed on Vidy§tÊrtha, Bh§ratÊtÊrtha, and on Vidy§raÖya’s knowl-edge of advaya(advaita) (UVAT 1985:116, v. 10), yet “aØkara, later so particularly associated with advaita, is not mentioned. In a ka·ita copy of Harihara’s inscription of 1380, Bh§ratÊtÊrtha is praised for defeating Bhaããa (Kum§rila), but here also no mention is made of “aØkara (Kulke 1985:134), who, as recalled, defeated Kum§rila in debate in the hagiographies. Shastry (1982:7) also comments on the “rÊ-purußottama-bh§ratÊ-carita, the manuscript of which is to be found in the archives of “ÜØgerÊ. Composed by “VißÖu”, and belonging to the fifteenth century, the first three chapters give an account of the§c§rya-s of “ÜØgerÊ, from Vidy§áaØkara to Candraáekharabh§ratÊII, and the other nine chapters deal with Purußottamabh§ratÊ, until his assumption of the pontificate at HaÒpe, and his taking over the administration of the “ÜØgerÊmaãha. Here also, remarkably, no mention is made of “aØkara.It was suggested in Chapter 5 that “aØkara was relatively unknown during his life-time, and probably for several centuries after, as there is no mention of him in Buddhist or Jaina sources for some centuries; nor is he mentioned by other important philosophers of the ninth and tenth centuries, notably the Ny§ya-Vaiáeßikas,áaiva adherents of a philosophy favoured, as we have seen, by the K§l§mukhar§ja-guru-s. Potter (1977, Vol. 1:15) remarks that even the advaitasystem scarcely receives any mention by Ny§ya-Vaiáeßikas until the time of “rÊharßa(c.1075–1125), who critiques Ny§ya and espouses Ved§nta.Our brief survey of the inscriptional evidence from “ÜØgerÊ and K§ñcÊ also reveals no trace of the name of “aØkara, even in the four-clark_BIL25a.indd 2175/30/2006 2:01:39 PM"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"chapter six218teenth century, after the founding of the “ÜØgerÊmaãha.It has been argued that “aØkara’s religious orientation was distinctly vaißÖava. However, the prime religious orientation of the early SaØgamas, theirr§ja-guru-s, and the early advaitapontiffs, was distinctly áaiva. We have seen that Vidy§tÊrtha, the first pontiff claimed by “ÜØgerÊto have any genuine inscriptional reference, is also referred to as a Maheávara, a sect which, as we have seen, was commented on by “aØkara with particular condemnation.If we examine the works of “aØkara’s immediate disciples it is also apparent, as first observed by Hacker (1995:38), that they and nearly all the early advaitaphilosophers up to the tenth century were vaißÖava, “in a restricted sense of the word”. This is apparent from the introductory invocations (maØgal§caraÖa) to the available works of“aØkara’s disciples.Toãaka begins his “rutis§ra-samuddh§raÖamwith an invocation to Hari; Vy§sa is also mentioned.132 The other references in the text that might provide a specific clue to Toãaka’s religious orientation are in verse 85, where he refers to “rÊ R§ma; verse 148, where he refers to Hari (of the BhagavadgÊt§) as the teacher of all teachers; and the final verse, v. 179, where he bows down to Lord VißÖu. Toãaka makes no reference anywhere to “iva, and is particularly critical of the S§Òkhya, Ny§ya and Vaiáeßika systems.133Sureávara also offers obeisance to VißÖu in the first verse of his Naißkarmyasiddhi,134 and refers to omniscient Hari at IV.64; at IV.76 he states that ““aØkara obtained through the power of his yoga the knowledge which reveals the abode of VißÖu and which destroys the entire world of bondage”.ThePañcap§dik§,, the work of Padmap§da135—another of “aØkara’sdisciples—begins with three invocations.136 The first is to the eternal brahman; the second is to B§dar§yaÖa (author of the Ved§ntasåtra/Brahmasåtra); the third is to his teacher “aØkara, who is described as being without the “enjoyment” of a family, or Um§, without vibhåti 132See Comans (trans., 1996).

This might be contrasted with a description of, for example, Sad§áivasarasvatÊ, pontiff of the K§ñcÊmaãha, who was referred to in an inscription of 1527 as an incarnation of “iva, wear-ing holy ash and rudr§kßa-m§l§. There is little in the Pañcap§dik§to indicate Padmap§da’s religious orientation. However, at one point, when discussing Brahman (I.3.49)137 Padmap§da refers to the (tran-sient) bliss of HiraÖyagarbhaloka (the abode of KÜßÖa), and then quotes from the BhagavadgÊt§. At Pañcap§dik§ II.5.12, Padmap§da refers to the sentient HiraÖyagarbha (the ‘Lord’ who is also subject to transmigration), beyond whom lies Brahman. No genuine works are available for Hast§malaka,“aØkara’s fourth disciple.138Sarvajñ§tman, author of the SaØkßepaá§rÊraka, was a pupil of Sureávara. In the introductory invocation he invokes VißÖu,139 and then, having saluted Vy§sa,“rÊ“aØkara and “rÊ Sureávara (vv. 6–8), states that the obstacles [to writing the treatise] have been removed by “my preceptor’s contemplation on Lord N§r§yaÖa” (v. 10). Inter-estingly, as noted by Veezhinathan in his introduction to the text, Sarvajñ§tman140 is associated with the K§makoãipÊãha at K§ñcÊ.According to tradition he took saÒny§sa directly from “aØkara, and was nominated successor to the maãha, with Sureávara, his preceptor, as his protector.However, is apparent that there is something odd about aspects of the traditional account here. As discussed in the previous chapter, inthe“aØkarite tradition the K§makoãipÊãha at K§ñcÊ is particularly associated with “aivism. This is substantiated in other sources also. Appar (seventh century), one of the sixty-three N§yaÖ§rs, refers to áaiva maãha-s at K§ñcÊ (Balambal 1999:32), and makes one of the earli-137Venkataramiah’s edition, p. 209.138To Hast§malaka is attributed the Hast§malakaálok§È, but this is probably spu-rious (Potter 1981, Vol. 3:19).

Campantar, Appar’s contemporary, refers to “iva in union with K§makoãi of “Kacci”, which refers to K§m§kßÊ of K§ñcÊ. The áaiva bhaktaCuntarar, who lived in the eighth century, also refers to thek§makkoããam of K§ñcÊ (Nagaswamy 1982:204–207). The term k§makoãiwas used, from the eleventh century onwards, to refer to ammaÖshrines,141 but crucially, from the time of Appar, k§makoãi referred to the consort of “iva. The K§makoãipÊãha, as currently constituted, was built during the reign of “rÊraØgar§ya in the late sixteenth century (Balambal 1999:39),142 though the present K§m§kßÊ temple may well be at the same site visited by Cuntarar (Nagaswamy 1982:207). As observed in the previous chapter, it was only in 1686 that the name “aØkar§c§rya first appears in inscriptions of the maãha.The earliest inscriptional records of the pontiffs of the K§ñcÊmaãha, dating from 1290, also clearly show that the pontiffs of the maãhawereáaiva.Yet the first three advaita saÒny§sÊ-s claimed by the K§ñcÊ tradition, namely “aØkara, Sureávara and Sarvajñ§tman, are evidentlyvaißÖava.In the previous chapter, Hacker’s (1995:38–39) suggestion was considered, that the reason behind the rivalry between “aØkara and MaÖ·anamiára, as portrayed in the hagiographies of “aØkara, was most probably that MaÖ·anamiára was a áaiva, which would have been in distinction from almost all other advaita ved§ntin-s of the time (when, it should be added, religious affiliation was not a trivial affair). This is not to say that political or hagiographical expedience may not transcend religious sensibilities. 141From the thirteenth century onwards, devÊshrines, known as ammaÖshrines, became a prominent feature of temple worship in Tamil Nadu. Although from at least the eighth century devÊimages in the temple were common, separate shrines for thedevÊas part of the temple complex were rare until the thirteenth century. Among the most important devÊ-s were Durg§, Jyeßãh§ (the fearsome sister of LakßmÊ), and the Sapta-M§tÜk§s. From the eleventh century onwards, the ammaÖshrines were invariably called k§makoããam or tiruk§makoããamin all temples, whence the name of the K§makoãipÊãha at K§ñcÊ. Folk goddeses, worshipped most probably since very ancient times at the village level, first started gaining prestige in south India in the CÙÏa period (985–1050). Absorbed into the religious practice of temple culture, devÊ-s were associated with both “aivism and VaißÖavism. After the eleventh century, ammaÖ shrines, those devoted to P§rvatÊ or Um§, gradually replaced other, older devÊshrines. By the fourteenth century, most “iva temples had such a shrine, known as ak§makoããam.DevÊ, with many names, also appeared as the consort of VißÖu in the mainvaißÖavacentres of south India, enjoying a universalisation in the company of Pur§Öic deities (Stein 1973:77–80; Nagaswamy 1982:204–206; Stein 1999:238).142ARE 1954–1959:no. 349.clark_BIL25a.indd 2205/30/2006 2:01:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"the rise and influence of advaita maãha-s221Regarding the various traditions that were to become subsumed under the umbrella of ‘Hindu’—a process that properly began in the early sixteenth century—pre-Muslim religious orientation in India was distinctly sectarian and non-universalist. The significance of this, in the context of religious identity, will be explored in the following chapter. An analysis of a manual on påj§for priests (Påj§-pad-paddhati), the eleventh-century Somaáambhu-paddhatiof Somaáambhu (probably south Indian), is pertinent in this respect. The removal of liØga(internal ‘marks’ of a previous religion) was a fundamental process in initiation into “aivism; there was no question of ‘equality of faiths’, as the removal of the liØgaremoved all the merit that may have been acquired while following the previous creed (Stietencron 1995:56–63). As there is considerable evidence that “aØkara and his immediate disciples were vaißÖava, there is all the more reason to doubt their connection with the early monastic tradition of either “ÜØgerÊ or K§ñcÊpuram.The monastic traditions that developed at “ÜØgerÊ and K§ñ-cÊpuram, as represented in the works that we have at our disposal from the hand of the early known (as opposed to hagiographically presented) pontiffs, were essentially and distinctly orthodox. As has been indicated, they were essentially áaiva, yet, in accord with Brahmanical tradition, sm§rta orthodoxy was demonstrated by their acknowledgement of the Vedaas the ultimate source of knowledge. In this, the advaitapontiffs and their strictly Brahmanical cohorts were somewhat distinct from the K§l§mukhas, Mattamayåras and “aiva-Siddh§ntins who had been so influential and powerful in previous centuries.143 These sects, while accepting the Veda, as we have seen, laid prime emphasis on the $gama. They did not deny the authority of other texts to other traditions: simply, religious traditions were hierarchised, and within their own orders, $gamic“aivism was at the apex. After the fourteenth century the influence and estates of the K§l§mukha and Mattamayåra orders significantly declined, their role to a significant extent being eclipsed by the new and heavily patronisedsm§rta advaita maãha-s. Thesm§rtatradition, centred on “ÜØgerÊ, may have also been com-peting with “rÊ-VaißÖavism. Suryanaran Sastri (1930:42, 74) remarks 143It may be noted that the áaivasects under discussion were also significantly inflenced by Tantra (see Lorenzen 1991:3–7).clark_BIL25a.indd 2215/30/2006 2:01:42 PM"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"chapter six222that under the CÙÏas VaißÖavism had found little favour, but that there is evidence that the influence of R§m§nuja’s movement, open to all castes,144 engendered a new aggression by vaißÖava-s against áaiva-s.145Haradatta (d.1119), for example, was forced to defend his áaivateachings in public, seated on a red-hot tripod, and wrote the Hari-hara-t§ratamya, which Sastri (1930:74) describes as “a monument of sectarianism, such as could have been called forth only by the intolerant spirit of a religion on the upward and onward march”.It was previously noted that one of the most important philo -sophers of the early mediaeval period was the áaiva advaitin“rÊkaÖãha,a K§l§mukha (also referred to as a “aiva-Siddh§ntin) who most probably lived in the early twelfth century. He is mentioned in a Vija-yanagara inscription (UVAT 1985:80–83) as a teacher of Bhogan§tha(minister to SaØgama II), and as a form of Paáupati who expounds a new Maheávara doctrine (vv. 12–13). “rÊkaÖãha argued for the author-ity both of the Veda (including the Upanißad-s) and the áaiva$gama-s, and his role in attempting to harmonise the two traditions has been compared with a parallel task undertaken by R§m§nuja—around the same time as “rÊkaÖãha—to harmonise P§ñcar§tra$gama with the Veda (Suryanarayana Sastri 1930:11). A crucial difference, of course, is that while the six-fold path of the áaiva$gama-s is open to all varÖa-s,theVedais only for the ears of the twice-born. The áaiva-orientated advaitaof“rÊkaÖãha may be understood as the bridge between the more Tantric K§l§mukhas and the orthodox sm§rtaáaivatradition that developed at the advaita maãha-s sponsored by the Vijayanagaras. It is perhaps partly in response to the situation outlined above that the early hagiographers found “aØkara’s orthodox Vedic position146and philosophical erudition so suitable for elaboration into a digvi-jaya.“aØkara’s orthodox position would, of course, have been fully acceptable to Brahmans.We now turn, finally, to the tradition that “aØkara inaugurated bothsm§rtaanddevÊworship at “ÜØgerÊ.

There are at least twelve divisions amongst sm§rta-s, four of them being Va·agalai, and six of them being TeØgalai, the two main divisions of “rÊ-VaißÖavism (Nilakanta Sastri 1992:113). Sm§rta practice in Karnataka, in general, has long been to apply the tripuÖ·ra, but the followers of Madhva apply a distinguishing single vertical line (Zydenbos 2001:120).

The two southern maãha-s were written into the hagiographies to enhance their status as resorts of “aØkara, the saviour of the Vedic tradition. This has created the legacy of a continuing dispute, resting on the irony that “aØkara probably founded neither maãha.150Hacker (1995:29) also believes that “aØkara was transformed into a áaiva folk-hero in a reconstruction of Hinduism—in the face of Muslim aggression—by his hagiographers, but wrongly attributes the project to Vidy§raÖya (assisted by S§yaÖa).clark_BIL25a.indd 2245/30/2006 2:01:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"the rise and influence of advaita maãha-s225Several conclusions may be drawn concerning the development of the hagiography of “aØkara, and the final attribution to him of the founding of an order of renunciates and four maãha-s.1)“aØkara’s connection with “ÜØgerÊ and K§ñcÊ was established some time after the founding of any advaita maãhain either of those places; this connection was perhaps first made in the fourteenth or fifteenth century in the earlier hagiographies which, as we have seen, contain no reference to his establishing any maãha.The“aØkaravijaya of Anant§nandagiri, perhaps the earliest of the hagiographies, dated perhaps to post-fourteenth century (Bader 2000:24), and associated with K§ñcÊ, is unique amongst the hagiographies in that it contains no reference to the four disciples of “aØkara, instead providing an account of twelve disciples who accompanied “aØkara when he went to see his guru (Bader 2000:258–259).2) The next stage in the elaboration of “aØkara’s hagiography was to attribute to him four main disciples and the founding of a maãha in either K§ñcÊ or “ÜØgerÊ (depending which stream of hagiography is referred to).3) The third stage of hagiographic projection is to attribute to “aØkara the founding of four maãha-s in the four quarters of India under four disciples. This stage, I believe, most probably coincides with the production of the Maãh§mn§ya-s, which both affirmed “aØka-ra’s conquest of the four quarters, and also integrated into that picture “aØkara’s founding of an order of ascetics, many lineages of which, up until the time of the dissemination of the integrated picture, had no connection to the orthodox traditions represented by the advaita maãha-s.

His pupil, NarasiÒh§árama,became one of the most reputed teachers of Ved§nta in the early half of the sixteenth century (Dasgupta 1975, Vol. II:53–55).155Unravelling lineages in terms of orders is inherently complex, given that orders may flourish or decline, that many people of historical importance bear the same name, and that lineages may bifurcate into orders with different religious or philosophical positions. While theseadvaitaVed§ntin-s are unquestionably in what might be called the philosophical parampar§of“aØkara, citing his arguments and works, this, I would suggest, is quite different from maintaining that these authors believed—whether they did or not—that they were of asaÒny§sÊorder begun by “aØkara, moreover a family also compris-ing militant Giris, PurÊs and Bh§ratÊs.The social, religious and political processes that may have been behind the integration of diverse lineages into an orthodox order is the central issue addressed in the following chapter.152His guru was Advay§nandasarasvatÊ.

If “aØkara did not found the Daáan§mÊs, then what is needed is some kind of explanation of when and why the order might have come into existence as a recognisable entity.In this chapter, the context for the formation of the Daáan§mÊs as a distinct order will be explored, the central hypothesis being that the Daáan§mÊ order formed in response to religious and political developments, some time in the late sixteenth and seventeenth cen-turies. The formation of an order essentially integrated two sets of disparate and previously unconnected lineages pertaining to the n§g§and monastic traditions. It is suggested that around the time of the formation of the akh§Ü§-s of the Daáan§mÊs, a Daáan§mÊ identity was created—encapsulated in the all-India purview of the Maãh§mn§ya-s—integrating monastic and military saÒny§sÊ-s, and enhancing thelegitimacy of both sets of lineages, the instigation of which was attributed to “aØkara. As indicated in Chapter 2, of the thirteen militantakh§Ü§-s currently functioning in India, the six non-Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s1 are believed to have formed in this period, and it seems most probable that the Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s also formed around the same time, notwithstanding claims to greater antiquity.1The three Bair§gÊ (R§m§nandÊ)akh§Ü§-s, and the three Sikh-affiliated akh§Ü§-s (the Nirmala and the two Ud§sinakh§Ü§-s).clark_BIL25a.indd 2275/30/2006 2:01:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"chapter seven2287.1The formation of militant ascetic ordersAs early as the eighth century, P§áupata ascetics were armed by guilds to protect trade (Davidson 2002:80).2 Lorenzen (1978) provides other examples of Indian fighting ascetics in the early mediaeval period. In a frequently cited reference to fighting ascetics in the KabÊra Bijaka(Abhilash Das 1997:56–57 [RamainÊ69]), most probably written in the mid-sixteenth century, scorn is poured on yogÊ-s, siddha-s, mahant-s and ascetics who resort to arms, keep women and collect property and ‘taxes’.3 Besides the Mad§rifakÊr-s (see below), the first groups of mercenary ascetics to be in any way organised appear to have been the N§ths4 (Orr 1940:6) and the SaÒny§sÊs. Perhaps the earli-est recorded confrontation between ascetic fighters is that recorded in Abu-l-Faíl’s Akbar-n§ma (1972:422–424)5 when rival groups of SaÒny§sÊs and ‘JogÊs’ (N§ths) clashed, watched by Akbar, in the late sixteenth century.6 Other organised militant orders, such as the early Sikh kh§ls§,7 the Ud§sin and Nirmala orders,8 D§dåpanthÊ,92In the eleventh century, King Harßa (Harßadeva) (r.1089–1101), short of funds, raided temples for icons he could melt down. He employed groups of naked ascetics, who defiled the temples with spittle and excrement. Basham (1951:206) believes they may have been $jÊvikas.3This particular section of the Bijaka appears to have been written not only after the time of KabÊr, but also some time after the battle of Panipat in 1526, as firearms are referred to; firearms were used for the first time on a large scale on Indian soil during this battle (Lorenzen 1978:61). Lorenzen (1992:9–12) dates KabÊr to between the mid-fifteenth century and c.1525.4N§th-YogÊs maintained a stronghold at the gorge at Galt§ (near Jaipur) until usurped by militant vaißÖava-s in the sixteenth century (Orr 1940:8). The state of Jodhpur (and the wider area of Marw§r) was heavily influenced by the N§ths in the first half of the nineteenth century, particularly in relation to the rise to power of M§n Singh, whose guru was Ayas Dev N§th (assassinated in 1815). N§ths were also an element in the Jodhpur army (see Gold 1996; White 2001:9–19). In royal chronicles of Rajasthan, Kumaun and Nepal may be found accounts of how par-ticular N§th-Siddhas use yogic powers and intrigue to install patrons favourable to them on the throne (White 2001:5–6). ‘Siddhas’ were not only heterdox power brokers: the famous eleventh-century writer and Tantric, Abhinavagupta, was also asiddha(see Muller-Ortega 1989:60–61).5Referred to in Ch. 2.1.6In his Memoirs, Jah§ngir (r.1605–1628) reports not less than two or three thou-sand people attending contests at arenas for athletes or pugilists, at places such as Agra and Lahore. However, it is not known what proportion of them were in the hands of sects like the D§dåpanthÊs or Gosains (Kolff 1990:28).7According to the Sikh tradition, the kh§ls§(‘brotherhood’) was founded in 1699 by Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth guru in descent from N§nak, the founder of the clark_BIL25a.indd 2285/30/2006 2:01:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities229R§m§nandÊ (Bair§gÊ),10 NimbarkÊ and R§dh§vallabhÊn§g§-s,11 all formed between the time of Akbar and the eighteenth century, with a substantial recruitment of low-caste áådra-s into Sikh, R§m§nandÊand Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s (Pinch 1996:26–27).

However, it appears that the kh§ls§formed gradually from bands of roving warriors, during most of the eighteenth century, as an element in the expansion of Punjabi J§ãs, and the consequent reaction of the Mughals (McLeod 1976:1–19, 51). The NihaØgs, soldier ascetics (also referred to as Ak§lis), a subdivision within thekh§ls§, were formed, according to tradition, in 1690, by M§n Singh (see Far-quhar 1925a:340).8The Ud§sin order was founded, according to tradition, by “rÊ Cand, during the seventeenth century, as was the other Sikh-related akh§Ü§, the Nirmala (see Singh 1951:64; Ahuja 1994; Oberoi 1997:124–127). However, the Sikh orders are more accurately understood as a continuation, within a new community, of an already extant ascetic tradition with significant correspondences with the N§ths, including particular respect for haãha-yogapractices, and a reverence for the dhå§n(=dhånÊ)(McLeod 1980:35 fn. 2, 103, 203). The three militant, ascetic, Sikh-related orders are the NihaØg, Ud§sin and Nirmala.9Towards the end of Akbar’s reign, D§då (d.1604), a cotton-cleaner from Ahmad-abad, organised a new sect of R§ma devotees, the D§dåpanth, which comprises virakta-s (ascetics), vastradh§rin-s (householders), and n§g§-s (kh§kÊ[ash-clad]virakta-s). The D§dåpanth n§g§-s had a prominent role in the armies of some princes, notably in Jodhpur, and still retain a small akh§Ü§that bathes with the Nirmohi anÊat Kumbh Mel§s. The D§dåpanthÊs claim that their n§g§-s are descended from Sundard§s, a disciple of D§då, and thus from the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century. Although the genealogy of the D§dåpanthÊn§g§-s may possibly have begun around the mid-seventeenth century at the earliest, firm records are only available from the second half of the eighteenth century; they were officially constituted in 1756 (Thiel-Horstmann 1991:257, 268–269). According to Orr (1940:15) the D§dåpanthÊsfirst fought alongside the R§m§nandÊs, and then set up their own akh§Ü§.10ThevaißÖava R§m§nandÊs appear to have constituted their military branches between approximately 1650 and 1720 (Ghurye 1964:177; [Thiel-] Horstmann 2001). According to R§m§nandÊ tradition, the decision to arm vaißÖavaascetics was taken at the meeting of the catuÈ samprad§yaat Galta (near Jaipur), in 1713 (Burghart 1978b). However, R§m§nandÊs were already armed and organised by 1693 (see below).11According to Orr (1940:10–17), the R§dh§vallabhÊs joined ranks with the NimbarkÊs, while armed VißÖusv§mÊ militants entered the service of R§ja Bijay Singh of Jodhpur as mercenaries in 1779, as one of sixteen fighting akh§Ü§-s (seven akh§Ü§-s were R§m§nandÊ; seven NimbarkÊ; one Madhva; one VißÖusv§mÊ). SaÒny§sÊsand VißÖusv§mÊs continued to serve the Jodhpur state for nearly a century, until they were finally disbanded by Mah§r§ja Jasvant Singh in 1875. Up to the early twentieth century, the Jaipur state maintained a force of 5,500 n§g§-s, comprising mostly D§dåpanthÊs, but also NÊm§vats (NimbarkÊs) and R§dh§vallabhÊs. SaÒny§sÊs,D§dåpanthÊs and VißÖusv§mÊs were still employed in the Bundi and Koãa states until 1915.clark_BIL25a.indd 2295/30/2006 2:01:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"chapter seven230Muslims—such as the massacre of a large number of devotees at Haridv§r by Timur in 1398 (Nevill 1909a:254)—it seems that the formation of the saÒny§sÊakh§Ü§-s was not primarily in response to Muslim harassment. Many follow Farquhar (1925b:483), who believes that MadhusådanasarasvatÊ (1540–1647), the well-known Ved§ntin philosopher, approached Emperor Akbar (1542–1605) to seek advice on the protection of the order to which he belonged from harassment by armed Muslim fakÊr-s. He was advised by his trusted R§ja Birbal, who was present, to initiate a large number of non-Brahmans. Thus were many kßatriya-s andvaiáya-s—and, says Farquhar, “multitudes of áådra-s at a later date”—admitted into the order. It is said that half the Bh§ratÊs refused to accept this and went to “ÜØgerÊ to remain ‘pure’, thus making three-and-one-half lineages ‘pure’. The recruitment of n§g§-s into fighting units appears to have taken place around the time of Akbar’s reign, although it is unlikely to have been a specific response to harassment by militant SåfÊs.12 Farquhar’s conclusion was based on anecdotal evidence, and the historical evidence (see Ch. 2.1) indicates that the main conflicts of the period were between sects of Hindu renunciates—more specifically between vaißÖavaBhair§gÊsandáaivaSaÒny§sÊs13(also known as gosain-s)—rather than between saÒny§sÊ-s and militant SåfÊ orders (Sikand 1998). A further problem with Farquhar’s thesis is that Akbar is recorded witnessing a fight betweensaÒny§sÊ-s and yogÊ-s (see Al-Bad§oni 1986 Vol. 2:94–95; Abu-l-Faíl 1972:422–424), illustrating that militant Hindu orders were already in existence in some form during his reign, but perhaps organised only within the previous few decades.14 R§m§nandÊ and 12Although the story of the founding of the akh§Ü§-s cannot be confirmed, it seems that MadhusådanasarasvatÊ may have had a connection with Akbar’s court (Halbfass 1983:88).13Although a distinct ‘Hindu’ identity seems to have formed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (see below), significant disputes concerning sectarian Hindu identity persisted well into the nineteenth century. In the Kachava kingdom of Amber-Jaipur a major dispute finally erupted in 1864 concerning vaißÖavaandáaiva affiliation. Under Mah§r§ja R§msingh II, zealous áaiva-s had chased vaißÖava-s from the capital of the kingdom, Jaipur. For many months the wearing of the vertical vaißÖava tilak had been effectively banned, and only those wearing the horizontal three-linetilakwere to be seen in the streets (Clémentin-Ojha 1999:349).14Lorenzen (1978:62–64) believes that the various fighting orders that emerged in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries—in response to social, economic and political change—may be divided into two broad groups: those movements con-cerned with the protection of specific, local, economic and social interests; and clark_BIL25a.indd 2305/30/2006 2:01:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities231D§dåpanthÊ traditions maintain that their military organisation was in response to the aggressive activities of the saÒny§sÊ-s. However, the evidence indicates that n§g§military activity flourished under direct state patronage,15 and was not primarily religiously sectarian, even though inter-sectarian battles did take place at Hindu mel§-s.The organisation of saÒny§sÊ-s and other ascetics into military akh§Ü§-s can be understood as a relatively seamless transition between the two lifestyles of n§g§and soldier: both require rigorous self-disci-pline, and an adaptability to harsh conditions. The travelling jam§tis perfectly adaptable to a military unit, with its command struc-ture, information network, and proficiency in practical camping and cooking arrangements over wide areas of India. Soldiers, naked and theoretically beyond identifiable caste, are cel§-s of a commander, who performs the religious rituals of his sect, thus increasing the bond of the unit. In mediaeval India, asceticism, trade and war were by no means incompatible (see Kolff 1990:77). Some western commentators have been challenged to reconcile the idealised ascetic striving for mokßa—referred to in the Introduction—with militant saÒny§sÊ-s (see Lochtefeld 1994). However, if the practice of tapas (‘asceticism’) is considered in its Indian context, epic and Pur§Öic material illustrates how tapasalmost invariably leads to boons and the acquisition of material powers, and also frequently of magical weaponry with which to overcome and kill adversaries.16 The pow-ers of militant, ash-covered gosain-s are quite reconcilable with their those involved in popular, sometimes regional, rebellion against central authority. However, the categories are not entirely distinct, as different groups operate in both domains. Lorenzen categorises the Sikhs, broadly, in the second group, while the Daáan§mÊn§g§-s, he maintains, formed for the protection of non-n§g§land and monastic property. Though the Daáan§mÊn§g§-s may have protected monastic property, there are no available historical records of this.15For example, in the reign of Aurangzeb (1658–1707), under an imperial decree of 1692–1693, five R§m§nandÊ commanders were authorised to move freely about the whole empire, with standards and kettledrums, and without hindrance, in charge of foot and horse-mounted soldiers (Orr 1940:9).16Pinch (1997:12–15) comments on the historical change in attitude towards tapas, comparing V§lmÊki’sR§m§yaÖa(usually dated to around the first century) wth theR§mcaritm§nasof TulsÊd§s (c.1543–1623), particularly in the B§lak§Ö·a. In short: V§lmÊki elevates it, in the traditional way, as leading to power; but TulsÊd§s pours scorn on tapas, prefering bhakti.Pinch suggests that this shift in attitude is a reflection of the change in the social attitude of the times towards religious ascetics, evinced by the activities at the time of armed, marauding gosain-s and fakÊr-s. Disdain for this kind of lifestyle was also shared by the nirguÖÊ bhakta KabÊr.clark_BIL25a.indd 2315/30/2006 2:01:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"chapter seven232mythological counterparts. In the construction of an identity for the Daáan§mÊs, the lifestyles and activities of both monastic monks and armed, ash-covered gosain-s are equally valid within the framework of traditional Hinduism.7.2The development of SåfÊ institutions in IndiaIf we consider SåfÊ institutions in India, many aspects of their devel-opment seem to provide a plausible rationale for a parallel institution-alisation of the Daáan§mÊ order. The first SåfÊ settlements in India17date from the eighth century (Siddiqi 1989:14).18 Another wave of SåfÊ Shaikhs, who migrated from Khurasan (western Afghanistan/Iran) to Delhi during the time of the Delhi sultanate, were distinctly militant, and did not always exhibit the pietistic attitude that some writers have extolled, their wrath leading to “the discomfiture, misery and often death of those who presumed to oppose [them]” (Digby 1986:60). Between the thirteenth and eighteenth centuries, Bijapur (also known as the BahmanÊ state) was a SåfÊ stronghold in India. The BahmanÊ state was a region contiguous and frequently at war with Vijayanagara, with which it had considerable structural similarities (Eaton 2002:160–166). At its height in the mid-seventeenth century, the Bijapur sultanate was one of the largest and most powerful states in the subcontinent, second only to the Mughal empire. The first SåfÊs to enter the Bijapur plateau arrived in the late thirteenth century (Eaton 1997:36–48), and were what might be called ‘war-rior SåfÊs’, who are virtually indistinguishable in many respects from Daáan§mÊn§g§-s. The first of these warrior SåfÊs to gain renown was Shaikh SåfÊ Sarmast (d.1281),19 who, with his army of seven hundred gh§zÊ-s (‘religious soldiers’)—according to his hagiography—killed 17The first Muslim conquest in the subcontinent was of the Sindh region, in 711/712, by Ibn al-Qasim (see Schimmel 1980:3–4).18The first major SåfÊ to settle in the subcontinent was al-HujwÊrÊ (c.1009–1071). Called D§t§ Ganj Bakhsh by his followers, he is the author of the first major trea-tise on Såfism in Persian, the Kashf al-maÈjåb.His tomb (in Lahore) subsequently became a ‘gateway’, visited by all SåfÊs who migrated to the subcontinent (Rizvi 1978:112–113; Schimmel 1982:3).19All dates in this and the following sections are given as CE. For the conver-sion of dates—given in many sources according to the Muslim calendar (A.H.)—to other calendars, see Sewell and DÊkshit (1896:105ff.).clark_BIL25a.indd 2325/30/2006 2:01:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities233many Hindus and engaged in battle with a Hindu king.20 During a crucial fifty-year period, from 1296 to 1347, militant SåfÊs seem to have been extensively involved with Muslim military expansion-ism in the Deccan. In this period, the SåfÊs, besides providing the Muslim armies with an element of religious legitimacy, may have represented the only element of Islamic organisation at the frontiers of expansion, most probably centred on kh§nq§h-s (simple monastic dwellings) (Eaton 1997:46).21SåfÊ Sarmast belonged to no institutional order as such, as he predated any such organisation in south Asia, yet, as a SåfÊ, he had been initiated by a pÊr (a Muslim religious preceptor), enabling him to initiate others. Within the SåfÊ world this system of initiation (baiy’a)22 and authorative transmission is known as khil§fat, and is a direct parallel with the guru-parampar§arrangement that operates within the Hindu domain. Integration through the khil§fatsystem is the single most important criterion for being a SåfÊ.23 From the fourteenth century onwards, an institutional network of kh§nq§h-s became established, based on a silsil§(‘chain’) from a founding pÊr(orshaikh). By the mid-fourteenth century, warrior SåfÊs—who had not been affiliated to any order—had more or less disappeared from the Bijapur area. They were replaced by SåfÊs who were affiliated to 20Another warrior SåfÊ, PÊr Ma’bari Khandyat, who died in the early fourteenth century, accompanied one of the sultan of Delhi’s campaigns in the struggle to gain control of Bijapur. According to Ma’bari’s hagiography, he slaughtered many idolatrous local r§ja-s. He appears also to have accompanied Malik Kufår—whom we encountered in the previous chapter (fn. 64)—in 1311, during his military cam-paigns in the south. While Sarmast and Ma’bari are known to have been involved with armies, other SåfÊs appear in Bijapur in the late thirteenth century who are remembered for their military prowess, martyrdom, and attacks on Hindus and idolatry. Amongst them are $li Pahlavan (a companion of SåfÊ Sarmast), Shaikh Shahid, PÊr Jumna, and Tigh Brahna. 21In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, kh§nq§h-s also functioned as travel-lers’ rest houses (sarai), thus facilitating the spread of the fame of saints. There were up to 120 kh§nq§h-s in Delhi, where three nights’ stay was possible (Digby 1976).22The initiation ritual involves the teacher grasping the pupil’s hand (or touch-ing his head), and investing the best disciples with a khirqa(a garment of, usually, patched wool). Some were also given a licence or diploma (called ijazaorkhil§fat-n§ma), authorising them to act as deputies (khalÊfa), and disseminate the principles and practices of their respective orders (see Rizvi 1978:102).23For an analysis of the pÊr-murÊd(teacher-disciple) relationship, one of the basic pillars of SåfÊ organisation, see Islam (2002:385–396).clark_BIL25a.indd 2335/30/2006 2:01:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"chapter seven234one or another of the SåfÊ orders that had developed in the Middle-East, notably the Chishti, Q§diri and Shatt§ri orders.24One of the first SåfÊs to become closely associated with the BahmanÊcourt at Bijapur was Shaikh Siraj-uddÊn Junaidi (d.1380), who assisted with the coronation of the new king, Ala-uddÊn Hasan, in 1347, and received what was perhaps the first land-grant to a Deccani SåfÊ,the village of Korchi, which has since remained in the hands of his descendants. Shortly after his coronation the new sultan distributed four hundred pounds of gold and a thousand pounds of silver in the name of Nií§m ud-DÊn (-al DÊn) Aulia, the great Chishti of Delhi. As a consequence, his successor Muhammad “§h BahmanÊ, was able to obtain a declaration of allegiance from virtually all the SåfÊs of his kingdom (Eaton 1997:60–61).It will be recalled that the first land-grants to “ÜØgerÊ were just a year earlier, in 1346, in somewhat parallel circumstances; namely, patronage of a saÒny§sÊinstitution in return for favours presumably rendered. In another parallel with Daáan§mÊ institutions, the Indian SåfÊ Shaikhs of the fourteenth century and later—following a tradition of some of their predecessors in the eleventh and twelfth centuries in Khurasan—were considered to have a divinely sanctioned jurisdiction over a specific territory (wil§yat).25 There were frequent challenges to various claims of jurisdiction and ‘protection’, both from within the 24Their occupation of the Deccan was in part as a consequence of Muhammad bin Tughluq’s order of 1327 that the kh§nq§h-s of Delhi be vacated. Resident SåfÊ-s were ordered to migrate to the Deccan to inhabit the new capital at Daulatabad, as part of a general policy of resettlement. In 1347 many Deccanis revolted against the rule of Delhi, and the BahmanÊ kingdom was established at Gulbarga.25Heads of sisil§-s dispatched their khalÊfa-s to various provinces, called wil§yat. KhalÊfa-s, in their turn, appointed subordinate khalÊfa-s for various cities and settle-ments. Thus a hierarchy of saints came to be established in northern India, with the chief saint established at the centre, controlling a network of kh§nq§h-s spread over the country. Mediaeval records show numerous instances of such territorial distribution (Nizami 1961:175–177). At the beginning of the fourteenth century, Shaikh Nií§m al-DÊn of the Chishti silsil§was identified with the well-being and fortune of the city of Delhi, over which the Shaikh exercised his ‘governance’. In an account of the late fourteenth century, AmÊr Khwurd describes how Mu’Ên al-DÊn’s wil§yatextended all over India (Digby 1986:72). The notion of ‘divine jurisdiction’ is perhaps most amply exemplified in the person of Mu’Ên al-DÊn Chishti (d.1236), who founded the Chishti lineage in India. His tomb in Ajmer became a major centre of pilgrimage, notably after Akbar’s pilgrimages on foot there between 1562 and 1575. Today, the festival for the anniversary of the saint is the greatest pilgrimage festival of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent.clark_BIL25a.indd 2345/30/2006 2:01:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities235order and from rival orders (Digby 1986:63–72), one example being the cult of Datt§treya,26 one of several Hindu devotional cults that arose in Maharashtra in this period.27 Tulpule believes (1979:352) that the Datt§treya cult probably arose as a reaction against the activity of SåfÊs, who were exerting a significant influence on the traditional religion of Maharashtra. 7.3 Religious identity in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuriesIn this section, we turn to the issue of religious identity in the six teenth and seventeenth centuries, and how there was an ample context in this period for the development of a distinct Hindu sectar-ian identity for the Daáan§mÊs. It was observed in Chapter 5.6 thatthe first references to Daáan§mÊappear around the middle of the sixteenth century. Around the same time, we find the first references to the term ‘Hindu’, as used self-reflexively to distinguish ‘Hindu’ from other religious traditions, specifically Islam. As noted in the previous chapter, in the earlier part of the first millennium, áaiva andvaißÖavawere considered as distinct religious traditions, and the term ‘Hindu’ was not used by the traditions themselves.The first use of the term ‘Hindu’ by Hindus was by Vijayanagara regents in 1352. This appears to be the first use of the term term ‘Hindu’ in any Indian language source (Talbot 2003:90). Devar§ya II is described as “the sultan among Hindu kings (hindur§ya-suratr§Öa)”in inscriptions of 142428and 1428.29 The term was previously only used by Muslims, and it was not until the late thirteenth century that Persian literature written in India uses the term ‘Hindu’ as a religious designation. The Vijayanagara use of the term appears to have been an appropriation in order to distinguish Indic from Turk-ish polities, and, according to Talbot (2003:90–91), was not used to 26NarasiÒhasarasvatÊ (1378–1458) is regarded as the second avat§ra of Datt§treya(a deity comprising the trimårti Brahm§, VißÖu and “iva). He is the central figure in the history of the cult, and most probably its founder (Rigopoulos 1998:111–112).27Another example is the Mah§nubhava sect, founded by Cakradhar (d.1273), who was the last of a series of five human incarnations, called the ‘Five KÜßÖas’ (see Feldhaus and Tulpule 1992).28EI, Vol. III, no. 5, vv. 19–20, p. 40.29EI, Vol. XIII, no. 1, vv. 10–13, p. 10.clark_BIL25a.indd 2355/30/2006 2:01:54 PM"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"chapter seven236represent a distinction between those of the ‘Hindu religion’ from those of the ‘Islamic religion’.30 The term ‘Hindu’ was first used self-reflexively in a religious sense in Bengal during the early part of the sixteenth century by Vallab-hÊya and Gau·ÊyavaißÖava-s, who actively proselytized, converting not only among Hindu groups, but also occasionally Muslims. “The Hindus now start using this foreign term as a device of asserting and defining their identity against the foreigners; the fact that they are named, excluded and defined as “others” by these foreigners provides them with a new sense of their own identity, as well as a new perspective on the otherness of others” (Halbfass 1988:192). In the seventeenth century the term ‘Hindu’ is also used in Maharash-tra where “iv§jÊ (1627–1680) led successful campaigns against the Mughal rulers. However, the projection in hagiography31 of “iv§jÊ as an entirely ‘Hindu’ ruler, a protector of gods, Brahmans and cows, fighting demonic ‘Muslim’ adversaries—such as the Mughal captain Udebh§n, who sacrificed a pregnant cow before battle and killed his eighteen mistresses—is misleading. Indeed, in the army of Afíal Kh§n(“iv§jÊ’s chief adversary) there were many Hindus; and in “iv§jÊ’s own army there were many Muslims (Laine 1999:307). Neverthe-less, it is during this period that ‘new’ and distinct religious identities emerge. Discussing this issue in the age of “iv§jÊ, Laine (1999:315) concludes: “In short, the complex diversity of religious belief and practice, which early Muslim arrivals to India saw as a multitude of sects and communities, was now a unity, a religion, a dÊn.”In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, on the one hand there appears to have been a tendency towards the establishing of a distinct ‘Hindu’ identity, while on the other there was also an apparent tendency—in the consciousness of difference—towards religious universalisation, a process that came to successful fruition during the following two centuries. The tendency towards religious universalisation is readily apparent in the PraÖ§mÊ sect, which was founded in the same period in the Jamnagar district of Gujarat. Its 30However, in the latter inscription (vv. 10–13) Devar§ya is compared in numer-ous virtues with R§ma, son of Daáaratha.31Notably, the “ivabh§rata, commissioned at the time of “iv§jÊ’s coronation in 1647.

During the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries religious iden-tity became a significant political issue with new dimensions in many parts of India. Although there had been earlier attacks on Hindu temples by Islamic regimes—primarily as demonstrations of power at the frontiers of campaigns, rather than being specifically anti-religious (Eaton 2000)—there was a period of cessation of hostilities from around 1420 onwards. However, in the late sixteenth century attacks on Hindu temples recommenced (Talbot 2003:104–107). By the middle of the seventeenth century, communal relationships between landed SåfÊs and Hindus became increasingly violent in the Deccan, with many SåfÊs participating in various conflicts in the region. Under a farm§n(‘royal decree’) of 1679, Hindu temples were destroyed, and a tax (jaziy§)33 on Hindus, that had been rescinded by Akbar (r.1556–1605)34 in 1564/5, was reinstated in 1679 by Aurangzeb (r.1658–1707), who at first desisted from imposing it, partly owing to his allegiance to the R§jpåts. His reimposition of the tax appears not to have been specifically anti-Hindu, but was part of an attempt to rally support from an increasingly orthodox clergy (ulam§)35 (Chandra 2003:141–142).36 Nevertheless, there is 32Pr§Ön§th’s mother tongue was Gujarati, but he was well acquainted with Persian, Arabic, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Rajasthani and Hindi. He twice made tours of Muslim Arabia, and had an extensive knowledge of Islam. All PraÖ§mÊ literature is in Hindi, written in the devanag§rÊscript, and Pr§Ön§th was the first Hindi poet to use the word hindavi (Hindustani), considering it as the ‘national’ as well as a link language. 33The tax has been calculated as amounting to a month’s wages from a trades-man’s income for a year (Chandra 2003:142). It was in force until 1713; it was again imposed between 1717 and 1720 ([Thiel-] Horstmann 1991:268).34Akbar’s son and successor, Jah§ngÊr (r.1605–1628), generally continued—but with important exceptions—the liberal policy of his father, permitting Hindu pil-grimage to such places as Haridv§r, preventing forcible conversion to Islam, and even paying daily allowances to extra-faith converts. Many Hindus also held high public office (Sharma 1937–1938:307–315).35Bayly (1985:191) believes Aurangzeb’s ‘tilt’ towards Islam may have been to build up local support against the power of Hindu zamÊnd§r-s. 36During periods of conflict between Mughal and Hindu rulers, up until the clark_BIL25a.indd 2375/30/2006 2:01:54 PM"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"chapter seven238also some evidence that Aurangzeb, after his conquest of Bijapur in 1686, contributed to the widening divisions between the Muslim and Hindu communities, purging non-orthodox and ‘eclectic’ SåfÊs(Eaton 1997:244–246).Regarding Hindu/Muslim relations, changes in government per-ceptions and policy can be seen in developments within the sultanate of Bijapur. Eaton (1997:99–114) discusses the cultural syncretism of the sultanate under Sultan Ibrahim II (1580–1627). The Sultan, a Sunni Muslim and a Deccani, was a noted scholar, with a consider-able knowledge of Sanskrit.37 He is hailed as one of the great poets of the age, and actively supported various Hindu religious and cultural institutions,38 one of his popular epithets being jagadguru.39The religious eclecticism of Ibrahim II was not shared by his suc-cessor, Sultan Muhammad $dil“§h (1627–1656), under whom an orthodox Muslim religious establishment came to play a heightened religio-political role in Bijapur. Up to a fifth of the wealth derived from military conquests went to support Muslim organs of state (Eaton 1997:115). Muhammad styled himself a mujahid(‘wager of eighteenth century, it is important to recognise that the political battles were not in any way similar to, for example, the religious wars waged in Europe between Protestant and Catholic regimes. By contrast, in India, no Muslim enclaves were siezed; populations were not expelled on the basis of religion; there were no forced conversions; banks maintained branches in both Hindu and Muslim regions, extending credit regardless of religion; and Hindus and Muslims served in respective govern-ments and armies on both sides. (For further details, see Gordon 1999.)37His dominance in the region can be traced from 1583, when the Shi’a khuãba (the Friday sermon, in which the secular ruler’s name was revered and prayed for) was replaced by that of orthodox Sunnism (Eaton 1997:100). 38He composed one of the landmarks of Dakani literature, the Kitab-i Nauras, a treatise on the nine sentiments (rasa) of Sanskrit literature, which also discusses the subject of Indian musical r§ga-s. Instead of the usual Muslim invocation, bism-ullah,the book opens with a prayer to GaÖapati.“iva, ParvatÊ and Bhairava also feature prominently in the work. It is reported that Ibrahim even had an image of Saras-vatÊ brought into the palace for his personal worship. Being infatuated with music, Ibrahim also instituted a national music-holiday, ^d-i Nauras, in which thousands of Hindu musicians participated. He issued orders ensuring the rights of pilgrims to perform rituals to the Hindu deity Khanderao (Mallari), and supported the upkeep of a Hindu temple at Chinchvad, near Pune (Eaton 1997:111).39Besides support for Hindu institutions, Ibrahim tolerated Shi’a Muslims—though not in his employment—and was the first sovereign to allow Jesuits to establish mission churches in the kingdom. He nevertheless wished to be remembered above all as a good Muslim; on his tomb are Arabic couplets from the Koran, extol-ling the piety of Abraham (father of Isaac), who is described as not a Jew, nor a Christian, but a Muslim.clark_BIL25a.indd 2385/30/2006 2:01:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities239jihad’) and gh§zÊ(‘religious fighter’) in his campaigns, from 1638 to 1649. Government regulations (Dastur al-$mal ) issued under Muham-mad specifically separated the Hindus and Muslims as distinct and unequal communities for the first time in the history of Bijapur.40Reaction to the religious eclecticism came not only from government but also from the SåfÊ orders of Bijapur, primarily from the newly-arrived Q§diri and Shatt§ri orders. The reformist SåfÊs of Bijapur were often hostile to Brahmans, Hindu ascetics and yogÊ-s. There are several semi-hagiographic accounts of the time that describe various spiritual battles between SåfÊs and Hindu yogÊ-s and gosain-s; the SåfÊs, of course, emerging victorious. Even though warrior SåfÊshad been active in India since the thirteenth century, it was only in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that the image of the Islamic holy warrior (gh§zÊ) appears in Indo-Muslim writing, an image that was then retroactively attributed to numerous individuals of previous centuries (Talbot 2003:107).During the period under consideration SåfÊs began to exert con-siderable influence on the administration in Delhi, some gaining very prominent status. Amongst Chishtis, Khw§ja Muinud Chishti and Shaikh Salim Chishti were virtually made patron saints of the Mughals (Chandra 1996:145). The status of Shaikhs was such that they were considered to be above some aspects of law (Shackle 1976:162). Already by the sixteenth century the Mughal emperors had estab-lished extensive bureaucratic hierarchies that dispensed royal funds and land to SåfÊ shrines, frequently regulated by appointed trustees (Ernst and Lawrence 2002:21). Also, contrary to certain preconcep-tions concerning the nature of Islam, some SåfÊs of the mediaeval period in the subcontinent enjoyed a particular kind of prestige, as they acted as priests at darg§h-s (‘tombs of departed pÊr-s’), and also performed rituals as intermediaries between God and supernatural forces (Gaborieau 1989).41Besides the more orthodox SåfÊs of the darg§h-s there were also 40The Muslim population were obliged to attend the Friday prayers, and preach-ers were instructed not to allow any Hindu influences on Islam. Muslims were instructed not to attend festivals such as Holi, Div§li and Dassera, when taxes on sheep,ghÊ, and rice were imposed for those attending (Eaton 1997:117–118).41Gaborieau’s study is limited to Nepal, but it seems probable that the situation was similar in north India.clark_BIL25a.indd 2395/30/2006 2:01:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"chapter seven240manymajzåb(‘dervish’/Mad§ri)42 SåfÊs wandering around.

In terms of life-style and appearance there is little to distinguish them from N§ths and Daáan§mÊn§g§-s.43During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries arose what has been called the ‘the Nakshbandi reaction’, an orthodox SåfÊmovement against religious eclecticism in Mughal India, represented by Akbar, and against ‘unorthodox’ SåfÊ orders and practices. This movement roughly parallels events during this phase of Bijapur’s history (Eaton 1997:124). The reformist Nakshbandis had spread widely throughout Muslim-dominated north India, many obtaining high posts in the civil and military administration.44 Many men, not only those with a high degree of traditional Islamic learning, but also military adventurers and soldiers, abandoned their previous occupa-tions and joined the Nakshbandis during the time of Aurangzeb’s rule. Some recent immigrants from Central Asia who were military commanders holding high office in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries became clients of Nakshbandi b§b§-s, though there seems to be no evidence of proseytizing or conversion of non-Muslims (Digby 2001:7–8).

This radical form of Såfism is also known as qalandar. The early Qalandari branches were founded in the Middle-East, Turkey, Egypt and Sindh in the thirteenth century (Schimmel 1983:335; Rizvi 1993:301–321; Ernst and Lawrence 2002:21–22). Radical SåfÊs were noted for being quarrelsome and sometimes violent, giving rise to anxiety when they stayed in kh§nq§h-s in India. Yet their spiritual powers were feared and respected (Digby 1976:172). For a graphic account of some of the radical practices of a sect of fakÊr-s in Hyderabad, the Rufayis, descended from Sayed Ahmad KabÊr RafaÊ (d.1160), see Hunt (1934).44The Nakshbandi order derives its name from Bah§’uddÊn Naqshband (d.1390), who came from central Asia. His most successful successor was ‘Abdu’l-Kh§liq Ghijduw§nÊ, who taught ‘the way of the Khojas (teachers)’, ãarÊqa-yi Khw§jag§n, and established connections with trade guilds and merchants. Under Khw§ja Ahr§r, Nakshbandis came to dominate central Asia, establishing a firm footing in India at the end of Akbar’s reign, shortly before 1600 (Schimmel 1983:364–367).clark_BIL25a.indd 2405/30/2006 2:01:56 PM"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities241also be seen in the pattern of marriages between Nakshbandis and the royal house (Damrel 2000:180–187).One of the most famous of the orthodox reformers was a Sunni Muslim, Shaikh Ahmad Faruki of SirhindÊ (1563–1624),45 who was a Nakshbandi. He disliked Shi’a Islam, and attempted to reform all orders.46 SirhindÊ rose to become governor of the province of Bihar, and oversaw a network of up to 1,600 khulafa/khalÊfa-s (Rizvi 1993:226, 293) that, according to Jah§ngir, was active in every town of the empire.47 Both the more conservative SirhindÊ, a Nakshbandi, and his more eclectic and ‘N§th yogic’ Chishti predecessor, Abd al-Quddås GangohÊ (d.1537), agreed on the principle of prohibiting kafÊr-s from government service, except in minor posts. SirhindÊ went further, however, wishing to reimpose a tax on non-Muslims, and attempting to prohibit Muslim dress for non-Muslims.48The assertion of a distinct Muslim identity on the part of the political elite also roughly coincided with the heightened importance of the institutions of SåfÊpÊr-s. From around the mid-seventeenth century, the kh§nq§h-s of the Bijapur region, which were previously occupied by the early migrant pÊr-s, were replaced by darg§h-s, which sometimes included a courtyard, a small mosque and the graveyard of the pÊr-s descendants. Spiritual power ceased being transmitted from one pÊrto another, and began to be transmitted from the pÊrto the darg§hwhere he was buried (Eaton 1997:210–213; Lapidus 1988:460). Also, whereas previously the pÊr holding the office of kalÊf§(orsajj§da-niáÊn ‘one who sits on the prayer carpet’) had been 45SirhindÊ—also known as ‘Mujaddid’ (‘saviour’) Alf i-Sani—traced his descent from Caliph ‘Umar, and believed that he and three of his successors (beginning with his son, Muhammad Ma’ßum) were the highest representatives of God (qayyåm), directly elected to reform Islam (Schimmel 1983:369; Rizvi 1993:202ff.).46The nature of the ‘Nakshbandi reaction’ has been questioned by Damrel (2000), who argues that SirhindÊ’s reform programme was essentially his own per-sonal agenda, rather than being rooted, as many scholars have maintained, in Nakshbandi tradition. SirhindÊ was imprisoned but was eventually released, after which he inititated “§h Jah§n (Haq 1935:17ff.). Although primarily a Chishti, SirhindÊ was also initiated into the Q§diri (and maybe also the Suhrawardi) order, and then, finally, into the Nakshbandi order. SirhindÊ traced his line of allegiance to the Prophet through twenty-one Nakshbandis, twenty-five Q§diris and twenty-seven Chishtis. He maintained Chishti ties even after he became a Nakshbandi (Damrel 2000:182).47On the relationship between SirhindÊ and Jah§ngir, see also Sharma (1937–1938:312–313).48See Rizvi (1993:215–329) for a comprehensive account of SirhindÊ.clark_BIL25a.indd 2415/30/2006 2:01:57 PM"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"chapter seven242succeeded by initiated disciples (murÊd-s), the criterion for succession changed, and it passed to a hereditary heir and his family, pÊrzada-s (‘sons of the pÊr’), who enjoyed—and still enjoy—the social prestige inherent in being descendants of an illustrious predecessor. The darg§h-s became dynamic social institutions centred on the personality cult of the departed pÊrand his descendants.Although for many centuries the devotion of a pÊrto his deceased teacher (Shaikh) had been frequently expressed by pilgrimage to his tomb—a local pilgrimage that in some instances was considered a Great hajj(Shackle 1976:162–163)—Såfism changed from being a discipline for a small elite, to becoming a movement of popular devotionalism, many darg§h-s becoming general places of pilgrimage. Although the pÊr-s of some kh§nq§h-s had acted as spiritual preceptors to Sultans, ties between pÊr-s and Sultans remained largely informal. However, a significant development in the late seventeenth century was that many pÊrzada-s entered into formal association with the state, and permanent land-grants (in§m) were issued, which were substantially augmented up to the beginning of the eighteenth cen-tury by subsequent Sultans, including Aurangzeb. The land-grants, enshrined within the Dastur-al-$mal, established a new relationship between the state and SåfÊ institutions, which began enjoying power and prestige within the state in a new and significant way, as the “Brahmans of Islam” (Eaton 1997:212–221, 247). The influence of SåfÊs may be gauged from the fact that there was more Persian SåfÊhagiographical literature produced in India than in all of Persia and Central Asia combined (Ernst and Lawrence 2002:48).49SåfÊ institutions were clearly very influential on the Muslim state during the period under consideration, and it is interesting to consider a parallel in the structures of the SåfÊ and Daáan§mÊ schemes of their respective orders. During the middle ages it was very common for SåfÊs to trace their lineage to the four Caliphs, and thence to the Prophet Muhammad. Hagiographers also retrospectively assigned such lineages to famous SåfÊs, such as J§l§l al-DÊn RåmÊ (1207–1273), author of the MathnavÊ. In the Al-Jawahir-ul Mudiyya of Shaikh Muhy-iddin Abdul Kadir (d.1373), and other works, RåmÊ was attached to 49One of the earliest works of SåfÊ hagiography was Muhammad Ja’far al-KhuldÊ’sHikay§t al-Awliy§ (late ninth or early tenth century), a work no longer extant (Islam 2002:3).clark_BIL25a.indd 2425/30/2006 2:01:57 PM"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities243the lineage from Abu Bakr’s family.

The Maulawi sect of SåfÊs, who descend from RåmÊ, thus trace the lineage of their sect back through RåmÊ to Abu Bakr, the first Caliph.50 It was dur-ing the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that the organisation of SåfÊorders as teaching lineages first crystalised (Rizvi 1978:83),51 a link to the lineage of the Prophet Muhammad being crucial.52 During initiation the lineage of the chain of masters is recited, a practice subsequently supplemented by the writing out of the names of the masters of the order, resulting in a filial tree (shajara). Knowing the names of previous masters conferred special religious merit (Ernst and Lawrence 2002:19–23). In this context it is interesting to note the observations of the author of the Dabist§n, written in 1645, com-paring the Hindus and the (celibate) Muslim SåfÊs:[The SåfÊs], as they have heard that there ten classes of sany§sÊs, and twelve of yogÊs,53they also pretend to be divided into fourteen classes; when they meet together, the questions which they ask are: who are the four sages, and which are the fourteen noble families? And they impose upon their disciples many years of service, before they reveal to them the four sages and fourteen families; they say: the sage of sages is the [1] illustrious Muhammed (may the peace of God be upon him!), and after him, devoted to godliness, [2] Ali (may the blessings of God be upon him!); from him the Khalifat devolved upon [3] Imam 50The four Caliphs reigned as follows: Abu Bakr (632–634); ‘Umar (634–644); ‘Uthm§n/‘Usman (644–656); ‘Ali [bin Abi Talib] (656–661).51An example is the Indian Chishti order, which has a tradition of twenty-two masters. Many Chishtis trace their lineage to the archangel Gabriel, and reckon the 21st successor as Shaikh Nií§m ud-DÊn Aulia (d.1325), and the 22nd as Shaikh Nasir ud-DÊn Mahmud Chiragh-i Dihli (d.1356). However, the branch of the Chishti order that predominates in the Deccan starts with the Prophet Muhammad, and counts Shaikh Nií§m ud-DÊn’s successor, Burhan ud-DÊn Gharib (d.1337) as the 21st successor, and Zayn ud-DÊn Shirazi (d.1369), as the 22nd (Ernst and Lawrence 2002:23).52Most SåfÊ orders regard ‘Ali as their Shaikh, and trace their descent from either ‘Ali, or from Hasan al-Basri (656–661), who was born in Medina and settled in Basra. According to SåfÊ tradition, Hasan became ‘Ali’s disciple, though this is doubted by mediaeval and modern scholars (Rizvi 1978:27, 83).53This is a reference to the twelve panth-s (baropanthÊ) of N§th-yogÊs/siddha-s, which are: Satyan§th, Dharma, R§m, Nateávar, Kanthar, Kapil, Vair§gya (BhartÜhari), Mann§th (Gopicand), Ayae, Pagal (associated with CauraØgin§th or Puran Bhagat), Dhavja (associated with Hanum§n or Mah§vÊr), GaØg§n§th (associated with BhÊßma,son of GaØg§) (see Banerjea 1988:13–14). For the complete guru-parampar§of the N§ths, descending from the ‘nine N§ths’, see Vil§sn§th (1998:61–81).clark_BIL25a.indd 2435/30/2006 2:01:58 PM"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"chapter seven244Hossain;54 then [4] Khaja Hossen of Basora,55 also was his disciple and a khalif; these four personages are the four sages (Dabist§npp. 220–221).The text continues with a list of fourteen families,56 which are said to descend from two Caliphs.57Similarities between the SåfÊ and SaÒny§sÊ overviews of their respective orders is evident.5854Husain (624/5–669/70) was the son of ‘Ali. His assasination—while opposing the Umayyads—was a decisive moment in the separation of the supporters of ‘Ali (Shi’a) from the Sunni community.55Hasan al-Basri (642–728); most SåfÊ lineages claim to pass through him.56In the eleventh century, the Persian SåfÊ, Shaikh al-HujwÊrÊ classified twelve SåfÊ orders, linking each to a famous SåfÊ master, despite the fact that there was seldom a correspondence between these early ascetics and the well-known SåfÊ orders of later times. Sultanate and Mughal tazkira(‘hagiographical family-tree’) writers added two more SåfÊ orders—to make fourteen—but the lists are not consistent (Ernst and Lawrence 2002:24).57The text continues: “They say besides, from Khaja Hossen, of Basora, sprang two branches: the first was that of the Khalif Hossen BasorÊ HabÊb AjemÊ, from whom nine families proceeded, named as follows: JÊbÊ§n, T§ikerÊ§n, KherkÊ§n, SikatÊ§n, JenÊdÊ§n, GazrånÊ§n, TåsÊ§n, FerdusÊ§n, and SoherwardÊ§n. From the second Khalifat of Hossen Basori, which was that of Shaikh Abdul Wahid Zaid, came forth five families with the following titles: the ZebÊrÊ§n, Ai§sÊ§n, AdhamÊ§n, HabÊrÊ§n and CheshtÊ§n, and these are the fourteen noble families.”The$-Ên-i AkbarÊof Abu-l-Faíl (1972, Vol. 2:393–420) provides a somewhat different list of the fourteen SåfÊ orders that existed in India at the time of Akbar (r.1556–1605): Habibi, Tayfuri, Karkhi, Saqati, Junaydi, K§zruni, Tusi, Firdaus, Suhrawardi, Zaydi, I’y§zi, Adhami, Hubayri, and Chishti. The lives of the fourteen founding saints are also sketched. “It is said Ali, the Prince of the Faithful, had four viceregents,viz., Hasan, Husayn, Kamil, and Hasan Basri. The source of these orders they believe to be Hasan Basri who had two representatives, Habbib-i-Ajami, from whom the first nine obtain their spiritual fervour, and the other Abdu’l W§had-b-Zayd, from whom the last five are filled with consolation” (p. 394). Five SåfÊ sects played an important role in India from the fourteenth century onwards: Shatt§ri, Q§diri, Qalandari, Nakshbandi, and Uwaysi (Siddiqi 1989:35).The earliest silsil§was the Q§diri, founded by Shaikh Abdul Q§dÊr Jil§ni (d.1166) (Rizvi 1993:6 fn. 1). From the beginning of the thirteenth century, the most important of the organised SåfÊ orders in India were the Chishti and Suhrawardi, the former order being more ascetic, independent from state patronage, and also open to outsid-ers. Suhrawardis were more closed to outsiders, accepted government service, and became wealthy. From the fourteenth century, SåfÊs were often initiated into both orders (Rizvi 1993:13, 217, 272). The Q§diri and Shatt§ri orders became influential in India in the fifteenth century. The Shatt§ri order became closely identified with the state elite (dressing like kings, with followers in military uniform), but lost favour with Akbar, and declined in influence (Lapidus 1988:448). For the founding and resumé of the history of the Q§diri, Suhrawardi, Kubrawi (which has two Indian branches, the Firdawsi and Hamadani), Nakshbandi (Khw§jagan), and Chishti orders, see Rizvi (1978:84–120). For the Shatt§ri order, see Rizvi (1993:62–64).58SåfÊ and Daáan§mÊ traditions have parallels even today.

Also, as previously noted, the áaiva P§áupata order traces its origin to the four disciples of L§kulÊáa. The vaißÖava Vaikh§nasa tradition also traces its origins to four Vedic schools, represented, according to the $nanda-saÒhit§(XVII. 38–39),59 by four Vedic Üßi-s who were disciples of Vikh§nasa: MarÊci, Atri, Kaáyapa and BhÜgu (Colas 1996:14, 20).60 Within the Indian epic tradition, Vy§sa, the reputed author of the Mah§bh§rata, is said to have had four disciples: Sumanta, Jaimini, Paila, and VaiáaÒp§yana (see Kramisch 1924:2). Accord-ing to the Jaina “vet§mbara tradition, four pupils of Vajrasv§min (fifth–sixth cent.?) founded four kula-s (‘clans’) for the mendicant community: the Candra (sometimes -kula), the NirvÜtti (sometimes -kula), the Vidy§dharagaccha(‘those who travel together’) and the N§gendragaccha. In the mid-thirteenth century, referring to “the fourkula-s” was a way of referring to the totality of the “vet§mbara mendicant community (Dundas 1993:251–252; Cort 2001:42).61 The Sikh-related BaÜ§ (‘large’) Ud§sinakh§Ü§ was founded, according to tradition, by “rÊ Cand, the eldest of the two sons of Guru N§nak (1469–1539). The akh§Ü§is divided into four divisions, namely: Balu Hasna; Phul Sahib (or MÊ§n Sahib); Almast; and Bhagat Bhagv§n (or Gonda). These four dhånÊ-s (dhå§n)62 are said to have been instituted in 1636 by the four disciples of B§b§ Gurdita, who followed “rÊ Cand on the gaddÊ.63According to the Bhaktam§la(v. 32) of N§bhad§sa64Daáan§mÊ-SaÒny§sÊs receive instruction on their Maãh§mn§ya, and usually receive a paper, such as the Daán§m-kalp-vÜkß, providing the four maãhascheme. A largely parallel procedure still operates at the Amin ud-DÊndarg§hon“§hpur Hill, near Bijapur (Eaton 1997:304). On induction to the order, murÊd-s are issued with printed certificates linking them, through Amin ud-DÊn, to the Chishti SåfÊs of Delhi, and ultimately to the Prophet.59The earliest part of the Vaikh§nasa corpus dates from the ninth century, while the bulk was composed in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.60See also Caland (1941:i–xxxvi).61There is some evidence that all of these four gaccha-s were extant in the late fourteenth century, but by the sixteenth century only the Candra gaccha was still flourishing. The gaccha-s, as organisational units, gradually replaced ‘the four kula-s’ during this period.62Besides the four dhånÊ-s, seven bhakáiá-s were founded, that is, centres of Sikh-ism in different parts of India, but mostly in Punjab (Singh 1951:64–66). There is here also some kind of a parallel with the seven Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s.63See Ch. 3.1.64See Pollet (1963:76, 171).clark_BIL25a.indd 2455/30/2006 2:01:59 PM"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"chapter seven246(c.1600), R§m§nuja had four disciples;65 and it seems the organisa-tion of the four vaißÖava samprad§ya-s may have first formally arisen in the sixteenth century.66This is not to suggest that the SaÒny§sÊs necessarily borrowed the idea of four ‘disciples’ from the SåfÊ or any other tradition, as “aØkara may possibly have had four disciples, though it is perhaps significant that the chief mahant-s of the akh§Ü§-s are sometimes called pÊr, a Muslim honorific term. However, some evidence has been presented to show that there was a very fertile context for the devel-opment of an identity for an orthodox Hindu order. By the middle of the seventeenth century in north and south-central India, there was harassment of Hindu saÒny§sÊ-s and yogÊ-s; the heightened power and prestige of pÊr-s and darg§h-s with their proud and remunerative lineages; a more orthodox regime at Delhi perceived by many as essentially hostile towards Hindus; and, importantly, large roving bands of militant n§g§-saÒny§sÊ-s with what seems to have been a non-orthodox Tantric background. The notion of ten names seems first to be attested around the end of the sixteenth century, around the time of the formation of the first militant akh§Ü§-s. It is suggested that it was in this context that the Maãh§mn§ya-s emerged as an ideological response to the saÒny§sÊ-s’ social and political situation. TheMaãh§mn§ya-s built on to the notion of “aØkara as a áaiva who conquered the four corners of India with Ved§nta, with the claim that“aØkara also founded of an order of ascetics, who consequently became united under an orthodox Hindu umbrella.

During the early eighteenth century the city of Jhansi was the capital of a small state ruled over by Daáan§mÊgosain-s (see below). During the latter half of the eighteenth and the early nineteenth centuries they were employed, in many instances as a regularly paid standing army, in service to Ma h§-r§jas of Jodhpur, Jaipur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Udaipur, BaÜaud§, Marv§r(western Madhya Pradesh), and Bhuj (capital town of Kacch).In an official bond-letter dating from the 1730s, addressed to the Mah§r§ja Jaisingh II (r.1700–1743),67 the R§m§nandÊ, Vrij§nand, abjures the carrying of arms and allowing armed monks to attend R§m§nandÊ communal feasts. This indicates their conspicuous presence.68 It is further stated that those R§m§nandÊs who do so will be expelled from the seven-branched “rÊ R§m§nandÊsamprad§ya(the seven-branched samprad§ya being perhaps modelled on the seven akh§Ü§-s of the Daáan§mÊs). The Daáan§mÊs, along with Sant and othervaißÖavaorders, were similarly requested to sign such bonds ([Thiel]-Horstman 2001:3–4). However, this did not prevent their extensive military campaigns.6967Jaisingh II was a king of the Kachav§h§ dynasty of eastern Rajasthan. The kings of this dynasty operated as semi-autonomous regents under the Mughals. Their capital moved from Ajmer to Jaipur in 1739.68They were permanently established at a small fort at the base of Nahargarh hill (Orr 1940:11).69R§m§nandÊ warriors under Vrij§nand subsequently engaged in battle in 1744 in the neighbouring states of Koã§ and BåndÊ with forces that were threatening ^ávarsingh, Jaisingh II’s successor. Although the R§m§nandÊs fought on behalf of the Mah§r§ja of Jaipur, they were not on his regular payroll. Vrij§nand died in 1752, and was succeded by B§l§nand, whom R§m§nandÊ tradition credits with giving definitive shape to the military organisation of the R§m§nandÊs, in 1734. Although B§l§nand is cast as a R§m§nandÊ, R§m§nanda is nowhere mentioned in the relevant documents of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Rather, it is R§m§nuja who figures as the spiritual fountainhead of the order ([Thiel-] Horstmann 2001:8). B§l§nand’s forces fought against the J§ãs who were seeking to expand. Outside Rajasthan, B§l§nand had strongholds in the entire Braj-Bh§ratpur region, and as far away as Jagann§th PurÊ. B§l§nand died in 1795, his funeral being attended by numerous dignitaries, testifying to his power and influence.

By 1803, eight years after they had officially joined state forces, 4,000 n§g§-s were a part of the 13,000-strong state army of Jaipur.70There are other documented instances of large bands of gosain n§g§-s being hired for specific military offensives. In 1763, PÜthvÊN§r§yaÖ“§h, king of Gorkha, and the founder of modern Nepal,71was engaged in a campaign to extend his empire into the Kathmandu valley (Baral 1964:231–234). His chief adviser and strategist was the ascetic N§th-siddha, Bhagavantn§th, who used his influence to negotiate various matrimonial and military alliances between Gorkha and some of the other forty-five kingdoms of western Nepal. During PÜthvÊ N§r§yaÖ’s attack on the village of S§g§, his Ghorkalese troops were confronted by five hundred n§g§-s who were fighting on behalf of one of his opponents, Jayaprak§á Malla, king of Kathmandu. The leader of the n§g§-s, Gul§bram, had given a sword to PÜthvÊN§r§yaÖ“§h when the latter visited him in Banaras twenty years previously. Gul§bram, believing the sword to be responsible for the king’s success in battle, had returned for recompense, which was denied. Gul§bram and his forces then took up arms with Jayaprak§á,but with disastrous consequences; all the n§g§-s were slaughtered by the Ghorkalese army. Gul§bram, however, escaped. During the 1780s, some seven hundred n§g§-s died in battle in another Himalayan province, Kumaon. 1,400 n§g§-s had been enlisted, with the promise of substantial financial rewards, by king Mohan Cand in his unsuc-cessful attempt to recapture his seat at Almora, from which he had been deposed by his rival, Harßdeo Joái, king of the neighbouring province, GaÜhv§l (Agrawal 1993:325).been an §c§ryafor forty-three years and had accumulated much wealth and several important temples; he was succeeeded by Govind§nand.70Crooke (1896, Vol. 4:238) reports that the D§dåpanthÊn§g§-s live in seven camps or villages in the neighbourhood of Jaipur.

As late as 1914, a group of D§dåpanthÊs offered military service to the Government of India for the First World War. However, they refused to enlist in the regular army, and their offer was not accepted (Orr 1940:12 fn. 4). 71See Burghart (1995) for the king’s attempt to found a “Hindu” kingdom.clark_BIL25a.indd 2485/30/2006 2:02:01 PM"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities249The careers of three prominent Daáan§mÊgosain n§g§-s, namely Rajendra Giri Gosain (d.1753), and his cel§-s, the brothers AnåpGiri Gosain (Himmat Bah§dur) (1730–1804) and Umrao Giri Gos-ain (b.1734), have been documented by Sarkar (1958:123–261) and Bhalla (1944).72 Their studies reveal the extent of some gosain-s’ power, wealth, influence and duplicity. At the height of their careers thegosain-s commanded a force of up to forty thousand horse and foot soldiers. The movement and recruitment of troops was greatly facilitated by a network of weapon-stocks and grain-stores in the countryside.Gosain-s also looked after food-producing small holdings at different times of the year. When on campaigns, most of which were executed in the Gangetic region, they carried equipment—includ-ing materials for mounting fortified locations—on elephants and other pack animals, and had camel-mounted guns. The army was equipped with excellent horses and state-of-the-art weapons, including musketry and artillery.73 They were highly regarded by the British as a fighting force, ranked alongside the Afghans, J§ãs and Sikhs, and particularly renowned for their night-time guerilla operations: naked, slippery with oil, and deadly with the dagger.Thegosain-s Rajendra Giri, Anåp Giri, Umrao Giri, and their n§g§ saÒny§sÊarmies, fought on behalf of several rulers and regents, their mercenary approach to war resulting on some occasions in their changing sides to fight on behalf of former adversaries. Their patrons in the mid-eighteenth century included the Safdar Jang,74vazÊr72See also Kolff (1971) and Barnett (1987) for further details of their activities and political developments.73Military equipment also included bows and arrows, shields, spears, discuses (worn around the neck), the ‘rocket’ (a metal cylinder with knives), and the ‘umbrella’ (a mechanism of revolving iron balls) (Orr 1940:16). 74The Mughals also supported R§m§nandÊn§g§-s at Ayodhya. Safdar Jang granted seven bÊgh§-s of land at Hanum§n hill to Abhay R§m D§s, the abbott of the Nirv§ÖÊakh§Ü§. During the reign of Shuja’s successor, Asaf ud-Daulah (r.1775–1793), funds were raised to construct part of the fortess-like building to be found at this site. It seems that originally the N§ths and then the Daáan§mÊs were the former occupants of the hill. The Daáan§mÊs also used to dominate Ayodhya, but were evicted from Ayodhya (except for the Siddhigiri maãha) and the hill then occupied by the Jån§akh§Ü§.

In league with the Afghans, the n§g§-s also fought the Mar§ãhas. Before the battle of Panipat in 1761, an assembly of the Afghans were most upset at the sight the naked army of Shuja, “with their things and buttocks exposed” (Sarkar 1958:158).A combined army of Mughals, Path§ns, Ruhel§s, R§jpåts,n§g§-s and others fought the British in battles at Patna and Buxar in 1764. However, the British repelled the attackers with superior fire-power (Sarkar 1958:163–166). Anåp Giri and Umrao Giri continued their mercenary activites under other patrons, including the J§ãs under JavahÊr Singh, in their unsuccessful campaign to capture Delhi from the Ruhel§s in 1764 and 1765 (Sarkar 1958:170–172). However, in 1767 the two gosain-s again changed sides, serving under the Mar§ãha,Ragun§th Rao (Sarkar 1958:178). During Rao’s absence in the Dec-can, the gosain-s lived by plundering BundelkhaÖ·, to be subsequently re-employed by the nav§b of Avadh, Shuja-ud-Daulah, between 1767 and 1775. They were paid the colossal sum of 48,000 rupees per year (Bhalla 1944:129).

Four thousand n§g§ saÒny§sÊ-s and bair§gÊ-s defended the shrine, but two thousand of them were slain (Sarkar 1958:154).77In battle against the Mar§ãhas in 1787, áaiva n§g§ gosain-s under Anåp Giri fought alongside another army of n§g§-s, including five thousand musketeers, under thevaißÖava bair§gÊ commander, B§lan§nand, who was in service to the Mah§r§ja of Jaipur, who had up to 10,000 n§g§-s in his army (Bhalla 1944:130–134; Sarkar 1958:226–252; Chandra 1977:21).78These were Mirza Najaf Kh§n (who seized Delhi in 1773); the Mar§ãha, M§dhav Rao Scindia (from 1784); and “§h$lam II.

In 1803 Anåp Giri and his forces at first united with the Mar§ãhas to repel the British, who were threatening Anåp’s territory. However, through the British Collector, Mr. Mercer, and Colonel Mieselbach, Anåp sold himself and his 4,000 cavalry and 8,000 foot-soldiers to the British. When his forces arrived they received a thirteen-gun-salute (Bhalla 1944:134).

Umrao Giri had two sons, namely Kum§r Jagat Giri and Uttam Giri, who were also involved in courtly life and mercenary activity (Sarkar 1958:245).clark_BIL25a.indd 2515/30/2006 2:02:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"chapter seven252as PiÖ·arÊs.82 Company records contain numerous reports of incur-sions by these ‘marauding’ and frequently armed groups, the first of which took place in 1743 (Ghosh 1930:36). Although often naked, leadinggosain-s frequently wore gold and silver bangles and necklaces, sometimes studded with pearls and diamonds (Ghosh 1930:19).British forces were subsequently engaged in numerous skirmishes and battles with bands of saÒny§sÊ-s and fakÊr-s in Bihar and Bengal (Ghosh 1930; Chandra 1977).83 The British version of events is, by and large, endorsed by Ghosh, whereby the ash-clad, bh§Øg-drinking saÒny§sÊ-s and fakÊr-s are presented as marauder-bandits, masquerading as pilgrims, but extracting money and goods from local landlords and peasants on false pretences. However, this view has been challenged (Chandra 1977; Chatterjee 1984): if the socio-economic situation of the region at the time is considered, then the disturbances can be seen as part of a larger movement of peasant unrest and rebellion against colonial repression and excessive taxation, sometimes lead-ing to starvation; saÒny§sÊ and fakÊrn§g§-s were frequently at the spearhead of the movement.8482After the battle of Panipat in 1761, the Mar§ãhas were forced to rely on mercenaries, some of whom received the name ‘PiÖ·arÊ’ (Gordon 1969:426).83From 1757 there are reports of battles between up to 5,000 saÒny§sÊ-s and British sepoys, forced seizure of money from zamÊnd§r-s’kacaharÊ-s (‘revenue offices’) and Collectors, and raids on villages and factories at Dacca and other places by groups of armed saÒny§sÊ-s and fakÊr-s. The first raid on a British factory was at Rampur Boalia, in Dacca, in 1763, by saÒny§sÊ-s assisted by unemployed cotton workers. In some raids British agents were killed, and army captains were regularly dispatched to disperse the raiders, not always successfully; both sides frequently sufferered extensive casualties. The raids were frequently successful as the robbers could flee from the British-held territories of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. In a series of succesful raids on zamÊnd§r-s in 1773, the saÒny§sÊ-s were led by Motit Giri and Dharma Giri (Chatterjee 1984:8). In the latter decades of the eighteenth century thefakÊr-s were under the leadership of the Mad§ri SåfÊ, Mañju “§h (d.1787), whose first raid in Bengal was conducted in 1771 (Chandra 1977:49–68). By 1774 he had established a cantonment in Dinajpur district of well-armed R§jpåts, with whom he had formed an alliance. A series of raids were conduced in 1786 by Musa “§h(d.1792), a relative of Manju, who retreated to a headquarters he had established in Gorkha, Nepal. Various groups of saÒny§sÊ-s and fakÊr-s operated out of Myemsingh (in what is now northern Bangladesh), an area over which ruling authorities, includ-ing Garos, Koches, Afghans, north-Indian Brahmans and breakaway Mughals, had only ever been able to exert minimal control (van Schendel 1985:140–144).84The situation was significantly exacerbated by the great famine of 1770/1771, when around one third of the population of Bengal, some fifteen million people, died. However, Warren Hastings was able to write to the Board of Directors that, despite the decrease in population, revenue had increased in 1771, in comparison clark_BIL25a.indd 2525/30/2006 2:02:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities253Groups of saÒny§sÊ-s and fakÊr-s—who ocasionally fought each other (Chandra 1977:29)—together with other pilgrims had for many centuries enjoyed annual pilgrimages to holy places in Bihar, Ben-gal and Assam.85 Some fakÊr-s had enjoyed extraordinary privileges under various patrons in the seventeenth and the early part of the eighteenth century. Prior to full British control over revenue, Muslim authorities occasionally issued sanad-s (‘deeds/grants’) to ensure the rights of the fakÊr-s to collect alms and acquire property,86 a demand on meagre peasant resources also regarded as legitimately collectable by the British in the form of tax. Some groups of saÒny§sÊ-s were also employed simply as mercenaries in the service of political rivals to the British.87British forces, under orders from Warren Hastings, made strenuous to 1768, owing to his diligent efforts: taxes were collected with the help of troops. Price-fixing, monopoly purchase, enforced monoculture, and control over trade in many goods, such as grain, salt, cotton and opium were amongst the economic tactics used by the British, leading to deprivation and workers’ anger. The price of rice increased enormously. Exorbitant demands for payment led to ryots being evicted from their land, many of them swelling the ranks of the roving saÒny§sÊand fakÊrbands, perhaps to up to 20,000 strong. Farmers enlisted the help of n§g§-s to resist new taxes introduced in 1770 (Chandra 1977:149, 166; Chatterjee 1984:6).85Visited by saÒny§sÊ-s and other Hindus in this part of India were places such as Janakpur (in the Terai), Mah§sthangarh (near Bogra), places along the Brahmapåtra river, GaØg§ S§gar (on the bay of Bengal, about fifty miles east of Calcutta), Jagann§th Påri and K§m§kßÊ (near Guahati). Many saÒny§sÊ-s began their annual pilgrmage cycle from the M§gh Mel§ at Allahabad in January/February. ThefakÊr-s and other Muslim pilgrims, who entered Bengal by the same route as that followed by the saÒny§sÊ-s—and who were generally better received in Muslim- dominated Bengal—went to darg§h-s, several of which are located in Dinajpur and Malda districts, and to the famous AdÊna mosque, near Pandua, also in the Malda district. Some pilgrimage sites were common to both fakÊr-s and saÒny§sÊ-s, one being a bath in the river Karotoya at Mah§sthangarh, where there is the darg§hof PÊr“§h Sultan (Ghosh 1930:24–29). Another was at Makhanpur, in the district of Cawnpore, 140 miles from Agra, where the headquarters of the Mard§rifakÊr-s and the tomb of “§h Mad§r are situated. Hindus also frequented the place, believing the saint to be an incarnation of Lakhan (Ghosh 1930:27).86In 1659 Shuja-ud-Daulah issued a sanadto the fakÊrJanab“§h Sultan Has§nMåri§ (of the Burhana sect, which is the same as the Mad§ris, who, of all SåfÊsects, most closely resemble saÒny§sÊ n§g§-s) whereby within the countries of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa he was free to roam with all the paraphernalia of the julås(‘pro-cession’), and confiscate properties with no heir, or which are rent-free. Although no contributions were to be levied, the fakÊr“will be supplied with provisions”, according to the sanad (Ghosh 1930:22).87Five or six thousand armed saÒny§sÊ-s undertook raids in 1773, in the pay of Darpa Deo, r§jaof Baikantapur. In the same year another large raiding group was reportedly in the pay of the Bhutanese (Chandra 1977:72–73).clark_BIL25a.indd 2535/30/2006 2:02:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"chapter seven254efforts to prohibit, rout and dispel the raiders entering Bengal. No less than four battalions of the army were actively engaged against thesaÒny§sÊ-s and fakÊr-s (Chandra 1977:84, 101–114), and attempts were also made to remove settled saÒny§sÊ-s—many of them being landless peasants—of which there were several thousand in some districts.88 The British negotiated with the Nepalese, and signed a treaty with the Tashu L§m§ of Bhutan, to prevent saÒny§sÊ-s from being resident in their territory, and by 1800 the rebellion that had continued for thirty-five years was finally suppressed. Raids on Com-pany-owned finance and property in east India ceased (Chandra 1977:131–137), and the few military n§g§-s who remained in south Bihar in 1809/1810 were reported to have abandoned arms (Pinch 1996:31).89Nevertheless, it seems that some saÒny§sÊ-s (or those pretending to be saÒny§sÊ-s) were still involved in criminal activities in the nine-teenth century. Their activities were were virtually indistinguishable from, and carried out in broadly the same region (central India) as those of maruding bands of PiÖ·arÊ highway robbers (van Woerkens 2002:26ff.). These bandits were also called Thag (Thug/Thugi/Thagi) by the British, a term that had already been used in South Asia to refer to criminal assassins for about a thousand years.90 In 1830, a government ‘Department of Thagis and Dacoits’ was set up by the 88A law was passed in 1773 to prohibit the carrying of arms by saÒny§sÊ-s and fakÊr-s, and certain sects of saÒny§sÊ-s,bair§gÊ-s and fakÊr-s were expelled from Bengal and Bihar, becoming ‘prohibited sects’. Farmers found to be harbouring members of prohibited sects were to be severely punished (Chandra 1977:60).89After a series of land-reforms had been implemented by Warren Hastings, by 1790 revenue collection for the British was undertaken by a new class of land-lords, who frequently employed saÒny§sÊ-s and fakÊr-s for that purpose. Under the Permanent Settlement of Bengal Act of 1793, responsibility for law and order then passed from the zamÊnd§r-s to a newly created police force (Chandra 1977:165). SomezamÊnd§r-s granted land, in a religious donation (sibbotar), rent-free, to ascetics. Landlords thereby enhanced their own status in the area, and gained a protection force of armed saÒny§sÊ-s to guard their estates. SaÒny§sÊ-s were also given land after they had assisted landlords’ own forces in repelling aggressors (Chatterjee 1984:3). In north and east Bengal, some saÒny§sÊ-s still live on the produce of endowed lands (Ghosh 1930:160).90Bh§sarvajña (ninth century) makes perhaps the first known reference: he refers to the ãhakaá§strain connection with the killing of Brahmans. Several writers use the term in the following centuries; and a fourteenth century Muslim report mentions thag-s. The term ãhaka/ãhagamay be derived from the Sanskrit root sthag(‘cover/conceal’). See Halbfass (1983:13, 24 fn. 61) for further details and references.clark_BIL25a.indd 2545/30/2006 2:02:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities255Governor General, Lord William Bentick. It was to oversee the activi-ties of Thugs, and was run by William Sleeman, a British official who is responsible for the stereotyping of the term ‘Thug’. Sleeman had read an article by Dr. Sherwood (a surgeon in Madras), published in 1816, entitled ‘Of The Murderers Called Phansigars [‘stranglers’]’, which so concerned him that he transfered to the Civil Service in 1918 (Annan 1967:64ff.).91 Sleeman, the initiator and architect of the anti-Thug campaign, came to believe that three-quarters of Hindu and Muslim mendicants were criminals (van Woerkens 2002:102ff.), and that the Thugs—who worshipped K§lÊ, and either strangled or poisoned their victims—constituted an organised criminal sect.92Such was the British suspicion of ascetics that a police handbook (s§dhu-i-kitab, written in Urdu) was issued in 1913 to enable officers to identify s§dhu-s by their appearance and sectarian markings (Pinch 1996:8). However, within the socio-political context of the time, it is apparent that the Thugs were not an organised religious sect or a caste; that their activities were entirely mercenary; and that the notion of a Thug ‘conspiracy’ was unfounded, but nevertheless helped to finance Sleeman’s department,93 which was quite successful in catch-ing and punishing several thousand criminals. Marauding PiÖ·arÊgroups that had previously been employed, on an occasional basis, as mercenaries by various powers such as the Mar§ãhas, in many instances simply continued their ‘criminal’ marauding activities when states had insufficient funds to pay them (see Gordon 1969).There is also a widely-held nationalist notion, still prevalent, of a specifically Hindu militant saÒny§sÊrebellion against British rule in the eighteenth century, famously taken up as the main theme of a novel by Bankim Chandra Chatterji94(1838–1894),$nandamaãh.The influence of this image is apparent in thatBande Mataram, the saÒny§sÊsong from the novel—which was set to music by Rabindra-nath Tagore—became the unofficial anthem of the Independence 91According to van Woerkens (2002:44ff.), who provides a comprehensive account of the Thugs, Sleeman first heard of specific crimes of the Thugs sometime between 1822 and 1824; an anti-Thug law was passed in 1836 (p.100).92See Sleeman (1903, Vol. 1:96–111) for his account of the iniquity of the Thugs.93The idea of a criminal religious cult also proved popular with the Victorian press and as a theme for novelists (see Rushby 2002:8–15).94For Chatterji’s role in the formation of Neo-Hinduism, see Halbfass (1988:243–246, 334–341).clark_BIL25a.indd 2555/30/2006 2:02:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"chapter seven256movement.95However, we have seen that the situation regarding s§dhu-s in the eighteenth century cannot simply be characterised as a Hindu saÒny§sÊuprising against British rule: SåfÊfakÊr-s were involved with saÒny§sÊ-s in the Bengal rebellion, and the gosainfight-ers formed substantial alliances with not only the Mughals but also the British. SaÒny§sÊ-s performed various roles in the period under discussion, both in support and against the rule of various powers. Nor can saÒny§sÊ-s and fakÊr-s be characterised, as they were by the British, as simply ‘Thugs’. This is to ignore the complex, various and shifting roles of many saÒny§sÊ-s in this period: as ascetics (some of whom would not so much as touch a coin), and as pilgrims, trad-ers, money-lenders, mercenaries, protection guards, bandits, and on occasion even diplomats.967.6 Gosain traders and bankers Many of the political conflicts previously discussed had ceased by the beginning of the nineteenth century, by which time many thou-sands of gosain-s97 had settled in Bengal and other parts of India, many of them being ex-soldiers from disbanded armies of various regents. These settled gosain-s, some of them rich from war, engaged 95M. K. Gandhi also took up the song as a constituent of his nationalist ideol-ogy. When V. D. Savarkar, the famous Indian freedom-fighter, was at high school in N§sik, he belonged to and recruited members to a secret society of revolutionar-ies, aiming to liberate their motherland from British rule. Members greeted each other with Bande Mataram, and in a pamphlet with that name Savarkar asserted that the assassination of British officials is the first stage of the revolution. In his monumental work, Indian War of Independence, 1857, Savarkar refutes British accounts of the Mutiny of 1857 as failed. The work, which describes how s§dhu-s,saÒny§sÊ-s andfakÊr-s can become revolutionaries, was banned but achieved wide circulation, becoming, for half a century, the Indian revolutionaries’ gospel and handbook. Savarkar was imprisoned for terrorist activities from 1910 to 1937. He then became president of the Hindu Mah§sabh§ from 1937 to 1944 (McKean 1996:73–77). See Savarkar (1989) for his conception of Hindutva.96In the 1770s, PuraÖ Gir mediated between the Panchen L§m§ and the British, serving both sides in their negotiation of a trade treaty between Bengal and Tibet. After the death of the L§m§, Puran Gir (and his successor, Daljit Gir) continued his negotiating role with the L§m§’s successor. In 1779 Puran Gir travelled with the Panchen L§m§ to Peking to visit the Chinese emperor (Clarke 1998:66).97The number of áaivaandvaißÖavaascetics in north India in the last decades of the eighteenth century was considerable, around 500,000, comprising around five percent of the population (Bayly 1992:126, 183).clark_BIL25a.indd 2565/30/2006 2:02:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities257in money-lending, banking and trading, involving significant amounts of money overall. Evidence of saÒny§sÊ-s’ involvement in trade may be seen in Banaras, where in 1787 they were the dominant merchant class, having a substantial trade in cloth, raw silk, gold and silver, in a network extending to the Deccan, Bengal and Nepal. In Banaras alone they owned forty of the leading business houses, representing a significant sector of the economy.98 Established also in Mirzapur, thegosain-s, who were mostly Giris, were described by G. H. Barlow, sub-secretary to the Bengal government, as being “a religious sect remarkable for their wealth, and for their integrity in all commercial transactions” (K. P. Mishra 1975:95–96). In Mirzapur, the gosain-s were the accepted leaders of the merchant community (Bayly 1992:143), one Giri mahantbeing notorious amongst merchants (Crooke 1896, Vol. 2:471). In 1911, the Giris of the Mirzapur area were reported to have land-holdings amounting to 44,784 acres, income deriving also from rent and money-lending (Chatterjee 1984:3–4).By the 1780s gosain-s had become the dominant money-lend-ing—frequently at exorbitant rates of interest99—and property-owning group in Allahabad, Banaras, Mirzapur, Ujjain and N§gpur (Bayly 1992:126, 143; Kolff 1971), and were major brokers in Rajasthan and the Deccan, at places such as Hyderabad and PåÖe (Clarke 1998:58).100 There was, however, often a very thin line indeed between tax-collection, dacoity and money-lending.10198In 1786/1787 the total value of the saÒny§sÊ-s’ imports and exports which passed through the customs houses of Banaras and Mirzapur was 1,614,759 Rs.. Around 40% of the trade was in raw silk, most of which was brought from Bengal and traded in Mirzapur and Banaras for bullion or other commodities (K. P. Mishra 1975:96). The figure given above only records the declaredgoods, and does not account for what appears to have been a substantial non-declared trade. In 1809/1810, one gosainmerchant alone sent silk worth 650,000 Rs. to the United Provinces (Cohn 1964:177).99Aware of the saÒny§sÊ-s’ profitable money-lending business, the British gov-ernment enacted various measures in 1772 to cap loan rates (at 2%) and restrict thesaÒny§sÊ-s’ business.100Chatterjee suggests that the increase in money-lending activities of the saÒny§sÊ-s was partly a consequence of a decline in their previously profitable silk-smuggling business. This decline was an effect of superior British production techniques, extra levies and custom posts. The saÒny§sÊ-s complained to the British admin-istration of being taxed in both Banaras and Mirzapur, and for a while tried to smuggle goods through Bihar. The British nevertheless recognised the value of the saÒny§sÊ-s’ trade (Cohn 1964:177).101Mar§ãha tax records of the mid-eighteenth century illustrate the nexus between clark_BIL25a.indd 2575/30/2006 2:02:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"chapter seven258In the 1780s, European banking houses were also established to finance trade, with the resultant consequence that samÖy§sÊ-s’ profitable loan businesses were effectively squeezed (Chatterjee 1984:7). The extent of the saÒny§sÊ-s’ money-lending business may be gauged from their involvement in the financing of the war between PÜthvÊN§r§yaÖ“§h, Jayaprak§á Malla and others, in their struggle for control of the Kathmandu valley in the mid-eighteenth century, referred to in the previous section. It is evident that PÜthvÊ N§r§yaÖ“§h helped finance his campaign with cash loans from saÒny§sÊ trad-ers, who had trade agencies in several cities in the valley.102 The gosain-s were repaid, and as a reward they were awarded charters to trade freely in his domain. The gosain-s profited handsomely from both sides throughout the duration of the conflict, in terms of both financial interest earned and trading rights.103 However, it appears that some gosain-s and Kashmiris were expelled from Nepal by PÜthvÊN§r§yaÖ“§h owing to their allegiance to the Malla dynasty (Regmi 1975, Vol. 1:117–121, 201).104During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it is apparent that somesaÒny§sÊmaãha-s—which were occasionally fortified (Ghosh money-lending, dacoity and mercenary activity. The gosain (or any) money-lender would typically loan money against the purchase of goods, and also arrange transport and guards. Default on repayment could result in land and its derivative revenue being acquired by the lender, an arrangement that was legally binding. Transfer of ownership of land and its revenue meant that the new ‘owner’ could demand money from tenants. Rulers also used their military forces to collect taxes, and the military were often gosain-s (Gordon 1971).102The first request for a loan was made in 1745, addressed to Mahant Kamala Bana, Mahant Lakßman PurÊ, and D§yal PurÊ. This was in a period when Jayaprak§áMalla was in exile—but not abdication—from his throne in Kathmandu. In 1748, Jayaprak§á Malla, alarmed at the threat to his realm, then borrowed 20,000 Rs., after extensive bargaining, from Kamala Bana Gosain and Rakham PurÊ Gosain to help finance his bid to reclaim the throne, which was successful.103In 1764 Jayaprak§á issued a charter requesting that the gosain-s—Durbasa Bana, Lakßman Bana, Jageávara Bana, BhagavatÊ Bana (disciple of Kamala Bana), Bhor Bana, Naval Bana and Catår Bana—reside in Kathmandu with him, enjoying royal favour. After the eventual fall of Kathmandu, the new ruler PÜthvÊ N§r§yaÖ“§h continued to support gosain-s. In 1786 he issued another charter, addressed to the first four of the above-named gosain-s, permitting them to conduct trade to Tibet, subject to statutory checking and taxes. It is curious that this lineage of Daáan§mÊs, the Bana (Van), although so prominent in Nepal in the eighteenth century, is very meagrely represented these days.104Sometime after 1792 the gosain-s were also expelled from Tashilumpo in Tibet, owing to the suspicion by the Chinese authorities that they were acting as spies for their enemies (Clarke 1998:56, 67).clark_BIL25a.indd 2585/30/2006 2:02:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities2591930:20)—became, effectively, storehouses for the trade in goods (including raw silk, shawls, opium, gold, silver, copper and spices) which was carried out by cel§-s of various mahant-s over wide areas of north India. SaÒny§sÊtraders who profited were able to buy land, sometimes acquired from both peasants and landlords suffering insu-perable debt. Individuals and groups of pilgrims traded in precious and semi-precious gems, notably coral and pearl from the Coroman-del coast and Sri Lanka. They also traded in diamonds, brocade, broadcloth, tobacco, indigo and conch shells. Coral and pearl were two of the principal exports from Bengal to Tibet, while musk, gold-dust and yaktails were brought from there (Clarke 1998). A network ofmaãha-s and pilgrimage routes throughout India greatly facilitied contacts, trade, resting places and loan facilities. Armed n§g§-s were available to protect the transportation of goods and bullion traded from as far afield as Ahmadabad, BaÜaud§, PåÖe, N§gpur, Bengal, Kashmir, Nepal and Tibet. The n§g§-s’ religious status and their fearsome reputation also made them virtually immune from pros-ecution or police harrassment (Bayly 1992:184). In 1792, the r§jaof Nepal complained that “although the fakÊr105 is full of faults and deserving death”, he could only expell them from his territory and could not confine or kill them, as that would be contrary to religious law (Ghosh 1930:9).106Thegosain-s were all members of a religious fraternity107 whose 105In Nepalese records of this period, the term fakÊris used also for saÒny§sÊ.106The different status of ascetics regarding the law may be seen also in ancient India, in Dharmaá§stra. Olivelle (1987:48), reviewing injunctions found in several works, notes that ascetics, when found guilty of a crime, were not subject to the corresponding punishment (instead they were required to perform religious works for the king); they were not to be tortured during interrogations; judges were expected to show leniency towards them; and wandering asectics could obtain a pass from the Controller of Shipping that allowed them to cross rivers without paying the usual fee. Amongst the privileges for Brahmanical ascetics were land-grants that were made to them in newly-settled countyside; they were exempted from the salt tax; and the property of an ascetic could not be taken as booty when an enemy’s land was conquered. 107Clarke (1998:53) suggests that the gosain-s may have been either vaißÖavaor áaiva.However,gosv§min(gosain) followers of Caitanya and Vallabh§c§rya are not, to my knowledge, ever mentioned in ethnographic reports of the period.

They were also favoured as religious mendicants who, in some kingdoms, were exempt from full taxation on their goods. In Banaras, for example, gosain-s paid special rates on their transit goods (Bayly 1992:143, 165). Maãha-s also received religious donations, particularly at mel§-s when pilgrims frequently donated handsomely to a mahant, and generally used rent-free land. The passing of wealth from a desceased mahantto, frequently, a sole cel§ or a closed group of cel§-s, ensured that institutional wealth, which was sometimes considerable, remained ‘in house’.108 This arrangement had distinct financial advantages over the traditional family arrangement, whereby a father’s wealth and property was often dispersed to many relatives, sometimes geographically distant, upon his death.Even in the mid-nineteenth century the gosain-s were still an impor-tant element in north Indian trade and commerce.109 They owned fleets of boats and controlled a major share of the trade along the Ganges, transporting goods from the United Provinces to Bengal—some of which went on to Europe—and brought Bengali and British goods to Mirzapur and Banares for trade (Cohn 1964:180). Until the 1840s gosain-s remained the key inland merchants in the growing colonial trade in cotton. The British were significantly irritated by the success, authority and general popularity of the gosain-s—a popu-larity the colonial masters did not enjoy—and attempted to blackentheir name. The gosain-s, however, were no economic partisans: in 1857 the gosain maãha-s of the United Provinces had at least 200,000 Rs. invested in government paper currency (Bayly 1992:241–242).In north India, there was a decline of the trading activities of the Daáan§mÊ connotations only in the nineteenth century in Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh where it generally referred to n§g§-s. By the end of the century gosainhad become a general term for both áaivaandvaißÖava s§dhu-s. 108In a case that reached court in Calcutta, the disputed wealth of one maãha—not considering immovable property—amounted to 242,000 Rs. (A. K. Mishra 1975:99).109During the late eighteenth century, corporate religious institutions had invested in a substantial building programme. In Banaras, by 1816, there was said to be one pilgrim rest house for every ten houses. The use of dressed stone in the construction of religious buildings was a major influence on the stone-cutting business, which was controlled by the ascetic orders (Bayly 1992:127).clark_BIL25a.indd 2605/30/2006 2:02:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities261gosain-s in the nineteenth century, which may have been a conse-quence of agricultural development in the Punjab and the change from river to railway transport (Cohn 1964:181). The increase in British hold over trade and exports is also evident, in that between 1814 and 1854 British exports in commodities tripled (Rothermund 1993:23). However, the gosain akh§Ü§-s adapted astutely to changing economic patterns, diversifying rapidly into urban property owner-ship after 1802.110 Following the construction of the railways, the gosain-s also capitalised on the rapidly rising value of urban properties. Although the gosain-s’ involvement in trade and banking declined in the nineteenth century, they still enjoyed considerable income from rent,111 and maintained their position as a major money-lending 110It has been estimated that around 250,000 acres of land are still owned by the Daáan§mÊakh§Ü§-s, about half being the property of the Jån§akh§Ü§.Until recently, the entire Girnar hills area in Gujarat was under the control of a n§g§from the Jån§akh§Ü§(Gross 1992:163).111In Banaras district in 1909, the gosain-s owned 10,304 acres of land (Nevill 1909b:114). Sinha and Saraswati (1978:262) provide a list of nine paramahaÒsa-s of Banaras who, between 1926 and 1931, had substantial bank deposits at the koãhÊ(‘banking house’) of the JaØgambarimaãha before the koãhÊwent into legal liquida-tion. Their deposits were mostly of around 2,000 Rs. to 3,000 Rs., but one, that of Sv§mÊ Svaråp§nanda MaÖ·aleávara, was of over 20,000 Rs. Joint families of‘respectable’ city bankers could earn around 20,000 to 80,000 Rs. per annum towards the end of the nineteenth century (Bayly 1973:41). It seems that up until around 1925 there were a few wealthy maãha-s in Banaras that were also known as koãhÊ-s. ThekoãhÊ-s used to feed the general public and ascetics on certain occasions but were guarded and only inhabited by the mahantand his servants who entertained wealthy people and high officials. It seems that some of the paramahaÒsa maãha-s of Banaras were once affluent, namely the Bih§rÊ PurÊ, Bodh Gay§, Param§rtha Giri, DakßiÖamårti, Dhurbeávara, Jageávara, Haãhiy§ R§ma, NarsiÒh Cauk, Annapårna,Hari GÊrÊka, and Prak§á§nandamaãha-s.SaÒny§sÊestates also occasionally have an ambiguous position in regards to religious status and the law. Sinha and Saraswati (1978:80) cite a legal case (Judgement of the High Court of Allahabad, Case No. 21 [1928], Appeal No. 584 [1934]) involving one Sv§mÊ R§mcaran PurÊ, who describes himself as a landlord (zamÊnd§r) and a banker, and not a paramahaÒsa.He states that he is the Municipal Commissioner of Banaras, paying a substantial amount of money in taxes and rent money to the government and the Mah§r§ja of Banaras. (Per year, he paid 2,000 Rs. to the government, 35,000 Rs. to the Mah§r§ja, 200 Rs. in municipal taxes, 208 Rs. in income tax and “some anna-s” on banking business.) He had inherited the property, themaãha, from his ancestors and also purchased further property himself. There were three temples on his property, of LakßmÊ, Mah§deva and Bh§gavatÊ, and he would feed and distribute alms to visiting Brahmans, áådra-s and fakÊr-s. He argued that his property was not an endowment, that he was the sole owner, and that he had the right to sell or mortgage it should he so choose. He claimed to have been given the property without any conditions attached, and to be performing clark_BIL25a.indd 2615/30/2006 2:02:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"chapter seven262group, not only in the cities, but also in the small towns and vil-lages along pilgrimage routes (Bayly 1992:452).112 Even in the early twentieth century the Mah§r§ja of Jaipur employed a group of n§g§-sas tax collectors (Farquhar 1925c:452). The influence of the gosain-s on the economy of north India had been such that Bayly (1992:242) comments: “As some of the largest urban property owners in the Gangetic and central Indian towns, and as important lower-level money-lenders, ironically it was [gosain-s] who became the nearest of any Indian business community to the emerging bourgeoisie that European theorists, from Sleeman to Marx, wished to see”.7.7 SaÒny§sÊ-s and the modern political worldThe wealth of merchants and bankers appears to have played a significant role in the establishment of the nascent Congress Party. Although some members of the Viceroy’s executive council assumed that the Congress was supported by journalists, lawyers and other professionals, it is apparent that between 1885 and 1901, very many of the elected members were from the trading and banking classes, such as the Naupati bankers, the commercial aristocracy of Banaras. These bankers (mah§jan) financed pilgrim centres and trade in sugar, indigo, opium, g§ñj§andbh§Øg. A high percentage of the assets of the major bankers, who had a close connection with the functions of local government, was also absorbed in the foundation of tem-ples, bathing gh§ã-s, community shrines and religious trusts (Bayly 1973:29–43). In terms of life-style, there was little difference between bankers and saÒny§sÊ-s.113On another front, in Calcutta, it was believed in 1912 that an akh§Ü§was being used as a cover for the Midnapore revolutionary charitable activities only, without the constraints that would be incumbent upon an endowed property.112Nevill (1909a:256) remarks that the UdasÊs [of Uttar Pradesh]: “Besides their religious duties carry on a considerable trade in money-lending”. The Daáan§mÊáaiva akh§Ü§-s of the n§g§ gosain-s (the [Mah§]-Nirv§ÖÊ, NirañjanÊ and Jån§) are said by Nevill (1911:71) to be “equally wealthy and carry on extensive banking business”. 113Until the 1880s, the major bankers of Allahabad lived as joint families in several small mud houses in the central market area. In a typical mah§janÊfamily, food remained strictly vegetarian and servants were few (Bayly 1973:41–42).clark_BIL25a.indd 2625/30/2006 2:02:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities263society, plotting aginst British rule (Taylor 2001:52).

Gandhi urged then§g§-s to visit military camps and advise the soldiers to give up their employment (Pinch 1996:5).

However, as has been explored by McKean (1996), there is a considerable connection between several important saÒny§sÊinstitutions and right-wing organisations such as the RSS, BJP,114 VHS115 and VHP.116 The VHP—which has recruited many s§dhu-s to its ranks117(Jaffrelot 1996:355)—supported the claim of 114By 1991, the BJP had six saffron-clad MPs (Jaffrelot 1996:479).115The closing ceremony of a meeting of the Viá§l Hindu Sammelan, held in Kerala in April 1982, was presided over by the “aØkar§c§rya of K§ñcÊpuram (Chiriyankandnath 1998:212). 116One prominent example is the relationship between the VHP (Viáva Hindu Parißad) and the Divine Life Society (DLS). The DLS was founded in 1936 by Sv§mÊ“iv§nanda, its headquarters being in Haridv§r.“iv§nanda (SarasvatÊ) took saÒny§sa in 1924 from the Daáan§mÊ, Sv§mÊ Viáv§nandasarasvatÊ, though he subsequently makes virtually no reference to his guru. One of “iv§nanda’s early disciples was Sv§mÊ Cinm§y§nanda (d.1993), who founded the VHP in 1964, which the DLS carefully avoid mentioning. “iv§nanda’s successor, Sv§mÊ Cid§nanda, maintains ties with the VHP. Significant events in the expansion of the DLS were “iv§nanda’s founding of the All World Religions’ Federation in 1945, and the All World Sadhus’ Federation in 1947 (McKean 1996:164–179). At the inaugural meeting of the VHP in August 1964, it was decided to organise a world Hindu sammelanduring the Allahabad Kumbh Mel§, on 22–24 January 1966. Among the 25,000 attending delegates were two “aØkar§c§ryas, from Dv§rak§ and PurÊ (Jaffrelot 1996:198; Bhatt 2001:180–185). For the involvement of JayendrasarasvatÊ (“aØkar§c§rya of the K§ñcÊpÊãha) with the VHP in the 1980s, see Jaffrelot (1996:357).117Jaffrelot (1996:357) maintains that the Hindu nationalist movement made major advances in the early 1980s by mobilising Hindu leaders who could be seen as ‘ecclesiastical’ authorities.clark_BIL25a.indd 2635/30/2006 2:02:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"chapter seven264Sv§mÊ V§sudev§nanda to the succession to the Jyotir pÊãhain 1998, his rival being beaten up at the Kumbh Mel§ (Krishnan 2002:28).

Firstly, although thesaÒny§sÊ is projected as being ‘beyond caste’ both in Brahmani-cal texts and in many contemporary anthropological and Hindu studies reviews, it is evident from our survey of Daáan§mÊ institutions in the first three chapters of this book that caste has an important influence on the life of the saÒny§sÊ. Secondly, even though most Brahmanical texts proscribe saÒny§safor women, references in the Introduction and Chapter 1 illustrate both the historical and the current existence of numerous women saÒny§sin-s.Noted in the Introduction were the studies of Dumont (1960; 1998) and Burghart (1978; 1983a; 1983b; 1996). It was observed that Dumont’s seminal article of 1960, which apprehended the image presented in Brahmanical texts of the ‘lone’ saÒny§sÊwho lives inde-pendently of the conventional social world, ignored the renunciate’s necessary initiation into a new social order, namely a renunciate institution. Burghart’s more sophisticated model, which was refined in his later publications, of parallel social orders whereby the political realm and renunciate institutions are juxtaposed, while improving on Dumont’s analysis, was also found to be inadequate—even if ini-tially useful for understanding a complex range of phenomena—for encapsulating the complex roles that renunciates have played and 1990s under the stewardship of JayendrasarasvatÊ, the K§ñcÊmaãhasignifi-cantly expanded its investments in hospitals, schools and colleges (http://www.countercurrents.org/comm-anand231104.htm, p. 3).clark_BIL25a.indd 2665/30/2006 2:02:12 PM"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities267continue to play. In the previous section, the influences of some saÒny§sÊ-s on the political world at the highest level were presented. Such involvement undermines the neat distinctions between social worlds that Burghart articulated. I would contend that the roles of saÒny§sÊ-s and other renunciates are historically too complex to be captured in any kind of binary model, even though such models may serve as useful navigatory schemes. Several ethnographies were cited in the Introduction to illustrate howsaÒny§sÊ-s are not only lone mendicants, but are settled as castes in various regions of India, performing a variety of roles, as priests, farmers and traders. Many of these settlements seem to have been established by ex-mercenaries after the demise of the saÒny§sÊ n§g§armies during the nineteenth century, whose activities have been reviewed in this chapter. Amassed wealth was most probably, in some instances, also channelled into land and property now at the disposal of the akh§Ü§-s and paramahaÒsa maãha-s. The role of saÒny§sÊ-s in the history of India since the sixteenth century is evidently complex, whether viewed from religious, economic or political perspectives; and the material presented in this book illustrates this.Historically, there may well have been some old, male, Brahman ritualists who renounced ritual life and wandered alone. However, these Brahman saÒny§sÊ-s would have been already initiated into the Brahmanical world through upanayana. An important consideration is whether the many kinds of ascetics—who were not old Brah-mans—mentioned by commentators during the first millennium could have adopted that way of life without being formally initiated by a guru. In the modern context, the saÒny§sarite, which has remained substantially stable in form since the earliest textual records (from around the third century BCE), simultaneously constitutes both a renunciation of a former social life, and an initiation into a spiritual lineage via a guru. The saÒny§sÊis not a ‘real’ and recognised saÒny§sÊunless he or she has passed through the viraj§-homaunder a guru. This is true today, and I have argued that it is highly improbable—but for some exceptions—that it was otherwise in the past, though this is difficult to substantiate. In general, lineages—inherent in guru-parampar§-s—transmit religious teachings, a sectarian mythology and a sectarian identity, and engender institutions over time. It is this package that essentially constitutes a sect, whether in the context of settledsaÒny§sÊcommunities, or amongst wandering s§dhu-s.The analysis of the saÒny§sarite in a modern context (presented clark_BIL25a.indd 2675/30/2006 2:02:13 PM"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"chapter seven268in Chapter 3) illustrates how the two main wings of the Daáan§mÊscome together on the occasions of its performance, when represen-tatives from the monastic tradition also provide preceptors for the militant wing of the akh§Ü§-s. The ten lineages of the Daáan§mÊs, spread between the daÖ·Ê-s, paramahaÒsa-s and n§g§-s, are brought together not only through initiation rites, but through the adoption of an identificatory structure, encapsulated in the information con-tained in the Maãh§mn§ya-s, texts which were analysed in Chapter 4. When the saÒny§sÊis initiated, the guru imparts to the candidate the relevant details regarding how his or her new name fits into the scheme of the Maãh§mn§ya-s, with its associated identificatory markers (brahmac§rÊname,gotraname, and samprad§yaname) and association of the name with one of the four pÊãha-s, which has its jurisdiction and founding §c§rya.“aØkara’s fame as an advaitaphilosopher, and his well-established reputation for performing a digvijayaand found-ing four maãha-s and an order of Brahmanical ascetics, provide the specific substance that bonds the identity of the Daáan§mÊs as a sect ofsaÒny§sÊ-s. One of the central issues of this study was to investi-gate how this identity came to be forged, in the light of historical information which undermines the veracity of the Maãh§mn§ya-s’ presentation of the founding of the sect.In the latter part of Chapter 4, it was shown how numerous maãha-s have claimed to be founded by “aØkara, and that claims were being contested by several of them in the nineteenth century. Still today, the K§ñcÊpuram and the “ÜØgerÊmaãhaare in dispute as to which one is the genuine southern pÊãha. Guru-parampar§-s were shown to be unreliable, and with the exception of the southern pÊãha-s, some of which appear to date from the thirteenth century, records of the othermaãha-s cannot be traced back further than about 250 years. In attempting to understand how the name of “aØkara came to be associated with the founding of a monastic tradition, the contents of his hagiographies were examined in Chapter 5. It was shown how the early hagiographies make no mention of the founding of maãha-s, and that the four maãha-s first appear in hagiographic work in an ‘incomplete’ form in the late sixteenth century at the earliest. Regarding the founding of a renunciate order, amongst the twenty extant hagiographies, only in one of the later texts (Cidvil§sa’s“aØkara-vijaya-vil§sa) are the ‘ten names’ briefly enumerated. This text may be dated to the late sixteenth century (or slightly later), a period when, for the first time, the ‘ten names’ phrase also appears in other texts.clark_BIL25a.indd 2685/30/2006 2:02:13 PM"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"n§g§-s, såfÊs and parallel religious identities269It is apparent from “aØkara’s own works (which were examined in Chapter 5) and the works of his immediate disciples (analysed in Chapter 6) that “aØkara and most of his disciples (Toãaka, Sureávara and Padmap§da) were not áaiva, yet “aØkara is projected as a áaiva in hagiographic works, which began to be produced around the fourteenth century. In Chapter 6 it was proposed that “aØkara, who was relatively unknown during his lifetime and for several centuries thereafter, was projected as an incarnation of “iva by hagiogra-phers in the image of their Vijayanagara patrons, who—in common with many other regents of the Deccan between the eighth and fifteenth centuries—were initiated into “aivism by áaiva r§ja-guru-s. This established “aØkara’s reputation as a áaiva, yet, as mentioned, the hagiographies generally fail to provide the key features central to Daáan§mÊ identity, namely that “aØkara founded four maãha-s and an order of ascetics.In Chapter 6 it was also shown how the early Vijayanagara regents patronised“ÜØgerÊ from the mid-fourteenth century, effectively estab-lishing a lineage and a maãhathat represented a ‘new’, orthodox form ofadvaita“aivism. However, it was evinced that there is no historical evidence to associate “aØkara with the founding of a maãhaat any of the places now recognised as “aØkaritepÊãha-s, including “ÜØgerÊ. In this chapter (Chapter 7) political developments during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries have been analysed, and it has been pro-posed that these developments provide an entirely adequate context for understanding the formation of an identity for a Hindu sect such as the Daáan§mÊs. It was during this period that militant akh§Ü§-s of all the sects appear to have formed, and it was proposed that the structure of Daáan§mÊ identity may have been influenced by the model of sectarian identity that had been developed by SåfÊ orders, who during this period exercised significant influence within the dominant Islamicate polities of north India. Through the creation of an orthodox Daáan§mÊ identity, with parampar§-s receding to “aØkara,lineages of both militant n§g§ saÒny§sÊ-s and those pertaining to the monastic tradition were forged into a sect with an identity, gaining added prestige from being founded by someone who was, by then, a famous Brahman saÒny§sÊ. It has been proposed that the tradition embodied in the Maãh§mn§ya-s is possibly of much more recent origin than is generally believed.It should be emphasised that the conclusions derived from this study of religious developments in South Asia from the early to late mediaeval period are but a ‘thesis in process’: further information clark_BIL25a.indd 2695/30/2006 2:02:14 PM"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"chapter seven270may come to light that could undermine any aspect of this study; and constructive criticism is invited.

Several typographical errors have been corrected, and variant readings of words and phrases are occasionally substituted from other versions of Maãh§mn§ya-s, notably “arma’s (1963:642–652), where Mishra’s text is unclear. For the translation, Mishra’s (2001:1–52) English translation was consulted, as was that of Dazey (1987:577–602), and the Hindi translations of Up§dhy§y (1967:601–617) and Miára (1996:33–57). In the various published versions of the Maãh§mn§y§-s the order of some of the verses is different, even though the content is substantially similar; this has been indicated in the footnotes. The published versions of the Maãh§mn§ya-s (given below) generally follow the verse order of either “arma (1963) or Mishra (2001). [‘l’ =line; ‘v’ =verse.] Maãh§mn§ya-s, or extracts from them, are contained in the following Hindi publications:“arma (1963:642–652); Up§dhy§y (1967:601–617); Vidy§nand Giri (1993:60–65); Miára (1996:33–57); Sad§nand Brahmac§rÊ (2001:24–26); PurÊ(2001:44–48); Haridv§r Giri (n.d.:66–69). The Maãh§mn§yopanißad(a short version of the Maãh§mn§ya-setu) is published in Un-Published Upanißads (Kunhan Raja 1933:48–49). Antarkar (2001:72) refers to versions I have not seen: Maãh§mn§ya-stotram andMaãh§mn§ya-setu (ed. Bodas), “rÊraØgam: V§Öi Vil§s Press (1954;1958; 1975). Three English publications contain Maãh§mn§ya-s: Aiyer and Sastri (1962:49–57, 102, 110); Chakraborty (1973:180–181), which contains two short sections; and Mishra (2001:1–52), which contains an appendix (Appendix 2:59–61) that compares the verses of three published versions of Maãh§mn§ya-s, those of “arma (1963), Up§dhy§y(1967), and Kameßvar N§th Miára (1996).

Each one properly abiding in his own territory, wandering around is to be practised. The §c§ryashould not make a permanent residence in a maãha.43.

It is the largest festival on earth, when, in recent years, up to an estimated fifteen million people will pass through or reside permanently during the six weeks of the festival.2 The main purpose is to bathe at par-ticularly auspicious times, of which there are usually five during each Mel§.3 Bathing at auspicious times4is believed to eradicate accumulated sin and, for the more mythologically minded, to confer 1The terms mel§andparvboth mean ‘festival’ or ‘occasion for religious obser-vance’,parv being the term generally preferred by saÒny§sÊ-s. The term kumbhameans ‘pot’, and also indicates the astrological sign of Aquarius.2Bedi and Bedi (1991:114) provide the following statistics for the attendance (in millions) at the Pray§ga Kumbh for MaunÊ Am§vasy§: 1906, (2.5); 1918, (3); 1930, (4); 1942, (1.2); 1954, (6); 1966, (7); 1977, (10); 1989, (15). MaunÊ Am§vasy§is the most important bath of the Mel§, and also a time most auspicious in the Hindu calendar for offering piÖ·§for ancestor (pitÜ) worship.3The main baths for the Kumbh Mel§ are as follows (the dates are for the 2001 Pray§g Kumbh; saØkr§ntiis the term used for when the sun or a planet enters a new astrological sign; * indicates the most important baths for saÒny§sÊ-s). At Pray§g: Paußa PårÖim§ (full-moon, plus eclipse, 9th Jan.); Makar SaØkr§nti* (14th Jan.); MaunÊ Am§vasy§* (24th Jan.); Basant PañcmÊ* (29th Jan.); M§ghÊ PårÖim§ (8th Feb.); Mah§-“ivar§tri (12th Feb.). The akh§Ü§-s perform the ‘royal procession’ (á§hÊ julås)three times: Makar SaØkr§nti, MaunÊ Am§vasy§, and Basant PañcmÊ.

Discussed in the text is how to properly discharge the traditional triple-debt (ÜÖatraya) to the seers, ancestors and gods: pilgrimage is stated to be one of the incumbent duties (Bharati 1963:147). On the significance of tÊrtha(‘ford’)-y§tr§, Salomon (1979) trans-lates and discusses a mediaeval text, TÊrtha-praty§mn§y§È, the earliest extant version of which appears in the SmÜtyarthas§raof“rÊdhara, dating to c.1150–1200. In this text, around one hundred pilgrimage sites throughout India are ranked according to the amount of merit obtained by visiting them, the merit being evaluated in terms of both the distance to be travelled, and a correspondence with regimes of purification penances (kÜcchraorpr§j§patya-kÜcchra) (see Ch. 3.1). The fundamental feature of the system of the TÊrtha-praty§mn§y§È is its emphasis on rivers, the text being organised around the main rivers of India.6The second most important mel§ for the akh§Ü§-s is that at GaØg§ S§gar, near Calcutta, held every year during Makar SaØkr§nti.clark_BIL25a.indd 2885/30/2006 2:02:25 PM"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"appendix 3289GaØg§ and Yamun§ rivers;7 Haridv§r, on the banks of the GaØg§;Ujjain, on the banks of the “ipr§; and Tryambakeáwar (near N§sik), on the banks of the God§varÊ.“aiva n§g§initiations take place in Pray§g, Haridv§r and Ujjain, whereas vaißÖava n§g§initiations take place at N§sik.8 There is a tradition that “aØkar§c§rya organised the Kumbh Mel§, or that he organised attending groups of ascetics (Krasa 1965:181). However, there appears to be no evidence to sup-port this belief. We will see that both the astrological determinants of the festival and also the notion that the Kumbh Mel§ occurs at one of four sites—which has an explanatory myth—were most probably invented in the mid-nineteenth century.One of the widely known mythological stories in the Hindu tradi-tion is that of the ‘Churning of the Ocean of Milk’ (kßÊr§bdhi-manthana)and the production of the Nectar of Immortality (amÜta).9 The story appears in both the R§m§yaÖa10 and the Mah§bh§rata,11 and later in more or less embellished variants in the Agni, VißÖu, Brahm§Ö·a, V§yu, Kårma, Padma, Skanda, Matsya and Bh§gavata Pur§Öa-s.12 It is famously represented in architecture—dating from the twelfth century—at Ankor Wat in Cambodia.Thedeva-s (gods), defeated by asura-s (demons) and ashamed of their weakness, approached VißÖu, seeking rejuvenation and immor-tality. VißÖu directed them to the primeval ocean that contained the secrets of life and death. The gods enlisted the help of the demons to churn the cosmic milk-ocean, so as to extract various boons, espe-cially the amÜta, contained in its depths. Mount Mandara—said in some accounts to be near Mount Kail§sa—was used as the churning stick. This ‘stick’ was supported on the back of the Tortoise King 7The extinct SarasvatÊ river is also said to emerge from underground at the saØgamof the GaØg§ and Yamun§ rivers.8The three vaißÖava n§g§ akh§Ü§-s belong to the R§m§nandÊ order (see Ch. 2.1).9The popular legend appeares in numerous Hindi publications; see, for example, Up§dhy§y (n.d.).

After many years of churning, fumes, gases and, finally, deadly poison was produced. To save the situation,“iva drank the poison. ParvatÊ (or VißÖu) prevented him from swallowing it, and his throat turned blue,13 hence one of his epithets, NÊlakaÖãha (blue-throat). Thereafter, fourteen extraordinary treasures were produced, including14 an aerial car (vim§na pußpaka), Air§vata (the elephant), the P§rij§ta tree (erythrina indica), a flying horse, a priceless jewel (kaustubha), the waxing Moon, Rambh§ (one of the celestial dancers at Indra’s court), five auspicious cows (LakßmÊ,Suråpa, Yamun§, SuáÊl§ and Saurabhi), Viávakarma (the cosmic architect), and, lastly, Dhanvantari (the divine healer),15 holding a pot (kumbha) of amÜta, which was handed to Indra.Thedeva-s and asura-s had previously agreed to share the amÜta, but thedeva-s reneged at this point and kept the whole pot for themselves, fearing the invincibility of the asura-s should they drink the amÜta.Theasura-s then snatched away the kumbhaofamÜtafrom the deva-s. N§r§yaÖa, concerned about the consequences of this, assumed the form of an enchanting female, MohinÊ, whose charms caused the asura-s to loosen their grip on the pot. The deva-s snatched back the pot and started drinking the amÜta.R§hu (the ascending node of the moon), one of the asura-s, disguised himself as a deva in order to get a drink of the nectar. However, just as he began to sip the nectar, he was noticed by the Sun and the Moon who warned N§r§yaÖa. N§r§yaÖa cut R§hu’s throat with his discus, but R§hu’s head and throat became immortal and ascended to heaven, remaining the eternal enemy of the Sun and Moon. Meanwhile, “ukr§c§rya (Venus), the preceptor of the asura-s, alerted the asura-s to MohinÊ’s enchant-ment. The asura-s attacked the deva-s and a battle ensued. There are several different accounts of what followed.Pertinent to the mythology of the Kumbh Mel§ is the story whereby BÜhaspati ( Jupiter), the preceptor of the deva-s, assisted. This particular version of the conclusion of the fight between the deva-s and asura-s 13This part of the account, wherein gases and poison were produced, and “iva drank the poison, is not in the Mah§bh§rata.(Simon Brodbeck kindly pointed this out.)14Accounts vary slightly on what was produced.15The ‘patron saint’ of the Indian medical profession.clark_BIL25a.indd 2905/30/2006 2:02:27 PM"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"appendix 3291underpins the mythology of the sacredness and linkage between the four sites. In this story, BÜhaspati told Jayanta, the son of Indra, to flee with the amÜtaand hide it from the asura-s. Jayanta took the form of a rook and, assisted by the Sun and the Moon, fled with thekumbha, pursued by the asura-s. A fight between the deva-s and asura-s took place for twelve days, and depending on the account: either the kumbha fell to earth at the four sites, Pray§g, Haridv§r, Ujjain and N§sik; or the sites were where Jayanta rested; or the kumbha was hidden at the four earthly sites and eight heavenly sites for twelve divine days (equalling twelve human years), when a few drops spilled en route, sanctifying the places. During the battle, the gods sent the Moon to prevent the pot from overflowing; the Sun to protect it from bursting; Saturn to prevent the contents being devoured by Jayanta; and BÜhaspati to protect Jayanta from the demons, during which twelve-year period he was staying in the signs (r§ái) of Aquarius (Kumbha), Taurus (VÜßa), Leo (SiÒha) and Scorpio (VÜácika), hence the origin of the twelve-year cycle of the Kumbh Mel§ and the determination of the timing of the Mel§ according to the position of Jupiter.16Whereas the story of the ‘Churning of the Ocean’ and the fight between the deva-s and asura-s is told in a number of texts, including the epics and Pur§Öa-s, the story of Jayanta and the spilling of the nectar at four places does not appear therein, notwithstanding current claims for the antiquity of the mel§.17 The myth of the spilling of the 16There are also other legends of the spilling of the nectar (Dubey 1987:121; Rai 1993b:43–44; Nandan 2002:3–4). In one, it is Garu·a who, winning the pot after a battle with the demons, is carrying it to devalokawhen the nectar drops at the sites. In another, Garu·a brought the nectar from devalokato release his mother, Vinat§, from Kadrå, the mother of the serpents (n§ga-s). Vinat§ was released but Indra stole the pot, and when fleeing the pursuing serpents spilt drops at the four sites. While the dropping of nectar is not found in the epic-Pur§Öic tradition, Garu·a’s bringing nectar to free his mother from the snakes is well known (MBh I.25ff.; R§m III.35.27; Garu·a Pur§Öa1.240.26–28;Skanda Pur§Öa4.1.55–125).17Evidence occasionally cited in support of an ancient Kumbh Mel§ includes a reference in the V§yu Pur§Öa(2.15.47) to “kumbha” as a holy place suitable for performingár§ddharites. Dubey (1987:120) believes that this reference does not refer to a Kumbh Mel§ but to a tÊrthanamed“rÊ Kumbha on the SarasvatÊ river. Bonazzoli (1977:107) observes that a verse from the Atharva Veda (4.34.7) that states, “I give four pitchers (kumbha), in four (several) places” (caturaÈ kumbh§Òáacaturdh§dad§mi) has been taken out of context by some commentators who believe this verse indicates the antiquity of the Kumbh Mel§. S§yaÖa (fourteenth century) com-mented on this verse, but made no connection with either Pray§g or the Kumbh as a Mel§, even though in his time tÊrtha-y§tr§-s were common.

Every twelve years the Mah§ (‘great’) Kumbh Mel§ takes place at Pray§g. This is when Jupiter is in Aqarius (Kumbha) on both the M§gh (Capricorn)21and Meßa (Aries) saØkr§nti-s.Some Mah§ Kumbh Mel§s are hailed as particularly auspicious, such as the 2001 Pray§g Kumbh, dur-ing which was an astrological alignment that had not occurred for 144 years. Periodically, the $dh§/Ardh (half) Kumbh Mel§ occurs at either Haridv§r or Pray§g, in six-yearly cycles, while every year the M§gh Mel§ is held at Pray§g. The M§gh Mel§ begins at MakarSaØkr§nti (on January 16th) and finishes on “ivar§tri, ‘“iva’s night’, the main festival for “iva, held on the 14th day of the dark half of the month of Ph§lgån (Pisces). The full Pray§g Kumbh Mel§ takes place when Jupiter (BÜhaspati) enters Aries (Meßa; Hindi Cait) and both the Sun and the Moon are in Capricorn (M§gha).22tradition of four Kumbh Mel§ sites was not current in S§yaÖa’s time. For other spurious Vedic references, see Bhattacharya (1977:4).18There is, however, no clear reference to the astrology of the Kumbh Mel§ in any astronomical work (Bhattacharya 1977:2). See Roebuck (1992) for an introduc-tion to Indian astrology.19It has also been claimed that the Kumbh Mel§ is referred to in the VißÖu Pur§Öa,but there is no reference in any printed edition. The astrological prerequisites have also been erroneously attributed to the “ivasaÒhit§ (Bhattacharya 1977:3–4).20VeÖÊr§ma“arma Gau·a,Kumbha parva mah§tmya(KM), K§áÊ: Vy§sa Pustak§laya, SaÒvat 2004 (=1947 CE), pp. 16–17.

The timing of the baths is also determined by how long Jupiter remains in each sign.

Thus, the Haridv§r, Pray§g, Ujjain and N§sik Kumbh Mel§s take place sometimes eleven, twelve or thirteen years after a previous mel§at one or another of the sites.25 The pattern of the dates (CE) of the mel§-s during the twentieth century is irregular (Dubey 1987:127),26 usually following a twelve year cycle, but with eleven and thirteen year intervals, in consort with the cycle of Jupiter. However, the N§sik and Ujjain mel§-s are either in the same year or a year apart.Although it has been suggested that the mythology and astrology linking the four sites of the Kumbh Mel§ seems to be of relatively recent origin, there are a number of references to each site in the Pur§Öa-s. The N§rada Pur§Öa([Part 5] Uttarabh§ga 66.44) states that it is auspicious to bathe [every twelve years] in the GaØg§ at Haridv§rwhen Jupiter is in Aquarius (Kumbha) and the Sun is in Aries.27Hazra25There was a dispute over this in 1956/7 and again in 1968/9 at the SiÒh§ßãaMel§ at Ujjain (“arma 1980:10). On both occasions, the daÖ·Ê-s,“aØkar§c§ryas and others attended, but the mel§ was boycotted by the n§g§ akh§Ü§-s, who attended a mel§ held a year later, claiming that the mel§ should be held strictly every twelve years. There was also a dispute over when one of the Pray§g Kumbh Mel§sshould be held, the SaÒny§sÊ astrologers believing it should be in 1965, while the Vair§gÊs (R§m§nandÊs) believed it should be in 1966 (Lamb 1999:198). The solu-tion and consequence was the enhanced funding by the government of the annual, month-long M§gh Mel§, held at the same site, the two sects of s§dhu-s attending in different years. On both occasions many millions of pilgrims attended. In order to show their gratitude to the goverment for funding both mel§-s, the R§m§nandÊsattended the following year, in 1967, a festival attended by over two million people. The M§gh Mel§ continues to be attended by the R§m§nandÊs and their akh§Ü§-s, but is not attended by the Daáan§mÊ-SaÒny§sÊakh§Ü§-s. 26Haridv§r Pray§g Ujjain N§sik 1915 1906  1945 1932 1927 1918 1957 1944 1938 1929  1968 1956 1950 1941  1980 1968 1962 1954  1992 1980 1974 1965  2004 1992 1986 1977   2003 1998 1989 2001 27It may be noted that the twelve-year cycle of Jupiter also determines the date of several other religious baths in India, the largest besides the four northern mel§-s being the twelve-yearly Mah§maham Mel§ at Kumbhakonam, by the K§verÊriver. This single-day festival is referred to as the Mah§ Mel§ of the south, the last having been held on the full-moon of March 1st 1980 when around two million people attended. It is celebrated when Jupiter is in transit across Leo, and the moon is conjunct with the constellation Maham, when the sun is in Aquarius (Kumbha). clark_BIL25a.indd 2945/30/2006 2:02:29 PM"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"appendix 3295(1940:132) believes that this section of the Pur§Öais “comparatively late” (post-1000). The Khul§ßt-ut-Taw§rikh(34b), a description of India under Aurangzeb, written between 1693 and 1695, informs us that every twelfth year, when Jupiter enters the sign of Aquarius and the Sun is in Aries, a large number of people come from far and wide to bathe at Haridv§r (Rai 1993b:64). The text also mentions ayearlymel§at Allahabad (Pray§g). Although a yearly festival at Haridv§r,28which draws exceptional crowds every twelve years, is historically quite well attested, its origins are obscure. Several of the Pur§Öa-s recommend bathing at the saØgamof the GaØg§ and Yamun§ in the month of M§gha, particularly on am§v§sy§,29 the fifteenth day of the dark half of the month. The Anuá§sanaparvanof the Mah§bh§rata30states that whoever bathes with a restrained mind, observing strict vows, at Pray§g in the month M§gha is cleansed of all sins and attains heaven. Perhaps the earliest unequivocal reference to a congregation of people at Pray§ga during M§gha occurs in the NarasiÒha Pur§Öa (1.1.24), a text dated by Hazra (1958:242) between 400 and 500. Another early historical record of a large gathering of ascetics at any of the sites may be found in the account by Hüang Tsang31 of his travels in India, between 629 and 645. From his account32 and from epigraphic evidence (Devahuti 1983:60, 176–181, 250), we have information of the presence of half a million people, from court officials to beggars, many thousands ofáramaÖa-s, and a whole township of temporary structures at the saØgamnear Pray§ga in 644, a gathering that lasted a month, which Hüang Tsang says is “age-old”. Bathing in the river washes away The mythology surrounding the festival involves nectar oozing from a pot into aliØga of sand made by “iva (see Subramanyan, 1980). 28According to the $-Ên-i-AkbarÊ(3.9), at Haridv§r (M§y§) large numbers of pilgrims assemble on the 10th of the month of Caitra (March/April). (See Abu-l-Fazl 1972.)29ThePray§ga-mah§tmya-áat§dhy§yirecommends bathing there, and describes the benefits thereof. The Matsya Pur§Öais the earliest Pur§Öa containing this M§h§tmya,which appears subsequently in the Padmaand other Pur§Öa-s. Besides the Matsya (106.8; 107.7) and Padma(3.44.1), other Pur§Öa-s also recommend thrice-daily bathing during M§gha at Pray§ga:N§radÊya(2.63), Kårma(1.36.2; 1.38.2), Agni(3.10b–11a), andSkanda (4.1.7.62).

Some ascetics are said to try to attain liberation by climbing a pole erected in the middle of the river, and staring at the sun. There also used to be a tradition of ritual suicide at Pray§ga.33 Since olden times, kings and noble families had come to the place to distribute gifts and goods in charity, hence the name of the area to the east of the river, d§n kßetra.34 Hüang Tsang was in the company of King Harßa Vardhana, the ruler of Kanauj,who was attending the sixth five-yearly assembly of the Buddhist saØgha.Harßa attended every five years, holding council, adorning a statue of the Buddha in a sumptuous way, performing religious rites and distributing alms to priests, men of standing, heretics, widows, orphans, the poor and mendicants. In one day, he is said to have distributed wealth accumulated over five years, much of it replenished subsequently by gifts from visiting nobles. Niccolau Manucci, who was in India from 1656 to 1717, also mentions (1990, Vol. II:76) a quinquennial festival at Allahabad. He observes that those who die from stifling by the crowd are not afforded the usual lamen-tions, as they die in a condition of grace and holiness, effected by thetÊrtha.Manucci also mentions that those who bathe must each pay six and a quarter rupees35 to the Mughal king, who derives a handsome income.It is also reported (De 1986:99) that Caitanya (1485–1533) visited the Pray§ga Mel§ around 1515. Pray§ga (Illah§b§s) is also referred to by Abu-l-Faíl in his $-Ên-l-AkbarÊ(3.9)36 (16th cent.); he observes that suicide is respected here—but regarded as a sin elsewhere—and that although holy throughout the year, Pray§ga is especially so during the month of M§gha. Thevenot, a European traveller, described the congregation at Pray§g in 1666–1667 of “troops” of fakÊr-s—some good men, and some rogues—performing ablutions and various penances, including fasting, continuously standing, holding their arms above their heads and being buried alive (Dubey 1988:67). Mediaeval commentators such as LakßmÊdh§ra (late 11th–12th cent.) 33See Kane (HD“, Vol. 2:925; Vol. 3:939; Vol. 4:603–614). Before it was ordered to be cut down by Akbar, around 1584, jumping from a banyan tree near thesaØgamwas a popular means of suicide (Bonazzoli 1977:144).34The area is still so called, and pilgrims still receive alms there during mel§-s.35A small fortune at the time.36Reference to the Blochmann (1997) translation.clark_BIL25a.indd 2965/30/2006 2:02:30 PM"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"appendix 3297and V§caspatimiára (c. 9th–10th cent.), refer to the efficacy of m§gha-sn§naat Pray§ga, as does TulsÊd§s (1532–1623) in the R§mcaritm§nas(Dey 1998:66).Regarding Ujjain,37 the Skanda Pur§Öa(5.1.1.48.51, 5.1.2.61.39, 5.1.2.82.15–17) recommends bathing there, in the “ipr§, on the full-moon day of Taurus (Vaiá§kha). The “iva Pur§Öa(1.12.22–23) and V§r§ha Pur§Öa(1.71.47–48) extoll the virtues of bathing at N§sik, in the God§varÊ—also referred to as GomatÊ-tÊrtha—when the Sun and Jupiter are in Leo (SiÒha). The Brahm§ Pur§Öa(152.38–39; 175.83–84) refers to this event as the SiÒh§ßãa Mel§. There is a temple at R§mgh§t, on the God§varÊ at N§sik, that is opened every twelfth year, when Jupiter is in Leo. According to Ghurye (1964:178), the earliest mention of the N§sikmel§ occurs in the Guru-carita, a text from the end of the fifteenth century.Although it can also be seen that these Pur§Öic injunctions coincide with the timings of the mel§-s at the respective sites, as previously noted, the linkage between the sites is not evident in the epics or Pur§Öa-s.38 Bonazzoli (1997:117)39 believes that the Kumbh Mel§ (or Kumbh Parv) gets its name from a large gathering that used to take place at Haridv§r every twelve years on the occasion of a particular conjunction of planets, one of which was Kumbha r§ái, and that the traditional bath at Pray§ga for Makar saØkr§nti may have developed into the ‘Pray§ga Kumbha Parva’. The name was applied to the other large festivals, even though no celestial body was in the Kumbha r§ái(‘sign of the zodiac’) at the time of their occurrence.It is apparent that the current Kumbh Mel§ at Pray§g and the other three sites is a continuation of an ancient gathering of ascetics in those places,40 but Maclean’s (2001; 2003) studies of the origins of the Kumbh Mel§ provide substantive evidence that the legend of 37Samanta (1997:17) states that there were three-yearly gatherings of Buddhists at Ujjain during the reign of Aáoka in the third century BCE, but gives no refer-ence for the information.38See also Ali (1983).39See also Bhattacharya (1977:7); Rai (1993b:53–56).40The festival of “ivar§tri, celebrated all over India and Hindu Nepal, is another festival attended by many áaiva s§dhu-s at áaivaholy places, such as P§ápatin§th in Kathmandu. Although there are references to the mythology of the ‘Night of “iva’ in several Pur§Öa-s (dating from the eighth to twelfth century), the origins of the festival are obscure (Long 1982:192). One of the earliest references to the festival in India is from 1141. However, one of the first references to “ivar§triin Nepal dates to 1773 (Michaels 1996:326).clark_BIL25a.indd 2975/30/2006 2:02:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"appendix 3298the four sites and the astrological determinants may have been insti-tuted around the middle of the nineteenth century. From Maclean’s (2003:884–888) inspection of numerous historical documents, includ-ing government archives, tax legislation, Indian and British travel accounts, and newspaper reports, it is evident that before 1868 there is no mention of the word ‘Kumbha’, in any of its variant spell-ings, in connection with the annual mel§at Pray§g, nor is there any indication that every six or twelve years the mel§had a particular significance, either as an ardhor ‘full’ Kumbh Mel§.41The main agents behind the transformation of the site of the M§gh Mel§ into a site for one of the Kumbh Mel§s seem to have been the paÖ·§-s42 of Pray§g, the Pragv§ls (pray§g-v§l§-s) (Maclean 2003:879–884), who claim that their exclusive right to serve pilgrims at the saØgamwas established by Akbar, in a farm§n(‘charter’) dated 1593. Their service to pilgrims for many generations had built up a network of contacts all over India, particular villages being the domain of particular Pragv§ls. They had enjoyed some freedom from intrusion during Nav§bÊ rule, prior to the secession of Allahabad to the British in 1801. The British inherited the right to collect tax from visiting pilgrims—and their vehicles—which was implemented in 1806. The exhorbitant tax (one rupee per pilgrim) levied by the British antagonised the Pragv§ls, as impoverished pilgrims would have less money to give to them (Maclean 2003:881). By 1815 the Pragv§ls threatened to cease officiating, causing concern amongst the British, who recognised the Pragv§ls’ substantial influence over the arrangements for the mel§ and their role in attracting taxable pilgrims.Although the Pilgrim Tax was abolished by 1840 (Maclean 2001:147), leading to increasing attendance, the British continued 41During the early part of the nineteenth century there are references by British observers to the Kumbha Mel§ (with variant spellings) at Haridv§r, which drew exceptional crowds every twelve years, but the M§gh Mel§ at Pray§g is referred to as a yearly event. The first mention that Maclean (2003:884–888) has been able to find in any document of a Kumbh Mel§ at Allahabad is in 1868, by the Magistrate of Allahabad, who reports that a “Coomb fair” will be held in Janu-ary 1870, and that four years previously (in 1866) there had been an “Ad Coomb when the concourse was immense”. Maclean believes that 1870 was the first time themel§at Allahabad was referred to as the Kumbh Mel§.42PaÖ·§-s are Brahman priests who may be found in all major Hindu pilgrimage centres. They keep family records and, for a fee, guide pilgrims through religious rituals, including the ministering of rites for the dead. They are generally regarded as low-caste Brahmans.clark_BIL25a.indd 2985/30/2006 2:02:32 PM"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"appendix 3299to profit from the mel§, taxing traders, barbers and others providing services. This was a source of increasing tension between the British and the Pragv§ls. In June 1857, after the mutiny of the 6th Native Infantry, the Pragv§ls joined the rebellion against the British, which was crushed. After their failed attempt at insurrection, the Pragv§ls exerted every effort to rebuild their business. Due to the general turmoil in India, there was no mel§in 1858, but in 1859 there was a small M§gh Mel§ (Maclean 2001:153). The M§gh Mel§ of 1860 was exceptionally well attended, the flags of the Pragv§ls (used for the the purposes of identification by their clients) bearing anti-British symbols. That same year the Pragv§l Sabh§ was formed and reg-istered with the government. Its aims were to protect and preserve the rights of its members to conduct rituals and accept donations at the saØgam. Although the origins of the legend of the four sites, the twelve-year cycle and the related astrology are obscure, Maclean’s analysis tends to the conclusion that the package of ideas was at the least actively disseminated, or most probably fabricated, around the middle of the nineteeth century, in an environment inhabited by several important groups of actors: anti-British Pragv§ls, with an economic agenda to expand the fame of their tÊrtha; and various mahant-s,saÒny§sÊ-s and pilgrims, some of whom, in the context of the general uprising against the British and general issues of geographical and religious identity, may have been active disseminators of some of the legend currently pertaining to the Kumbh Mel§. The mel§ became a symbol of religious identity, and the legacy of a decision by the British not to interfere with religious affairs. The institution of British rule in India at the end of the eighteenth century had effectively eroded the power and economic activities of the akh§Ü§-s. The only great arenas remaining for displays of the power and religious prestige of saÒny§sÊ-s and akh§Ü§-s, and for the collection of alms and donations, were the Kumbh Mel§s, which remained relatively free from government interference;s§dhu-s were allowed to go naked and display arms. The dissemination of legends highlighting both the antiquity and auspiciousness of the mel§-s could not have but furthered saÒny§sÊ-s’ economic and religious agendas.clark_BIL25a.indd 2995/30/2006 2:02:32 PM"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"appendix 4300APPENDIX 4SUBDIVISIONS WITHIN THE DA“AN$M^AKH$4$-S: MAŒH^-S AND D$V$-S1.In the Maãheávar Dharma Paddhati, an oral tradition has been recorded (Sad§nanda Giri, 1976:19), in which there is a list of 53 maãha-s, which are as follows:1.“ÜØgerÊ. 2. “§rad§. 3.
